Since many summaries and evaluations of the written book have appeared, I will make no comment on the story save to echo the view that this is good Christie but only the beginning of the character she ultimately delineated more appealingly. Souchet's reading is excellent, of course, with adequate voice characterizations of the variety of different speaking roles in the text. Hastings, the narrator for the book, naturally, is the most defined. Souchet creates an appropriately young (he is supposed to be in his early twenties at this time) voice, naive, overconfident, assertive, bewildered, easily bruised, angry, humiliated, awed, puzzled, as he deals with the Old Man who often seems to him to be more of an early senile dementia case than the brilliant detective he had been. He manages this central voice quite well, as he does the men and women who make up the suspects and walk-ons customary in the Christie cast. Surprisingly, perhaps only because I was not reading the book, is what I see as a somewhat too flighty Poirot, not as weighty as in the TV productions (where he retains the Belgian excitability). At any rate, I found the voice less appealing than in the filmed versions.That is a minor point. Overall, there is a vivid portrait of the murder scene and the interactions comprising the plot to its denouement with the surprise solution offered to all the suspects gathered for that purpose in the murder house (but not Inspector Japp, who has strictly an \\"also with\\" role in the book.At the price being charged as of this date, the audio book is a bargain for those addicted to them as am I."},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"The Mysterious Affair at Styles: A Hercule Poirot by Agatha ChristieGreat eBook for Kindle!"},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"She didn't really have it together yet but after all it was her first novel! And as such it's pretty amazing how much Hercule Poirot is him glorious self already. pompous, witty, abrasive, yet kind and chivalrous especially to a \\"woman's secret heart,\\" for he goes to crazy lengths to ake things come out all right for two separate couples by the time STYLES is over.I just finished Gilbert Adair's abstruse takeoff on Agatha Christie, MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR OF STYLE, so I decided to go back to the real, original thing, see what I hadn't seen in years. I was surprised to find that, in the twenty years since I had read the book, very little of it had remained in my memory--outside of the central trick. In a way, the book is spoiled by an ugly racial remark thatv just seems to slip out of the lips of the one character in the book everyone loves, the faithful white servant \\"Dorcas.\\" It's not that Christie wants to characterize Dorcas as a prejudiced sort, but just take a look at page 137 and you'll get the shivers. It's rather odd in Christie, for often enough she lets her characters' racialized remarks tell against them, but here it's just the opposite and you can tell that Dorcas is supposed to be more cute after making it.What's hard to figure out is why, in CURTAIN, Christie decided to return to the scene of her first novel, for it doesn't really have as much weight as some of the country houses she describes elsewhere. Oh well, it must have been a sentimental mise en scene for her, the site of the meeting of Hastings and Poirot; the place where her first novel located itself, etc. CURTAIN is a book very few of us have ever been able to plumb to its depths--and I thought a reread of STYLES might help. No, but it's great fun all on its own, and the plot is so crazily complicated that it takes the final fifty pages to work out all the kinks and false solutions of the story, before Poirot finally shows what his \\"last link\\" has led him to.One more thing that was strange, how there are only 12 chapters in the book, of very uneven lengths--some a few pages only, some upwards of 30. I don't remember Christie ever returning to this noticeably choppy way of telling a story?"},{"Title":"Mysterious affair at styles","review":"The Mysterious Affair at Styles was the first novel to introduce the great Hercule Poirot to the world. It also introduced Arthur Hastings, who appears in a number of other Poirot novels. The story begins with Hastings arriving at Styles Court to visit an old friend and his family. While he is at the estate, the Mistress of the house is killed. By a lucky coincidence, Poirot is in the nearby village and free to investigate the matter. The cast of suspects is largely drawn from the woman's family. Poirot interviews them all in his unique style and his little grey cells are put to the test as he attempts to untangle the mystery as many twists and turns ensue.Because this is the first Poirot novel, you might expect that it would be lacking compared to the later efforts. It is often the case that characters become better developed in later stories, for example. In this case, you will find a very typical Poirot novel, with no real evidence that Christie hadn't yet found his voice. His little witticisms and eccentricities are present, the upper class suspects, the relatively remote \\"bottle\\" location for the murder... all of these are typical elements in a Hercule Poirot novel and all are well executed. Once the story gets going, it moves along very well and the mystery certainly held my attention to the very end. The suspects were all pretty interesting and Poirot himself is pure gold. The only sour note for me was Hastings who is a bit too dense for my taste as well as being too pure of a Dr. Watson clone.Overall, The Mysterious Affair at Styles is well worth reading. If it isn't the best Poirot story, it is still far from the worst. While I might recommend a first time Christie reader to look elsewhere (Death on the Nile: A Hercule Poirot Mystery (Hercule Poirot Mysteries), orEvil Under the Sun: A Hercule Poirot Mystery), this is definitely worth trying for those who have read several Poirot novels and are looking for their latest fix of the little Belgian."},{"Title":"After the Wreck, I Picked Myself Up, Spread My Wings, and Flew Away","review":"Joyce Carol Oates's new book for teens has a long title and it really does sort of give away the ending.

Her father, who abandoned the family years earlier for a new wife and family, is of no help and Jenna's bitterness towards him fuels the flame of her anger and despair.In her loneliness, Jenna finds acceptance from \`Trina, a bulimic teen who befriends Jenna, but also uses her. A dramatic scene at a party gone bad shows Jenna the direction in which she is heading. Although the reader only sees him briefly, Jenna's one true friend is a young man nicknamed \\"Crow\\" who speaks words of truth that resonate in Jenna's heart. His own traumatic experiences (including his brother's death, living with a father who is an injured Vietnam vet, and his own accidents) enable him to come alongside of her and provides the exact help that she needs--a firm hand that pulls her out of her fears and self-incrimination and pushes her to move on with her life.Oates use of symbolism is powerful. When you read this book, be aware of how birds and bridges are important in the story. I would recommend this to older teens (there are some sexual references in the book, although nothing explicit) and adults. Parents who are struggling to understand their own teen or the effects of peer pressure might better appreciate the iceberg underneath the surface of a teen's \\"whatever\\" faade after reading this book."},{"Title":"After the Wreck, I Picked Myself Up, Spread My Wings, and Flew Away","review":"Jenna Abbott was just a normal girl living a normal life, until the wreck happened. Nothing was the same after the wreck as before it--Jenna's friends, her home, even her own self. She has been irrevocably changed, whether she likes it, or wants to admit it, or not. She's really only a shell of the girl she once was, clinging desperately to distant memories of happiness even though she's on the verge of completely losing it. She can't trust anyone, can't let herself trust anyone, even her own family. And then Jenna meets Crow, who's got secrets of his own. Jenna finds that she can open herself up to him, but will this put her on the path of redemption and self forgiveness, or will she continues down the ugly road of self-destruction? In this emotional and moving story, Oates explores the trail of damage that death causes and the fragile strength required to rise about it.Most of this story can be summed up with its lengthy title, After the Wreck, I Picked Myself Up, Spread My Wings, and Flew Away, because that is, in essence, what Jenna struggles with doing and eventually accomplishes. I really appreciated Oates' sometimes simplistic writing style because it so effectively conveyed Jenna's thoughts, emotions, and delusions. It's from this style of writing that I was able to truly grasp how damaged Jenna was by the wreck, and it caused my heart to go out to her. There is something so fragile and delicate about Jenna's character that makes the reader want to protect and take care of her, but at the same time, Jenna's nature does not permit this type of babysitting. I loved how complex Jenna was and how she struggled to distinguish between dream and reality, because I feel this is an issue many of us also struggle with, although not necessarily on so desperate a scale as Jenna. After the Wreck, I Picked Myself Up, Spread My Wings, and Flew Away is an emotional journey and moving tale about death, forgiveness, and everlasting friendship.This novel is one of those that you want to take your time reading to fully understand. It ranks up with other novels on the same topic such as Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher, Freeze Frame by Heidi Ayarbe, and Saving Zo by Alyson Nol."},{"Title":"After the Wreck, I Picked Myself Up, Spread My Wings, and Flew Away","review":"Joyce Carol Oates's new book for teens has a long title and it really does sort of give away the ending.

As far as she's concerned, she should've died, too. The horrific injuries upon waking are only the beginning. For a while, she can escape everything by going \\"into the blue.\\" Soon enough, she faces reality: her mom is gone; her estranged father wants her to join his \\"new\\" family in La Jolla--clear on the other coast; her family has to sell the house that belonged to Jenna and her mom; and Jenna will have to transfer to a new school--scars and all.Jenna defines her life as \\"before the wreck\\" and \\"after the wreck.\\" Before the wreck, she had friends, was on the track team, and was a fairly normal teenager. After the wreck, pain, loneliness, leave her alone, did she see something on that bridge, did she grab her mother's steering wheel, she doesn't want new friends, she finds a friend, her new friend has a crapload of her own issues, and then there's Crow...The writing reflects Jenna's state of mind throughout her ordeal. Immediately after the wreck, her thoughts are confused and fragmented due to her head injury and pain medications. Her mind clears, but nothing else seems to, despite time's insistence on pressing forward.Oates masterfully steers the reader along Jenna's ride from shattered mind and body to beyond. The novel is as hopeful as it is solemn. I highly recommend this book for teens who have been through tragedy. I especially recommend this book for anyone who is close to a teen who has been traumatized. It will offer meaningful insight into things that sometimes can't be spoken aloud.Reviewed by Christina Wantz Fixemer9/5/2006"},{"Title":"After the Wreck, I Picked Myself Up, Spread My Wings, and Flew Away","review":"Have you ever been in a horrific car accident that has changed your life forever?Jenna was living a normal life as a normal teenager. Then she got into a car accident. Her mom dies and she is seriously hurt and is sent to rehab. Then she is sent to live with her aunt and her aunt's family, and has to go to a different school. She is determined not to get close to anyone ever again because she thinks that anyone one who you get close to either leaves you, like her dad, or is taken from you, like her mom. That is when Jenna meets Crow. He becomes her friend and helps her get through the rough times.This was definitely not a great book. It was okay. The one good thing was that it was like talking directly to the main character, Jenna. It was made in diary form, and it seemed like it was actually written by a teenager named Jenna instead of an adult, even though Jenna seemed pretty boring.I gave this book two stars because it was a boring and slightly annoying book. It would have been better if there were longer chapters. On average they were only two and a half pages long. There were also many fragments in the book that were annoying. It would say things like, \\"Or not. Kick the remote off my bed,\\" and she would be talking about something she did, not something that she was telling someone to do. It had many other fragments and they would make the book hard to understand sometimes.I would recommend this book to teenage girls who want to bore themselves and nothing else to do."},{"Title":"The Boss's Boss","review":"I know that sexual fantasies can and are full of stereotypes and one or two in a novel or a short story can be great. But this novel, which was a best seller in Europe when it came out in German in 1987, has almost nothing but stereotypes. There's the boss controlled by the female underling who really seems incapable of true affection. They both seem to have a mental illness or at least emotional problems. She's cold and wears lots of leather and boots; so are all her female friends, even the lesbians who are still attracted to the main male character. And finally, and most disappointing, there's the death or faked death of one of the characters.

The chemistry between the two of them is amazing and I love the repartee. I like how the story is set in Scotland and how the lovers are from warring clans. The minor characters are interesting and don't distract but add to the story (a rarity). It is not the most original but its the best of this typical storyline. (clarification: there are a lot of major themes and typical storylines in romance novels; like girl pretends to be boy, girl is forced into marriage, girl is kidnapped by pirate..ect).

That book is fabulous."},{"Title":"Tempted (Book Club Edition)","review":"The previous reviewer has done a wonderful job of expressing just how great and timelessly enduring this book is. I bought my first Henley in the early 90s and have loved her books ever since. This one is my Henley favorite.I am a true history buff and I love this book not only for the quality of the writing and the depth and complexity of the characters but for how much Ms Henley brought the period and the Douglasses to life. They were truly that powerful and that feared in Scottish history. They were called the \\"Black\\" Douglasses and used by parents to scare little kiddies into behaving because their projenitors were \\"Moors\\" and they were truly \\"Black\\" for the first couple of hundred years (in the Middle Ages) before intermingling. (Check out David MacRitchie's Ancient and Modern Britons if you want more info - but it's textbookish - not for the fainthearted.) I had always been a little bit in love with the legend of the Black Douglasses and Ms. Henley's portrayal of these historical characters was perfect. Add to that her imagery of the English and Scottish courts and their lifestyles, the battle of Flodden, the Scottish/English border disputes and raids, etc.... she truly captured this period and in so doing captured me with this book.The setting and historical period aside..the characters in this book are intriguing. Black Ram Douglass is the ultimate Aries MAN and Tina the Ultimate Woman. They are so wonderfully drawn and so fully developed that even Ramsay's distinctive tone of voice comes across. Their relationship is followed from their first meeting as clan enemies to their forced handfasting by the Scottish King. The relationship truly develops on paper and the reader can see how these two characters evolve, grow, change, and mature. The forceful, aggressive character that is Black Ram is matched by Tina's stubborn, eccentric Aquarius character. It makes sense. Tina is not the type of woman that could be married to just any man. She is a force to be reckoned with - not because she's foolishly hardheaded like so many romance heroines - but because she has a strong, courageous, forceful character that is all her own. She's outrageous in a way that only a truly beautiful woman who knows that men will forgive her anything is outrageous. That kind of woman in that time period needed a man much stronger than herself - and strong enough to keep other men away from her!There is so much more that could be said about this book. It is a classic. The subplots and supporting characters are wonderfully intricate. But I will stop here. I think you get the idea.This book is an excellent read for those who like more meat and depth to their historical romance. It is written in such a way that the history comes to life in a wonderfully sensual love story."},{"Title":"Tempted (Book Club Edition)","review":"I just can't put down the book.

I loved it. Henley has the ability to capture not only the time period, but also the culture of the borderlands between Scotland and England and the difficult but wonderful relationship between two stubborn, courageous people. I highly recommend this one.Set in Scotland in 1512, TEMPTED is the story of clans Douglas, Hamilton and Kennedy. Beautiful Valentina Kennedy, the oldest of the Kennedy daughters, was known as Flaming Tina for her glorious red-gold hair and her feisty temper. She was raised with her sister and brothers in Castle Doon in Ayr on the Southwest coast of Scotland where her father ruled as the Lord of Galloway. Tina despaired the lot of women that prevented them from enjoying male pursuits, and she frequently joined her brothers in their activities. But when she turns 17, her father insists she say yes to one of her many suitors. Tina thinks to marry the Hamilton heir but is happy when the Gypsy tells her there will be no wedding for her this year. In a surprising turn of events, she is hand fasted to her enemy, the powerful Black Ram Douglas, who she considers to be a brute of a man. Tina intends to have her revenge...Henley develops some wonderful characters, including the ghosts of two star-crossed lovers from the past (another Kennedy and Douglas pairing), who constantly entertain. She paints vivid word pictures of the food, clothing and castles that really drawn you in and help you experience the times--and she does it very well. In a fitting climax to the story, she superbly describes the battle between the English and Scots at Flodden where Scotland went down in terrible defeat.This is going on my Best Scottish/Highlander Historical Romances list! The second in the 2-book Clan Kennedy Saga is THE BORDER HOSTAGE."},{"Title":"Tempted (Book Club Edition)","review":"This book was really good.

Alike, Firebrand & Hotspur.And when Ram realized what he had done the first time they made love, he honestly felt bad and tried to make up for it.CONS:I didnt like the fact that everytime they were okay, something else went wrong.

I thought this book was going to be a wonderful romance. It wasn't, the sex over shadowed the romance! It's frustrating when you're looking forwarded to reading a Historical Romance and it turns out to be a rough sex book with offensive, coarse, language throughout.The scene where the Hero can't stay away from the Heroine any longer (and had to have her) did however, make sense to me because she gave him the impression that she was experienced and she wanted it. When he realized she had been a virgin, it was touching that he tried to soothe her other than that, we didn't need the graphic details of his earlier escapades with other women.

I especially do not want to read about brutal sex scenes between the hero and heroine. The sex scenes were not hot or erotic to me they were just crude and nasty. When did Ram and Tina have time to fall in love? Was it during his never ending insults and harsh treatment of Tina or was it during her ploting against him? I didn't not like Ram or Tina they were not in any way shape or form endearing or likable chacters. I didn't care about what happended to them. If they both fell off a cliff I would say good riddence! The story was poorly written. It reminded me of a story that couldn't make it on the big screen and went straight to video. Also when I read romance I don't want to read about the hero having rough sex with the heroine because he thought she was loose and was mad that she didn't get hot for him because after all he was a wh*%emaster or some such garbage. There was nothing hot or erotic or romantic about this story. This is the first book that I felt the urge to toss in the trash."},{"Title":"Tempted (Book Club Edition)","review":"This is a great alternative for romance fans who have become bored with the traditional, time-honored formula of the genre. While it's possible to get a chuckle or two out of most romance novels, this book is packed full of laughs. The situations are so outrageous, the characters are so over-the-top, that reading it is a wicked, guilty pleasure.The heroine, Tina Kennedy, is well aware of her effect on men, as well as their effect on her. The hero, Ramsay Douglas (cleverly nicknamed Ram), is an uncouth Highland clan leader who expects to get what he wants. Both characters are powerfully attractive, and powerfully attracted to each other.I appreciate Henley's frank, blantant approach to romance. A rough, brutish warrior would never refer to his body parts with euphamisms, nor would he refer to every sexual encounter as love-making. A well-born, innocent lass would of course be appauled by such language at first, but later might be inclined to use it herself should the situation warrant it. Henley's strength is in knowing exactly when her characters should use the softer, more mysterious language, and when they should just call it like it is.The story is a familiar one of Scottish clan feuding, but it is given the breath of life by two supporting characters who happen to be dead. The marvelously inventive and romantic subplot between two ghosts is what elevates the storyline above those of much of the genre.What I love about most of Henley's work is that she sets her characters loose to run rampant. She seems aware that this genre can take itself too seriously, and she seems willing to embrace the absurd. That makes her books, particularly this one, a joy to read."},{"Title":"Tempted (Book Club Edition)","review":"I truly loves books that are written like this!!! If you take the sex scenes out, the book would still be wonderful. Let's face it though, Virginia really knows how to write those steamy sex scenes. There are not too many books that are similar in design to this one! Valentina and Ram are hot! Flaming Tina learns very quickly how to use sex to her advantage! Wish that we were all the brave! Tempted also slid in a brief history lesson in the process! It may not ALL be completely accurate, but the reader gets the idea of the behavior and events of that time. I love steamy books such as this and I know if I could make a list of all the steamy, erotic historical romance fictions authors -- Virginia would be at the top of the list! Rebellion, Intrigue, Battles, Warriors, Sexual Pleasures...REAL MEN and REAL WOMEN. A MUST READ!"},{"Title":"Tempted (Book Club Edition)","review":"At first I really didn't want to read it because I had made the mistake of opening the book and reading from the middle right where Douglas and Tina are fighting big time. So I figured that I it was a total waste of time. But then one day when I really didn't have anything else to do I picked up the book and it is needless to say I didn't put it down until I finished reading it. This book is one of those in which you just can't stop reading! Tina is hell bent on vengance against The Douglas but what she doesn't know is that she will fall into her own game of seduction. The Douglas is so blind that he only sees what he wants to see until he falls in love and finds that love is the total opposite of what he expected. I loved the way Henley mixed the supernatural characters with the real characters. You will find everything you want in this book. Murder mysteries, betrayal, passion, love, GREAT LOVE SCENES, it is full of surprises. It is beautifully written and wonderful to read. I highly recomend it."},{"Title":"Tempted (Book Club Edition)","review":"THE HENLEY PRIMERI have reason to believe that you will either worship this book or strongly dislike it (with Virginia Henley's classics, indifference is not an option). To determine into which camp you will fall, you'll need to learn if VH is a writer whose style and recurrent themes will compel or repel you. Thus, a Henley primer:>>>You may dislike Henley if:--you favor subtle, subdued writing styles in a romance--you favor quiet, thoughtful, and emotionally reticent lead characters (If this is the case, the only Henley heroine you will love is Jane in A Year and a Day, and the only hero you will love is John in The Decadent Duke.)--you dislike Alpha and Gamma heroes who are \\"too much\\" Alpha and \\"too much\\" Gamma, who have taken the state of being a blazing Aries charger or a dangerous, dark Scorpio and turned them into art forms.-- you prefer heroines to be on the \\"average\\" and \\"normal\\" side of physical appearance, skills and talents--you prefer slow-burning relationship development, or romances where the hero and heroine have a lightly flirtatious courtship-- you dislike large age differences between a teenaged or young heroine and a thirty-something hero-- you dislike historical romances that are Historical with a capital \\"H.\\" (you dislike romances where the history is an integral part of the action and where kings and queens, dynasties, war and plague are all detailed within an inch of their lives.)-- you prefer subtle sensuality and dislike erotically-charged, plentiful sex described in graphic detail--you cannot tolerate reading descriptions of the hero's sexual escapades before getting together with the heroine-- you demand innovation in romance plots; you are constantly looking for a plot or character types that have never been done beforeIf you fall into this first camp, Godspeed to you, and enjoy the many romances out there that will not send your blood pressure sky high, as Henley's likely will.>>>You will thank your lucky stars for Henley if:--you crave high-octane traumas and dramas, with dramatic roller-coaster-high loves and swooping-low, full throttle hate between the hero and heroine-- you adore saucy, devilish, clever, physically courageous, naturally imperious, persevering, \\"I will survive\\" heroines with rapier wit, a towering temper, and a righteous sense of justice that they WILL see served...or serve themselves.--you adore...well, authoritarian, clever, physically courageous, naturally imperious heroes, as well!-- you rejoice in seeing said heroine truly meet her match--but never be bested--in a powerful male version of herself (here, like attracts like!)-- you delight in the outrageous antics of said heroine and her Alpha-lion or Gamma-panther counterpart-you love \\"down and dirty\\" historicals that showcase the stuff left out of your history textbook (homosexual gentry; child rapist kings; a non-virgin Virgin Queen; the misery of prisons and asylums; the horrors of plague and war)-- you can tolerate the hero's high-handed behavior and sexist actions because the heroine doesn't let him get away with it and because both sides end up equalized--\\"Over the top,\\" \\"high drama,\\" and \\"outrageous\\" are all positive, not negative, descriptors for you--------------------------------------------------------------------------Reader, I fall into the latter camp. Joyously.Let me take you into the world that Henley has created in TEMPTED, a volatile, epic-scale romance novel that I guarantee, if you fall into the second Henley Primer camp, will knock your socks off.PLOT. Vibrant Lady Valentina Kennedy sacrifices herself for her family's political alliance with their longtime enemies, the dread clan of Douglas. She becomes handfasted to the dangerous laird known as Black Ram Douglas, on whom she has secretly vowed vengeance for his capture of her young brother. Their love story unfolds against the epic drama of 16th century Scotland/Tudor England, including the devastating battle at Flodden.HEROINE and HERO. What dynamite protagonists these two are. They are second-to-none in historical romance: fully realized and so vividly drawn, they will remain in your head for years to come.Valentina is a surprisingly complex character. Because she was raised in a household of men, she is both instinctively adept at sexual byplay and flirtation, and can hold her own fighting, raiding and playing along with her brothers. In the patriarchal culture of highland Scotland, she has earned a (false) reputation for being a sexual temptress. This piques the powerful Black Ram, a hero who is super-Alpha, yes, but whom Henley also masterfully characterizes as, deep down, a funny and basically lonely man, searching for his equal.Henley is an absolute wizard at getting readers to empathize with a powerful female lead. This is no small feat in a society that even today demonizes take-no-prisoners women who go after what they want. From the very first pages, we are drawn into the character of Tina, for whom our heart aches when we see the way she is disfavored by her mother and forced to sacrifice herself for the good of her clan. Courageous, loyal and fighting on the side of justice, Tina's a superhero with a vulnerable streak.RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPMENT. Grab your safety goggles; sparks are about to fly. Yes, the \\"hate at first sight\\" storyline in romances is as old as Pride and Prejudice, but boy, can Henley light the page on fire with it. Tina has sworn vengeance on Ram, and the lady means it, so get the heck out of her way! The most wonderful thing about their \\"courtship\\" is that we, the reader, can recognize these two are essentially the separated-at-birth twins of each other, but they at first don't see it; what fun watching them come to realize this, and, later, articulating it. Towards the end of the book, when evil abounds in the castle and the political situation devolves into war, Tina and Ram are placed in situations that will bring a lump to your throat over the poignancy and tenderness of their newly found love and that which threatens it.STYLE. Henley is a storyteller who, at her best (Tempted), can spin a web around even the reader who swore they were going to stay up reading Chekhov tonight. She is blunt-talking, bawdy, and manages to create richly detailed historical tapestries that don't bog down the romantic narrative. Yes, the love scenes lay it on thick, and the villains are always Pure Evil and the heroines are generally brimming with umbrage and fire, but you know what? It works. It gets your blood up. It sweeps you up and squeezes you close and makes you forget all the mundane stuff you left unfinished on the kitchen table. How many books--not just romances--do that for you?SEXUAL SCENES. Plenty of them, and hot, hot, hot without being erotica. Anyone who finds Henley to be erotica has obviously not read that genre. Her stuff is graphic, but always relationship-based.PROFANITY. Plenty of it, but well-used to develop character.CHEATING. None. Ram has mistresses before Tina, but never after. She never strays. (His mistress does pop up now and again to cause trouble, though).THE EVIL MAN. (!!!!Spoilers!!!!) In many historicals and in almost all of Henley's, there's an evil man who lusts after the heroine, gets his paws on her, and, in some books, rapes her. The evil man in Tempted is a very famous historical personage but he does NOT get a chance to actually rape the heroine.SEXUAL VIOLENCE (!!!!Spoilers!!!!!)There is a scene in this book in which the hero forces sex onto a heroine who deep down does not want sex but who bravely resigns herself to it because she knows it is her \\"duty.\\" I think this sort of resignation for political reasons borders on lack of genuine consent, and lack of consent=rape. But, in both books, I was able to get past the assault and even grow to approve of the hero because:(1) the circumstances demanded a sexual consummation: Ram has to consummate the handfasting in order to fulfill the terms of the political alliance between the clans. He expects her to acquiesce because the very purpose of the handfasting was to create a consummated clan bond and produce a child of that alliance. (Normally this would make him a victim, too, however, he still wants to have sex with Tina for his own pleasure purposes.) In this sense, the initial \\"rape\\" is in fact the handfasting of Tina by the patriarchal clan elders.(2) Crucially, and the thing that made me able to accept this where I could not accept the rapes of the 1970's and 80's romances, is that the hero admits very clearly that he raped the heroine and that he was wrong to do so. He thinks the actual word \\"rape.\\" He then spends quite a bit of time allowing the heroine to heal and showing his regret over hurting her. I've come to consider this to be a fairly subversive treatment of rape in books aimed toward heterosexual readers. There is still a strong belief amongst some that, if the man tries to arouse the woman and they are married and the woman is otherwise attracted to him, forced sex is not rape. Well, Henley blows that argument right out of the water. Her hero realizes that he has done rape (even if he was compelled to for political reasons and even if Tina had resigned herself to it) and clearly articulates that it is unacceptable. I can appreciate that. And I think it will cause readers to in the future more clearly see sexual assault for what it is.NEGATIVES: the afore-mentioned assault, a rather insignificant subplot about a creepy member of the Douglas clan; fairly one-dimensional villains; stereotypes about Gypsies (and for that matter, Scots and redheads!).TWO WORDS:Tina: Courage and FireRam: Action and IntegrityVERDICT: The cream of Henley's considerable crop, Tempted has everything and more for lovers of high drama and history. This book, unlike many romances, will convince you over and over again of this couple's once-in-a-lifetime bond. Their larger-than-life personalities leap off the pages and draw you into their world. Is the book flawed? Undoubtedly. But at the last page, you exhale, you wipe your brow, you think: \\"Now, THAT'S a romance!\\""},{"Title":"Tempted (Book Club Edition)","review":"I am a HUGE Virginia Henley fan, and it all started with this book. The story was well written with numerous plots and subplots that helped to accentuate the developing love between the unbeknownst heroine and hero. There is a lot of strong language and intensely erotic love scenes, but it is acceptable when entwined with the setting at hand. Henley was very adept in adding a subtle role reversal between Tina and Ram.Black Ram Douglas is the quintessential ALL MAN hero. He has the usual hero traits of intelligence, strength, ambition and unmatched sexual appeal(captured brilliantly by the model used in the picture), but Henley delves further by adding more layers to this larger than life character. His hard sometimes vulgar machismo personality was tempered by his love of children, respect for family and land, charm and humor as well as being an undercover romantic. Ram's gentleness towards Tina, and concern for her every comfort and well being are a delightful transition from his rugged high-handedness. We are allowed to see Tina fall in love with Ram and understand WHY she loves him, from antagonistic hatred to the revelation of a man so suited to her, the word soulmate seems lacking and inadequate.Valentina was no innocent. She had the normal heroine trait of being intelligently chaste with heartstopping beauty that left men breathless and women envious. Tina was more than that. From the beginning she was shown as a brave hoyden with a loyalty to surpass most men. She was clever with a shockingly humorous charisma that was engagingly seductive. A true tomboy, Flaming Tina was fearless in all things, with an intense devotion to those she loved as well as any endeavor she approached.The descriptiveness of the violence and war, was a perfect accompaniment to the intrigue of court and familial entanglements. This novel has it all. After fifteen years of owning this book, I can honestly say I read it at least once a year. With mediocre writers publishing disappointingly lackluster novels, the tried and true always lures me back for the desired enjoyment of a brilliant romantic read."},{"Title":"Tempted (Book Club Edition)","review":"&quot;TEMPTED&quot; will whisk you away to Scotland where you will experience the tempestuous love/hate relationship of Ramsey and Valentina. Ram is bold, sexy, and challenging, while Tina is intelligent, strong-willed, and beautiful. In this rollercoaster adventure you will definitely remain caught up in their ups and downs, and you will be exposed to Scottish history, as well. The supporting characters are well thought out and complement both Ram and Tina. The lovemaking scenes were just enough to whet my appetite, but I found that I wanted more of the detail that I've found in a Susan Johnson (&quot;BRAZEN&quot;) or Linda Howard (&quot;AFTER THE NIGHT&quot;).

Ram is all man and is quite likeable as well. There of course is the stubborn interaction between both of these characters that seem to be a Henley trait, but is stops short of making the charcters unlikeable.

One discovery led to another and another -- and today those discoveries provide a background for better understanding both how the Buddha's teachings were lost and how they were rediscovered.I picked up this book in India. Here I was surprised to find no reviews for this scholarly, unique work of history. As I began to outline this review, I was told there was an American edition entitled \\"The Search for the Buddha: The Men Who Discovered India's Lost Religion.\\"To avoid being redundant, I encourage interested readers to go to that website and read the reviews.

I also found the book to be well illustrated with portraits of the main protagonists and their drawings and paintings of the artifacts and sites. The style of writing is very British (for lack of a better expression) - meaning it can be a bit dry at time but this will not put you off if you are fascinated by the archeology of Buddhism.

Unfortunately, it is full of misinformation, starting with the mangled transliteration of the names of the famous Chinese pilgrims to India, Faxian and Xuanzang (given here as Fa Hian and Huan Tsang), a mistaken etymology of the word Pagoda (not from Sanskrit as he states, but Tamil via Portuguese),and many other factual errors (for example, the Russians really had been seeking influence in Tibet in the early 20th century, contrary to Allen's view). The author presents a totally distorted account of Catholic missionary activity in South Asia, portraying the missionaries as ignorant bigots and not even mentioning outstanding figures like the Jesuit Roberto de Nobili, who in the early seventeenth century mastered both Tamil and Sanskrit and was well aware of the difference between Buddhism and Hinduism, or a later Italian Jesuit, Ippolito Desideri,who acquired a profound knowledge of Tibetan Buddhism in the early eighteenth century, before the British Raj came into existence. None of this information is obscure; it is easily accessible through Wiki and elsewhere on the net, but apparently Allen did not want to let historical reality get in the way of a good story.

It is not a book on church history. You will look in vain for any material on (for example) the narrative of the seven ecumenical councils, the Crusades, or Calvin's life. Among different doctrines, it focuses on those that are important to Reformed Orthodoxy of the seventeen century. For example, while there are 140 pages on the Arminian controversy, 13 pages cover the whole discussion on medieval scholastic theology. Cunningham studies in detail the doctrine of church government, the person and work of Christ, and most of the doctrine of grace (the Five Points, doctrine of justification etc.)This work is the lecture notes of a 19th century theologian. Therefore, there is no bibliography at all. Its purpose is not to retell the development of doctrine from a neutral perspective. It is an apologia for orthodox Reformed theology based on a history of doctrinal controversies. Cunningham asseses theology not from a contextual, historical perspective. It does not matter to Cunningham what century a particular theologian is speaking from. All that matter is whether the theologian expounds scriptural teaching correctly.Owing to its uneven coverage and its methodology, Cunningham is misleading as a textbook of historical theology. However, as a defense of Reformed orthodoxy, it is hard to fine a better work than Cunningham."},{"Title":"Carving Totem Poles & Masks","review":"Very detailed diagrams and helpful pictures.

It's missing some of the details necessary to pass. I missed passing by 20 points, according to Prometric, and I know exactly which questions I biffed on---RIS. Chapter #2 does an okay job explaining RIS from a conceptual point of view, but falls short on some of the details.My advice, this book is okay, but don't make it the end-all be-all for your 70-210 certification."},{"Title":"MCSE Windows 2000 Professional Exam Prep (Exam: 70-210)","review":"With the coming of any operating system there is bound to be questions for how it works, Also Microsoft has retired the MCSE NT$ track and replaced it with the MCSE 2000 track.

This is definitely worth reading and I would have bought the book from this series for the 70-215 exam if it had been written by the same authors.

It was sold out in a few stores, and some others hadn't heard of it yet either. It just came out, and I was told that it's hard to get. But several of my friends bought it here. we all agree. if you have kids you need to read this.

When I picked up my new April edition of Readers Digest from the post office today and saw her featured in a whole article about her work online in keeping everyone safe from stalkers, I had to get it today. I bought three. One for my daughter, one for my daughter-in-law and one for me.(Apparently other reviewers bought multiples too...must be the price. It's a bargain, I expected to pay far more.)I even found things in there that applied to my safety online.

Parry explained why it is dangerous to do this. I spoke to our principal and library media specialist. Our library media specialist&quot;~ had met Parry at the librarians annual meeting where she was a speaker and had spoken with her. Apparently she's the top person in her field. She even works with the FBI and other police departments around the world. She's the only one I'd trust to keep my kids safe online.&quot;~ I hope I can get her to come and speak at our school.

It is important for parents to monitor their child's access to the World Wide Web and teach them proper use of it. This is not a television set with a limited number of channels. It is the information superhighway to the whole world. Think of it the same as traffic safety. You don't leave a young child playing unsupervised by a busy roadway. They could be hit by a car or kidnapped or attacked by a neighbor's dog. An older child after being taught basic principles is allowed more independence in that same situation.Provide clear guidelines. Let your children know there are subjects or areas that you prefer to be off limits and explain why. Explore cyberspace with the child and talk about what they are seeing and doing.Teach children safety rules for dealing with strangers online such as never giving out their full name, address or telephone number; never giving out a credit card number; or arranging to meet someone online without your permission. These are the same guidelines you probably use for telephone use in your home or for talking to strangers on the street.Don't miss out on all the wonders of the World Wide Web.

When I talked to my kids about not sharing this information with stragners online, they told me that they don't give it away until they get to know the person really well. I was shocked at how much information they had given out online, what was on their profile (that I didn't even know existed until I read this book) and even what their teachers were letting them put on the school websites about themselves, including pictures and e-mail links. If you're still not sure whether your kids are worth spending $10 on this book, ask them what they do online, who they talk to and look at their profile. Then, you better hope they still have any in stock. Our kids need this book! You need this book!"},{"Title":"The Parent's Guide to Protecting Your Children in Cyberspace","review":"&quot;~I thought I could trust my kids online.

I didn't know how things worked and what dangers are serious and which are just paranoia. After I finished this book (which only took a few hours this weekend) I knew how to talk to my son about the Internet and how to get my daughter online when she's ready. I finally understand about filtering software, and using her recommendations bought one today. My friend liked her safe site lists best, and decided not to use filtering software for her daughter. But we both understood how to make that choice. I wish we had more books like this. This woman really is an angel.

This book will give you all you need to arm your chldren and yourself against the predators who trick children online.

I have been online for over 6 years and I am a very experienced user yet I read it cover to cover and learned more than I ever could have imagined.

He's fine now, chiefly because of this author, who is the top internet safety expert in the world.He was being threatened and stalked by someone who knew where he lived and went to school. I found a site where people help parents when things go wrong online. The head of this site is a cyberlawyer who also wrote this book. I had read about her in Readers Digest and saw her on the Today show, and knew that she worked with the FBI on finding child molesters in cyberspace, and saw that 20/20 recommended her site, cyberangels.org, for help in cyberstalkings.I wrote her in a panic. She answered my e-mail right away, personally, and helped us, personally. I'll never forget her or how she made us feel. Like we were the most important people on earth and she had nothing else to do but help us.I bought her first book last year and this book as soon as I heard about it on television last month. I bought one for my sister and for my two brothers too. I don't think any parent should have to go through what we did, and I don't know what I would have done without help from this incredible woman. Her book is the best! and my son now knows not to give away personal information to strangers online. And I know how to teach him to use the Internet safely. She reminds us constantly, that even if they know more than we do about the technology, we are still the parents. Hurray for people like this. Parry is a real angel, not just a cyberangel.

It was hard to get, apparently it's sold out in a lot of places offline already, but I bought it online. It was like reading a Family PC Book, easy to udnerstand, everything was relevant to what I wanted to know. This woman isn't a censorship fanatic, she tells us things I hadn't heard elsewhere about how pedophiles operate online and what our kids really do online. I also learned about filtering software, what works and what doesn't and found some great sites for my children to enjoy safely. What a help. It wasn't techy at all. It felt like we were having a conversation. Jokes and funny asides throughout the book, it was one of the easiest books I have ever read. It's just the help I needed. Once again, Family PC has steered me right. Right to this incredible book, written by an incredible person who cares about children.

It's predators. She provides suggestions for dealing with the former and focuses on how to keep children safe from the latter. She does this in a sensible, non-alarmist way, putting the issues in true perspective and offering sound advice.Realizing that children are far more knowledgeable about technology than parents, Parry tells you how to learn from your children, talk to them about what they are doing online, and with them, develop rules and guidelines that will allow them to be safe online.So even if you don't know what a child is, you just might meet one online.

Portrait of an era gives the reader an inside look at the six time world champion Chicago Bulls! This book contains numerous pictures of the players and staff with short summaries of each person. Being a huge Bulls fan, I would obviously enjoy any book about the Bulls, but this book gives an intimate look at all of the teammates, coaches,etc. If you are a Bulls fan, this book allows you a rare opportunity of seeing the entire team and the staff behind it which is difficult to find. If you happen to be a fan of some bench players that are sometimes overshadowed on the team, here is your chance to get a look at them with equality to Michael Jordan or Scottie Pippen.Portrait of an era will also give the reader an inside look at the Bulls head coach Phil Jackson, owner Jerry Reinsdorf, and many others. At the end of the pictoral, there is an exclusive look at the historic 95-96 NBA season, in which the Bulls are the record holders of the 72-10 record which is the best in NBA history.Portrait of an era is a definite must-have for ANY Bulls fan!!!

Included films are: 'That's Entertainment', 'Buster And Billie', 'Chinatown', 'The Conversation', and one of the year's biggest blockbuster: 'The Towering Inferno'.Again, a must read for those who love film!!"},{"Title":"Golden nuggets of thought","review":"Disclaimer: This book was written (or compiled) by my Great-great grandfather, Barton Morgan.It is a compendium of aphorisms quoted from many great thinkers in history.

I have not ready every book or even twenty percent of the books written about that long ago war, but, like the person once said, \\"I knows what I like.\\" I first saw a copy of War With Heroes back around 1971 or '72 and was immediately taken with the absolute honesty of the photos of the grunts depicted within its pages. This book is not for veterans, because, simply put, the veteran already knows what the look of war does to the human face and psyche.

It is first of all a book of photgraphy and does not pretend to be a major literary work. I find the photgraphs to be very moving and dispute the previous reviewer's comment that the text is insipid. Contrary to her opinion (as she has no combat experience I don't know why she would voice an uneducated and ignorant opinion in the first place) I found the comments were right on the mark and reflect the majority of the veterans that served in Vietnam."},{"Title":"War without heroes","review":"The book arrived in a great condition for a very old book. I bought it for my brother, who is a VietNam Chaplain Veteran. His two sons, who are adults now, have leafed through his original edition until the pages were tattered and torn.

I had an opportunity to go to Con Thien once when I was at C-2 Washout. Second plt. almost was wiped out right after I went on R & R. But it was b/c of Vietnam that I became a Christian (Christ imputed His righteousness to me & forgave all my cosmic treason (sin) against His holiness) & for that, I will be eternally grateful for God's rich mercy in Christ Jesus.

Work on it for 6 months. Everyday. It gonna get boring and frustrating sometimes, but stick with it.2) Buy this book. The book is very fast paced, and without a foundation, you'll throw it in the trash.

However, I think if you are starting from scratch it may be more useful to start with Guitar for Dummies. The author assumes you have at least a bit of knowledge about the very basics of music theory that are more completely covered there. Also, this is NOT a method book. While it covers a lot of useful ground, it's not exactly chock full of extended lessons. Instead, the author tends to touch on a subject and provide a short example before moving on. On the plus side, there are lots of tips and tricks that I haven't seen in method books and they can be very helpful if you are learning without a teacher. Likewise, it's full of useful information about the mechanics of your guitar, amps, effects, maintenance, etc. The CD is also a great bonus as it's really nice (and sometimes surprising) to hear what it is you're supposed to be playing. I think it would go hand in hand with a good method book (perhaps Chris Lopez's First Stage book?)."},{"Title":"Rock Guitar for Dummies","review":"Well, not really dummies, but the very beginner. When you're putting your rig together to get a certain sound and want to know what's out there. The type of guitars, amps, all the pedals. It reviews the sounds that many great past and present players have and what they use to get it. It cuts down on a lot of guess work and the waste of money in buying pedals you don't need or gear you end up never using. It gives many short riff's to give you a taste of the many differnt styles and how to play them. Granted this is not a teach all or tell all book. The hard work is up to you. It's give a great illustration of the pentatonic scale, explaining how it links in the first 12 frets, and if you've been doing any work at all you know that the fret board basically starts over at the 12th fret only an octave higher.

It is still truly one of the most encouraging, real people books I have ever read. Marie Killilea reveals how cerebral palsy affects not only Karen's life but also the lives of her whole family. Fear, disappointment, discouragement, faith, peserverance and love are all shared in a reality many will never know. This book is not only one to be read by families of children with cerebral, but by everyone facing seemingly impossible challenges."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I first read this book when I was 11. It gave an excellent description of physical therapy and the different types of CP. It was a very informative book and I was impressed with the author's strong knowledge base and literary references. However, I was perturbed by the author's saying she would rather have Jimmy (the husband) than the two girls (Marie and infant Karen). The other thing that bothered me was when the author told Karen, then 6, who understandably was tired during one of her intense therapy sessions that &quot;God loved her so much he wanted her to suffer like Jesus.&quot; As a cradle Catholic, I just can't let that go unchallenged. God does not want anybody to suffer, His own begotten Son or any of His other children. Karen unfortunately suffered some sort of brain damage in utero (most likely) that resulted in cerebral palsy. She was well provided for -- she had a literary mother who made her famous, she had superior intelligence, she had loving siblings and a passel of pets. She was lucky in that she had a doctor who went to bat for her at an early age by recognizing her intelligence and telling her parents that she &quot;needed help and a great deal of it&quot; and for providing the Killileas with options to have Karen treated for C.P. (God bless that doctor)! In response to Karen's understandable displeasure with the button boards and her physically grueling routine, instead of telling her God wanted her to suffer (which certainly does not do a service to God), it might have been better to say that &quot;God is working with you and you have made a lot of improvements. Let's pray together for more improvement, or let's pray together for good work,&quot; or &quot;God is cheering you on! He had helped you come this far. Keep up the good work.&quot; My favorite uncle used to ask God to bless his work (he was in the construction and real estate)and this wonderful man really taught the faith in a loving and humane way. He really lived it in the kind way he treated people and in the respect he afforded people in his interpersonal and business relationships. He, of all people would be among the first to suggest that praying for &quot;good work together&quot; or for a general blessing would be advisable. That one part notwithstanding, it was an excellent book."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I have only read Karen but I would like to read Wren and With Love From Karen.

After reading this book, one feels inspired to be stronger, to do better and to try and make a difference. But as others have said, I have searched for information on what ever became of Karen in her adult life. I feel that I was left hanging by this mezmorising story.

I started reading &quot;Karen&quot; and &quot;With Love From Karen&quot; when I was about 10. Now I've read each of them at least 6 times!The books influenced my life in many little ways, and in some big ones, too. With little or no religion in my childhood, I found the references to their strong Catholic faith somewhat mysterious--but it taught me some Latin! Now I am a Catholic, imagine that. I much enjoyed the passages about Karen and the Newfoundland dogs, our family is on our second Newfy. Additionally, I learned about courage, faith and determination, and the lessons remain with me today.A note about the family, one of my Newfy contacts mentioned meeting Karen at a dog show a few years back, and that she was in good health. She no longer had Newfies, but another smaller breed (can't remember what). Both of fher parents are deceased, but no mention there of a divorce. Also, I hear that Karen works at a religious retreat not far from Sursum Corda, the family home on Long Island, I believe it was. She is a very private person, understandably. I hope she knows how many people read or heard her story and were inspired by it!!"},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I read this the first time as an adult. I had asked a librarian if she could recommend a good heartwarming book, and she insisted this was what I needed to read. It instantly became one of my all time favorites. The main reason I wanted to review it here, is I notice so many fellow readers complaining about the mother's approach to her daughter's disability, etc, and I want to point out,when Karen was born, the world was a different place entirely. 'Political correctness' had not been coined yet.Smoking was not recognized as the evil we now think of; in fact, it was common for doctor's to smoke in their offices with their patients. Mother's were not told to quit smoking because they were pregnant. I could go on, but my point is, for the time in our history when Karen was a child, there was no Disability Rights Act. The idea to treat a disabled child with dignity and equal rights were sadly un-common, and this is not the fault of Karen's family. Like all of us, they did the best they could with what they knew how to do.I think all this P.C. talk is taking away from the underlying feeling of the book. It is a triumph of the human spirit and I see that so clearly and am left feeling good about the strength and courage inside of us that we don't know is there, unless we are forced to summon it, or learn about someone like Karen, who had no choice but to live life the best she could.I am not condoning smoking or other bad choices mentioned in the book. I am simply attempting to suggest that if that is all you are looking at, you are missing the boat.This is the kind of book that I love most; it makes me laugh and cry and most of all, it is the kind of story that makes me realize how small most of my problems are.It brings to mind other humbling people such as Helen Keller. It may not be an equal comparison, but the feeling I derive from it is the same."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"Upon reading some of the other reviews I was surprised to see that this book is/was considered a book for younger readers. I have a 2 1/2 year old son who has cerebral palsy (the same type as Karen, but not as involved) and this book was given to me by a friend. I found it fascinating--both the way that Karen's parents learned to work with her and the things that Karen accomplished. Given the historical timeframe, I was not bothered by the fact that they smoked as some other people were. Having gone down this road myself, I cannot imagine what these people went through with virtually no resources, help or information available to them. Marie's story is so real to me and both heartbreaking and inspirational at the same time. I would recommend this book to people to help them to understand what my parenting experience has been like (on a different scale of course--I'm not starting from scratch). A great book!"},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I have read \\"Karen\\" a number of times since my teen years, though prior to purchasing the book, it had been at least 10 years since my last reading. This story of a girl born in 1940 with cerebral palsy -- and all the trials, tribulations, and stigma that went along with its diagnosis, treatment, and daily living at that time -- remains intriguing and engaging.More than simply an eye-opening account of life with a severely disabled child, \\"Karen\\" is a window into another era, even another culture (the story takes place in the well-to-do suburbs north of New York City). The Killilea's were a devoutly Catholic Irish-American family. This is before Vatican II and the changes it brought to the Mass and to the church itself. Smoking was socially acceptable, its health risks not well-consdidered. These things all play into the story.I feel compelled to address Marie's (author/narrator) comment, during her husband Jiimmy's serious illness, that she would sacrifice her children. I believe other reveiwers have mis-interpreted her remark. She wasn't minimizing her love for her children; she was expressing her extraordinary love and devotion to her husband. Again, remember that the book was written in 1952 and should not be judged as if it had been written in 2006. Language, customs, beliefs, and even our culture were significantly different.In summary, \\"Karen\\" is a fascinating story. Should you take everything in it at face value? No, of course not. Is it worth reading? Absolutely, if not for the day-to-day details of life with cerebral palsy, then for the window into life in suburbia in the early 1950's.It is also worth noting that Marie Killilea was instrumental in founding United Cerebral Palsy, the organization that still advocates for and supports the cerebral palsied today."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"&quot;Karen&quot; and &quot;With Love From Karen&quot; changed my life...sounds corny, I know, but true nonetheless. I first became acquainted with &quot;Karen&quot; as a bewildered ten year-old whose parents were divorcing. Even though &quot;Karen&quot; had been published some thirty years prior to the day that I first picked it up as a little girl, the book struck a profound chord within me that still resonates today.In searching for a common reason as to why these books continue to matter to so many people so many years later, the prevailing theme seems to be the against-all-odds humour that infuses the pages with such joy, and also a sense of &quot;connectedness&quot; to a family none of us will ever know -- perhaps a familial connection that some of us have found lacking in our own lives. The message of these books is timeless -- love your family -- work hard -- be good to animals -- help your neighbours -- be true to yourself -- and let God in your life.Like everyone else, I would love to know what Karen and the rest of the surviving family are doing now, but one suspects the reason for their silence may have something to do with a wish for privacy that should be respected. I know Marie has passed on, but I would like to thank her and the rest of the Killilea family for encouraging me and thousands of others.

I never could understand why more people didn't know about them. Marie wrote with such talent and brought the reader into the family and made you feel a part of it. You couldn't help but be touched by the family, faith and relationships within these books. What an amazing family. I just read a review that Jimmy and Marie were divorced...It really took me a back and saddened me very much. They held together through so much heartache, joy, family and triumphs, what could have been the situation that came between them. I too, would love to know more of what has happened to the rest of the family. Little Marie, Karen, Rory, Gloria and Kristen and their families. Also in one of the reviews it was mentioned that they thought in the book -With Love from Karen- that the younger Marie's experiences were glossed over, and yet Gloria's was described in such detail...that has always puzzled me too.

Wouldn't it be great for the family to be able to continue this chapter for us. I truly hope that they are happy and healthy. I just wish I knew what happened to them.

Because of these online reviews and the fact that some had left their e-mail addresses for contact, a group of us formed a bit of a &quot;fan club,&quot; have been together on a Yahoo site since Oct. 29, 1999, and now have a membership of over 600!

It is a wonderful story of Karen and her family, back in the '40's when correct diagnosis and treatment of cerebral palsy was almost unheard of.

Marie died in October of 1991, Jimmy in July of 1994. It says his marital status at time of death is &quot;Widower&quot; (she died before he did). Under 'Name of Spouse' it says &quot;Marie Killilea&quot;. Also, I checked out the updated Forward to my 1993 edition of &quot;Karen&quot;, and Marie mentions going to the Bronx Zoo with Jimmy and their grandson Jason, in 1981. I have no idea why someone would say they were divorced; perhaps Pat O'Brien was confused at the time. Best to check resources carefully."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"Received the book quickly, gave it to my student teacher as a gift. It was a great book for me to read way back 45 years ago! Wow! I wanted to share it with a really outstanding future teacher. Found out she collects old books and just loved the thought!"},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I wanted to buy a book for my daughter who has Cerebral Palsy, and thought a copy of the book \\"Karen\\" would be appropriate, since it a mother's story of her daughter who lives with the challenges of C.P. I found several sellers who offered what looked like good copies; but decided to email them to ask if spine and binding was secure so my daughter could easily handle the book. Only one seller got back to me right away-she answered the question as honestly as she could but it satisfied me, and that is why I chose to purchase fromt them. I chose right!! The book arrived well before the promised date and was in even better condition than I had hoped! Thank you Amazon and Atlanta Books!"},{"Title":"Karen","review":"Like many of you, I loved this book as a child, but re-reading it in 2004, what jumped off the page to me was how much everyone smoked.While Marie is recovering in the hospital from the birth, she lights a cigarette. When they take baby Karen to the doctor, the doctor lights a cigarette, and then offers the cigarette box to the Killileas.I know this was in 1940, but still, it was disturbing, given that we now know smoking causes premature birth, and may well have led to Karen's CP.I would still recommend this inspiring book, but if I gave it to a child, I would have a talk with them about smoking first, since this family is supposed to be role models."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"Christopher Reeve died three days ago, which caused me to wonder whether quadriplegic former skier Jill Kilmont was still among the living, which brought me to someone's post in which she said that Jill's story reminded her of Marie Kililea's \\"Karen.\\" My recognition of the book was instant. I then read these reviews with interest. So this is the book in which a loving mother said she'd not hesitate to choose her husband over her children--after all, she could always have more! To the saintly Marie Lyons Kililea, children were as fungible as furniture. I've remembered for thirty-five years that some mother felt that way; thanks to another reviewer of this book, I now remember just where I read it. Other memories of \\"Karen\\" flooded back as I read over these reviews; a desire to re-read the book and its sequel did not. I remembered the train trips to doctors, Karen's two enema bags, her mother's smoking (and her being told at some point, even in those distant days, that she thus might have caused Karen's paralysis), Karen's final choice of the wheelchair over the appliances she needed to walk. A story that lingers so long in the memory cannot be without value, and Mrs. Kililea was not without gifts as a writer. So why only two stars? When I was nine, Karen, plucked off the library shelf because she shared my name, irritated me because she charmed and was loved by everyone, as I, bookish and introverted, did not. Thirty-five years later, deeper reasons not to recommend the books occur to me. The Kilileas inhabit a world without moral subtlety. Everything is either black or white; every dilemma is resolved by submission to dogma and orthodoxy. Age nine is too young to read of mothers who'd gladly sacrifice the children for hubby, who lecture their suffering children that God wants them to hurt, whose beloved niece saves herself, waiting patiently, until \\"Rome says yes!\\" and her swain is released from his marriage, over legally for years with a divorce, by a Church annulment. Nor would I present either \\"Karen\\" or its sequel to a child with a disability. Not only would I not want to suggest to her that she must suffer gladly as Jesus did, but I would not want her to feel that she must shoulder the burden of setting everyone around her at ease with her handicap. Not everyone, whole or crippled, is born with Karen's gifts. So to whom, if anyone, would I recommend this story? Certainly only to someone who's seen enough of life to take \\"Karen\\"'s message of sweet submission to the divine will with a grain, or more, of salt."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I picked up this book in a library toss bin recently and foolishly (not realizing it was out of print) left it on the airplane for the next passenger requiring inspiration. The many 5-star reviews should give an objective reader a clue as to the type of book this is, and the type of writer Killilea was--and that does NOT mean Jane Austen. Because I am something of a 3-star Sally in my reviews, I must add that my usual complaints (poor writing, confusing organization, insufficient editing) are not my reasons for faulting this book. It is fairly well-written (back when editors were editors!), with the insousiance that pervades works by well-fed, country club ladies of the 1950's (Jean Kerr comes to mind) who bore none of the crosses feminism would later burn figuatively on their expansive front lawns.My beef about this book--please do NOT send me nasty e-mails!--is that I did not find any of the characters, and I include the title character and the author, particularly appealing. As to Karen herself, she was a little girl undergoing a particular education regimen. It was rigorous and stressful, and, being a little girl who, like most little girls, wanted desperately to please those whom she loves, she survived it. But living to tell the tale is not the same as heroism, though nowadays you would never know it, and if Oprah were interviewing Homer about Troy, we'd be listening to the story of Aeneas rather than Hector. I doubt that Killilea's intention was to raise her daughter to a pinnacle, though, and anyone who views the child's story as a triumph over adversity is misreading the book. I believe that Killilea's point was that Karen's story could be ANY child's story, given the same set of favorable circumstances.So, having attempted to view the author's intentions in a light most sympathetic to me, I sadly must now add that I really didn't like the author ONE BIT. She represents a type of unquestioning, anti-intellectual, rigid Catholicism that makes it hard for other Catholics to be Catholic. Since she flaunts her Irishness, I feel free to whack the ball back into that court by saying that the Italians where I grew up in New York thought people like the Killileas were crazy. I do not know how many Roman Catholics she and her ilk have caused to lapse over the decades; any healthy religion has a spectrum of levels of dogmatism, but this particular group seemed to dominate the Church in New York for a long time (if you think I lie, check the list of bishops in the NYC archdiocese even now).But I should not air this dirty laundry online! And I should not let my intellectual response to the book be colored by the fact that I now am sojourning in a city that gives full testament to the Catholic Church's exhuberance, wackiness, theological depth, and sensual excess. Killilea was probably an above-average product of her isolated little smoke-filled (literally as well as figuratively!) caucasion world. (I normally make my home in the Baltimore/Washington area, and found quite enlightening her descriptions of the people of color who carried the Killilea luggage on the way to Johns Hopkins Hospital).Speaking of smoke-filled: Amen to the reviewers who point out the frightening excess of tobacco-dependence. I do believe there was a point in the book in which the author and her husband sit around smoking in the same room where lay their daughter Marie, at that very moment suffering from some type of long-term lung failure. Excuse me? Is there a doctor in the house? (No, wait; the doctors were the ones offering cigarettes.) Maybe just someone with an inquiring mind? (See, it's getting back to the Catholic thing . . . . )"},{"Title":"Karen","review":"After reading the book, &quot;Karen,&quot; I was so enthralled that I read the book aloud to my physically handicapped son who only wanted to read photography and computer manuals! The humor was so warm and delicious. I've always wished I could have been the type mother, as was Marie, who would actually *wear* the outrageous jewelry her children gave her! I even began to read anything that author Jean Kerr wrote because she was a neighbor to this family. As most other readers have acknowledged, there was a sense of belonging to that large, loving family and it evolved into an urgent quest for more information about them. About 20 years ago, actor Pat O'Brien (Uncle Pat) and his wife, appeared in a local theater production. I sent a note and asked to meet them. They were most gracious and shared that they had kept in touch with the Killilea family. I truly, truly regret to say that Marie and Jimmy were divorced by that time and Marie was suffering from some form of cancer. Karen was still living and, of course, was an adult woman. How I wish there could have been a more happy conclusion to my search for information, but we must not let the lack of ideal endings detract from the absolute beauty of that book and those lives. I hope this classic will continue to be read and appreciated for decades to come."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"This book remains a classic of Eisenhower-era nonfiction. Marie Killilea's lyrical memoir transports modern readers back to the days when smoking was socially acceptable, Catholics heard mass in Latin, and milk arrived in bottles on the doorstep. But, with Karen leading the charge, it also tackles more timeless themes. Ultimately, it's a clear-eyed record of the triumph of a little girl who, with the support of her family, met the challenge of cerebral palsy successfully. If you have this disorder of posture and movement, or want an uplifting read, look for this book in your local library. You won't be disappointed"},{"Title":"Karen","review":"My wife had read &quot;With Love from Karen&quot; and the sequel &quot;Karen&quot; about thirty years ago. She was so enthralled and enthused by the stories and Marie's style of writing she almost demanded I read them also. I was in the midst of a college engineering course of study, and reading anything that didn't discribe &quot;Statics&quot; or &quot;Dynamics&quot; was out of the question. However, when I did pick these books up in mid semester I found a &quot;Dynamics&quot; that far exceeded anything I had ever seen in Engineering. These are true stories of women involved in living life's challenges with courage and finese that is rarely seen today. Karen and her mother are truly women for the Age. This is a must read for any one who needs to have a cold splash of water in the face and start their journey into the first day of the rest of their lives. It is a fresh, vibrant romp through the problems we all face in one way or another but are afraid to admit to. Karen and her mother make the impossible seem easy, if just taken one day at a time. They are not super human just human in a super way. If you want the end of your day to be better then the begining, start reading these books today. I am now in the medical field and a day doesn't go by that I don't think of Karen, and her mother Marie Killilea."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"This is a wonderful story of a family dealing with a handicapped child and the struggle to get her the help she so desperately needed.

I did- that year, and straight through High School. Karen was once of the reasons I became a Special Education teacher. And her desire to go to school just like her friends and siblings is why I work in inclusion settings. This book was so meaningful in my life! I just finished an incredible year with a 7 year old who has Cerebral Palsy as a member of my First Grade Class.

The very next weekend, I bought another paperback copy at Woolworth's and kept that one hidden inside my textbooks! Like other reviewers here, I reread the book often as a young girl. In retrospect, I think it was the depiction of a happy family that most moved me. However, as an historian I have developed a professional focus on children with special needs and think that &quot;Karen&quot; must be one of the reasons.

Later, I read it over again many times. It is a wonderful story of struggle and triumph, but most important it is a wonderful story of a loving family. My favorite parts of the book are the way the family &quot;adopts&quot; just about everyone who is lucky enough to cross their path, and the way that of all Karen's achievements, the ones they are proudest of are her sense of humor and her loving heart. I also love the way that the sequel shows that they are committed to what is best for Karen, rather than traditional concepts of &quot;normality&quot; or even previous goals like walking."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I read this book when I was about 10 years old - it caught my attention in the library because my name was Karen also.

Any one I told of the book thought it would be a depressing, sad story - but I couldn't emphasize enough that it was heartwarming, beautiful and a joyous celebration of life.

Their story helped influence many of my values as I developed into a young adult and still now as I struggle to parent my children in this world. Perseverance, hope, community helping those in need, sacrifice, unconditional love; these are just a few of the lessons I learned from the wonderfully written telling of their story. I wanted to order the book and its sequel for my daughter who is now in junior high and am saddened to learn they are out of print. The experience of the Killilea family is universal and very important to tell in order to share these values that will serve our society well."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I just love this book!!

Its revealing and impressive firsthand view of the situation of those who have disabled children is extremely valuable as well - and it is interesting how many of the problems stem as much from the reactions of others as from the medical situation. My only regret is that there are no illustrations - I love Marie's pardonable pride in speaking of the beauty of her children."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I first read this book as a child and have reread it every year. One year, as I read, I realized my five month old daughter had cerebral palsy. The book was a great source of comfort and advice. Written in the 1940s, it tells of a time when mopst of these children were forgotten in institutions and thought to have no IQ. Karen's family not only kept her, but they raised her to be an intelligent and successful human being-a miracle for the time. I pick up every copy I find in thrift stores and give them to parents. (They're getting harder to find, so order fast!) Even if you have no special interest in Cerebral Palsy, you'll be touched by this loving family story."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I first read Karen in about the 5th grade.

I believe it would be a good motivational book for all children, expecially those with disabilities. My daughter has ADD and daily has to struggle. I would like her to know what can be accomplished by trying and trying, over and over again. Just an excellent book!"},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I first read Karen when I was in grade school.

Definitely worth the search, it's one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"Karen and With Love From Karen written by Marie Kililea are in my opinion both masterpieces on mans ability to overcome physical and emotional disabilities in a positive manner. I read &quot;Karen&quot; and &quot;With Love from Karen&quot; when I was young and wasn't able to appreciate at that time the true value of these books. The humor and kindness of the Kililea family was very apparent even at the first glance. I enjoyed them all the same at that time and recently picked them up again to reread. The literary style and content is superb. The quality is unsurpassed by many books written on handicaps because it gives a feeling of hope and determination rather than a feeling of &quot;the poor child&quot; to the readers. I would recommend this book to people of all ages, with or without disabilities because its a good lesson in appreciating the gifts of God that we receive daily.It's a pity that we don't know what happens with Karen as she goes through her adult life since readers feel that they know her at a personal level by the time they finish the books. I was also disappointed to see that &quot;With Love from Karen&quot; is out of print!"},{"Title":"Karen","review":"It's not much, but I did a key word search on all the family names from the Karen books. I found a number of hits for a Russ Lea down in Georgia. I also found a hit for a Rory Killilea which took me to a picture of a middle aged man holding a young boy at a local ball game somewhere on the west coast. There was no article, just a caption: &quot;Rory Killilea and his son enjoy the game&quot; or soemthing like that. The Lea ones seem iffy because it seems to be a fairly common name, but I thought that Rory Killilea was unusual enough that it could be him. I couldn't find any thing on anyone else in the family except for references to the various books that Marie wrote. It left me with some sense of satisfaction to think of Rory as a happy dad. Anyway, thought I would share it with all of you who, like me, are wishing to know more of the story."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I received &quot;Karen&quot; from my Mom when I was 10 (I'm 16 now), and at the time I didn't think much of it. As a matter of fact, I even said, &quot;You can walk. Big deal!&quot; I wasn't being serious, but I still reget that careless remark. &quot;Karen&quot; is the story of a God-sent child and her remarkable family as they deal with Karen being &quot;affected by&quot; not &quot;afflicted with&quot; Cerebral Palsy. I reread this book whenever I feel lonely, or happy, or disappointed. You'll laugh at the descriptions of their mishaps and the nightly Bible classes between Karen and Rory. You'll grow attatched to the warm characters- both human and animal! You'll experience the family's troubles and triumphs and you'll cry at both. I don't know of anyone who wouldn't have a restored faith in the heart of humanity after reading this book. This book reveals the strength of the disabled and te progress of society toward their acceptance. I am very surprised and saddened to hear about the divorce of Jimmy ad Marie-- who would've guessed? At any rate, they are both strong people in their own right, so don't be disillusioned now! Does anyone know what happend to little Kristin?

You can't criticize the smoking, because at that time, people didn't know smoking around kids was harmful. Smoking was a very normal activity for many adults. If Marie Killilea had known that smoking might be contributing to her miscarriages and ill health of her kids, I'm sure she would have stopped. People didn't know.You can't criticize Karen's parents for not creating a cerebral-palsy playgroup for her, because they were the groundbreakers in treating cerebral palsied kids like \\"normal\\" kids. They were flying by the seat of their pants. My guess would be that they decided they should raise Karen \\"normally,\\" and having her play a lot with other handicapped kids would not have seemed \\"normal\\"--after all, what they were fighting were doctors and other professionals who recommended placing Karen permanently in an institution FILLED with other handicapped people. This book is not a recent book and it has to be read in the historical context. I mean, schools were still segregated when Karen was born. Geez.I read this book and \\"With Love From Karen\\" when I was in about fifth and sixth grade, after my mother gave me \\"Wren.\\" Honestly, I never thought much about the cerebral-palsy side of the books. I was an only child, I loved animals, and I thought that Karen was lucky to live in her family. The cerebral palsy was kind of a side issue for me. We didn't go to church, and I didn't understand a lot of the Catholic stuff either, but I loved that the family sounded so close.I think the concern someone posted about publishing this book when Karen was still young has some validity, but--her mom was desperately trying to draw attention to the fact that handicapped kids were okay. She succeeded in a huge way, through this book. She influenced a generation of people, people who would have looked at her daughter strangely if they ever met her, due to her handicap, but, instead, looked at Karen as practically an angel, because they felt they knew her through this book. And after all, when Marie wrote the book, she would have had no idea that it would end up being in print for decades and read all over the world, and that Karen would still be hounded by fans in 2007 (which apparently she is, when they can track her down).I guess what I'm saying is, before anyone criticizes Karen's mom, they ought to keep in mind that their opinions about what's right and wrong for handicapped kids were probably shaped by Karen's mom, whether they realize it or not. Our whole society was influenced by \\"Karen.\\" Yeah, everyone knows you don't keep a kid with cerebral palsy hidden in the basement of your house--but hey, America didn't always know that.I just found a website where I read that Gloria's two daughters, ages 9 and 7 at the time, were killed in a house fire. I actually cried over this. Although of course I never met any of these people, they felt like my family when I was a kid."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I am 49 now and read this book when I was about 8 years old. (Why a book with curse words was available in the Weekly Reader Book Club for little children to read, I'll never know.) I have never dwelt on any of the negatives that readers are commenting about, with the one exception of the smoking. I do not have CP, but as a child I knew something about me was different. I was premature, late learning to walk, and the slowest runner of all the children - no matter how hard I tried to run faster or how much I loved to run. I had frequent stomachaches & got sick with sinus/allergy/URI's/dehydration regularly every 3 months or so. I almost died at least twice. My ankles turned or twisted very easily. I hated being crowded or hearing loud noises. My legs hurt often, & if I fell on one of my kneecaps, it felt broken because the pain was so horrible. The pediatrician said this was \\"growing pains\\", but it wasn't. At the age of 28, I learned that I had \\"fibrositis\\", now called Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS or CFIDS). This incurable chronic disease - an autoimmune, muscle, pain, allergy/sinus, urinary, colon, and neurological/cognitive disorder in one - can be disabling. In fact, it has been compared to mild cases of spastic CP. Microscopic tears that grew into huge tears (caused by the FMS) made me need to have major reconstructive surgery of my right knee at 13 and my left knee at 24. So reading about Karen's struggles from a young age helped me to also conquer challenges that my own disability has brought into my life. I presently work a full-time job as an administrative assistant for a global company. I love Big Marie's different writing style. Like today's very popular cable show about the Roloffs of Roloff Farm in Oregon (married dwarves who have 4 children, only one of which is a dwarf), who have the problems and disagreements every family has but struggle as a team to make it in an oversized world, the Killileas were a normal family dealing with a precious child who was labeled \\"abnormal\\". I loved that they turned the living room into a physical therapy room and invited the \\"normal\\" kids over to watch and join in the fun. I loved that there were gouges in the furniture where Karen had vacuumed, and they didn't care. I loved that Karen was not a little saint - she was human, as proved by the stunts she made her little brother Rory carry out, and the \\"female dog\\" term she used to get rid of an obnoxious stranger who invited himself into their house. I loved that Gloria had the maturity, discipline and self-control to wait 7 years for Russ, her true love. I'm not Catholic, but I loved that they regularly went to Mass and had spiritual insights. I loved that they taught Karen to take part in what physical activities she could, such as swimming and horse riding. I loved that Karen dealt with severe pain every day (as I do) and HATE that they put that spreader between her legs at night to stretch her leg muscles - like torture! In short, the best part of \\"Karen\\" is that she never limited herself by listening to what doctors and therapists told her she could never do, but she surpassed all their limitations and expectations by victories like walking, writing by hand, and getting up & down off of chairs alone. I'm still inspired by this book today."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"&quot;Karen&quot; and &quot;With Love from Karen&quot; remain my favorite all time books - and this is saying alot as I am a librarian and avid reader.

It is a testament to Marie Killillea's ministry of public education that today students with disabilities are present in public schools."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"This is a wonderful book for readers of all ages. I first read this book when I found it on the booshelf of a house we were renting for the summer. It is a sweet story and as you read it you will fall in love with Karen and all the Killileas. It is amazing as you look at the time that Big Marie and Jimmy put into helping Karen become self-sufficient. The story of Karen's birht is amazing also. KAren was born at 6 months 2 days weighing 1 lb. 12 oz. She spent the first 8 months of her life in the hospital, she was unable to gian sufficient weight because of an esaphagus problem. Weighing barely 8 lbs. The doctors risked everything and preformed surgery, completely fixing the problem. THen two days later Karene becomes so sick with the flu that she is put on critical. Miraculously a risky blood transfusion saved her again. Everyone should read this classic story of the Killilea family."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"This is a profoundly moving book - the biography of a child afflicted by cerebral palsy who was born in an era when it was a little-understood disease with almost no treatment options or support groups. On the contrary, many people were repulsed by what they considered a dirty or degenerate condition. Written by her mother, this is a lively and engaging account of the family's experience, from discouragement to hope to triumph, all anchored by a deep religious faith that shines through. You don't have to be a devout Catholic to find this a profoundly inspirational story. Karen herself is no saint; her humor, intelligence and inner strength reveal a person of great value, even as a very young child. I have re-read this book many times over the past 45 years and it has never failed to enlighten and uplift me."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I was sad to see these books are out of print but was happy to see others felt the same about Karen and her family. I have a 14-year-old that I would love to have read these stories. How many of us have to write in before someone puts these fine books back in print?"},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I, too, have worn out my copy of this. I first read Karen's story as a small child, as a child's book called &quot;Wren&quot;. Then I found &quot;Karen&quot; and &quot;With Love From Karen&quot; and read them to death. Thanks to Karen, I have a Newfoundland! I'm trying to find another copy of each of these, hence my stop here today. Also good, Marie Killilea's children's picture book, &quot;Newf&quot;. Great for dog and cat lovers everywhere."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I can't remember how I got a hold of this book, but I read it when I was very young. One summer, my family took me to New York City and somehow we ended up in the suburbs and found the Killilea house. No one was home, but I can still remember how excited I was to be so close to the Killilea family. I also was puzzled by the fact that Gloria's life was much more detailed than little Marie's. Karen and With love from Karen really should be mandatory reading for children."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I bought this as a gift for my sister who loved these books as a young girl. She was so surprised and happy to receive it. It arrived very quickly and in great condition."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I too have fibromyalgia and pain every day. Fortunately I have a loving husband and two daughters. I have read these books do often I could quote passages from them. I am just heartbroken that the fire tore apart the family and three precious girls were killed. How could Marie had said such a thing to a freshly bereaved mother of two children? (she said now she had the theme of her next book) Our family is also dealing with many other illnesses including Alzheimer's with my mother and me being disabled from a career as a professor. It is a rough life down here! I am glad that the remaining family is close."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"This book is such a good read, it is all about a little girl born with CP. She is so brave and such an inspiration. I think everyone will enjoy the story of Karen."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I originally read the Karen books as a child, and I've loved them ever since. To those who find fault, as others have pointed out, the events took place in the 40s and 50s- yes, a lot of people smoked. Interesting, but certainly not shocking. And to the person who objected to Marie loving her husband more than her children- for heaven's sake, remember the context: The husband was in emergency surgery and the author was *praying*. She says as she prayed she tried to bargain with God and explained that while her children were a precious part of her life, her husband *was* her life. These were private words spoken to God; not worthy of criticism."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I have also been a fan of Marie Killilea's books since I first read them as a kid almost 30 years ago. I would love so much to find out what happened to the family members. I also find it almost impossible to believe that Marie and Jimmy ever got divorced, not only because of everything they had been through but even more because of their very strong Catholic faith. If anyone knows what really happened, please write!"},{"Title":"Karen","review":"This book is a wonderful and true story about a courageous mom and her very bright daughter who happens to have cerebral palsy. It is a finely detailed literary work that speaks volumes to the centrality of involved, conscientious parenting. Excellent and beautiful work, recommended for any one that cares as much about the parenting profession as this writer clearly and eloquently does."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"This book is one of my favorites and should be read by all. It is a wonderful story of Karen and her family, back in the '40's when correct diagnosis and treatment of cerebral palsy was almost unheard of. Someone posted in the review section regarding Marie and Jimmy Killilea getting divorced over 20 years ago. Well, I did a bit of research of my own and found Marie and Jimmy's death records online. Marie died in October of 1991, Jimmy in July of 1994. It says his marital status at time of death is &quot;Widower&quot; (she died before he did). Under 'Name of Spouse' it says &quot;Marie Killilea&quot;. Also, I checked out the updated Forward to my 1993 edition of &quot;Karen&quot;, and Marie mentions going to the Bronx Zoo with Jimmy and their grandson Jason, in 1981. I have no idea why someone would say they were divorced; perhaps Pat O'Brien was confused at the time. Best to check resources carefully."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I read Karen when I was in my early teens, and was thrilled to re-read it just a few months ago when my daughter brought it home from school. (About 40 years have gone by.)I was also able to read With Love From Karen, a book I had looked for, but was never able to find. Both books were in the local high school library!These are outstanding examples of humor, and faith in God enabling you to cope with any situation. In the Killilea's case without air conditioning! Just great books, and very enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I first read this book as a child. I loved it, and wrote a book report on it. Even as an adult, I still find this book warm and uplifting. When my son was born, he sustained a brain injury that has caused him to be delayed in many areas. I reread Karen, and found strength that other people have gone through tough times. As to the breakup of the Killilea's marriage, this is probably evidence of how little support there was for parents of children with special needs. It can take a toll on a family, even one as bright and cheerful as Karen's. Read this book and be enlightened and encouraged."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I read this book almost 30 years ago and still remember it like it was today. My 10 year old son is studing disabilities in school; I was surpriced when I tried to purchase the book that it was out of print; it should be required reading for all children and adults!"},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I read Karen and With Love from Karen when I was in sixth or seventh grade. Having CP myself, these were the first books I ever read on the subject. Karen's courage, strength, determination and spirit were, and still are, an inspiration to me today and to those who are lucky enough to read these books as well. I strongly encourage parents, grandparents, siblings and friends of loved ones who have CP to read these books. Their inspirational messages are just as valid today as the day they were lived, written about and published."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"WHAT I WOULD LIKE THE WORLD TO KNOW IS THAT I WENT TO THE CEREBRAL PALSY SOCIETY IN NEW YORK LOCATED ON 29TH &amp; MADISON AVENUE IN NEW YORK CITY...NOONE THERE HAD EVER HEARD OF KAREN OR HER MOTHER..I LEFT MY NAME AND NUMBER AND A MS.

I was shocked to see it out of print, and to learn that my niece, an avid reader at age 14, had never heard of it. It is a disservice to keep from a new generation of young readers the valiant story of Karen."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I, like Karen, have Cerebral Palsy. I have read and re-read this book so many times in the last 22 years that I have had to replace my original copy twice. It was, and is an inspiring book for me and has always lifted my spirits each time I read it. I wish some printer would reprint the book so that future generations would have access to such a wonderful book! It should definitely be required reading for every student in high school."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"My mother gave me this book on my ninth birthday not knowing herself what it was about. I read it then and have read it at least twice a year in every year since. Karen's loving family and heroic struggle to achieve everything possible for her are inspirations for all of us who ever wanted to give up on anything. Equally important is Marie Killilea's description of the prejudices of the times, when she was advised to turn her back on her daughter and forget she ever had her. Her refusal to do so and her matter-of-fact recounting of her and her husband's struggles to help Karen speak equally well for their own courage, love and clear-sightedness. This is a book to own, treasure and re-read at least twice a year -- especially when you feel like giving up."},{"Title":"The Forest of Symbols: Aspects of Ndembu Ritual","review":"Considered an ethnographic classic. Victor Turner, a professor at Cornell, was known for his work in both anthropology and the behavioral sciences. These essays go far beyond meticulous recording of Zambian ritual to examine the role of symbols in social processes. Topics include medicine, witchcraft, morality, social structure, rites of passage, color classification, and the role of symbols in so many aspects of tribal life. Photographs, charts, and lists."},{"Title":"The Forest of Symbols: Aspects of Ndembu Ritual","review":"Turner writes a classic of what it means to successfully complete an ethnographic study. What my professors did to better explain this work (centered on Zambia) is build upon it to show how the Western world has captured and portrayed the modern Olympics. The role of symbols in social processes is better understood by this reader because of Turner."},{"Title":"MAMA FLORA'S FAMILY: A Novel","review":"At the center of Mama Flora's Family is the indomitable spirit of Mama Flora, the matriarch of an extraordinary family of destitute Tennessee sharecroppers. The characters are so real and believable it made this reader feel that I was right there with them experiencing all their trials and tribulations, as well as the joys. This book is much more than a poignant, hard-to-put-down story of a Mama Flora and her descendants from 1920 to the late 1990s. It, for the most part, effectively weaves into the plot much of what has transpired in American/African-American history during this time period (e.g., life for African-Americans in the South, the rise of the Civil Rights movement, the Black Panthers, the Nation of Islam, the Viet Nam war, political repression under Idi Amin, etc). Mama Flora's Family is a rich, resonant family novel that cuts across the barriers that divide us to touch the hearts of people of all races and backgrounds. I highly recommend this excellent, emotionally-packed posthumous novel written by David Stevens based on Alex Haley's notes and research."},{"Title":"MAMA FLORA'S FAMILY: A Novel","review":"This novel is one of the best I have read. Alex Haley and Stevens express a kind of compassion from a grandmother/mother that no one could do better. It's a very emotional book, and touches everyone that has ever experienced a good book.

It is one that is vary hard to put down because you can't help wondering what is going to happen next."},{"Title":"MAMA FLORA'S FAMILY: A Novel","review":"I saw the movie first, and I was so happy to see Erika Alexander and Queen Latifah working together. Then years later, I decided to watch the movie again and then finally read the book. Usually you hear about people liking the book better than the movie, and considering the book is written by an incredibly talented storyteller (Alex Haley), I'm assuming the book is factual. So that makes me wonder why the screenwriter(s) for the movie wrote such a different reaction in some parts in the movie. In the book, Luke's first meeting with Mama Flora was warm and sweet. In the movie, it was cold and uncomfortable. There were other spots like this with Willie's children Don and Diana, and Ruthana going to Africa was completely excluded from the movie. I know a film has to be cut, but I actually liked certain people better in the movie than the book and vice versa. Luke was more of an afterthought in the book but a major force in the movie.I think if I'd read the book first and then watched the book, I might've not liked the movie as much because there seemed to be false information. Now whether the information really was false to make the movie more exciting or excluded from the book due to editorial changes I couldn't tell you. I liked the book and the movie, but if you're looking for one to mirror the other, you're going to mentally start counting moments that don't match. The most disappointing part for me was I thought Flora was annoying, unnecessarily mean to Ruthana, catty to Pearl and way too submissive to folks who she did laundry jobs for. In the movie, she was much stronger and more likable.With that said, the story of Mama Flora's childhood, teenage years and adulthood and the challenges she went through with plantation owners, children, her parents, her grandparents and love were fascinating."},{"Title":"MAMA FLORA'S FAMILY: A Novel","review":"It was a wonderful story if you loved roots and queen you will love this book.I can't beleive David Stevens wrote this book from Alex Haley's notes.

I started using it in college because it was easy to look up words in the dictionary format. I continued using it in my career as a writer. I cannot imagine writing letters, speeches, etc. without it. Now that I have retired, my wife uses my old Roget's Thesaurus for her crossword puzzles and loves it. Between the two of us, we wore it out. This new edition is as good as the previous one. If you think you will write something, I highly recommend it.

You can click on the header for each location to see if it is one that you want to use (if you cannot tell right away, from the amount of context provided); if it doesn't fill your needs, press 'back' and go to the next location.The only seemingly awkward part of this is that once you've done one search, you have to do the next one from where you were last; just feels counterintuitive, although it works very well.Best choice for the Kindle, for sure!Edited to add: Do give your Kindle time to index the thesaurus before you try to use it; it may take a while!"},{"Title":"The Doubleday Roget's Thesaurus in Dictionary Form","review":"It is a good thesaurus if this was in print form.

The majority of thesauri only include synonyms. (NOTE: If SYNONYMS (not antonyms) are all you want, then settle for nothing less than Rodale's THE SYNONYM FINDER. Its comprehensiveness --and, arguably, its ease of use-- are significantly superior to that of all the competition.)While this \\"Doubleday Roget's Thesaurus in Dictionary Form\\" frankly isn't quite the equal of many competing thesauri as a SYNONYM finder, it nonetheless includes something that the majority of competing thesauri lack: ANTONYMS.Comparing/contrasting this Doubleday book with Princeton Language Institute's \\"21st Century Synonym and Antonym Finder,\\" I'm finding that many words (e.g., \\"deduce\\" and \\"infer\\") are included in Doubleday's book but not that other book.

Of course, this admittedly isn't an entirely fair comparison, considering that this book encompasses 804 pages, while the other (much more conveniently compact and portable) book encompasses only 520 pages.Bottom line, NEITHER of these two competing books FULLY satisfies me.

Unlike its 1999, second-edition incarnation, the 2005 version does include ANTONYMS. I only wish the third edition were available in hardcover form.

Ellison has long been a passionate, generous supporter of the Metropolitan Opera; her insider's knowledge of the company is revealed in the striking images she produced over the course of fourteen months spent observing the Met at work: the massed squadrons of Aida supernumeraries waiting for their entrance; the bittersweet company farewell of Luciano Pavarotti in Tosca; the triumphant Met debut of Angela Denoke as the Marschallin. Weighing in at seven pounds and measuring a strapping seventeen-and one-quarter inches in width, In Grand Style devotes most of its big pages to the era's stop stars in performance, but there are also offbeat shots taken from the wings or snapped in rehearsal. Easily the most amusing of these features Placido Domingo in preparation for Cyrano; the tenor sits patiently, his own street wear augmented by Cyrano's dashing suede boots- and a less-than-dashing oversized false nose.Each of the twenty Met productions covered is given its own section of the book, headed by a brief listing of the credits and casting for the performance in question. The absence of captions identifying individual performers is a puzzling (and serious) editorial quirk; a less damaging omission - but a stumbling block for those not yet initiated into the world of these productions - is the decision to omit a recap of stage action for the opera pictured, which would put these images into some kind of context. Vivid as Ellison's shots of the final act of Samson et Dalila are, readers unfamiliar with bacchanal protocol will be bond to wonder just what the scantily costumed people are up to on pages 116-125. Similarly, the significance of Karita Mattilla's complete lack of costume in Salome might have been explained - or, as the very least, the caution offered that displays such as that on page 193 are not seen regularly at the Met. But Ellison's ability to communicate her own passion for the Met through her photographs - whatever the opera, performer or moment captured - is compelling; the cumulative effect of these images provides a portrait not only of the Met but of one of its greatest fans.E. PAUL DRISCOLL"},{"Title":"In Grand Style: The Glory of the Metropolitan Opera","review":"I purchased this book as a Christmas gift for a friend who thought she knew all there was to know about the opera, being an opera buff for over 50 years.

This book has great pictures which allows you to experience the emotions and especially allows you into the younger generation's point of view. It was a little to broad and seemed to be directed at a younger reading group (12-15 years of age). I am glad I read it, but it is for the beginner in this subject."},{"Title":"Hunting with the microscope","review":"This book has tons of information on how to use the microscope, from beginners to more advanced users. I use this volume as microscopy is a hobby of mine, and also I use our microscope to teach my young children about the world of the small. In the pages of this book you can learn about plants, molds, yeast, bacteria, animal cells, microscopic pond life, how to prepare slides, preparation of cultures, insect life, and this list could go on, it makes science fun for the family. This book is very easy to understand, yet has very detailed information on a variety of subjects, with many drawings and photographs."},{"Title":"Hunting with the microscope","review":"I got my first copy of this book along with my first microscope when I was in elementary school. It started me off a lifelong pursuit of science, both professionally and as an amateur. This is a fantastic book for both the young person interested in biology and the adult with an interest in the natural micro-world."},{"Title":"Excommunication in the Middle Ages","review":"Since first encountering this work during graduate school, I have never seen its topical equal. Vodola ably presents the matter of excommunication from its Old Testament roots through its &quot;high point&quot; during the late medieval Church. Accessible for non-canon lawyers, with plenty of scholarly apparatus for specialists, reading this book was both a personal pleasure and a historian's feast. I have recemmended the book many times over the years. Those who read or consulted it were never disappointed."},{"Title":"Rancour","review":"Lets just say this book is really good. I couldn't put it down... A comtemporary piece, but has all the elements of a classic: werewolves, vampires, terror, courage, romance.... and sex ^^. I didn't really mind the frequent er \\"suggestions\\" towards it, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone overly sensitive.The beauty of the book is of its simplicity of the plot, yet it holds so much depth. The characters are solid, and really seem to breathe. Suspense grips every word. Romance clings on every page... a real piece of ART ^_^.There are a few minor weaknesses though; I find the flashbacks a nuisance sometimes, and there are some parts that aren't exactly perfectly described/ explained very well, but most of the pieces fit in harmony. And the book had too much of a background for such a short story.... and too much suggestive stuffies ^_^. as I said, I personally wasn't bothered by it, but younger kids will shy away.Apart from those minor things, the book is awesome. Buy it, read it, and read it again. 4.7 stars, but rounded up it becomes a nice 5 ^^.lUcAs =P"},{"Title":"Rancour","review":"Rancour. An ancient feud between two races: The werewolf and the vampyre. Two immortals to live forever...even in this world. This is the situation Alix, or Alexandria, finds herself in. A high school girl, about to graduate. Mysterious wolf attacks have also been present and she can't help to wonder why.However, Rellik shows up. He is not as you first expect. But he knows something of Alix and will not leave without it...Very well done MacCann! Wonderful plot and twists. I was hooked! I highly recommed this for someone who likes a good fantasy, but also romance. Charming, it was. Wonderfully thoughful and in depth. It was very well developed.However, I do warn you. Young readers...stay away. There are quite a few references to sex and such. Don't read this novel if you get disturbed about that kind of thing. I found that these certain parts could have been left out. Future advice to you MacCann. A good fantasy doesn't need such intimate situations. Either give a sentence about them or leave them out. Actual description is a big 'no'.Again, well done!

I was so triumphant when I finally found it. I was relieved when I read it after all of these years and still liked the book."},{"Title":"Sports shorts: Astonishing, strange but true (Grosset Sports Library)","review":"In my opinion, one of the most enjoyable areas of light reading is short spots of sports trivia. This book contains 300 of the most unusual events in sports, some well-known yet others almost unknown. All areas of sports are covered, from horse racing to hockey to circus acrobatics.To me, this was a commercial book, one that I read in snippets during television commercials. The facts are fun, always interesting and fodder for discussion among fellow followers of sports."},{"Title":"Take My Rooks","review":"This is a very original book, devoted to just one rare but extraordinary tactical idea - one player sacrifices both his Rooks on the first rank. This sacrifice is extremely uncommon and the resulting positions resemble a world of fantasy where normal chess strategies don't apply. Even so, there are many different and practical tactical tips the reader will find very instructive. This book, containing exciting games with vivid insights, will bring many hours of enjoyment."},{"Title":"I Saw Ramallah","review":"For a person with little exposure to conflict in the Mid-East, this is a very good book. He mentions a couple of wars that I'd never known about because of my age, which sparked interest. But more than that, his emphasis is on the HUMAN ASPECT of these conflicts, which current affair venues skim over. Barghouti mentions the conflicts and assassinations he's seen and felt through his life only as a backdrop to the way the people he knows and loves have been affected.This is not a light read. The author addresses emotionally draining topics. But there was a sense of healing through the journey and resolution of the book, and a universal spirituality that unites humanity. It is a very powerful book.This book was given to me, and I'm very glad because I would never have sought it out on my own. It is a surprising story which tells of pain and loss, and still offers hope."},{"Title":"I Saw Ramallah","review":"I had not heard of Mourid Barghouti before I chanced upon this book in the store, but the names of two people and a place on a beckoning Mediterranean blue cover, was enough stimulus to want to know more. The people - Edward Said and Naguib Mahfouz; the place - Ramallah. It took a couple of days to read and more than measured up to the high expectations raised by the cover.This is not a book that can be slotted with the usual political commentaries that line the shelves. Mourid is first a poet and everything else comes next and this book confirms that. What you will find is a poignant and lyrical description of life as a displaced Palestinian and Barghouti's first hand account, tells of the struggle with a clarity of experience that is sure to shake the most cynical of readers. For, displacement is a journey that threatens with a new reality every day; an insecurity that forces frequent adaptation to its ever-changing circumstances. Situational adjustments are forced out of people for sheer survival and come with potent mixtures of confusion, shame, anger, grief and loneliness. Mourid's journey describes all this and more, compelling a new understanding that is heavy on the soul.The text is interlaced with his translated poetry and in every instance where a poem is used to accentuate sensibilities, the blend with prose is seamless, fluid and successful. Aside from the overall impact of the book, two things that I would like to single out: the powerful metaphorical symbols of the bridge and the swing and the little anecdotes of growing up in Ramallah, the fig tree, Big Uncle Fakhri, Sanduqa bookshop. They left me marveling at the remarkable ability of the people to effect some small stab at normalcy and innocence and Mourid's dogged resolve to document that. Despite the knowledge that every attempt at resurrecting a life out of the debris, every effort at adaptation, will open itself up to a trivialising of the problem and demand a further stretching of the limits of tolerance.There is politics here of course, but it is only directly addressed in the last few pages; everywhere else you will read and see the enormous damage the conflict has wreaked upon an unsuspecting people in daily terms. Buy the book and read it and then, read it again."},{"Title":"I Saw Ramallah","review":"Palestinian poet Mourid Barghouti tells of a brief return to the West Bank where he lived as a boy and now may visit only by permission of the Israeli occupation authority. It is a bittersweet homecoming told with a poet's sensibility, emotions reflected in what seem like fragments of free association, as he remembers the years between 1948 and 1967 and notes the many changes that have taken place during his absence, from the growth of Israeli settlements to the impact of liberation politics on a new generation.Identified as a dissident in the aftermath of 1967, he was expelled from Egypt where he had been a university student, was married and had become a new father. Barghouti has since lived as a displaced person in several different countries, a member of the Palestinian diaspora. He writes of his particular kind of homelessness with poignancy and sharp clarity. Interwoven are accounts of the deaths of friends and his brother Mounif, lost to the dark forces of political strife. Not surprisingly, there is anger, as well, in Barghouti's book. Anyone with an interest in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine would do well to hear him out."},{"Title":"I Saw Ramallah","review":"As a person who has lived in the Middle East for most of my adult life, and someone who has scores of very lovable Arab friends, yet married into a Jewish family with loads of Jewish friends, I was instantly drawn to this book. During these dangerous times, when the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians might well spark devastating nuclear war, it is so important for readers to understand both sides of this issue, for only with knowledge and understanding will this dangerous conflict ever be resolved. With &quot;I Saw Ramallah&quot; I thought about another book, titled &quot;Ester's Child,&quot; which was required reading in a college class, (and many of my classmates agreed it was one of the best books we'd ever read), letting the reader into the lives of the Israelis and the Palestinians, yet inspiring understanding rather than hatred, which most books about these two nationalities do--its as though you are required to be on one side or the other--when instead we need to be on the side of humanity.Now with this very valuable book, the reader comes to feel that he/she has been banned from their own home, and the desolation of the spirit at such a horrifying turn of events is sooooo painful.I wish more people were reading this book. It's a beauty, written by a poet with enormous talent. It makes me wish more than ever that those who have lost their homes, could all return to the days once lived, and that peace would finally come to the land of Israel."},{"Title":"I Saw Ramallah","review":"Although I'm an ardent supporter of Israel, I deliberately picked up this book hoping to better sensitize myself to the enormous pain in the Palestinian community. Mr. Barghuthi's touching personal story did help to achieve that goal.I'm not an educated literary critic, but I found the style and substance of his work to be engaging and difficult to put down. If anything, I concluded my read feeling a strong sense of accessibility in Mr. Barhuthi's personal journey and his humanity. I believe that important because of how penetrating the constant images of violence and suicide bombing are, and how easy it therefore becomes to forget that there are real, human families on the Palestinian side of the conflict.I wouldn't be honest if I didn't make note of the few places in which Mr. Barghuti lashes out at Israel with political comments that seem to ignore or misunderstand the Israeli point of view. I couldn't help but also feel that as a person who grew up under totalitarian Arab regimes, he has a basic misunderstanding of classic, liberal society. I also wondered whether or how much his views might have changed since the time this book was written. Those political interludes are few and far between, though, and not at all the focus of this work, which feels intensely personal and excruciating.I think that all such things deserve a critical eye, but I also believe that anyone deeply interested in this conflict would be well served by reading this touching work."},{"Title":"I Saw Ramallah","review":"The title for my review is Mr. Barghouti's statement throughout his book and obviously of the Palestinian/Israeli conflict that it cannot be simplified. This great Poet's description of life in Palestine before and after his exile allows you to feel his nostalgia. His description of Jersusalem particularly was heartfelt, it allowed me to feel that I was walking with him down the cobbled streets smelling the sweet smells of this troubled walled city, yet, for a change, it is a discription that brings to light a somewhat normal life instead of the troubled life that Palestinians live day to day. In addition, his summary of the Palestinian conflict is symbolized in his description of how the winding roads to Ramallah around Jerusalem do not even allow you to view Jerusalem from your car window. The humour makes this heavy subject bearable, such as the many ways you can describe the word a 'slap in the face'. Read it, read it, read it."},{"Title":"I Saw Ramallah","review":"Mourid Barghouti's vivid memoir was a pleasure to read. &quot;I saw Ramallah&quot; describes the Palestinian-Israeli conflict through the eyes of one of the millions of human beings and families directly affected by the conflict. We learn how the author was exiled because the 1967 war took place while he was studying abroad. We see how he was separated from his wife and kid by a second exile from Egypt due to his &quot;Palestinianness&quot;. We get to cry with him when he hears of his brother's tragic death, also in exile. And we get a taste for his complicated feelings upon seeing his country for the first time in 25 years during the Oslo Peace process.This book truly shows that nothing is simple about the Middle East Conflict. It spares no authority from criticism - not the Palestinian Authority, not the Arab countries, and not Israel. At the same time, the book shows that in fact the Middle East conflict IS simple: we are humans at the base of it. Enjoyable reading, and very thought-provoking."},{"Title":"I Saw Ramallah","review":"For anyone wondering how the livelihoods of normal Palestinians have been impacted by the long conflict in the Middle East, this is essential reading.As a Palestinian, you grow up living several tales similar to the ones you read in this book. And as Palestinians we could not find a more eloquent poet than Barghouti to capture the essence of these tales with all their meaning and put them in a book the whole world could read, understand, and even relate to. I found myself laughing at some of Barghouti's inside family jokes with Americans as well as with my Palestinian grandmother, a distant cousin of Barghouti.Barghouti manages to so eloquently and vividly portray the misery and beauty along with the despair and hope of being Palestinian, and of the eternal Palestinian malaise of being a stranger at home and abroad.If you are thinking of reading ridiculous journalistic trash analyzing Palestinians from the comfort of American colleges like Dershowitz' \\"The Case for Israel;\\" read this book instead and you will actually realize you suddenly understand this conflict.If you are Palestinian, then you must read this book to remind you of the incredible sense of humour, the delicious olive oil, and your family fights that you miss so dearly."},{"Title":"I Saw Ramallah","review":"I love this book! I read it first in the original Arabic and was thrilled to discover that Ahdaf Soueif's masterful translation renders the spirit and the language of Barghouti's prose beautifully. This book has fast become my number one recommendation as an introductory book on the Palestinian experience. Barghouti captures the experiences of exile, occupation, and less than optimal \\"return\\" as no one has before. I know so many fellow Palestinians who have experienced exactly the range of emotion he describes crossing the bridge from Jordan to the occupied West Bank, or receiving that phone call at night in a foreign country, with relatives scattered across the globe. Barghouti's book humanizes Palestinian life in all its complexity, grief, humor, and presents to the reader in sincere and lucid language. This book is a must read for anyone hoping to understand Palestine and the Palestinians."},{"Title":"I Saw Ramallah","review":"Do you want to know the story, suffering, feelings etc. of the Palestinian refugees? You won't find, as far as I know, better than this book to give you the picture. I think it is time for us to realize the misery of these people."},{"Title":"I Saw Ramallah","review":"Thomas Wolfe introduced the subject aphorism into the American language with the publication of his bookYou Can't Go Home Again. It is a bittersweet tale of the lost innocence of a childhood upbringing in Ashville, North Carolina. Wolfe's theme is the disorientation of the aging process: how both the person and the place left behind have \\"moved on\\"; one cannot again place a foot into the same river. But if Wolfe had regrets and remorse, imagine the feelings of a Palestinian, any Palestinian to the loss of his childhood home and surroundings. Mourid Barghouti is not just any Palestinian, but rather one who is a poet and writer, with an eloquent command of the Arabic language which he utilizes to express the far greater dislocation of the Palestinian people; at least a couple magnitudes greater than Wolfe's experience. Certainly the fact that he had no choice in the matter; being barred from his homeland after the 1967 6-day war contributes greatly to his outlook. He was finally allowed to return in 1996, as a result of the Oslo Peace accords, and this book is an account of his moving human odyssey.Barghouti does not view the loss of his homeland with equanimity. The account of his homecoming can be searing, exhibiting a painful edge. For example, early on in his account he says: \\"there is the Israeli flag in the blue of the Nile and the Euphrates with the Star of David between them.\\" Traditionally, that is not the original derivation of the flag's design, but he has chosen to see it through the eyes of the more rigidly Orthodox members of the settler's groups who believe that God gave them all the land between the two rivers, because it says it \\"right here,\\" in the Bible (Torah). Of course, BOTH Jews and Arabs trace descent from Abraham: thus Genesis 15:18 is applicable to both.The author's native village was Deir Ghassanah, just outside Ramallah. He writes that one of the aspects of the Occupation is to ensure that it always remain a village, which is not what the inhabitants wanted in his youth: they wanted it to grow into a city. There is an elegiac quality to his writing as he describes what once was, and juxtaposes it with the present reality in which the inhabitants have no control over their destiny. Consider: \\"What is it that was lost in this that I have found?...It is always the same problem: the problem of stitching two times together. It cannot be done. Time is not a length of calico. Time is a mist that never stops moving. Say you are romantic. Time will coldly discipline you. Time makes us reel with realism.\\"This book was written before the Second Intifada, before 9-11. Hope for a resolution to the seemingly intractable Israeli-Palestinian issue is a most unsubstantial mist in this book. There is even less hope now. Ahdaf Soueif, an excellent author in her own rightThe Map of Love: A Novel, and others, rendered Barghouti's book into stirring English prose. Barghouti's fellow Palestinian, Edward Said, ofOrientalismfame, and much else, wrote the Foreword. Barghouti is a poet, one who has produced a cri de Coeur of Palestinian anguish. Certainly 5-stars."},{"Title":"I Saw Ramallah","review":"I have read a lot of books showing both sides of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. This memoir is one of the best I've seen from the Palestinian point of view. Regardless of where you stand on the issue, it is important to read books like this to gain a greater perspective."},{"Title":"I Saw Ramallah","review":"Mourid Barghouti's vivid memoir was a pleasure to read. \\"I saw Ramallah\\" describes the Palestinian-Israeli conflict through the eyes of one of the millions of human beings and families directly affected by the conflict.

Enjoyable reading, and very thought-provoking."},{"Title":"I Saw Ramallah","review":"In his book I Saw Ramallah, Mourid Barghouti is able to give us a realistic view of what it is like for a refugee. Although he shows the emotion that a Palestinian goes through, he also explains what it is like to feel that you are losing touch with your homeland. Finally, Barghouti makes the struggle more human when he explains it as being a fight of pride. The moment that Barghouti was standing in the Jordanian side and looking at his land, tears welled up into my eyes because he makes his readers feel what it is like to be so close to what you MUST attain and yet so far away."},{"Title":"I Saw Ramallah","review":"This book by Mourid Barghouti captures the spirit of the Palestinian peoples in the poetic glances of one man's journey back to his homeland after exile and during occupation. It is every Palestinian's wish to live, work, play, breathe without the fear of death, torture, constant threats, and imprisonment of the occupation forces. Truly, every Palestinian needs to write their stories for the world to know... as the \\"Logic of Beings\\" indicates in this book. My heart goes out to the Palestinian people after reading such a depiction of unthinkable loss, constant uncertainty, and simple wishes of life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness."},{"Title":"I Saw Ramallah","review":"Mr. Barghouti's tale of returning to his city is interesting, as I soppose it would be itneresting to read the account of a Jew returning to Iraq tro see where he grew up before all Jews were forced to leave Iraq. However Mr. Barghouti makes some major errors in describing the reality. He has obvisouly never travelled to Israel, the country he so abhors and who he blames all his problems on. First of all let us remmemebr that his nostalgia is for pre 1967 Palestine, a place where women could not vote and only rich landed gentry, like Mr. Barghouti could vote.His Mr. Barghouti is for a Jerusalem where Jews could not pray at their holy site and where Christians were forced to teacht he Koran half the day in school. His nostalgia is for a country where Jordanian curfews kept people inside most of the time and where Jordanian army troops occupied every inch of the countryside, wher emost villages had no water, no electricity or sanitary services. Of course Mr. Barghouti is nostalgic for this society for was one where he and his clan made up a small elite of the five or six families who controlled Ramallah and Jerusalem. His nostalgia is like what a Russian nobleman felt after the rise of Communism.This poetic, well written book is disengenous for it harkens back to a world where the poor had no agency where women had no rights and where his land was occupied by simply a different foreign power. Although many of his generation still retain framed pictures of the late King Hussein on their walls, it is a fake image, an image of self rule that never existed, an image of a perfect society that only the Palestinian bourgousie could tell.Seth J.

I was one of those guys who thought that it was up to mothers to drive their kids back and forth to and from sports, pack snacks and fundraise but that was about it. After reading Home Team Advantage, I realized I was dead wrong: there is a whole lot moms can and should be doing beyond simply chauffeurs; that perhaps if we included womens's perspective, our kids would be having more fun playing sports. I am the director of a youth football league and will encourage all of the coaches to read this book-- simply put it is a blueprint for a succesful season."},{"Title":"Home Team Advantage","review":"We all hear about the sports moms who spend most of their time chasing after and picking up their kids. But what IS the role of all those mothers of kids in youth sports?In HOME TEAM ADVANTAGE: THE CRITICAL ROLE OF MOTHERS IN YOUTH SPORTS, Brooke de Lench looks beyond the minivan-chauffeuring, frazzled women behind children's athletics. In this culmination of experience and research, de Lench examines everything from when to register kids for sports to how to handle bad coaching situations.This wonderful resource is divided into three major sections: \\"Part I: The Role of Sports Mothers in the Family\\"; \\"Part II: Sports Mothers, Coaches, and Other Parents\\"; and \\"Part III: What Mothers Can Do to Reform Youth Sports.\\"Part I steps mothers through the process of getting children started in sports. Knowing what sport(s) to register your child in is just as important as determining a good age to begin. Also discussed are differences between boys and girls, the need for balancing family schedules, preventing abuse, and dealing with injuries and injury prevention.Part II addresses the ever-growing concerns over abusive coaches and parents, as well as ways to handle such situations.Part III gives great tips for mothers (and fathers) to advocate for their kids. Mothers can and should take active roles in their kids' sports. Besides driving and providing snacks, there are many more ways to contribute, even if a mom is a busy professional.The material in this book is concise and well written. Some themes are repeated throughout the book, but these are important ideas that cannot be expressed enough (such as whether the kids are having fun, safety, and so on).While this book is directed at mothers, this is a valuable resource that all parents of youth athletes should have, and it should be required reading for coaches and staff. Do not miss out on Brooke de Lench's wonderful contribution to the world of youth sports.Reviewed by Christina Wantz Fixemer9/26/2006"},{"Title":"Home Team Advantage","review":"I heard author De Lench talking on NPR national radio last week about this book and all of the work she has done (is doing) with preventing catastrophic injuries and death of kids in youth sports. I had no idea what I was in store for when I read the book. In fact her advice may just save my kids lives. And, the chapter on Preventing Child Abuse in youth sports is another must read. Again, I now know that the hollering that one coach does to my 6 year old and his team mates is downright abuse. Better yet, I know (from her lessons) how to advocate for my kids to keep them emotionally safe and physically sound. I found her chapter on how to start a new team to be FABULOUS! Bravo-De Lench-You go girl! Kids were being excluded so she rallied her parent pals and started their own all-inclusive group with rules that we all would die for--no bad mouthing eachother, open dialog with the coaches, all kids play the same amount of time (coaches kids included), etc.The chapter on Politics is a must read! And, the one on parenting/coaching girls and theother on how to parent boy athletes is very interesting.The only folks who won't love this book are the bad coaches who are nervous that we all will become so well educated that they may lose their coaching jobs."},{"Title":"Home Team Advantage","review":"As a mother of two sports-active children and a school nurse my reaction after reading this book was, \\"It's about time!\\" First, it is the first sports parenting book I have read written by a mother specifically for sports mothers. Second, no other book of its kind is as well-researched (just one look at the twenty-page long bibliography shows that the author has really done her homework!). Third, it is covers all the bases and discusses all the hot button issues (cutting, elite teams, early specialization, how to talk to a coach etc.). It gives moms practical advice in clear, concise, easy-to-read terms on how to make her child's sports experience safe and fun-filled (as a nurse, I was particularly impressed with the chapter on safety). But, fourth, and most importantly, it looks at the crisis in youth sports - the win-at-all costs attitude, the cutthroat competition for spots on elite and high school teams, the epidemic of overuse injuries, the rising tide of physical, emotional and sexual abuse of youth athletes - in a new way. Instead of seeing parents as the problem, de Lench sees parents, particularly mothers, as the solution. She argues, convincingly in my view, that if more mothers were coaches, more mothers were on boards of directors, the culture of youth sports would change for the better. This book just may be the \\"Call to Arms\\" that sports mothers need."},{"Title":"Home Team Advantage","review":"This book is a \\"must read\\" for any parent whose child is involved in youth sports at any level. It is really like a survival guide and was full of some great advice and ideas that made alot of sense. It makes life easier too when you know that you are not alone in a particular situation, as there obviously needs to be some serious reform in high school sports in my opinion. Ms. de Lench deserves alot of praise for tackling this difficult issue head on and gives many of us parents out there a much needed voice!!"},{"Title":"Home Team Advantage","review":"i got this for my wife. she is already very involved and i thought this would do 2 things; confirm her hard work and appreciation from both our kids and their teammates, myself and other parents by showing how important she is; and possibly give her some additional ideas and support from other moms who put so much time and energy into their kids activities (not limited to sports but things like band, scouts, and other things). we are already doing a lot of things in the book and it is nice to see that she is contributing to the lives of not just our kids, but many others. this would be a great book for someone with small children just getting into sports or other activites to give some insight on what to really expect as far as time and committment, but also what a truly important role you can play in the developement of your children. you can't beat the price and it shipped very quick."},{"Title":"Home Team Advantage","review":"As a professional who has worked with hundreds of youth athletes, I can tell you that there is much more than what meets the eye in your child's participation in sports. The author leaves nothing out and has filled out my knowledge of what a young athlete goes through, how they think, and how we as adults can best help them use sports as a vehicle for growth and learning.I have read a lot of books in this genre and Home Team Advantage is by far my favorite.

I say, supposed, because I cannot believe that a REAL priest would condone such blasphemies!This alleged priest says that Mary Magdalene was the First Lady of the Christian Community and the Model of the Church. Get real! Those titles apply to our Blessed Mother, Mary, the mother of Jesus, not Mary Magdalene! So much for his knowledge!The Holy Grail, Mary Magdalene!

This woman has never been identified and is not Mary Magdalen:Matthew 26:7a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table.(Whole Chapter: Matthew 26 In context: Matthew 26:6-8)Mark 14:3While he was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the home of a man known as Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head.(Whole Chapter: Mark 14 In context: Mark 14:2-4)Luke 7:37When a woman who had lived a sinful life in that town learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume,(Whole Chapter: Luke 7 In context: Luke 7:36-38)The only history any where about Mary Magdalen involved in the anointment of Jesus is at the Tomb:Mark 16The Resurrection1When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus' body.This brings questionable validity to her discovery which is unfortunate because I do believe there is proof that a very deep relationship existed between Jesus and Mary."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"I really love that Ms. Starbird has done so much reasearch on Mary Magdalene.

IF A is true2. And if B is true3. Then C must be true4. Therefore D is true.In \\"IF books\\", the statements in Steps 1 and 2 are almost always true. The \\"sleight of hand\\" comes as we move on to Step 3 in the process, which is nothing more than an unsupported extrapolation from Steps 1 and 2. And since the veracity of the statement in Step 4 depends on Step 3, there is actually no reason to suppose that either of the last two statements is true, even though it LOOKS as though they were arrived at by the use of logic.For example, Ms Starbird cites Jesus' instruction to Mary Magdalene after his resurrection, in John's gospel, when Jesus tells Mary not to touch Him. According to Ms Starbird, what Jesus really meant was \\"do not cling to me.\\"On the basis of this unsupported reasoning she then goes on to claim that this proves they were married.In other words, by means of the distorted syllogism ploy:1. If John's gospel says that there was a meeting in the cemetary between Jesus and Mary (true)2. And if it says that Jesus commanded Mary not to try to \\"touch\\" him (true)3. Then Jesus \\"must\\" really have meant \\"don't cling to me\\" (no supporting evidence)4. Therefore Jesus and Mary \\"must\\" have been married (pure speculation which LOOKS as though it follows logically from statements 1 and 2, but which ACTUALLY relies entirely on the unsupported ALLEGATION in step 3).The tenuous basis for this line of argument is that the original Greek phrase has three meanings: \\"To touch\\", \\"To hold on\\", \\"To embrace\\". Ms Starbird presumably supposes that the correct translation of the phrase in this passage is \\"embrace\\" - but on what basis?There are four different Greek phrases meaning \\"touch\\" which are used in the New Testament - and three of them are used only once.This most common phrase is used 36 times, including passages such as:\\"touched the hem of his garment\\"\\"If I may just touch his clothes\\"\\"he came and touched the coffin\\" and\\"he touched his ear and healed him.\\"Does it really make sense to translate these passages using Ms Starbird's translation, which would give the readings:\\"clung to the hem of his garment\\"?\\"If I may just cling to his clothes\\"?\\"he came and clung to the coffin\\"? or\\"he clung to his ear and healed him.\\"?As a matter of fact, out of these 36 passages, these is only ONE example of the phrase being used in a way that clearly refers to the intimate way a husband and wife would touch each other.Looks like pretty flimsy \\"evidence\\" to me.As to the claim that Ms Starbird is a \\"pre-eminent theologian\\", when an American TV show ran an item on Ms Starbird's claims and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" (which deals with the same theme), Professor Darrell Bock, who teaches New Testament studies at Dallas Theological Seminary, totally rebuffed the idea that Jesus and Mary were married, saying that Mary Magdalene's move to touch Jesus was nothing more sensational than \\"her single act of devotion, given to him without concern about what people are thinking about what she's doing.\\" The show's presenter admitted that the majority of biblical scholars consulted for the program agreed with Professor Bock's assessment.So, if you're not to worried about the use of illogical \\"logic\\", and you prefer to have your Bible stories sexed up and sensationalised, this may well be the book for you.If, on the other hand, you prefer at least a modicum of intellectual rigor, you'll likely find a whole host of books far more worthy of your attention."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"I have always found that there is definite mystery to the Kingdom of God.

Starbird's definition of Mary's (BVM that is, not Mary Magdalene) Immaculate Conception is that Mary's parents didn't sin in the act of conceiving her. First, as warped as the Catholic church is about sex, it does not consider procreational sex a sin. What the Immaculate Conception actually means is that Mary was conceived with original sin on her soul. As fascinating as I found this book, because of that gigantic error, I have to question almost everything else in it. Another mistake she made was calling Jesus \\"Jesus of Nazareth.\\" She uses \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\" as a major source of her research, yet in that book, the authors explain how and why that title is erroneous.

Even in grade school, I intuitively felt an urge to question it while my parents insisted the family attend church every week. Yet I never questioned that Jesus was a great spiritual master. Margaret Starbird's scholarly, yet unconventional treatment of the historical role Mary Magdalen played in the life of Jesus is both refreshing and fascinating.The book is a detailed study of the early Christian heretics, and an exploration of how their knowledge and traditions were kept secret and handed down through time in art and symbolism. One of the most important points about heresy she makes is this: \\"The question of heresy does not hinge on truth, but rather whether or not the doctrine is in line with the official statement of the faith.\\" Then she goes on to provide dozens of correlations between ancient scripture, medieval art, pagan traditions, matriarchal cultures, sexual symbolism, the inquisition, the templars, gypsies, Dead Sea scrolls, tarot cards and even unicorns to support the idea that Mary Magdalen may have been married to Jesus and carried his child. The idea is that Mary herself is the Holy Grail, the vessel that carried the \\"blood of Christ\\", and that she disappeared (fled) soon after his crucifixion.Anyone with an interest in Christian spirituality in its more mystical form will find this book fascinating. The only thing I found challenging was in trying to keep up with the author's vast knowledge of historical information, mythology and the secret teachings of the gnostics. I've read a fair amount on all of these subjects, yet often found myself struggling to follow her. It may simply be that the details were so broad and far-reaching, that a comprehensive look at all the ideas she included in her book would have made it too long. The tone of the writing seems to assume the reader already has a pretty strong background in the areas she covers.For example, she sometimes discusses medieval art but without the appropriate illustrations to accompany the text, it is difficult to relate to it. There is a group of colored medieval art illustrations in the center of the book, but they are not dated or related to the information in the book in any more than an indirect way. We are left to guess what symbolic imagery inspired her to place them there.Still, the book is full of interesting facts and folklore, and the author's knowledge is impressive. Personally though, I often wonder why people get so hung up on trying to prove or disprove spiritual traditions. As Margaret Starbird says herself in chapter 6: \\"The heretics did not simply believe a creed; they lived a life of personal encounter with God.\\" So call me a heretic."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"I suppose, as with so many books on Mary Magdalene (which naturally have to include Jesus), one has to make assumptions. Most of those assumptions are not ours, but have been dripped into our ears since we were way too young to judge for ourselves. So by the time we do grow old enough to ask questions, so many have already been answered for us by others. Just as they have had their questions answered by those who came before them. What we have then, is a world of inherited assumptions. Few break out of this. Most stop asking when they're assured they have their answers. This is how religions work. As humans, we tend to hang with those whose assumptions most closely resemble our own. Catholics with Catholics, Pagans with Pagans, teenagers with teenagers, golfers with golfers, ad infinitum.But I've just read something that made my hair stand on end...and not only because its assumptions were also mine. Ki Longfellow's \\"The Secret Magdalene\\" made me look at all my old assumptions all over again. Who was Mary Magdalene? What was important about her? Was it merely because she was female and therefore the Bride of Christ? If so, once again, MM's importance depends so much on her gender...not on her actual being, her mind, her thought, her influence on Jesus.Now reading Margaret Starbird's assumptions, steeped in, I think, kabbala, I can admire them, follow them, and even enjoy them. But I don't share them. Not exactly. Margaret stays firmly in the Bride camp, assuming marriage, assuming children, even noting that her assumptions might be merely in the powerful world of myth...but still, once, now, and always, the Magdalene is only a wife and a mother. I understand symbolically that \\"giving birth\\" is creation. But I want more. I want a female hero, a goddess, who speaks for my need to \\"know.\\" I want to hear of mysteries denied us. I'm no longer satisfied with the woman who gets to give birth to a \\"god's\\" child. What I really want is more like \\"The Secret Magdalene.\\""},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"I bought this book with great hope, because I had heard that it was a literate book, written by a scholar.What I heard was wrong.Unfortunately, most of Ms. Starbird's references are, at best, tertiary -- meaning that they are survey books which rely on other people's works, which in turn are based on other people's or, perhaps, original sources. In the case of this book, her references are, at best, based on books that rely on other books; and sometimes, she has relied on materials that are completely devoid of knowledge of her subject.Her knowledge of history is poor. Many times the circumstances of which she writes are misinterpreted and other times the information is just plain wrong. Witness Ms. Starbird's discussions of what historians call the \\"Courtly Love,\\" which she changes from a pleasant game developed in Eleanor of Acquitaine's court into a celebration of Mary Magdalen which is contributed to by King Rene, three centuries later. This bodes ill for her theory, since it is a critical leg. She makes other errors regarding about the beliefs of an alternate religion to Christianity, the Cathars (or Albigensians or sometimes Gnostics) for which they were persecuted during the Albigensian Crusade soon after the death of Eleanor and her son, Richard the Lion-Heart. Further, she claims that this incident happened in the eleventh century when, in fact, the Crusade occurred from 1209 to 1255 (not all crusades were pressed against the Muslims). Much of her misinformation, in fact, can be confirmed and/or refuted by simple searches of the Web.The author also depends heavily on Baigent, et al's Holy Blood, Holy Grail. This book depends on the _Dossiers Secret_, which the authors believe must be taken on faith, since it just suddenly turned up in the French National archives, with no information of who put it there or when, as well as information on the sources of the information contained in it. While this might be considered as a decent source for _The DaVinci Code_ (which is was), it is not a source for a scholarly discussion of a fascinating topic.I am quite willing to take some things on faith -- I have long believed in the theory of the Magdalen-as-Grail. Unfortunately, with its historical errors and misconceptions, this book does poor service to that theory."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"Let me start this out by saying that i heard about this book while watching a special on Discovery channel about Mary Magdalene. I loved The Da Vinci Code, so i thought i would give this book a try. I was super impressed with the amount of research Starbird did for this book, and i was surprised to find that she had begun her research as a devout Catholic trying to debunk and disprove the grail heresy. She found an overwhelming amount of evidence supporting the theory that Mary Magdalene was the wife of Jesus and the mother of his child. I was fascinated with all the facts and evidence she uncovered throughout her research, and she made the truth so obvious it's a wonder none of us have seen it before. I would recommend this book to anyone who wholly and completely believes what is hand-fed to you in church. It gives a different perspective on what was, and makes you extremely sad when you realize that this Lost Bride, this holy woman has been pegged as a prostitute barely worth mentioning, for centuries. Starbird shows connections to the grail heresy through paintings, tapestries, and even the tarot cards. I highly recommend this book, both as a Christian, and as someone who is searching for the truth. Mary Magdalene's story must be heard, and the lost feminine recaptured- for the betterment of all mankind"},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"First things first. The author states very clearly that she knows she cannot \\"prove\\" anything with this book, other than to show that the Mary Magdelen as Holy Grail heresy was historically known and practiced as a kind of alternative to orthodox Christianity. On that count, I think she does a pretty good job.This book has a lot of bits I consider odd (such as noting that certain names are anagrams or inverse of other names/words), and several interesting but strange detours (sacred geometry? Roma legends about how the placement of cathedrals in France as a mirror image of the constellation Virgo?), and some of the inferences and connections the author draws do seem tenuous, but the overall scholarship and actual research seems fairly solid. I do feel that some of her assumptions are questionable, but I have done some followup independent research of my own, and so far I haven't found any glaring errors in her historical work (though I admit, I've only checked up on facts that struck me as especially strange or unsupported).As far as taking the material in this book as some sort of historical truth, well, truth is in the eye of the beholder, and history is, when all is said and done, a matter of consensus. Clearly, Margaret Starbird believes that this literally unorthodox story/myth is valid as a belief system (she believes it is \\"true\\", whatever \\"true\\" is supposed to mean in this context), but ultimately, faith in the Magdalen-as-Holy-Grail is going to be up to the reader. This \\"Jesus was human and had a wife and child\\" story has, certainly, been around for a long, long time (well before Baigent and Lee tackled it inHoly Blood and the Holy Grail, which is the book which sparked Margaret Starbird's quest to disprove the heresy). You can take the story as gospel or you can take it as just an interesting alternative myth/story or you can take it as a dreadful heresy that should be dismissed with contempt, or you can just take it as a curious story told from bits and pieces of history.Personally, I enjoy mythology of all kinds, and I particularly enjoy examining the history of Christianity in all its forms. Orthodoxy is the one that \\"won out\\", but Christianity has a rich and diverse history with all kinds of divergent beliefs streams and worldviews and I find it all very interesting. This book was, for me, good food for thought and a very solid look into an alternative storyline/mythology, and that's exactly what I was looking for, so it works for me."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"According to the back cover of this book \\"Margaret Starbird's theological beliefs were profoundly shaken when she read Holy Blood, Holy Grail, a book that dared to suggest that Jesus Christ was married to Mary Magdalen and that their descendants carried on his holy bloodline in Western Europe. Shocked by such heresy, this Roman Catholic scholar set out to refute it, but instead found new and compelling evidence for the existence of the bride of Jesus\\".Having read Holy Blood Holy Grail and, subsequently, this book, I can say quite determinedly that this book engrossed and captivated me much more than HBHG. First of all, Starbird's writing style is much easier to handle than the one employed in HBHG. In fact, the first 25 pages read like literary fiction with Mary Magdalene being shocked that she has produced a daughter, not a son.I loved everything about this book. The notion of the sacred feminine itself interests me a great deal and this book has handled the subject in a lucid and comfortable manner. In fact, another bookThe Rozabal Linehas taken the Starbird notion one step further by establishing a connection between \\"the sacred feminine\\" and the \\"divine feminine trinity\\" of Eastern tradition."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"Margaret Staribird decided to write this book after reading &quot;The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail&quot;.

Seeking to understand their relationship is worth the effort. This book will not help, though. Read this book only for cautionary purposes.This is not a scholarly book. It tries to do many thing, but fails to penetrate deeply into any. For a better encounter with mystic grail followers, see Umberto Eco's &quot;Foucault's Pendulum&quot;.

To meet Mary herself, see LeLoup's &quot;The Gospel of Mary Magdalene&quot;.Starbird describes Mary Magdalene as a rather inert object of Christ's libidinal passions. Mary never speaks directly in this book. She acts as sublime priestess of matrimonial ritual, but she only acts out the dance others created. She carries/nurtures the seed of Christ, but whatever that involved, StarBird never personalizes. In the end, we are left with something of an argument for divine-right political legitimacy. The patrimony of David is highly exalted here.Rather than illuminating anything Jesus or Mary Magdalene said while walking this earth, as lovers or otherwise, Starbird shoehorns the couple into the mold of ancient Egyptian and Babylonian magic. Starbird keeps her two lovers silent. It is much easier to keep the revolutionaries under control that way. Starbird is advocating the most conservative of views: Let us return to the rites of the Pharohs, all that was important was known to them.

Starbird delves deep into the myth of the Holy Grail and presents evidence supporting her theory that the Holy Grail was Mary Magdalene and the royal bloodline she fostered through the children she produced through her marriage to Jesus Christ. Starbird's arguments are very compelling and she backs up her claims through some extremely intriguing ways (art, literature, watermarkings, localized custom, etc.). It's also interesting to note that Starbird set out to prove this theory false and ended up a believer."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"Is it possible that Jesus could have been married and conceived children?This is the question at the center of most of the controversy around The Woman With The Alabaster Jar, which provided the impetus for the Da Vinci Code phenomenon. Entire television documentaries have been devoted to examining the relationship between Jesus and Mary Magdalene. I will not spend too much time here trying to refute this outrageous claim, but a few points ought to be considered.1. Mary Magdalene was not the woman with the alabaster jar! This was Mary of Bethany the sister of Lazarus. Right away, the so-called scholarship of Margaret Starbird is suspect. Has she even read the biblical texts? In the four canonical Gospels, several prominent woman are mentioned among Jesus' disciples. Mary of Bethany, the sister of Lazarus, is more prominent than Mary Magdalene. John chapter 11 tells the story of Lazarus who was raised from the dead by Jesus. In verse five we are told, \\"Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister, and Lazarus\\" (John 11:5). In all of the New Testament, Mary and Martha of Bethany are mentioned as the only women disciples whom Jesus loved. Mary of Bethany is also identified as the woman who \\"took a pound of very costly oil of spikenard, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair\\" (John 12:3) in order to prepare Him for the crucifixion. One could just as easily concoct another conspiracy theory involving Mary of Bethany. Yet Holy Blood, Holy Grail and The Da Vinci Code rely on a few obscure passages from the Gnostic Gospels to claim that it was Mary Magdalene who was loved by Jesus \\"more than all the disciples.\\" And therefore, in a quantum leap of logic, Mary Magdalene must have been his wife.2. Many of Jesus immediate family are mentioned in the New Testament. James and Jude, authors of the two general epistles were both called brothers of the Lord; John the Baptist was his cousin; John's parents were Elizabeth and Zechariah; and several of Jesus' siblings are mentioned as part of the so-called Holy Family. In Matthew 13:55,56, when Jesus teaches in his home country of Galilee, the people hearing him are astonished and ask: \\"Is this not the carpenter's son? Is not His mother called Mary? And His brothers James, Joses, Simon, and Judas? And his sisters, are they not all with us?\\" (Matthew 13:55,56). It is unlikely that if so many immediate family members are mentioned in scripture, that someone as important as a wife would be left out.3. One might counter that the Catholic Church wanted to cover-up evidence against the celibacy of Jesus, and decided to suppress the fact that Jesus was married. But if so, they also would have suppressed the the fact that Jesus had brothers and sisters since it contradicts the life-long celibacy of Mary, the mother of Jesus - another Roman Catholic teaching - one so universal in the history of the church, by the way, that it was also held by Protestants such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, John Zwingli and John Wesley. Yet the scripture mentioning Jesus' brothers and sisters was not removed from the text of the New Testament.4. Eusebius, the fourth century church historian wrote that at the time of Jesus birth in the year 4 B.C.... there had been kept in the archives up to that time the genealogies of the Hebrews as well as of those who traced their lineage back to proselytes, such as Achior the Ammonite and Ruth the Moabitess, and to those who were mingled with the Israelites and came out of Egypt with them.Eusebius goes on to mention that King Herod, and the first king of Judea not of Hebrew descent, had the genealogical records burned. But a few Jews, even in the time of Eusebius writing in the fourth century, had kept careful records of their lineage. He goes on to write that some of these were Christians who claimed lineage from the family of Jesus.... among these are those already mentioned, called Desposyni, on account of their connection with the family of the Savior. Coming from Nazara and Cochaba, villages of Judea, into other parts of the world, they drew the aforesaid genealogy from memory, and from the book of daily records as faithfully as possible.Nowhere in Eusebius or in any other record up until this time, including the Gnostic writings, is there any mention of direct descendants of Jesus.5. Finally, there is a bride of Christ mentioned in the book of Revelation. One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues, came to me and talked with me, saying, Come, I will show you the bride, the Lambs wife (Revelation 21:9). John then sees in a vision the city of Jerusalem, a type of the church, coming down from heaven. While scripture promises that the victorious and risen Christ will one day wed a spotless bride in the form of spiritual Israel, the Church, Margaret Starbird imagines an earthly Jesus joined to a woman in the flesh. While Jesus did live on earth as a flesh and blood man, the marriage supper of the Lamb described in the book of Revelation tells us who the bride of Christ truly is."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"In order to believe Starbird's contentions, you have to assume that not only the Gospels were written much later than most Bible scholars now admit, you also have to assume the Pauline letters were written hundreds of years after Jesus' death.That simply won't fly. Everyone agrees that Paul wrote his letters between 50 and 60 AD. But if the Pauline letters are authentic (and no one says they aren't), then Mary Magdelene could NOT have been married to Jesus. Steve Kellmeyer's &quot;Fact and Fiction in the Da Vinci Code&quot; (0971812861)uses precisely this argument to demolish the substance of Starbird's basic argument. The rest of Starbird's book is equally silly bunkum, destroyed by a few simple indisputable and undisputed facts. If you want to know the history, instead of the fantasy, abandon Starbird and start reading Kellmeyer."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"The book is an exponent of Starbird's feminist theory. The reason the book has been well received is because the subject is taboo although not new. It is also a great source of revenues.Many other authors have presented the same idea in more eloquent terms. Her writing is one of fragmented thoughts put together and repetition of ideas.Despite the fact that the book begins very nicely it goes downhill after the first chapter. Those of us that have closely studied the makings of the Catholic Church find the book a weak proponent of a theory without actual support. Hence, the proof provided is weak, vague, and has no merit."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"One of the reviews refers to Starbird as a &quot;preeminant theologian and New Testament scholar.&quot; On what planet? I promise you not a single Theologian or New Testament scholar of any merit even knows who this woman is. Not because some evil church empire is suppressing the knowledge; rather, her work is fantasy. If you just read the Da Vinci Code and think this is some kind of scholarly backing and you've never read any real scholarship in the field then I sympathize with you for being duped.

It tells the story of the lost Bride and provides strong evidence for the sacred marriage at the heart of Christianity, that of Jesus and Mary Magdalen.It is significant that all four Gospels record the anointing of Jesus by a woman with an alabaster jar of aromatic nard. In middle-eastern liturgical practices surrounding the ancient rites of the &quot;sacred marriage&quot; the anointing of the sacrificed bridegroom/king was a sacred ceremony reserved to his bride. The Gospel narratives describe the pre-nuptial anointing of Jesus by the woman with the alabaster jar and contain other elements from this ancient ritual.On seven of eight New Testament lists of the women who walked with Jesus, Mary Magdalen's name is mentioned first on the list. She was clearly &quot;first lady&quot; in the eyes of the early Christian community. Some early Church theologians identified the Magdalen as the model of &quot;church&quot; (ekklesia) whom Christ &quot;loved so much, that He gave his life for her.&quot;More compelling facts from Scripture and history are included in Margaret Starbird's work. She follows a trail of evidence that leads through Egypt, to the south of France, and into important historical events in Europe.Most significant is the medieval legend of the Holy Grail (sangraal), which secretly celebrated Mary Magdalen as the Bride of Christ. The &quot;sangraal&quot; is the &quot;sacred blood&quot; -- the royal lineage of Jesus. Because the legend of the Holy Grail contained and preserved the truth about Mary Magdalen, it was ruthlessly suppressed by the Inquisition. In an effort to discount her significance, Mary Magdalen was labeled a prostitute, but she was really the &quot;Beloved&quot; -- the bride of Jesus.Restoring the sacred union of Jesus and Mary Magdalen to the heart of our Christian story provides us with a model of holiness based on the sacred union of the masculine and the feminine. It affirms the true holiness and significance of women as PARTNERS in the future practice of our Roman Catholic tradition.I have talked with Margaret Starbird. When she embarked on her research, her intent was to disprove the possibility of Jesus' marriage, but the facts led her in a surprising new direction that provides a wonderful healing message for us all.The Woman With The Alabaster Jar provides the facts and history that will explain why women hold the key to many of the problems faced today by our Roman Catholic Church.Father John Shuster, Roman Catholic Priest"},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"In her beautiful book THE WOMAN WITH THE ALABASTER JAR Margaret Starbird lays out a compelling case for seeing Mary Magdalen as the \`lost bride' of Jesus. Whether you believe the Jesus story was a historical event or is a myth, if you have an interest in the Grail and/or symbolism, you will want to read this book.Apparently, many Europeans, especially in France (Provence) believe(d) the Magdalen escaped Jerusalem after her husband Jesus was executed. Eventually, she traveled to what is today Marseilles, where every year, the local people celebrate her arrival on the Magdalen's feast day. The \`fathers' of orthodox Christianity were so appalled by the notion that Jesus might have had sex and produced a child let alone married the Magdalen who some how or another became linked with prostitution, that beginning in the 4th Century the church attempted to squelch the \\"heresy\\". By the Middle Ages, the church had instituted the Inquisition.However, the harder the Inquisitors pressed \\"heretics\\" like the Cathars, the more clever they became at disguising their truth. Using European fairy tales, water marks on paper printed during the Middle Ages (and frequently found in bibles!!), and paintings of the Masters like Fra Angelico, Starbird shows how the message of the heretics was hidden in plain sight. She suggests that even the Tarot cards which appeared in Italy just after the \\"last\\" Cathar was hunted down in Spain, may have been a condensed heretical catechism.Ever wonder why some of Botticelli's \`Madonnas' are dressed in red when the Roman church instructed artists to depict the Madonna in blue and white? Did you know a branch of the US Army wears the insignia of the Magdalen on it's uniform, and celebrates a dance ball every year on the feast day of saint whose likeness to the Magdalen is uncanny? Do you know why the \`Little Mermaid' is named Ariel, and Snow White \\"died\\" from a poison apple (went to sleep)? Did you know Cinderella may be related to the \`Black Madonnas' of Europe including one venerated by Pope John Paul?Starbird says she set out several years ago to refute the \\"heresy\\" she discovered in HOLY BLOOD HOLY GRAIL by Baignent, et al. and discovered not only were these authors onto something there was a whole lot more to share. This is a wonderful, provocative book."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"The author presents a chain of indirect proofs to support her belief that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalen. She states that this is a tenet of heresy widely believed in the Middle Ages; that fossils of the heresy can be found in numerous works of art and literature; that it was vehemently attacked by the hierarchy of the established Church of Rome and that it survived in spite of relentless persecution.This book is a courageous exploration of an extremely delicate question. Mary Magdalen is called a penitent prostitute by the Church. The original story of the anointing of Jesus at Bethany by the woman with the alabaster jar may have been misinterpreted by the author of Luke's Gospel since the anointing was similar to the familiar ritual practice of a sacred priestess or temple &quot;prostitute&quot; in the Goddess clults of the Roman Empire.Mrs. Starbird does an excellent job of researching european history, heraldry, the rituals of Freemasonry, medieval art, symovlism, psychology mythology, religion and the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures to discover that the meaning of the Holy Grail could be the lost bride of Jesus and the female child she carried within her."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"Despite the ecclesiastical criticisms leveled against them by so-called Christians, Starbird and Sweeney do an excellent job documenting their assertions in this splendid work of historical reconstruction -- scholarship, I might add, that is supported by several other notable authors and historians. This is not merely some insane theory conjured up by someone with an axe to grind against the Vatican. The authors share several brilliant insights with the reader that are truly inspired and speak to some of those long-unanswerable questions of history. Of course, no one can know the COMPLETE and TRUE story that is the legacy of the Magdalen, but these authors and others like them at least have the courage to make what information they have uncovered available to the masses despite the Church's long history of silence, secrecy, suppression and outright deception. I say, &quot;Bravo!&quot; and &quot;Well done!&quot; AND, I've ordered a second copy of this book to pass around among my family and friends.Mary Magdalen, if returned to her proper and rightful place in history, could be viewed by the Church as a powerful role model, for women as well as for men. Instead, many prefer to continue to believe a politically-motivated, misogynistic lie and portray her as a weak, repentant whore, which is anathema to those of us -- including many well-educated and enlightened Christians -- who know in our hearts what she represents. It's time to return the sacred feminine to its rightful place in Western society. Thanks to Starbird, Sweeney and other authors like them, we can begin that long journey home."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"This is a very good book. The author draws heavily on Holy Blood, Holy Grail for her factual data in addition to her own research, but she makes her point more clearly and The Woman With The Alabaster Jar is much more readable. Holy Blood, Holy Grail contains more dense verbiage, and the authors develop their facts and surmises slowly and their themes very carefully, item by item. It gets tedious at times. Not so with Margaret Starbird. She comes right out with it.The thrust of both books is that Yeshua bar Yosef (better known by his Greek name, Jesus) was married to Miriam of Bethany (better known as Mary Magdalene) and sired a daughter by her. After his crucifizion, Mary moved to Egypt where her child, Sarah, was born, and then to Provence on the Mediterranean coast of France.The Catholic church tried to stamp out and eradicate the idea that Mary and Jesus were married and had a child because it threatened their orthodox views, and murdered 15,000 people in the Provence area in their effort, who believed the fact that Mary and Jesus had started a bloodline which survives yet. In the Inquisition, many thousands more were killed for the same reason: their &quot;heresy,&quot; in the eyes of the church.The theory is that the organizations known as the Knights Templar and the Priory of Sion protected the secret genealogy of the holy bloodline, and the proofs of the sang raal (holy blood, which became known as the Holy Grail).Starbird and the three authors of Holy Blood, Holy Gail make a plausible case--even a convincing one.These hypotheses were the background for the recent best-seller, The Da Vinci Code, by Dan Brown, who also drew heavily on Holy Blood, Holy Grail for his fictional mystery.The research is very thorough, although there is clearly much persuasive speculation involved.I do not recommend this book for orthodox Christians who are convinced that the Bible, as they know it, is the inspired word of God and not to be questioned. This is a book better suited to people with a background in religious history, who are familiar with the Council of Nicaea and its activities, and the part played by Constantine and Theodocius in suppressing the so-called &quot;heretical&quot; gospels and other writings that were denied entry in the canon of scripture, and the editing, deletions and additions made to those that were included.It is not clear that the truth of the matter is portrayed in these books, but it is quite clear that there is much evidence to support their plausibility. On balance, this is a more likely story than the virgin birth or resurrection of the dead, as portrayed in the orthodox version of the Bible.Joseph (Joe) Pierreauthor of The Road to Damascus: Our Journey Through Eternityand other books"},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"Margaret Starbird is a preeminent Theologian and scholar of the New Testament and related literature and a leader of American and international culture.

What we need more of, are books like this one; what we need less of, is dogma!"},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"This was a good book but not great. It offered some outstanding nuggets of information which presented me with much food for thought. The idea that Mary Magdalen was actually married to Jesus Christ and the Holy Grail is not a cup or chalice at all but Mary's womb as she carried the &quot;bloodline&quot; of Jesus to Egypt and then to Europe is very interesting. She backs up this thought by analyzing art of the dark ages and the &quot;understood&quot; meaning behind it.There was obviously a lot of research that went into this book and I must admit that it was very intriguing. Yet I could not bring myself to believe most of it. There seemed to be a lot of leaps made between some of the information. But I do think there is enough here to warrant some more research on the subject. It would be tough to find out much of what happened because of the Inquisition and the fact that the Roman-Catholic Church purged most of the records of other religions as they stepped on them throughout time as being heresy.In short the beginning of the book really pulled me in but from the mid point on I felt that it was a bit reaching in trying to defend the ideas it presented. But it certainly is a good book to read in combination with other books on the subject. Just don't make it your first and only one on Christianity."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"I wouldn't be surprised if this book was used as a text for a college class. It reads like one. That's not to say that the book isn't interesting. Starbird's research is presented in a very scholarly and interesting way. It just took me awhile to get through it. I bought this book to fill in the blanks of my own knowledge concerning Mary Magdalen. After reading THE DA VINCI CODE, I had to know more. If you, too, have just read THE DA VINCI CODE, I would suggest starting with HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL. Starbird wrote THE WOMAN WITH THE ALABASTER JAR after reading HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL herself. Don't get me wrong. Starbird's book is extremely interesting and contains a lot of evidence for Mary Magdalen being Christ's lost bride. I just wish I had read HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL first."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"Amazingly, Starbird uses many biblical sources to prove Magdalen was the wife and mother of Jesus' child. It's staggering the amount of information packed into this book. There is a whole world of heritical / Gnostic sources that she could have relied on, but instead she used mostly uncontroversial sources. She is a master at pointing out the hidden, but obvious, meaning of religious symbols and art. It's easy to see the influence this book had on Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code. Many of Brown's plot points are taken directly from this book.A more Gnostic, possibly pagan, perspective on the Magdalen story can be seen in Jesus and the Lost Goddess."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"Being a minister I never would have initially considered the possibility of Jesus being married. The idea appeared ridiculous to say the least. The popularity of such a belief due to books such as this one got me looking more into it though. I decided to conduct my own research. I read many books including this one. I agree with many of the reviewers here that this book is not the best researched book available, but non-the-less, it does do enough to raise some interesting questions. Did the books convince me Jesus and Mary Magdalen were married? No! Did it convince me that it is atleast a possibility? Yes! If you have an open mind you will enjoy this book, if not then you probably won't."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"When Margaret Starbird read the Holy Blood and the Holy Grail she was infuriated by it and decided to do some of her own research to refute it. However she found herself caught up in the story and with her own variant on it. Unfortunately some of the sources she found weren't particualarly historical or accurate and some of her leaps of faith are a bit overdone.To my mind sometimes a flower is just a flower. There are many examples of artisans finding particular shapes and colours that just appealed to them, and I'm sure they could have done in their sleep to fill in backgrounds. I stitch myself and I find myself being attracted to some of the same imagery over and over, sometimes I look deeper for the meaning but sometimes that pattern just plain appeals to me. I'm sure it was the same with some of the papermakers that Starbird mentions in the book. There may have been some who had meaning but there may have been others who just picked a shape because it was easy, well known, had a relationship with their master or just plain appealed to them.And this is the main flaw of the book. Just because an image has certain meanings to certain people does not mean that everyone imbues it with that meaning. Just because certain people or peoples imbue certain items with certain meanings does not mean that all people do the same.It may be that Jesus married Mary Magdalene, and some of the arguments for are quite compelling (the fact that non-married men were a rarity and that this would have been mentioned in the Bible is one of many); but we may never know the truth. The truth at the moment is that Christianity has ignored the female and the feminine for a long time and this is begining to be something they may not be able to ignore for much longer.This book gained a few points for making me think but lost some for it's slightly rigid view of the feminine and the masculine. Some of the flights of literary fancy are a little overwritten, but her heart is in the right place."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"This is not your typical academic book, I mean this in a good way!It contains a lot of information but, it reads like a novel and it is truly good.M.

I have read about forty of them and the gist of them is the same. It was not the case this time and I learn plenty of new things.I also recommend her follow up book."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"This was a very interesting book. I've actually owned it for quite some time but never got around to reading it. I'm glad that I finally picked it up, because it only took me a short 3-4 days to finish it. Now, I should say that I read it in that time span due to my interest in the topic, and not because of the author's writing style or adroitness in presenting the topic. Which is where my main criticism lies with this book. As others have pointed out, her scholarship is engaging but lackluster. I feel this is due to her writing style or the excessive emotional investment she has in persuading her readers of the possibilities presented in her book. Unfortunately, I found myself cringing at some of her statements throughout the book, no matter how thought-provoking they were. Not because I disagreed with what she was saying but because I felt it was a rather amateurish attempt, when the field is flooded with heavy-hitters that aren't afraid to call a spade a spade (pun intended). I truly hoped she would have made it a more scholarly work (even though she states in the forward that she wants the book to be readable by non-Biblical scholars) due to the profound nature of her argument. Including short sections of historically-inspired fictitious events and poetry do not help in establishing her viewpoints as holding any significance with \\"real\\" scholars (whoever they are). Also, and I suppose this cannot be a valid criticism due to recent archaeological discoveries, her presentation of the ancient feminine divinity as the end-all, be-all of ancient religious belief systems is horribly flawed. It would have given her more credibility if she acknowledged that male and female were equally represented in ancient religious belief systems (perhaps a revised edition is in store?). Both \\"God\\" and \\"Goddess\\" were represented by a priest and priestess in many temples, which were also populated with clerics of the opposing sex as adherents to the respective deity (I.E. - the Goddess's temple was staffed by male priests lead by a head priestess and vice-versa for the God's temple). Anyhow...I digress...On the other hand, it was refreshing to see her utilize a variety of disciplines to make her case. I especially appreciated her analysis of European heraldry, watermarks and art history in general. I found her references to the Song of Songs and other various Old Testament verses especially interesting. I am familiar with the Orthodox interpretation of these verses as the mystical union of God and Man as Bridegroom and Bride, however, it was engaging to see Ms. Starbird frame them in a more \\"physical\\" manner. I was also impressed by her knowledge of Freemason symbolism, ritual and oaths.Overall, I think she had a great approach to the topic, but it was not executed as well as it could have been. To her dismay (I'm sure) the majority of scholarship addressing the Jesus-Magdalene-Holy Grail-et al. topic is largely seen as a joke. This is unfortunate because I find myself engrossed by a large part of what Ms. Starbird asserts in her book (and I'm Roman Catholic). I would still recommend this book for readers interested in the subject, but I would caution that the writing style and disjointed argument may prove somewhat bothersome in finishing the book."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"Nothing of this story depicts anything negative of Jesus or Mary, just another perspective that could be. I would recommend this to anyone who thinks outside the box."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"Starbird's entire premise rests on the idea that Jesus left a child behind and that the Romans would want to hunt down this child and kill him. This is incorrect on so many levels I hardly know where to start.Starbird claims Jesus' child was important because he carried on David's lineage. Nonsense. The were other Jews at the time who could trace their lineage back to David. Even the bible lists Jesus' brothers/cousins. Why weren't the Romans hot on their trail? It astounds me this never occurred to Starbird.Furthermore, historians have proof that the Davidic bloodline continued after the death of Jesus. It comes from the second century church father Hegesippus. Hegesippus wrote that the emperor Domitian ordered the members of the Davidic bloodline sent to Rome. But when they appeared before Domitian they were not the wealthy princelings he expected, rather, they were scruffy, with the calloused hands of laborers. And they explained they were more interested in the kingdom of heaven that was to come than anything here in this world. Domitian dismissed them as being of no importance.So much for the idea that Jesus' bride would have had to flee because the Romans would have wanted to kill her child. There had been people of David's lineage lying around unmolested for centuries and centuries. And there were men from David's lineage after Jesus was crucified. The entire premise that the child of Jesus would have been in trouble and need to hide is complete drivel.And it's also drivel when Starbird insists Jesus need to marry Mary because of her Davidic bloodline. In the genealogy given in Luke there is a lineage for Jesus shown through Nathan, a brother of Solomon, but it goes through MARY, not Joseph. So Jesus was a biological descendant of David through his mother. There would have been no point in Jesus marrying into the line again.Then there is Starbird's incorrect belief that the early Jewish Christians had a reason to make up a celibate Jesus. But as anyone familiar with Second Temple Judaism will tell you, celibacy was not required of a rabbi. In fact, it was very, very rare among Jews. Almost all Jewish young men were married early. Nor did the pagan cults require celibacy of their priests. There was simply no reason in the world to make up a celibate Jesus, so it is likely to be simply the truth.Among the hilarious bloopers she makes:\\"During the period of Greek influence (333-30 B C)...the rites of other sacrificed sun gods on earth...became modified, borrowed, and confused...\\" (p 43) in the Jewish religion. Wrong. This is an old claim, called the 'History of Religions' theory, now regarded as utterly silly by all biblical historians, theist or nontheist. Read 'The Jesus Legend' by Boyd and Eddy and 'The Gospel and the Greeks' by Nash to grasp just how fully this idea has been refuted.\\"The cult of the dead and resurrected Dumuzi spread to Palestine\\". No it didn't. Read \\"Judaism and Hellenism\\" by Martin Hengel, widely regarded by biblical scholars as the most important book on Second Temple Jews and how they responded to the culture that surrounded them.And this one is a real howler: she claims Judas would have been \\"appalled to see Jesus willingly assume the role of the sacrificed pagan fertility/sun god\\" (p 45) by being anointed. In order to make this claim, she can't have read a single book on ancient Judaism, let alone the Second Temple era. All Levitical priests were anointed. The ill were anointed. A common custom in hot desert areas like ancient Egypt was ro anoint guiests with a blob of jellied perfume on their heads. Lots of people were anointed for a lot of reasons, and it had squat to do with fertility cults.Another howler: \\"There is a very strong Roman Catholic tradition that the Apostle John was the protector of Mary, the mother of Jesus\\" (p 46). This is amazing. Tradition??? It very clearly says in the gospel of John that Jesus, still on the cross, told John that Mary was now his mother. From this enormous mistake, I guess that Starbird's never read the gospels.She claims the \\"the nation of Israel was virtually destroyed and the Christian community of Jerusalem was wiped out\\" (p 54) by the war that ended in the destruction of the temple in 70 AD. Untrue. Eusebius says the Christians fled to Pella before the war and were uninjured.She claims \\"Iscariot...is widely understood to indicate that he (Judas) \\" (p 54) belonged to the sicarii. No, it is not 'widely understood'. 'Iscariot' is translated to mean 'killer' or 'assassian\\", which would be how the early Christians saw Judas.She actually claims--really, I am not making this up, but prepare to laugh--that \\"the First Crusade could...have been an attempt to restore an heir of the Davidic bloodline to the throne of Jerusalem\\" (p 63). That one should have you rolling in the aisles. Why, the fact that the entire of North Africa, once so solidly Christian that it produced a pope, had five hundred bishoprics, but now had been overrun by Muslim armies had nothing to do with it! Neither did the desperate pleas from the eastern world, especially Constantinople, because they were about to be overrun my Muslim armies (which is why Constantinople is now Istanbul). No, it was all a big, big conspiracy about the Davidic bloodline. I'm suprised she didn't mention alien abductions.Starbird makes the most astounding--and wrong--statements without offering a shred of proof. For example, \\"the Church of Jerusalem...remained very Jewish in orientation and did not equate Jesus with God\\" (p 65). What nonsense! How does she explain a church council being held in Jerusalem if everybody disagreed about a basic point--the single most basic point of Christianity, that Jesus was God? And why, pray tell, did the Jewish leaders order James to be killed if he was merely another Jew and wasn't pronouncing Jesus God??One more comment: why would anyone trust Starbird when she's supposedly writing real history, but she gushes on like a cheesy romance novelist? To whit: \\"her blood singing in her veins...her heart's silent song...he had held out his hand. She...shyly reached out to accept it. And every wound she had ever known had been healed\\" (p 8). Gag. Doesn't sound like any historian I've ever read before.And here's another reason not to trust her, besides all the bloopers and errors in logic. She never uses footnotes. She just makes sweeping statements, which anyone who has ever read any biblical scholarship could challenge, but gives never gives a clue as to where she got her 'facts'. In fact, the entire book reads and looks a lot like fiction, not history.I am told that Starbird's book was used by Brown as research for 'The Da Vince Code'. Well, that explains everything, doesn't it? As a famous historian once said of Brown's book: He accomplished the near impossible. He got every single fact wrong including the location of the bathrooms at the Louvre."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"\\"the woman w/ the alabaster jar\\" paints a story of who the real mary magdalen may have been. the author explains her research without trying to sell you her opinion. i found it informative and refreshing."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"Mary Magdalene seems to be coming out of the dark shadows of pious crypts of unbeliefs. It is about time! The power of the Magdalene has scared the patriarchal forces throughout history even deleting her roles as Apostle of Apostles and her intimacy as companion of Christ.Why is the sacred feminine so tabu or why is the creative force of the Holy Spirit kept securely hidden by the Christian Church for 2000 years? Starbird addresses the mystical and forbidden fruits of this knowledge which may transform true believers by faith.Her fascinating chapters on the Tarot and the Holy Grail are worth rereading in deep meditation to unravel secrets held in the collective sub-conscious. She refers to the Cathars and their last stand as martyrs at Montsegur which has been lost to many in America. Thank-you Margaret, for allowing their noble history to be read at last. The Inquisition so adeptly rewrote the French genocide in the Ariege during the 12th and 13th Century with distortion and cruelty.Other books to read if interested in the truths of the sacred feminine are: The Gospel of Mary Magdalene by Jean-Yves Leloup, The Templar Revelation by Pickett and Prince, and the Eclipse of Fate...my healing journey through past-life recall by Barbara Burritt.There appears to be a present day awakening to the secrets of the ages hidden within the cryptic clues of the Grail and the Templars. Lately my favorite books refer to first hand stories of this awakening and inner transformation of knowledge by personal gnosis. That is why I recommend Eclipse of Fate for anyone seeking confirmation of miracles and truth crossing over barriers of time itself."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"Margaret Starbird has taken on what had to be a difficult task for herself: being brought up and fully involved in Roman Catholicism, she questioned her beliefs, followed the EVIDENCE and documentation and has written a very accessible book about Mary Magdelan and the whole Holy Grail controversy. It is very well argued and written and is very enjoyable. No starry eyed anti catholic, she is a catholic and goes back to the historical evidence, not the stories written since."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"First, let me say I very rarely write a negative review of anything unless I feel it's subject matter is not what it is purported to be. I'd just gotten done with &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; and this book seemed so highly recommended in reviews here on its factual, historical content. Or maybe I misunderstood. Because halfway through I had to stop reading it. I thought it was going to be about Mary Magdalen-from her birth to her death, including her time with Jesus. Maybe eventually it ends up being about her, but it's not written that way in the half I read. It was more of a Holy Grail history lesson. While the subject is her relationship to the Grail, I did not buy this book for a Holy Grail history lesson, there's a ton of information on that subject already. I bought it for the biographical information about Mary Magdalen. The author repeats herself quite often, and constantly refers to Bible passages. If you aren't Christian, or haven't opened a Bible in a long time, these constant referrals get quite frustrating and exclusionary because you have no idea what is being referrenced. I have no other recommendations for information on Mary Magdelan. And I'm not saying people could not enjoy this book. All I am saying it was disappointing and not what I expected in a biographical story."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"I appreciate Margaret Starbird's book on Mary Magdalene. It is one of the many recent attempts to return her centre-stage in Christian tradition. However, there is little literal or surface evidence to show Yeshua married Mary. The indirect evidence put forward in her book goes the right way: Yeshua married Mary. Although confessing churches loathe to accept this point, there is a growing consensus today that Yeshua was more intimate with Mary than they had ever suspected.The alabaster jar with its perfume and the service rendered by Mary to Yeshua in Bethany before his 'death' seem not so much mystical, esoteric or ritual marriage practices of the Roman goddess cult, but actual practices of the Essenes and Qumran ascetics, and early Christian communities led by Yeshua and others. The latter separated themselves from the ascetic priestly and royal sect and created their own 'Christian'communities of lay and Diaspora Jews and 'gentile' proselytes. In their common heritage the alabaster jar needs to be returned within the Song of Songs tradition and its marriage ritual associated with perfume ceremony held by the bride for the bridegroom. Miriam would have held it for her 'Lord' with the perfume in the alabaster jar.Mary, in my view, needs to be related to the first Miriam, the sister of Moses and Aaron. Re-enacting this Miriam we have so many Miriams around Yeshua, which could go to ascertain the fact that Miriam is a title, and less a personal name. Probably Miriams made up a female monastic and ascetic group within Essene and Qumran community, later went over to the Chrisitian party. In both communities they re-enact the exodus drama in 'these last days' re-playing the female role of the original Miriam, the prototype.From this historical point of view of Jewish and Christian life in the first century AD, the mystical and grail story to which Starbird links Mary Magdalene could be an interesting later Christian tradition built around Mary Magdalene, but it will not do sufficient justice to the historical 'Miriam.' She was, it looks to me, a fine, sensitive woman; very much attached to her 'Lord.' But the upheaval and stormy life of the Jews under Romans could have led to strained relationship between them. This might be reflected in repudiating Mary in the second century and casting out her 'Gospel' together with other 'Gospels' from the canon of the New Testament. The 'Gospels' have now been recovered and published; the Dead Sea Scrolls too have been recovered and published. Together they open the closed New Testament canon and submit it to new historical scrutiny."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"I think it is an excellent presentation in lamen's terms of the early christians and ancient cultures and rituals. It explains many things that have been misunderstood and erroneasly taught up through time.I personally found it easy to read and captivating!"},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"I am very interested in this subject matter and am not a religious fanatic (only a recovering Catholic!). I am, however, a scientist and must know where any information is coming from for it to be of any use. I am assuming this book is not a fictional work.The first chapter is a \\"story\\" about some biblical-sounding folk \\"The Lost Bride\\". However, there is no reference, background, or anything given for the story itself. Who wrote it? When was it written? Is it from the Gnostic gospels? Did the author fabricate it? Where did it come from? I.e. - why should I care about this story???I put the book down and haven't picked it up since."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"I was mesmerized by how grand the secrets behind the Holy Grail. Like all the rest, I assume it was just a relic hunt. But No, Dan Brown saw to that and now I am hunting for the facts.Named in Da Vinci Code, this book is one of the source Langdon and Teabing used in their explanation. So naturally I looked for and was very fortunate to find it. With more that 30 pictures attached as the references of what she tried to say in her book, this was very satisfying in its own way.The book is started by a fiction story of Mary Magdalene which was not clear who wrote it, then it proceeds to each subject concerning Magdalene based on the Bible, along with the facts and fiction gathered from books by other researches , added with some hypotheses from Ms. Starbird. There is so much info I get from reading this, including more understanding of what Tarot cards really hold in their pictures.But I think there are still too many repetitions of subjects between the chapters which sometimes made me lost focus of what was being discussed. It is very helpful to have the Index page but it would be better if Ms. Starbird could reorganized some of the subchapters an make it more systematic."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"The ideas presented in this book are so intriguing, so &quot;I WISH they were true,&quot; that it kills me to have to say that Starbird has built a beautiful, glittering house of cards that will fall to pieces at the first breath of wind.Starbird's typical chain of reasoning tends to go, &quot;Scholars think that some Mediterranean people MAY have believed X 1,000 years before Jesus was born. Therefore Jesus DEFINITELY believed X.&quot; And for the rest of the book, Starbird takes X as accepted fact.For example, *some* scholars believe that the Songs of Songs, which was probably written during the intertestamental period, two to five hundred years before Jesus was born, *may* contain elements that date from a much older Sacred Marriage cult (probably Syrio-Babylonian) between a Great Goddess and a Shepherd King. Therefore a minimum of several hundred years later Jesus *definitely* knew about *and believed in* this pagan cultic practice, and deliberately set about re-creating it. Therefore the royal/priestly/messianic anointing of Jesus described in Mark 14 and Matthew 26 was actually a royal wedding anointing between Jesus and the unnamed woman (who was Mary Magdalene in disguise). . . . On the other hand, what if Jesus, who was probably reared as a good Pharisee, never heard of the legend of Inana and Dumuzi? What happens to the beautiful chain of reasoning then? -- killed at its source!Starbird constructs these flimsy chains of reasoning not once but any number of times. The result is a structure that I, as a feminist theologian, WISH could be taken seriously -- but alas, her reasoning is just too rickety to support any weight at all."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"There are numerous works out now exploring the theme and person of Mary Magdalen. Unfortunately this is not one of the better ones. Unconvicing, surprisingly dull and sentimental. Too much goddess worship. A far better work is the one by Susan Hoskins. Mary was truly the disciple to the disciples and an example of the radical rediscovery of women in society, but the rest of this is tiresome."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"This work explores some fascinating ideas about the identity and role of Mary Magdalen. From the perspective of one who does not have an extensive background in Christian theory, however, the book is difficult to follow, wandering in it's points and repetitive. Those well versed in theology might possibly have a different take."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"Pretty poorly written, repetitive, confusing, seems slightly bootlegged and almost too contrived. The author is too deeply rooted in orthodox Christianity in order to even make a run for the alternative. I love the subject matter though - that's why I bought this book. I am slightly disappointed to say the least."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"I cannot tell you just how many times this author misses the mark. But just the title alone should show you how poor the research is. The Luke 7:37 clearly says that the woman was from that town. That excludes the Magdalene. The same passage says the woman was a sinner. That excludes Mary of Bethany (sister of Martha and Lazarus). The Passage from Mark 14 is unnamed, if it was someone as important as either Mary of Bethany OR Mary Magdalene, it would have been mentioned. It goes on and on from there. This is clearly a book written to capitalize of Dan Brown's better researched, but brilliantly written fiction, the Da Vinci code. WHen ever a blockbuster appears, there are inevetably \\"poor cousins\\" that appear hoping to pick up the scraps."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"The woman with the alabaster jar of expensive perfume is Mary of Bethany (sister of Martha and Lazarus whom Jesus raised from the dead), not Mary Magdalene. The story is in all four Gospels, but her identity is revealed in Jn 11:1-2.After Pentecost, when the Gospel starting spreading to the ends of the earth, Mary Magdalene went with Maximilian (or Maximus--one of the 72 elders of the NT) and Simon (Hb name), the man born blind that Jesus healed, to the Roman colony city of Aix en Provence, France to spread the Gospel--not Egypt. Their tombs are there. I have a friend who spends three months every year there. Why do you think the French are so devoted to the Madeleine? She was there! Who knew her? The French. At no time in history did they make such wild claims about Mary Magdalene as this author does. She's been watching the movie \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\" and taking her ideas from that. It's art, not truth. BTW, I'm a fan of JCS but I won't let its errors confuse me.The Catholic Church has never formally taught that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute, and the Scriptures only say that seven demons were cast out of her.Enjoy this book as a work of fiction and fantasy if you must, but do not make the mistake of thinking it is historical truth. Read the earliest Christian writings to see what the first believers knew to be true faith and what they fought as heresy...including priestesses, goddess worship, and Collyridianism.Fertility goddess womb worship of the divine feminine already existed in Christ's time and before then. Christ and Mary Magdalene wouldn't have been necessary to reveal this sort of faith if it were true. What new covenant would that be? Nothing new about it."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"This was suggested to me by a Catholic friend and I know it ruffled his tail-feathers a lot more than mine (since I'm not Catholic). This lady certainly knows what she is talking about and the story takes a little imagination, though she does provide a lot of convincing evidence. I would love to see a &quot;rebuttal&quot; book to this one since I am sure there is quite a bit of &quot;evidence&quot; in the other direction as well. This is really an interesting book for anyone with any religious or historical interest."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"Despite the ecclesiastical criticisms leveled against them by so-called Christians, Starbird and Sweeney do an excellent job documenting their assertions in this splendid work of historical reconstruction -- scholarship, I might add, that is supported by several other notable authors and historians. This is not merely some insane theory conjured up by someone with an axe to grind against the Vatican.The authors share several brilliant insights with the reader that are truly inspired and speak to some of those long-unanswerable questions of history. Of course, no one can know the COMPLETE and TRUE story that is the legacy of the Magdalen, but these authors and others like them at least have the courage to make what information they have uncovered available to the masses despite the Church's long history of silence, secrecy, suppression and outright deception.If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program \`insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. Another fun book is Brad Steiger's 'Werewolf.' I also really liked Dan Brown's \`Angels and Demons.' Want to be shocked, check out Dr. Paul Hill's 'Unconventional Flying Objects' which NASA tried to ban.The tip of the iceberg: Numerous authorities who had noted the errors in the K.J.V. such as William Kilburne (1650's) 20,000 errors, John Wesley (in 1755) 12,000 changes in the New Testament alone, the Revised Version of 1881 consisted of 36,000 errors and on and on. The NIV, RSV and The Living Bible are also replete with thousands of errors. Do some research!The KJV Bible is the True Word of God! Or is it? Inspired? Or not? I believe all of the one star ratings and rantings are from uneducated Protestants. For example:In \`Acts 5:30; 10:39.' the KJV, in speaking of Jesus' death, reads, &quot;Whom ye slew \`and' hanged on a tree.&quot; The word &quot;and&quot; is \`not' in the Greek text, and by adding it to the text at this point in the verse it leads to some confusion on the part of the readers. The conjunction &quot;and&quot; indicates grammatically that one action followed another (i.e.: two separate actions independent of one another). Some unbelievers have tried to use this verse to demonstrate that Christ was killed first, \`and then' His dead body was hung on a \`tree'. By inserting the word &quot;and,&quot; numerous complications have arisen which could have been prevented by a correct translation of the original text.The KJV translators also did not know what the &quot;Asherah&quot; was (a wooden idol representing a Canaanite goddess), so they translated the word repeatedly as meaning a &quot;grove&quot; of trees. In \`I Kings 16:33' they state, &quot;And Ahab made \`a grove,&quot; which provoked the Lord God to anger. In point of fact, Ahab made an \`idol' here (the Asherah); his sin was \`idolatry', not planting a grove of trees!!In Deuteronomy 33:17 the KJV speaks of &quot;the horns of unicorns.&quot; There are two mistakes in this passage: (1) The animal mentioned here in the original text is the &quot;wild ox&quot; and not the mythical &quot;unicorn,&quot; and (2) in the original text the passage speaks of one animal (singular) with horns (plural).In Luke 18:12 the KJV reads, &quot;I give tithes of all that I possess.&quot; The Law did NOT require one to tithe a tenth of all that he &quot;possessed&quot; (all his capital holdings), but rather a tenth of his increase (that which he acquired in addition to his possessions). This is clearly stated in the Greek word used in this passage.A must read for skeptics and devout Christians alike. \\"He who believes blindly sees not the truth.\\""},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"Margaret Starbird's (1992) book The Woman with the Alabaster Jar was the first of her several books on Mary Magdalene, and it was inspired by her reading of the 1981 best-seller Holy Blood, Holy Grail (HBHG). As such, the book is a blend of her own original research on the subject as well as a good re-hashing of the HBHG vis-&agrave;-vis Mary Magdalene and her role in the life of Jesus, and fans of HBHG will be very much at home in Starbird's book.This 200 page book is really 3 books in 1. The first 22 pages, labeled a prologue, are a small novella about Mary and Jesus. Chapters 1 to 3 discuss the historical evidence for Mary Magdalene, and the remaining chapters discuss the role that Mary Magdalene (and the sacred feminine) played in the art and folklore of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Think of the third part as an excellent supplement to HGBGStarbird's case and the work on Mary Magdalene is by now standard fare, although in 1992 (pre DaVinci Code) it was pretty revolutionary - Jesus and Mary were married...for various reasons the church hid this fact...they had a child...Mary fled to France after Jesus was crucified where the bloodline of Jesus continued to develop...etc. Where Starbird goes beyond the HBHG tradition is in her emphasis on the \\"sacred marriage\\" and its implications. This theme she carries from the OT to the NT and right through the Middle Ages up until the present. Her work is thoughtful, documented, creative, and insightful.I have some disagreements with Starbird about some of her historical assumptions (e.g., Jesus was \\"taller than average\\", he was from Nazareth, nailed to the cross and pierced through the heart with a spear). These are all relatively minor points and all refer to Jesus, not Mary.With regard to the historical Mary Magdalene, Starbird does cover some basic ground, but she will elaborate in greater and deeper detail in her later books. The strength of this book is the breadth of her coverage of the influence of Mary Magdalene on 1000 years of artwork and folklore, from the fairy tales of Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Rapunsel, and Snow White to the foundation of the Tarot cards to the works of Botticelli and beyond.The bottom line is that this book is a must for any serious person with any interest in the New Testament. It will be particularly beneficial for someone with a wide range of interests beyond the traditional biblical studies approach."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"As someone who has always subscribed to the Jesus-and-Mary-M-were-married school of thought, I WANTED this book to convince me, to provide me with unmistakeable proof of this theory. Alas, at the end of this book, while my mind was certainly enriched and I had had many intriguing notions suggested to me, I found that my belief of Jesus' and Mary Magdalene's relationship was still based on faith and not cold, hard fact.While Starbird has painstakingly done her research, the links with which she joins the evidence seem very flimsy - or perhaps she is simply not skilled at presenting evidence in writing. The end result never seems to be anything more than speculation and hypothesis, a long string of &quot;maybes&quot; &quot;possiblies&quot; and &quot;could bes&quot;.Despite this, the narrative is so passionate, so heartfelt, so excited, so intent on its cause that it is difficult not to enjoy the book and be swept up in its ecstatic &quot;proofs&quot;. And the maybes may very well *be* maybes.....it is just that Starbird does not *convince* me it is so. Still, a world of possibilities and intriguing ideas are opened to the reader with this book, and while we may never know for certain what the truth is, this book is well worth a read. Challenge your ideas, open your mind and enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"This book was a very thorough look at the possibility that Jesus was married to Mary Magdelene. I really like how Margaret Starbird laid out her arguments and came to her conclusions. It was a very interesting reads; I learned about a french legend I never heard about, about how the Bible used metaphor from Middle Eastern myths and aobut how this story plays out in our modern society (i.e., Cinderella, The Little Mermaid, Sleeping Beauty, etc).The one think I didn't like was that it got emotional at the end. I agreed with the emotion expressed-that if the feminine in our society was honored there would be more of a balance. But I was under the impression that this was a dissertation (the intro) and that emotional aspect does not belong in a dissertation. Just an opinion. But overall, a fascinating look into what could be the greatest conspiracy."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"I am in love with this book. As a student of The Heresy, this book was a wonderful starter into the Mystery of The Millennium. The book is as friendly and accessable as its author, who has thoughtfully answered my every e-mail, poor lady! Woman With The Alabaster Jar was life changing for me...I certainly don't mean this to sound 'miraculous' by any means. But, if you happen to be one of an increasing number of those questioning contempory theology, this book can help you form a foundation for your ideas and investigations. This book is kind and gentle, much like the Lady herself, but the information- explosive. Men and woman alike have been robbed of an intrinsic portion of their psyche for 2000 years. Start to reclaim it by reading this book. This is NOT New Age gibberish- (no offense meant to those who channel dead Native Americans and Egyptians everyday)...if anything, I would call it Old Age as it is information that has been sequestered for two millennia. The simple fact you're here reading this means you've got the question...now, begin your journey to find your answer. A little tid bit: What's the Roman Numeral for the year 2000?

This book is truly a gem in the arena of the reimergence of the Sacred Feminine. Her exploration of the preservation of Mary Magdalene as the sacred bride of Jesus and the 12th century symbolism (watermarks)of the Albegensians/Cathar lineage is really amazing. You'll discover the true meaning of the watchtower and the true purpose of minstrals and Tarot symbolism to weave the tale of the Dark Madonna in censored times. The beauty of the Song of Solomon in the Bible is also explored. It's functional purpose in the Hieros Gamos is revealed and discussed by Starbird. I really got a lot out her discussions on the true meaning of unicorn symbology too. I'm lucky enough to have visited the Cloisters museum in NYC a few years back and saw these amazing tapestries in person. I am forever mesmerized by the search for the sacred feminine in our world today. I have been on a quest to discover this myself way before the whole Da Vinci code phenomenon. Dan Brown has his place to alert the masses, but if you are a true seeker of knowledge about the tale of the Magdalene and her flight to Gaul and her importance in our understanding of our divine heritage well...this book is for you. Not too be missed!!!!! Here's to the unification of the Chalice and Blade and the return of the Holy Grail to the Wasteland. Reach out and take her hand Fisher King, your babe is coming home to rest in your arms once more!"},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"Margaret Starbird's courageous work has changed my life. I read the book, first, with mild curiosity. It gripped me and helped me to become wide awake spiritually. To have someone really suggest that &quot;the emperor has no clothes,&quot; in the realm of our religious teaching, was my wake up call. I realized that what is really important in her work is that we must consider all possibilities because we were not there to witness ourselves. In light of that, we can only believe what someone else has written as the history. My true north is that this story resonated for me and for a group of my spiritual friends; we began a reading group to explore the relevance of this work to our lives. We have been meeting for several years now, and in all of our studies, it is Margaret Starbird's work that is our guiding light. I highly recommend this profound work to all who are willing to ask for the truth and accept the answers."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"As I read The Woman With the Alabaster Jar my head doubted, but my heart didn't.

I hope she will be only the first of many, many more."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. Margaret Starbird obviously dedicated a lot of herself to researching the history and symbolism and also agrees there is no way to prove this hypothesis. Very interesting history in any case.

In my opinion for someone to devote so much timeand effort in finding out the truth, she has done an excellent job.That is why we are all here, to find out the truth."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"For someone who is interested in theology --- this is a great book! Loved every page --- I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"The thesis of this work will be for many controversial- that Jesus was married, that the\\" Woman with the Alabaster Jar\\" was part of the transmission of \\"wisdom\\" and that this knowledge was passed down through mystical and secret organizations.In The Woman with the Alabaster Jar Starbird considers the art, iconography and mythology of medieval period and shows that hidden within its imagery was the representation of a secret tradition of the \\"holy family\\". She decodes the symbolism with great erudition including a truly fascinating journey into the meaning of the Tarot. For Starbird the Magdalen is clearly the missing figure from the Christ story as taught by the Church and she outlines a truly powerful vision of what the true role of Mary Madgalen was before the male dominated establishment suppressed her.This is a powerful and moving work. Not only does it show the intellectual foundation for the Magdalen tradition, but through its presentation of the real meaning of art, symbolism and mythology it lifts the veil, just a little, so we may gain a glimpse of her long hidden face. This is a work anyone concerned with the true essence of the Christian vision must read."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"After a rather dull 'history-based-on-fact' short story, Starbird bursts into her quest: to convince the reader that Jesus had heirs. This is where the meat of this book is*!* Easy to read and understand, it provides the reader with a quick synopsis of why Starbird believes Jesus had heirs. Unlike HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL, where memorization and reading comprehension are vital, this book is easily understood by the average reader. But, I was disappointed with the last few chapters wherein Starbird gives a disseration on feminist ideas, myths, and symbols. If you are researching feminine myths and symbols, read Marija Gimbutas books [an associate of Joseph Campbell]. If you eliminated the first and last chapters, you have a great book."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"I find speculative history as interesting as the next person, but the problems with Starbird's work are fatal. For one, she presents a &quot;straw man&quot; church against which to rail. Obviously, the church has had flaws, but Starbird ignores its complexity. Also, she presents a picture of the Cathars that they would not recognize. As a gnostic movement, they rejected the physical and the bodily completely. How such an idea is transformed into liberation for women is mystifying. Ironically, the strongest women of the age were those who embraced the body and affective piety--Margery Kempe, Julian of Norwich. Her &quot;evidence&quot; that Jesus married Magdalen is, to say the least, highly creative but hardly comvincing. Most bothersome is the way she has posited herself as an orthodox Catholic who finally saw the light for half a dozen books now. How many times can you lose your virginity? Once seems plenty.Finally, as interesting as I find these kinds of speculations, I am always somewhat troubled by the elitism. There is always, in any brand of gnosticism, the suggestion that a select few get to know and understand the &quot;real&quot; history, the &quot;real&quot; message, the &quot;real&quot; Jesus. If Starbird is right, billions of Christians have been wrong, and only an impossibly small clique in only a few brief moments have had access to the truth. Of course, she is one of them. As are you, the reader. Does that make you feel special? For all of orthodoz Christianity's problems--and they are legion--at least it insists that the gospel is open to all people, everywhere, and in all ages."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"Ms. Starbird has done a great job of presenting what would be, for some, a disturbing counter to the traditional Church's version of the Jesus story.

If you want any information on Mary as she pertains to Christ as a woman, or if you are interested in the possibility of the Sang Real..Holy Bloodline..then this is the book for you! Great historical and geographical information. I definitely recommend this book.

It's time we women stand up and take a stand for our right to be equal in spiritual history like men. I do believe that Jesus is with us in doing so! Thank you Margaret Starbird for this wonderful book giving us hope that we don't have to act behind the doors... and thank you Mary Magdalene for going with us! Great book!"},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"She presents interesting research but her writing style is somewhat disjointed. This makes it difficult at times to follow her train of thoughts. There have been a few instances where she has gone back to the initial theme with an \\"oh yes I need to tie it in\\" attitude. It has taken me a while to finish it because it is not enthralling as I had hoped having read several other books with this theme."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"To think that Jesus had a child, what a wonderful thing to know and believe and that his bloodine is here with us. He married and loved and known his beloved Mary Magdelene. This is the good news.Why have we not known this all this time? Shame on those for hiding the truth."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"Ms. Starbird has made a remarkable effort.The work is fascinating and *just* scholarly enough without being dry. Well-researched, clearly.The Tarot information is especially deep, giving a concise, well-matched explanation for the existence of the Major Arcana.She did not go into enough detail regarding several of the watermarks, in my opinion, but that in no way detracts fromtheir validity within the work.I can appreciate that this work made me think and made me willing to expand my spiritual horizons.My only *MAJOR* problem with this work is it is very Essentialist--It is very firm in \\"how men *are*\\" and \\"how women *are*\\" and \\"how the relationship between the genders *should* work\\".It claims women *are* inherently by their nature passive and receptive, the nurturers, while men are always naturally prone to aggression and the tendency to rule.It denies validity to many other personality archetypes within both women and men, to the detriment of both.For this, I attempted to give the book 3 1/2 stars, but since that wasn't permissible, I felt it warrented the extra half-star, bumping it up to four.A worthy read all-in-all, but balance it out with, say, Jean Bolen (Goddesses in Everywoman, Gods in Everyman) for a better perspective on gender archetypes and interrelationships."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"Margaret Starbird does an excellent job explaining the history of the Holy Grail legends as they apply to Mary Magdelene, and explains the evidence very well, pointing to the fact that many have believed them for over 1000 years. What she does not do well is find evidence that they are true. She claims that Mary of Bethany and Mary of Magdala are the same person, based largely on the declaration of Pope Gregory I over 1300 years ago, with no reference to any other scholars since then. She also places great emphasis on this Mary anointing Jesus on the head, but the gospel of John says that Mary of Bethany anointed his feet! Other versions of the story in Matthew and Mark do say that an un-named woman anointed his head, but neither of these books imply that it was either of these Marys. In fact, Mary was one of the most common names in Israel at the time. So, the evidence that these two women were one and the same is extremely thin. I agree that the Christian church has suppressed the participation of women for many years, and it is high time to elevate women and encourage their full participation in the church in every way. But I think that while Starbird's history is good, her theology takes some very large leaps that are not supported by enough evidence to convince me that they are true."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"The Woman With the Alabaster Jar was recommended by so many people, it was the first book I'd intended to read on the controversial subject of Mary Magdalen's relationship to Jesus. It didn't turn out to be the first, but it would've been a great place to start. It's not a book about gnosticism specifically, but a collection of facts and theory regarding the relationship of Mary Magdalen and Jesus, or Miriam of Bethany and Yeshua, as they're often named in the book.Margaret Starbird began her research of this subject in the hopes of debunking Holy Blood, Holy Grail by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, and Henry Lincoln, having read it from the perspective of a devout Catholic. Somewhere in the course of her research, she found herself supporting many of their claims. Her journey explored the life of one of the most enigmatic women the world has known, or at least thought we knew.The Woman With the Alabaster Jar begins with a prologue, a fictionalized account of Mary Magdalen's flight to Egypt with Joseph of Arimathea, the subsequent birth of a daughter, Sarah, and finally a voyage across the Mediterranean into southern France. This account is based on theory only, and Starbird concedes throughout this book that her conclusions can't be proven. But she adroitly connects numerous historical threads and \\"fossil\\" information in a credible speculation about how the early days of Christianity, and particularly the life of Mary Magdalen, may have played out after the execution of Jesus.The theories raised here may be difficult for anyone steeped in the canonical gospels, or who is a devoted follower of established Christianity. They'll be seen as disturbing, or as nonsense, or again as heresy. But to those who have had doubts or have left Christianity because there were certain precepts they found themselves unable to believe, or for those who have always seen Jesus as a great teacher, but human, this book opens up a new way of considering his life and teachings.The information is presented in a way that makes for fast and easy reading, in contrast with more scholarly treatises on religious history. It's a human story, told in human terms, giving the lay person access to a gathering of information difficult to come by elsewhere in as palatable a form. Complete footnotes are provided at the back of the book, where they don't intrude on its reading ease. The color plates are magnificent. As a student of Tarot, I welcomed the images from the so-called Charles VI Tarot (more correctly known as the Estensi or Gringonneur Tarot) and the theory of its possible origins as a way of teaching the Grail heresy in secret.I found one weakness in the book, in what I perceived as redundancy, and perhaps too much effort to put things in layman's terms. It's possible the author underestimated the level of understanding of her readers. On the other hand, what I perceived as repetition may have derived from the number of times the themes actually repeat through history, adding possible weight to their veracity.The information is presented respectfully, even lovingly. The author is clearly a devout person, who has great regard for people of all beliefs. She exhibits sensitivity for her subject matter and its possible impact on others' faith. Her theories and the evidence supporting them, though revolutionary in nature, are at the same time gently offered."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"I am Catholic, myself, and believed what I was taught in school and Church and I'm inclined to believe the theory supported in this book. The truth can not hurt us, but instead sets us free. If the &quot;other Mary&quot; was the Bride of Christ and carried His child, then what pain we must cause Him by denying Her.If Ms Starbird could collect all of the &quot;proof&quot; that was in her book, then surely the Catholic Church could and should look into this as a matter of grave concern. Our Church should ALWAYS put the will and word of GOD above power, politics and money. I pray that they will and let us have it's thoughts about this VERY IMPORTANT MATTER. I for one am convinced and feel blessed that Ms Starbird found a way to make her information easy to understand and a joy to read. Thank You, Viviano"},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"In THE WOMAN WITH THE ALABASTER JAR Margaret Starbird pursues further the topic made popular in HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL. Specifically she explores the possibility of a marriage between Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene which produces a child after Mary Magdalene manages to escape to the southern coast of France. This legend leads to the Grail heresy which suggests that certain families in southern France can trace their ancestry back to Jesus and Mary Magdalene.Starbird's book is a story about a heresy which keeps popping up throughout history in spite of the best efforts of the church to stamp it out - particularly during the inquisition. The author's reasoning is that if there is so much smoke then there must actually be a fire somewhere. Since the Grail heresy left an impressive legacy in art, song and folklore, Starbird is able to offer us numerous examples of the persistence of the heresy. She does this in great detail covering such subjects as the hidden meanings concealed in tarot cards and their connection to the Grail heresy.Margaret Starbird is an enthusiastic writer who can tell a great story. She is not composing a work of scholarship but instead is investigating a mystery - the enigma of a legend which gets more intriguing with the passage of time and each new advance in the quest for the historical Jesus."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"A nicely thought out book, passionate in its response to our need to recognize the feminine in our spiritual lives. But what always astounds me in our search for \\"truth,\\" (damned elusive Pimpernel) is our blindness to the great truth staring us all in the face from the first moment any of us ever questions our own religion, or our neighbor's religion. I know this. I was subject to the same belief-blindness when I first began my quest to know God...or at least Jesus. The blindness is simply this: all these stories are MYTH. I know. I know. Many of you think myth is just another way to say: lie, to commit a falsehood. Wrong. Myth is one of the most powerful words/tools in any language. Joseph Campbell tried to tell us all this. But Christians appear to be amongst the only people on earth who can't face their deeply symbolic stories as anything but literal truth. (For which we have so many early Church Fathers with so many early agendas to thank.) Myth tells the ultimate in truths about the state of being human. In myth is woven all that we believe about ourselves, and that we hope for ourselves: as individuals...and as an entire race. This book is Ms Starbird's myth. And I like it very much. It's not mine since I don't need there to be an actual Jesus or an actual Mary Magdalene who were actually married and had an actual child. It's more than enough for me to know that Jesus = Christ = Cosmic Consciousness. And that Mary = Bride of Christ = the body coming to consciousness through Christ. The child can only symbolize US. We are the Grail.This is all Gnostic teaching. You can find all this by a careful and open-hearted reading of Gnostic texts, which very much include the four canonical gospels. (Elaine Pagels is trying to tell us all this without going too far out on her own establishment limb.) But still, Ms. Starbird's plea for Mary as the Bride is sweetly sung. If it weren't so tied to the literal, it would soar higher.Now, if you want some real red meat about Gnostic ideas, some profound scholarship, and some storytelling on the order of the master story-tellers, you could do much worse than go read something I just stumbled across: Ki Longfellow'sThe Secret Magdalene: A Novel. For me, the best of the best."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"I've read a lot of the reviews and wondered what points I'd make in mine. The first one is that the continual mention of Dan Brown's book THE DA VINCI CODE, which is fiction with a thready root in fact, should not be compared to scholarly research and investigation.This book takes on one of the sacred cows of Christianty; the virgin birth, and the sexuality of the Christ.Even though I was totally indoctrinated into the fundamentalist Christian faith from my very first breath, I was fortunate to maintain the ability to think and question for myself. Apparently not everyone is that lucky.One of the very first things I questioned and personally debunked was the Virgin birth. I knew that it takes a sperm and an egg to make a baby, and that ghosts, holy or otherwise, simply didn't have the right equipment to make a baby. I couldn't understand how anyone could believe that story. Then I began to wonder why the story was told in the first place and there began my journey of study and investigation into how the Virgin myth began and more importantly why people felt they had to believe it in order to have a relationship with God.I've read every available text on the dead sea scrolls, the nag hamadi libray, the origins of church doctrine, studied the hermetics of the bible in college and loved every minute of it.I understood how the current bible came to be and in that understanding it meant even less because I saw it as an incomplete document and very self-serving to the MEN who created it. I've done comparative religion and read things that left me shaking my head wondering how it could be that the Hermetica shared so many spiritual concepts with the bible?As I grew in my resesarch and knowlege I began to question why, if Jesus was of the line of David, (which the bible claims in the same breath it says Jesus is the son of the holy ghost which means he wasn't of the line of David..head spinning) I knew that he would have been of the rabinical line and knowing my Hebrew laws and history, I knew that had Jesus been a Rabbi, he would have been required BY JEWISH LAW to marry, and that all aspects of that marriage would have been strictly regulated by the law.If Jesus wanted to be taken seriously by the Jews he would never have flouted that tradition. He may have consorted with the poor and downtrodden, the Zealots and the prostitutes, but he could not have done as much as he did if he'd ignored Rabbinical tradition and law in regards to marriage.I found this book a simpler easier to read version of Holy Blood Holy Grail which focuses on bit by bit building of the evidence. This book also focuses on the feminine and the author's interpretation of what I used to think were \\"fairy tales\\" made me rethink some of my old long held beliefs.I'd learned years ago that women used to be equal with men in the early Christian church (until Peter's jealousy and Paul's perversion ruined it) and I knew that the Catholic Church rooted out and eliminated any and all remote sects that still honored women's roll in the church.The author is right, a man a lone creates imbalance. Her interpretation of the damage done to the WORLD by the denial of the role of the feminine devine has been devastating. OF course Christ married, he was a man, he felt everything and experienced everything a normal man would. He claimed to come to earth to experience the life of a man and what sort of \\"son of God\\" would he be if he left out one of the most important aspects of MANHOOD...the relationship of man with woman.The truth is right there in front of our faces. What risk do we take if we \\"see'it? I'd always wondered why people needed Mary to be a virgin and Jesus to be unmarried in order to believe in and love God. What faith would be tumbled should absolute proof come tomorrow that Mary was no Virgin and Jesus married and fathered a child? The idea that Jesus was more of a man than previously thought...that he knew the joys of physical and emotional love and bonds with a woman makes him even more \\"loveable\\", more one of us, more of everything they claim he was.This book is a nice easy introduction into the deeper issues. It's not a book for the faithful Christian who would only be angered and lash out. (Although the root emotion of anger is fear so I'd have to ask what they were afraid of?)We've let the men in Rome run our lives since the Cannon and the inquisition. I for one will celebrate when the Church of Rome crumbles as it surely will. They won't be able to \\"do\\" the inquisition to us again, and they can't govern people and dictate to people who can think and read and study for themselves. Americans espeically are reluctant to allow a priest into their bedroom to tell them how many children they can have, and even the stauchest Catholic has to wonder how, in the face of a deadly disease, the Catholic church can look their \\"people\\" in the eyes and tell them they can't use condoms. I guess the same way they used to look a desperate loving husband in the eye and tell him it would be a sin for him to save the life of his wife at the expense of the child.The time is close for the rebirth of the feminine divine, and the reunification of the Prince with his Bride and in my opinion it can't happen a moment too soon."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"This was a great book! There are several reviews posted about this book that blatanly bash it. This is only a possibility, and a good one at that. Evidence is laid out clearly, it is only up to your faith to decide what you believe. As a born again Christian I have had my doubts about what is the acceptable truth and what is not. After reading this book and Holy Blood, Holy Grail as well as doing some research myself; I have drawn the conclusion that this theory is more probable than that taught in church. But, if you can't enjoy the book for its theories, at least respect the woman for her hard work and determination."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"I bought this book because I was intrigued by the title, but I was very disappointed in the contents. The author has obviously done her research, but I sure wish she could have presented it better. I found parts of it very repetitive (where was the editor?). I found many of the &quot;connections&quot; to be very very speculative at best. (When someone takes words from one language, reverses the letters, and points to the similarity to a word in another language, I get very nervous.) All in all, the best part of the book was the introduction by Sweeney. Nevertheless, I still find the subject interesting enough to pursue, and intend to read some of the sources that the author points to."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"Margaret Starbird was one of the first to elaborate at length about the idea that Mary Magdalen was more than just the irrelevant aquaintance of Jesus that the Bible tries to make her.

It really made me think about the whole idea of the wholeness of God, and the idea that a masculine God completely limits the deity. It's amazing how humans, in trying to make God into their own image, limits the deity into a half-entity.I enjoyed the chapters about the Tarot and the symbols hidden in art. I'd love to read more on that subject."},{"Title":"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail","review":"This book makes so much sense on so many levels, but most of all it makes sense on an intuitive level, even though the author guides us step by step in facts and logic. I think we get so used to looking at thinks from one point of view that to take a step back and to take a more fresh, objective point of view, and maybe that's what 2000 years can give us, it seems radical. And its not. It has a gut response from me of something shifted, being righted and being put into balance. (The importance of women in general, not necessarily any Grail speculation). I bought this book after I read the DaVinci Code, and I thought I really wasted my money on the Code. Because he obviously read this book and here was the meat of it, without the silly fiction. Only good thing, it did prompt my interest to delve deeper. Want another thing to think about with this? Try the August 2005 issue of Discover Magazine.

My husband and I do it to each other before bedtime and find that we sleep much better when we do.

In fact, when I finished with the Metamorphic Technique I actually took the next course: the Universal Principles.The whole concept has to do with the unfoldment of your life being connected to the stages of conception, pregnancy and birth, and how the practitioners will work on the spinal reflexes in your feet without judgment, allowing the energy to release whatever it needs toI remember that there was a group of about 18 people with me in Gaston's house that day. After he explained his story and the many principles of the Metamorphic Technique, I remember that he guided us through one exercise in which we had to choose a symbol. I was the only one who chose the turtle. He told me that \\"I was going to grow through fear\\".I didn't understand what he was talking about at that time, but years later I did. I actually feel a fear and, contrary to what the majority of people do (that is, run away from it), I actually sit with it, feel it, allow it to travel through my body, deliver its gifts of release, unblocking of energies, etc. And after the however-long-it-takes process (it can be half an hour or it can be 10 days!), and after doing my mourning (I will normally have crying episodes, physical pain, twists and turns in my solar plexus, burning energies going up and down my spine, and so on and so for), I feel a huge emotion of release and liberation, and I feel free to take on my next life-path challenge which, invariably will include more of my personal power.I have made this work a way of life because it works and because I can always put my finger on the pulse of what stage of development I am undertaking.This little book is basic and it is a compilation of Gaston St-Pierre's work. I myself find it as an introductory stage, but there is no substitute to taking the course(s).I will always be grateful to this man and his work, and the few days that I spent in the heart of London, healing myself with fellow humans who wanted to know what is all about becoming a butterfly.

This is precisely the method used in cognitive therapy, effective since introduced widely in the 1980s, but not affordable by most of the population.The Recovery method is still going strong after all these years."},{"Title":"Mental health through will-training;: A system of self-help in psychotherapy as practiced by Recovery, Incorporated,","review":"I received an e-mail from a lady who told me that rational-emotive therapy saved her relationship and maybe even her life! And I believe her. But some of us need more heavy &quot;Head Work&quot; I believe. Real &quot;Trench Warfare&quot;. Dr. Low teaches you cognitive-behavioral therapy in this book. But he doesn't leave it there. Daily readings. And ONE TWO-HOUR MEETING A WEEK WITH OTHER NUT CASES! Why am I screaming? Because it is easy to sit at your computer and be mean. But you can't getaway with this in real life. I read most of Low's book after my first meeting. I felt excruciating anxiety for 4 days BEFORE THE MEETING! I'm screaming again, right? Sorry. And my reading didn't really DIG IN until I got to the meeting. You say something and then everybody else contributes and then these cognitive techniques are really cut into your brain. This is the main text. So it is one-third of the program. The other two parts are daily application and one meeting a week. It seems that people with psychological problems make TREMENDOUS demands on themselves. This book will re-wire your brain. And that may take awhile. But remember this. According to Dr. Low, when you cut a &quot;temper&quot; sequence of working yourself up into anxiety and anger or down into depression, you will be automatically reducing those HIGHER STRESSORS which you will have to confront. Let's make it simple. Asking a question of somebody on the street may cause incredible anxiety. Let's say 99. But if you &quot;spot&quot; this scenerio and replace it with realistic thoughts (&quot;I'm not doing anything wrong&quot;) and endorse yourself (&quot;I did just fine&quot;) - this process will reduce the the anxiety of public speaking, say, from 1,000 to 859. Good deal, huh? As Low says, &quot;Strike at the Weakest Link&quot;. If your dog dies and you have a BIG DEPRESSION of 876, let us say, and you practice this program and your spouse dies, you might only get hit with a 700! Whereas, before, it might have been 7,000, given you a stroke, and put you in a hospital. Do buy the book. I could philosophize about all the chapters (Like &quot;The Courage to Make Mistakes&quot;, chapter 30), but I think you now understand the whole purpose of the text. If you don't want to wait, then find out where the closest Recovery, Inc. Meeting is (they are worldwide for those of you in Guam), take 5 minutes, run in, and buy a copy.

It was a lifesaver for our family."},{"Title":"Mental health through will-training;: A system of self-help in psychotherapy as practiced by Recovery, Incorporated,","review":"In most respects this book and it's author, Abraham Low, were decades ahead of their time. Although this particular book was not published until 1950, Low was advancing the methods described in it before he founded Recovery, Inc. (now Recovery International, but generally referred to simply as Recovery) in 1937; a network of mutual-support groups for former mental patients. The technique of \\"spotting\\" thoughts and behaviors in this book that lead to \\"temper\\" (behavior resulting from emotions like resentment, impatience, indignation, disgust, hatred, shame, inadequacy, hopelessness and despair) are comparable toAaron T. Beck's Cognitive TherapyandAlbert Ellis' Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy.In other respects, this book is in lockstep with the year it was published. Readers may have difficulty relating to discussions about the thrill of automobiling at speeds of 50 miles per hour, and new \\"mechanical conveniences\\" like refrigeration, electricity and gasoline. Many of the examples and stories in this book deal with traditional nuclear family themes; with the man as the head of the household and his wife playing a subservient role. It is important to remember that this book is going on sixty years old, and that for its time, its ideas, particularly that mental patients were not hopeless and could recover, were very progressive.It's difficult to resist comparing Recovery withAlcoholics Anonymous(AA) as they were founded independently within just two years of each other and both are voluntary organizations for of people with similar illnesses aiding each other in a common purpose. The million dollar question: why are there only a few hundred Recovery meetings worldwide, while there are over 110,000 AA meetings?There are remarkable similarities between the two programs. Both of them ask members to preserve anonymity, to overcome resentments, to place a premium on creating peace and serenity, to defer gratification for the sake of long-term goals. Both programs see self-centeredness as a cause of illness, encourage discursive thinking and discourage mixing politics with recovery. The only real incompatibility is the method suggested for changing behavior. In AA members surrender to or cooperate with the will of their Higher Power, whereas in Recovery members are expected to follow direction of their physician and \\"command their muscles\\" to behave rightly. In Recovery language, \\"muscles train the brain\\" (a sort of layperson's phrase for a kind ofHebbian learning), in this way, members slowly learn to behave correctly. In each case the result is the same, members slowly learn new habits; one through a spiritual method and another through a secular method.According to the peer-reviewed literature (see specifically Marc Galanter's research on Recovery and Christine Timko's work on AA) they are both effective programs for dealing with the problems members present with, so the deficiency is not the methods.Abraham Low was born in Poland and educated in Austria at the University of Vienna, and while his command of English was solid when he wrote this book, reading some of his earlier works (such hasManage Your Fears Manage Your AngerorThe Techniques of Self-help in Psychiatric After-care) it is obvious that English was not his first language. More than that, it's difficult to tell if he meant this book for Recovery members or if it was written more for an audience of other physicians or professionals interested in the organization. It is detailed and encyclopedic, but it is not warm or inspiring. Low was very good at communicating tactfully and technically, but his writing lacked the charisma of someone like AA's founder, Bill Wilson.Another possibility is that the demographic Recovery deals with, people with serious mental illness, is not as good of fit for being treated in self-help groups as are alcoholics. Frequent meetings may be more of a benefit to alcoholics who are always in danger of a relapse than people gradually trying to improve themselves. AA, however, describes people in their program as changing slowly over a period of time. The third most popular twelve-step group, Al-Anon, treats co-dependency. It would seem that self-help groups are useful for helping people gradually recover from a variety of chronic problems.Recovery's program, as outlined in this book, relies heavily on a physician overseeing Recovery members and working closely with Recovery groups. Low played this role until 1952 when he suggested that Recovery become more of a stand-alone mutual-support organization. AA's program never relied on professional help in the same manner. Still, other programs for people with mental illness that assiduously follow AA's model (such asEmotions Anonymous,Neurotics Anonymousand GROW) each, like Recovery, have yet to move out of obscurity in to the mainstream.With several organizations facilitating support groups for people with mental illness (to the list above you can add the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill and the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance) it could be there is a significant factor of confusion both for individuals looking for a group and for mental health professional referring members to such a group."},{"Title":"Mental health through will-training;: A system of self-help in psychotherapy as practiced by Recovery, Incorporated,","review":"This is a terrific book in good shape.

Its authors, Mike O'Connor and Norman Franks, have given us a terrific little volume about Manfred Von Richthofen, guiding us to the locations of airfields he flew from, his living quarters, his battles, and his death. A central purpose of the Battleground Europe titles is to serve as guides to those who wish to visit battle sites, and this work succeeds wonderfully.Much more than von Richthofen is covered here: He killed dozens of men in combat, and O'Connor and Franks do a great service to those who met their death fighting him. The burial place of every known casualty is listed, and several biographies and photographs of the victims are given as well. There is also this: many of von Richthofen's opponents were too badly burned to be identified by the Germans, or their graves were later lost. Their names can be found on the Arras Memorial and are listed here.As is the case with all the books in this series, this one is very highly recommended even if--and perhaps especially if--you do not plan to tour the battle sites personally."},{"Title":"In the Footsteps of the Red Baron (Battleground Europe)","review":"This is a terrific book from the Battleground Europe series by Michael O'Connor who has also capably executed a series of books dedicated to World War One Aviation, the Airfields and Airmen series.

The second-in-command of the legendary Lewis and Clark Expedition deserves a much fuller discussion than heretofore available. Born in Virginia in 1770, Clark was closely tied to frontier military and Indian affairs throughout his life. He served with Gen. Anthony Wayne at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794, and between 1803 and 1806 he and Meriwether Lewis led the military expedition to explore the Louisiana Purchase to the Pacific Ocean. In 1813 Clark became Missouri Territorial governor, working during the War of 1812 to secure the frontier from British-incited Indian attacks. When Missouri was admitted to the Union in 1822, Clark was appointed by Congress superintendent of Indian affairs, serving until his death in 1838. He was fair, humane, and honest in his dealing with the western tribes.This book is an exceptionally well researched and written life of Clark, whose career, at least in its later stages, outstripped that of Meriwether Lewis. It is must reading for anyone interested in the Lewis and Clark Expedition and the settlement of the trans-Mississippi West. It replaces as the central work on the subject the biography written by Jerome O. Steffen, \\"William Clark: Jeffersonian Man on the Frontier\\" (University of Oklahoma Press, 1977)."},{"Title":"Wilderness Journey: The Life of William Clark","review":"William Clark is best known as the American explorer who joined Meriwether Lewis in heading an overland expedition to the Pacific: but as William Foley demonstrates in Wilderness Journey: The Life Of William Clark, how William Clark has many more claims to fame than his explorations with Meriwether Lewis. Studies have appeared on the two, but this is the first comprehensive biography of Clark's entire life, revealing his service as a soldier, Indian diplomat, and his involvement in US politics and policy-making in the West.

This book completes the picture. Clark was the steady, get-the-job-done, go-to guy, who complemented the mercurial Lewis. Where Lewis made only occasional journal entries, Clark is the principal source of our non-botanical/zoological information because he reliably performed the journaling function. The only criticism I would have of the book is the repeated drubbing of Clark as a slave holder and his perceived mistreatment of York.

Charles Lindbergh took his family to live in England after the trial of Bruno Hauptmann for the kidnapping and murder of Charles and Anne's first son. But even after the trial, the Lindberghs were harassed and they feared for their son, Jon's, safety. In England, for the first time in their married life, they had a home of their own and privacy. They also travelled extensively and this book tells of their impressions of Hitler's Germany, among other places. To read now what Anne and Charles thought of Germany is enlightening, especially when considering Charles Lindbergh's public speeches trying to keep America out of the war. The Lindberghs moved from England to an island off the coast of France for a time and Anne's descriptions of living in such an environment with an infant and unpredictable conditions is fascinating. Anne also writes about many well-known people of the period, such as Alexis Carrel, Lady Astor, Gertrude Stein, Hitler, and others. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"War within and without : diaries and letters of Anne Morrow Lindbergh, 1939-1944","review":"War Within and Without is not an easy book to read. It must have been an even more difficult book to publish. Lindbergh gets points for exposing herself and this period in her life to public scrutiny.This book contains her journals and letters from the period 1939-1944. Although many things happen during this time, the focus of the book is on her husband and his involvement with the isolationist America First Committee. It is by turns painful and almost offensive to read the young Lindbergh as she attempts to defend her husband for his opposition to US war participation. She points out correctly in the introduction that they did not then have the benefit of historical hindsight. Still, it is difficult not to cringe as you read about Charles and his decision to criticize the Jews for pushing the US to enter the war. Anne herself during that period is tarnished by the charge of fascism as she publishes her book The Wave which tries to make sense of the changes in Europe.These journals are an invaluable historical window into those conflicted pre-war years in the US. The national reluctance to act has now been almost forgotten, and it is a rare person who is willing to admit that they had taken a stance against US participation. I doubt that there are many texts like this one.Although Lindbergh wrote many books which were not journals, her style of writing is ideally suited to the journal form. Her prose is as lovely here as it is in anything that she ever published. The descriptions of her love for Charles or the death of a beloved family dog ground the political aspect of the book and are powerful enough to bring tears to the eyes. The fact that I so often disagreed with her politically only made her more human-- and ultimately made the book more moving to read.Highly recommended for virtually any reader interested in history, essays, or journal writing."},{"Title":"War within and without : diaries and letters of Anne Morrow Lindbergh, 1939-1944","review":"This book interested me primarily because I am a life-story writer - and I knew Anne Morrow Lindbergh primarily as the wife of famous aviator Charles Lindbergh. I knew she had a child kidnapped and murdered, but beyond that, I knew nothing about her.This book opened my eyes to the beautiful woman she is - the poet, the lyrical parent, the mother-author-woman-lover-of-life that allowed us to see the private, family side of a world famous marriage.Politically, the Lindberghs went through a lot of heat during this era, which we get to witness, front-and-center. She doesn't sugar coat things, she speaks openly and plainly.I especially enjoyed hearing about St. Exupery - and the relationship they cultivated, and AML's love for Rainer Rilke made me love her even more, as I love him, too.Reading this one volume makes me hungry for more of her words - and after reading this I also see her daughter, Anne published a memoir as well. I look forward to reading more."},{"Title":"War within and without : diaries and letters of Anne Morrow Lindbergh, 1939-1944","review":"Read the introduction to get the gist of this book.

One hopes that now, following her departure, the family will release the unedited, full diaries. Many questions remain--what really happened in the death of her first child? What happened after the published diaries end? How did this educated, wonderful woman really feel about her uneducated, doctrinaire hero-husband? How did she feel about her later affair?Despite their brevity, the diaries provide satisfying reward to readers, including some humor. Lindbergh complains about not having time to write, which seems odd to the reader who realizes she has a mass of servants taking care of all the daily details."},{"Title":"The Black Veil","review":"Having read this book several times cover to cover since it came out in 2001, I have grown to appreciate it more with each read. I think the main mistake previous reviewers have made in assessing the Black Veil is blaming this book (which I find is mistakenly categorized as a memoir to appease our label-loving publishing industry) for its inability to live up to their expectations of an average, straight-forward autobiography. It seems to me that Moody, as an esteemed experimental writer, had no such designs for this kind of total recall and those who foist their preconceptions of the memoir upon this book will indeed be disappointed.For the open-minded reader however, Moody has a much more interesting offering. Using himself as a means of reflecting upon the vast scales of life experience, Moody connects discussions of family and friends, alcoholism and drug use, literature and music, to grand themes such shame, criminality, and tragedy in both personal and national identities. Using Hawthorne's story, The Minister's Black Veil as a touchstone, (think Proust's madeleine but more integral) Moody achieves the rare feat of making his particular life story feel universally important."},{"Title":"The Black Veil","review":"In the last pages of this memoir, Rick Moody expresses his worry about &quot;leaving something out.&quot; Yeah, Rick, you left YOURSELF out of your own memoir. Though Rick's experiences of alcoholism are interesting and self-reflective, the weaved in literary criticism of Hawthorne's parable attenuate any emotional potential of the memoir. We can feel bad for Rick, but we better shut up quickly and think deeply about his examination of what the black veil means. Also, as one reviewer pointed out, Rick just seems wordy here. He actually writes sentences like, &quot;i don't know how to describe this...&quot; Well then don't!Ahh.... . the days of The Ice StormHowever, after reading the first chapter of this book (even the first page), you will think you are in for a treat. So it is worth just reading the first chapter in a book store."},{"Title":"The Black Veil","review":"With \\"The Black Veil\\", Rick Moody has written a brilliantly realized memoir which I suspect will one day be remembered as well as Frank McCourt's \\"Angela's Ashes\\". Indeed there are many passages throughout \\"The Black Veil\\" which rank alongside \\"Angela's Ashes\\" for their elegant literary quality. If some readers - and I might add, book reviewers such as the infamous Dale Peck - have been frustrated with \\"The Black Veil\\", then I suspect it may be that Rick hasn't written nearly as engrossing a tale of survival as the one depicted by Frank in \\"Angela's Ashes\\". It also probably has hurt Rick that he has told his tale in a nonlinear fashion, jumping to and fro between various points from his childhood to early adulthood, while trying to mingle successfully with his memoir, writing a thoughtful literary exploration of the Nathaniel Hawthorne short story \\"The Minister's Black Veil\\" (The entire story is reprinted in its entirety at the end of \\"The Black Veil\\".) and of his own biographical odyssey in search of Joseph \\"Handkerchief\\" Moody, the ancestor who inspired Hawthorne's short story.Among the more memorable passages are those relating to Rick's mental collapse and rehabilitation in a psychiatric clinic in Hollis, Queens (a New York City neighborhood in the borough of Queens) back in 1987. Indeed, I might add that I found most refreshing his acknowledgement of personal flaws such as drinking which led to his hospitalization (This is in stark contrast to what I read in Frank McCourt's \\"Tis\\", in which I perceived - whether correctly or not - that Frank was more willing to blame others for his own problems rather than acknowledging his own responsibility.). I also found rather interesting his relationships with his brother, sister, parents and grandfather, though I shall note that none of these are nearly as memorable as the anecodotes which Frank recounts of himself and his brothers in the dirty lanes of Limerick in \\"Angela's Ashes\\".Rick Moody has demonstrated in \\"The Black Veil\\", his novels and short stories that he is among the most interesting literary stylists of our time, and perhaps among the finest in our generation (Editorial Note: Rick and I were classmates in a fiction writing seminar in college taught by British feminist science fiction novelist and short story writer Angela Carter.). I suppose that's why I regard him as among my favorite authors, ranking behind the likes of William Gibson and Jonathan Lethem, in my personal list of twenty five favorite writers (And yes, of course Frank McCourt is on my list, though I will plead the fifth regarding his placement on it.)."},{"Title":"The Black Veil","review":"If you are a Rick Moody fan, hang on to your seats for a penetrating read.I can't talk about Moody's work without disclosing that I have an intense personal identification with it, having grown up in his \\"neighborhood\\" in CT, NY and New England during the 70s and 80s. As a brooding, depressed and chaotic gal for the first 25-30 years of my life, I've shared countless external and internal experiences he describes. I've read the Ice Storm, book and screenplay several times and it never ceases to overwhelm me, how Moody has the ability to capture nuances of this place in time culturally, and this multidimensional place in the lifetime of more recent American generations. I've grappled with whether his experience, and my experience are terribly unique culturally to the NY area (or to drunk and psychiatric \\"cases\\" and the communities that surround them) and have come to the conclusion that if you are a child of any suburban/urban American community, and you experienced any kind of the spiritual void and disconnection that seems to present during these decades, and in his writing- then you'll probably find this memoir quite engaging.Sometimes I think of the Cohen brother's \\"A serious man\\" as a more irreverent and lighthearted mirror to the Ice Storm (thought this may speak more to the contrast between Jewish suburban culture and WASP suburban culture in a delightful way- same situation, different interpretation) and I weigh in more on the side of universality than uniqueness. I'm curious how relevant this material would feel to current 20 or 30 somethings, though obviously certain elements of the experience of disaffected youth and young adults in the US are universal and Moody draws aspects of events that occurred in the 90s and new millennium into the discussion in an effective manner.I'm clearly still working it all through in the 5th decade of my life, and Rick Moody has offered me a nice mirror for (hopefully) \\"useful\\" contemplation that might serve both myself and others. I think the tapestry he's woven together of works from classic American writers and modern American history makes his story (our story ?) even more relevant. For someone who is trained as a therapist and not a writer or reader, it offered me an enlightening, personal and very rich view of some of the great American writers such as Hawthorne, who I had only briefly come in contact with in high school English class through a THC fog. If you tend to think about life, American life, your life, our history and what it may or may not mean, and you like to reflect on it beyond a simple chronicle of war stories- then I think you'll find this memoir penetrating, provocative and illuminating."},{"Title":"The Black Veil","review":"What Moody does with this book is simultaneously brave and daring. He combines the skilled prose and sort of literary scholarship that would interest a classic literature fan with a gritty portraiture, unsparing, of modern substance abuse addiction. What I particularly enjoyed about this book was that, contrary to most memoirs where the goal is to aggrandize the life a person lived, this book is a haunting, fascinating portrayal of the dark side of a life's events, despite fame and early wealth.Should Moody desire to stroke his own ego, he would likely have had much to say--but in my view, the dense prose, philosophically complex constructs, and haunting moments in this piece made him all the more admirable for the reader. For isn't this what most of us would like to read and feel empowered by--the unglossed struggle and triumphs of those who take life by the throat? That one's private fears and foibles are actually part of the larger continuum that *is* being human?I adored this book for its language, its elegance, its playfulness, its skill, and its invention. If you are a reader who enjoys a narrative that challenges you, this book is a lovely excursion into reading something vividly and artfully done.But, what's better, it did not presume to give me yet another public persona with a spin-performing revisionist history team embellishing on the life of someone less than interesting. In my view, Moody is interesting in all projects he undertakes. And although, in all honesty, Moody's work has always fascinated me--from his early stories to essays I've read through the years--I was interested he would be so bold as to do a memoir, so picked it up and read it before other fiction on my to-read list, and thoroughly enjoyed his Black Veil.It moved me. It made me think and question. It was worth my time and I read it in one day.A piece like this gives one the feeling of viewing something mysterious and hard to capture, something seeming both hard as a plate of steel and simultaneously ephemeral and fragile as a butterfly's wing. The Black Veil is truly a fascination piece that wraps and binds a man's search for his ancestors neatly with (both literature as a departure point and) his own search for self-definition that is unflinching in many regards. In general, I hate memoirs. I loved this. For the thinking people who enjoy fine language and whimsical flight for the intellect, I do highly recommend.

Moody, the middle child, had divorced parents, the divorce event having transpired in 1970 when the family was living in Darien, CT. The home had been quiet. His father's favorite book was MOBY DICK. He was a financial planner. 'Black Veil\\" refers to a Hawthorne story, 'The Minister's Black Veil'. Presumably the writer used a Moody ancestor in the story, Joseph Moody.Both the author and his grandfather, the owner of a General Motors dealership, were exaggerators. Moody's grandparents lived in Norwalk, CT, after living in Winchester, MA, where the dealership had been located, and Rowayton. The Grandmother occupied the second floor and the Grandfather the basement. The Grandfather told the children to get out of the house and do some work.Hawthorne tried to write his way out of his life circumstances before getting married in middle age. After college Moody goes to San Francisco to do something new. The landlady is a psychiatrist.Holidays, back East now, are given over to unquiet waiting. At Christmas there is sorrow, there is the burden of guilty conscience. Gifts have obligations attached to them. Christmas is a contested day with sets of parents. Moody's 'slough of despond' is alleviated by drinking.Newton Arvin and Leslie Stephens wrote about the Hawthorne story. The veil may represent the sick soul. In York, ME, the author and his father visit the grave of the Reverend Joseph Moody. He died in 1753.Melancholy is a way of thinking. After having a panic attack Christmas, 1986, there are therapist visits and drugs prescribed. Then in March Moody experiences irrational thoughts, blackness. He ends up in a psychiatric hospital in Queens in 1987.The writer began the book seeking to conceal nothing. It is an interesting amalgam of family history, personal history, and descriptions of the writer's craft. The Hawthorne story is presented at the end of the book."},{"Title":"The Black Veil","review":"I hesitate to write anything negative after reading the editorial claim for &quot;one of the most admired writers of his generation&quot; who has written a &quot;searing, brilliantly acclaimed memoir&quot;, but alas... .

Unfortunately, after I slogged through one-third of it, I paged through the rest trying to find something to restore my initial enthusiasm, but without success. His memories, insights, experiences, and writing seemed no more interesting than my own or those of any blogger on the face of the planet.

Moody finds that he may be the descendant of a Reverend Moody who was fictionalized as the title character of Nathaniel Hawthorne's &quot;The Minister's Black Veil.&quot; Digging through obscure histories and travelling about New England in an attempt to find out more about the man behind Hawthorne's self-loathing minister, Moody creates a sense of very powerful parallels to his own struggles with severe depression and drugs.

He is unique, a savant.He collected hundreds of studies, most from 1935-1965. I don't think he was wrong on any one of them.The only medical man I know of who paid any attention to him was Beecher, who used about 10 of his articles in writing his famous New England Journal of Medicine article on unethical studies.Eventually, unethical studies have become much less frequent. This may be because of the notoriety these types of studies garnered in the general public. No matter what the scientists said, the man in the street felt studies like these did not pass a smell test.I am interested in responses to him from the medical establishment. Most of the responses can be categorized as biased because of appeal to authority, without any discussion of the facts, or, more interestingly, an ad hominem ad hominen attack on Pappworth. In other words, they argue that his work was problematic because he made ad hominem attacks."},{"Title":"Human guinea pigs;: Experimentation on man","review":"The book suggests that there are limits to the permissibility of experimants on humans.

I'd love to check out the Tasks that specifically cover new or improved features and tools. New or improved features and tools are noted within most of their corresponding Tasks, though.My other minor little wish is for the helpful screenshots and examples to be printed in color within the book. While the black-and-white image quality in the book is pretty good, I found I could get a better perspective when I instead used the downloadable color images via the online companion site. At the same time, I understand the much higher cost of printing in color.

There have been hundreds of commentaries written on Romans over the past few centuries, but Murray's has joined the small cluster at the top of the 'classics' list (with Charles Hodge and Martin Luther, and the less orthodox Barth). All future commentaries will continue to reference Murray, as the standout work of its kind for the mid-20th century.In addition to its usefulness for preachers and seminary students, it is also a nice window into the kind of teaching that was coming out of Westminster Seminary in a golden period of productivity when that school was THE leading Reformed school of the English speaking world."},{"Title":"The Epistle to the Romans","review":"John Murray is an important figure in the Presbyterian and Reformed faith in the 20th century. His commentary on Romans is thorough and insightful, building on the heritage which he inherited from the great Reformed thinkers from Luther and Calvin to B. B. Warfield and Geerhardus Vos, the latter under whom he studied at Princeton. Murray shows particular sensitivity to the Old Testament background of Paul's epistle to the Romans and Paul's consciousness of his place in the history of salvation, a history which to Paul culminated in the person and death/resurrection of Jesus the Christ. Dr. Murray's admirable treatment of Paul's doctrine of the Spirit may only be surpassed by his successor at Westminster Theological Seminary, Dr. Richard B. Gaffin (and by his professor at Princeton, Dr. Geerhardus Vos). Murray's work is scholarly but not so that it would be inaccessible to the intermediate student. Murray does interact with his contemporaries; but could have taken it a litter further. The only criticism against Murray's Romans is his treatment of chps. 9-11 where he fails to break out of the dogmatic mould, and thus fails to capture the movement of the epistle from the anteclimax at the end of chp. 8 to the climax at the end of chp. 11. Overall, however, Murray's is a helpful and insightful commentary, a must for students and pastors."},{"Title":"The Epistle to the Romans","review":"'God's righteousness revealed in the gospel is the provision of His grace to meet the exigency of His wrath. And nothing discloses its glory and efficacy more than this.' p xxivNo one is more able or probably likely to succeed John Murray in explaining God's own glory as the sole cause of redemption. The cross as symbol of God's power to reconcile fallen man to Him, is misunderstood to be a sign in that for Jews it constitutes an offense, and for Greeks, folly. And yet, given all the hostility that came by the fall, and with the subsequent glorification of man's wisdom and power as supreme, God simply calls. And calls effectively. The covenant of grace was divinely promoted as such revelation moved onto the world scene. It was as such most successful strategically that the apostle should write the Epistle to the believers in Rome - seeking to teach the nature of the grace of God and thereby fulfill his commission as apostle to the gentiles.'There is no discrimination arising from race or culture and there is no obstacle arising from the degradations of sin. Wherever there is faith, there the omnipotence of God is operative unto salvation. This is a law with no exception.' 1:28Romans 3:24 is the ground of our confidence: 'Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus'. God settles the relationship issue once and for all through justification and adoption, and in this way He places the new life on a sure foundation. Murray's syntactical construction connected v 24 to 22a: 'a righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ, unto all who believe', as clauses that are parenthetical in the pericope. He then stated the importance of the doctrine of justification in unequivocal terms: 'It is perhaps not irrelevant to observe that this is the first time in this epistle that Paul uses this verb directly and positively in reference to what is the leading theme of this epistle.' Again in support of free grace, Murray calculated its staggering implication: 'As we have found already, the fact of universal sinfulness bears directly upon the other fact that there is no discrimination among believers - they all are beneficiaries of the righteousness of God.' 1:115 The indiscriminate preaching of the gospel to all, regardless of creed, color or condition, strengthens our need to understand the free offer of grace by, firstly, putting forth the sufficiency of Christ to save us from our sins, and, secondly, by teaching that God is willing to save all those He efficaciously calls.As Murray explained elsewhere:'God's call, since it is effectual, carries with it the operative grace whereby the person called is enabled to answer the call and to embrace Jesus Christ as He is freely offered in the gospel.'Redemption: Accomplished & Appliedp 96To add weight to his already convincing exegetical argument, Murray honed in on the two catalytic terms Paul used: 'freely' [Gk: dorean] and 'by His grace' [Gk: autos charis]: 'Merit of any kind on the part of man, when brought into relation to justification, contradicts the first article of the Pauline doctrine and therefore his gospel.' The sovereign will of God's good pleasure invites us only to try harder to come to grips with Paul's true meaning: Paul said that it is God's goodness [Gk: chrestotes] that leads us to repentance (2:4). Because we are powerless to effect salvation's actualization in and of ourselves, we have no choice but to accept that God, having promised eternal life, is able to make good on His promise: 'No element in Paul's doctrine of justification is more central than this - God's justifying act is not constrained to any extent or degree by anything that we are or do which could be esteemed as predisposing God to this act.' 1:116"},{"Title":"The Epistle to the Romans","review":"Murray provides a superb reformed understanding of the book of Romans.

We all have learned that the political generals of the North did not accomplish much and were generally a drag on the Union effort. Mr. Goss shows that that is not so. Contrary to the prior reviewer, who clearly didn't read the book very carefully, the author develops his case carefully, year by year, showing how the political generals served the Union cause well in the early years and gradually were edged out as their services were no longer necessary. He makes a careful case that they should have been kept longer.He carries the story of the professionalization of the US Army right up to World War I, making it clear that, while General Scott has always been venerated as the officer responsible for that acheivement, Generals Grant and, later, Sherman are just as important. Interestingly, the Union tried to combine professional generals with political generals in somewhat the same way the Prussian army did in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, although the US Army's attempt failed.Mr. Goss also makes it clear that the Union was faced with little choice but to recruit political generals at the start of the war, as the army grew several hundred times at the same moment that its officer corps shrunk as the Southern leadership left the Union. The need to expand the Army many times explains why both the British and US military for so long kept many more senior officers on duty than they really needed (I believe that the Royal Navy has more Admirals than they have ships).One more thing must be noted and that is that the author wrote the book while serving in the US Army and taught history at West Point. Making a case for the political generals of the Civil War is hardly the party line for the US military, but it shows the degree of freedom military intellectuals have in the services today. The result is that we are turning out a generation of military intellectuals who are superior to their civilian counterparts. Whether it is Lewis Sorley, HR McMaster, David Petraeus (whose doctoral thesis is available on the web) or any of a host of others, they are unrestrained by political correctness, doctrinal conformity or any of the other fetters of free inquiry. The result is a magnificent new tradition in American letters."},{"Title":"The War Within the Union High Command: Politics and Generalship During the Civil War (Modern War Studies)","review":"The author takes 210 pages to come to a conclusion that is apparant after 50.

One summer day, Robin finds a lost puppy and names him Ruff, hoping to keep him, but his insufferably stuffy aunt Isabel not only refuses to let the dog stay, she plans to have it \\"disposed of\\" in the morning. Robin isn't sure what she means by \\"disposed of\\", and he's not about to wait around to find out. Rescuing the dog in the dead of night, Robin and Ruff run away to hide themselves in the anonymity of London. After a misadventure with a would-be thief, they are rescued by a man named John Heminges, an actor at the Globe Theater whose company happens to include, among other people, an already famous playwright named William Shakespeare.Heminges takes Robin and Ruff to his home for a night's sanctuary, but their stay extends through the whole of the winter if 1596-97, as Robin makes himself indispensible to the household and is accepted as an apprentice into the Queen's Company. Among the actors, we meet Shakespeare himself, Heminges, Richard Burbage, Will Kempe, and other giants of the Elizabethan stage, rehearsing a new play in which Robin is given a bit part, about a pair of star-crossed lovers named Romeo and Juliet.In \\"The Wonderful Winter\\", Marchette Chute gives us a fascinating, true-to-life tour of Elizabethan London and the inner workings of the Elizabethan theater. We get to know the actors not only as artists but as people. We learn how a play is put together from its conception in the mind of the playwright to its first performance. Robin is a delightful invention, but the actors in the story were all real, and Chute invests them with a vitality that makes them people we wish we had known personally. \\"The Wonderful Winter\\" is a great introduction for young people to the literary genius of Shakespeare and the world he lived in.

When young Robin Wakefield finds a lost puppy, he acquires the resolve to keep the animal - yet one of his aunts refuses to allow this, forcing Robin to run away to the streets with his cherished new animal friend. Adventure, danger, and excitement ensue in this captivating tale which is enthusiastically commended to the attention of school and community librarians for inclusion in their fiction collections for young readers."},{"Title":"THE WONDERFUL WINTER","review":"This delightful, heartwarming, rich-in-detail story for older children is one of the finest works of fiction for young people in the English language, and it is wonderful to see that it has been reissued after languishing for so long in the out-of-print file. Set in late sixteenth-century England, it follows roughly half a year in the life of the teenaged Sir Robert Wakefield, who has run away from home to seek a new life in London. Robin encounters members of the theatre company from the Globe Theatre, and is taken in by John Heminges (an actual historical figure), a friend and colleague of William Shakespeare. Robin's adventures in Elizabethan London and in the theatre, where he becomes an extra of sorts, are highly entertaining, and the story's conclusion is satisfying to adults and children alike. This is a great read for kids 9 to 12; younger children might enjoy having it read to them. They'll have fun without realizing that they are learning a lot in the process."},{"Title":"The Oxford Book of English Short Stories","review":"A good collection for readers interested in England and also well written stories. High quality tales."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"I'm no fan of the Clintons. Not by any stretch. In fact, I really, really don't like them. But that doesn't mean I have to pay blind fealty to every book criticizing them. In fact, some anti-Clinton books are just plain bad.This is one of them.There's no doubt that the last days of the Clinton Administration were marked by truly strange events: pardons-for-hire, vandalism at the White House, blizzards of new regulations, even an unprecedented, overblown ceremony in a hangar at Andrews Air Force Base upon which the new ex-President insisted as a sendoff. All that has been documented, and documented well.Unfortunately, the late Ms. Olson wasn't content to stick to the facts and the law. Rather, she descends into bitter polemics, resorting to ad hominem insults, some of which are rather childish and embarrassing.A more scholarly, and more sober, analysis of the last-minute antics of the Clintons would have been far more convincing. And Ms. Olson, a former Federal prosecutor, was quite capable of such.Moreover, this book was obviously rushed to print and given only cursory attention by Regnery's editorial staff; it's filled with typographic errors and poor sentence construction.I, like many Americans, was shocked to learn that Ms. Olson was killed in the attack on the Pentagon on September 11. I truly did appreciate her commentary. Unfortunately, this book does not do justice to her legacy."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Just when you think you know all the slime about the Clinton's, you read another, well documented book on their partnership with the devil. How anyone could vote for any Clinton after reading this book defies reason. It would be nice to see an equally researched rebuttal from the left so folks like me can remain fair. It's too bad we lost a writer like Barbara Olson. Educate yourself and read the book while checking out the validity of her sources."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Barbara Olson wrote THE political biography of Hillary Clinton (\\"Hell to Pay\\") and had just completed \\"The Final Days: The Last, Desperate Abuses of Power by the Clinton White House\\" when she became one of the victims of the hijacked flight that crashed into the Pentagon. The world lost a powerful and clear voice that defended the rule of law and all that is good in America; her family and friends encouraged the publishers to proceed with making this book public, and for that we must be thankful and extend to them out sympathy for the terrible loss they have experienced.Ms. Olson, for years an investigator, attorney for the Department of Justice, prosecutor, and counsel for the United States Senate had the instincts and the skills to know where to focus her interest in exposing the most corrupt and vulgar White House in modern times, perhaps ever. In its final days the White House of Bill and Hillary ratcheted up the frequency and intensity of their abuses of power, and this book traces all the known instances of egregious misuse of Presidential authority at the end of their term. She describes those last days as a mad feeding frenzy.The style of the book is restrained and sedate, and that is perhaps part of the source of its devastating power. It entirely lacks in histrionics, and as it lays out the extraordinary abuses, category by category, an awful monument to corruption and venality emerges from under her steady hand. A monument which is most likely to become the real (and much vaunted) \\"legacy\\" of the Clinton presidency.The book contains no major breakthroughs showing additional corruption on the part of the Clintons. The history that is covered is well known to those who make notes of such things: the corruption of the \\"pardon\\" powers of the presidency, i.e. clemency for cash, clemency for political deals, clemency for friends; pardons for terrorists, pardons for cop killers, pardons for drug dealers, pardons for those who might help elect Hillary; and the taking of things that belonged to the people, not the Clintons: furniture, clothes, art, and gifts; nothing new here, but when it is all aligned and organized, and we are shown how it all worked, it is likely that even hardened cynics (of either party) will not failed to be amazed and horrified. The enumeration of their corruption is astonishing; and the power of the book to move the reader lies in that meticulous accounting of the awful things this counple did during their last days in the White House.Occasionally the book reveals fleeting looks at how the people in contact with the Clintons reacted, and what they did. A favorite: \\"...marine guards failed to execute a right face to stand facing [Clinton's] back as he walked away. The marines somehow relearned this maneuver on January 20, 2001, when the new commander-in-chief [] took office. \\" The book also cites the three Bartlett's Familiar Quotations which are his verbal legacy: \\"I...didn't inhale\\"; \\"I did not have sexual relations with that woman...\\"; and lastly \\"It depends what the meaning of the word 'is' is...\\"The writing is smooth and compressed (216) pages. It has a full set of chapter notes, and a good index. It is an excellent resource for those interested in the history of the Clinton presidency, and it is a wondeful final tribute to Barbara Olson: may she rest in peace."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Olson's style is engrossing and entertaining and recounts many of the abuses of the final days of Clinton in office. I particularly liked the last half which concentrates on the outrageous pardons. However, the books overall validity is undermined by several annoying statements reflecting a right wing bias--this is particularly true in the first half of the book. Some statements are essentially neither right nor left but just plain dumb. On page 2, she tells us Clinton, during his presidency, \\"had experienced nothing that could be called a major international crisis.\\" On page 21 she talks about pardoned 60s radicals that were part of a plot to establish a Black republic in the South. This wer are told was \\"...part of the Communist Party policy that did not view blacks or Jews as genuine Americans.\\" A Black Republic in the South was part of a 1930s Stalinist policy modeled on an earlier Leninist_Stalinist policy of national self determination for oppressed minoritiesin Eqastern Europe and elsewhere. It was abandoned after the 30s and in any case it had nothing to do with not viewing Blacks or Jews as genuine Americans. She continues throughout the book to refer to the Clintons' liberal-left agenda, forgetting that what left rhetoric we heard from Clinton was just that--rhetoric from a lying politician whose real agenda as a member of the Democcratic Leadership Conference was to move the party and the nation to the right--check out his actions on world trade, labor and environmental lwas, welfare, etc. He was probably the most conservative Democrat since Grover Cleveland. There are other problems with this book but space limits further comment."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"What an important book for \\"centrists\\" to read. The American public knew what it was getting in the Clintons, so they can't complain. All they can do is not to make the mistake again when Hilliary runs. Do not doubt that she will. Her lust for ultimate power will not be satisfied until she claims the presidency. As Olson says late in the book,\\"At a time when the United States stood as the world's only superpower, the Clintons exercised presidential power as if they ruled an emerging third world dictatorship. Pardoning a brother and an ex-girlfriend, pardoning billionaire fugitives, allowing drug kingpins to buy influence, buying votes, and acting like an abosulte monarch - these are the actions of tin-horn autocrats in less respected countries.\\"Live (and read) and learn so the same mistake is not made again. Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"One way or the other, this is bound to be a controversial book. As one who is not an American, I can only judge the book for what it is and what I have learned through the media - and that has been plenty! There will be die-hard supporters of the Clintons (no matter what they do or fail to do) and then, there will be those who bless the day they left the White House. One true thing about Barbara Olson, she was a high-spirited woman who called &quot;a spade a spade.&quot; This book is no exception. She aptly describes the payoffs, pardons and lootings that went on during the Clintons final days at the White House. Did Hillary stay with her husband to feather her own political career? The Clintons were true public figures and played the part well. They always smiled for the cameras, but who ever really knows what goes on behind closed doors unless, as with Bill, the indiscretions becomes public knowledge! However, according to what is written here, it appears the Clintons did little more than make a mockery of the postion of presidency, abuse their power for their own gain, and make a parody of everything the position of President of the United States of America represents. However, those judgements are best left to a Higher Power than us mortals here on Earth.The reader's viewpoint of the book will be an individual affair. Either you accepted the Clintons for who they were, or you saw them as ordinary people trying to take extraordinary advantage of their positions. As for Barbara Olson, she was one who pursued justice and spoke out for what she believed in - for that she earns my respect. Her book, &quot;Hell to Pay&quot; is also highly recommended reading and most deserving of a five-star rating. Barbara, will be sadly missed. She was an acclaimed and gifted writer, and I am sure she is now &quot;an angel on someone's shoulder&quot; trying to make right the political injustices of the world. Barbara, may you find eternal peace."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"I guess I shouldn't have been surprised when reading about the abuse by King and Queen Clinton based on how they acted for 8 years, but my jaw just dropped over and over again with every page, and every chapter. Clinton lovers beware. You'll have a hard time turning a blind eye after reading this."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"When I first received this book I was a little skeptical. Would this just be a hatchet job on our ex president? The cover and title seemed to indicate that it was going to be a very one-sided right wing slam blaming every thing wrong in the world on anti-Christ Bill. But what I found out was a book that was extremely fair. The author even seemed in some strange way enamored by President Clinton's charisma and his obvious political skills. She paid kudos to him for the way he managed the government during his tenure in office, praising him for keeping a robust economy and a fairly good job at handling foreign affairs. Ms. Olson was in no ways vindictive to the ex-chief.What the author did do though was provide a synopsis of the dealings of Mr. Clinton during his last days in office. There was no specious charges brought out by this book. As a matter of fact all the allegations brought up by Ms. Olson are known and proven to have occurred. What the author has done is culminated many of the main factual news stories into a book showing the tawdry dealings of our Ex-President.One of the best points of the book was the complete lack of hyperbolic arguments or vitriolic chatter from the author. It was obvious that none was needed since the ex-presidents actions speak loudly enough. However, she does quote many of the Clinton apologists near the end of the book. And it is very fascinating that once Clinton was out of office his staunchest supports began to spew forth such verbal tirades and denunciations against him and his amoral actions. (Perhaps it is these quotes from liberals that many of the negative reviewers have confused as the authors thoughts???)Anyhow, I gave the book only 4 stars because I think it lacks depth in discussing the most pernicious action of the president in his last few days in office. That is the issuing of executive orders or legislation by presidential fiat if you will. While Ms. Olson does spend one chapter discussing these issues she only hits a few of the goodies that William Jefferson Clinton signed into law. For any conscientious American I suggest you search out all the EO's that were signed. They are easily available on the web. Once you have read them you to will be outraged at the abuse of this privilege.I hope that all Americans have learned their lesson from the incorrigible megalomaniac we had in the White House.Character does count not political party affiliation."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Barbara Olsen died a brave and tragic death, and is rightly commemmorated for it. But that does not mean her final work should go without scrutiny.Olsen was one of the smartest of the recent crop of female conservative pundits, and I always found her insightful. But she had an anger about her that sometimes clouded rational argument. That unfortunate quality is on display in this book.The shenanigans of the last days of the Clinton Administration were pretty blatant -- even once-loyal Democrats were appalled. It seems, then, that an objective, almost detached, examination of that period would have been more effective. Olsen instead deploys rancor and emotion. The result: The book comes off as one more right-wing attack, not a factual assessment of very real dirty doings."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Barbara Olsen's last book documents in detail the excesses and avarice of the Clinton's final days in office. In her usual pithy and clear-sighted way Barbara sums up the Clinton years and exposes their desire for control and power."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"It is very rare that the media only gives you part of the true story. Most of the time the public finds itself literally assaulted by gossip based on fragmentary evidence regarding the moral lapses of people in high power. However, in the case of the Clinton administration, that rule can be thrown out the window. Here for the first time in &quot;The Final Days&quot; is the chronical of the truly abhorent denouement of the Clinton administration. I don't want to give anything away, but let me assure you that you will be startled by the overwhelming evidence of the abuse of power. Why was this not brough to our attention more forcefully in the media? Government tampering? You be the judge. This is the most tremendous comment on the abuse of authority since Ben Jonjak's brilliant &quot;Glorious Failure.&quot; However, the effect of &quot;The Final Days&quot; is made all the more shocking because of its status as a work of non-fiction."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Elegantly worded, elegantly written. It should put to rest the pitiful whining of any remaining Clinton defenders who are still deluded enough to think he was a good president. For their infantile minds nothing can be done by Clinton to diminish his stature and no criticisms can be levied against Clinton that are not \\"right-wing partisan hack jobs\\".This book is succintly written with very little fluff. It does not try to come across as a deeply researched book but rather a well-organized gathering of the damning evidence against our previous president. It discusses the clemencies, the pardons, and the executive orders that had no justification for taking place. Who would have thought that an analysis of just the final days of a president would be enough to cement his standing in the bottom tier of our national leaders.Barbara Olson lets the facts speak for themselves with a passion and thoroughness that is both a joy and a sadness to read.

It amazes me how the Clinton supporters just write off everything as a \\"right-wing consipiracy\\". If you ever notice, they never have an answer for anything. No answer for \\"Travelgate\\", \\"Filegate\\", Vince Foster, Whitewater, Rose Law Firm, Monica Lewinsky, Paula Jones, Jennifer Flowers, the China connection, Marc Rich, on and on and on. Well, Barbara Olsen does have some answers. She reveals the true nature of the Clintons. The Marc Rich pardon is the most fascinating section. It proves, completely, that Bill Clinton had no respect for law, morallity, the presidency or the American people. It's very interesting reading, but it will make you angry. Unless, of course, you are a liberal Clinton supporter. At wich point you will cry \\"right-wing\\" consipiracy and insert your head back into the sand."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"I found Barbara Olson book quite unimpeachable. Though most of her research is nothing of earth shattering headlines it is easy to believe Bill and Hillary Clinton did spend their final hours trying to sabotage the incoming administration.

Most people will enjoy it as it reinforces their sentiments about the Clintons a year after they have left the Whitehouse.Clinton supporters will be unable to put it down.

Hopefully, someone can pick up the torch that Barbara Olson carried."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"It just breaks my heart that Barbara was taken from us so soon. Just as she was getting over her unhealthy obsession with the Clintons, her life was ended by fanatical terrorists who hijacked her plane and crashed it into the Pentagon on September 11. Fortunately for us, she was able to get this worthy tome completed, if not fact-checked, so that we could read her breathless prose one last time. Because of her untimely demise, we will never see her planned books on the 138 convictions of former Reagan officials, or the companion book to The Final Days where she reveals in-depth knowledge of the last minute pardons by George HW Bush of Caspar Weinberger before he spilled the beans on Iran-Contra.In the Final Days, Barbara reveals all of the abuses of power and crimes by the Clinton family that ultimately resulted in no convictions. There are the gifts that the Clinton's received from well wishers which were so tacky in comparison to the house in Bel Air and the million dollar speaking fee's that were forced upon Ronald Reagan. But more importantly she provides us with many quotes from such notables as Bareback Andrew Sullivan who refers to Clinton as a &quot;psychologically sick man&quot; in a moment of supreme irony. Or there is noted historian, Forrest McDonald who asks what Clinton did during his administration other than give us &quot;eight years of peace and prosperity&quot;. Indeed. More importantly, Barbara goes after Hillary Clinton for having the gall to run for an elected office and actually win, whereas the true path to power is to marry a well connected lawyer who gets appointed to all of his positions in goverment.We will all miss Barbara Olson (I'm sure Larry King, more than others!). She provided a valuable service in ways she never understood, and now, obviously, never will."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"The late Barbara Olson, who a few years ago wrote the anti-Hillary screed \\"Hell to Pay,\\" now gives us \\"The Final Days,\\" a supposed hot expos&eacute; of the winding down of the Clinton Administration. Her choice of title is doubtlessly meant to echo the Watergate-era Woodward-Bernstein book of the same name (which chronicled the downfall and disgrace of Richard Nixon) and is also doubtlessly meant to draw parallels between Nixon and Bill and Hillary Clinton.To Olson, there is no evil too black and no crime too squalid to be associated with the Clintons. She indulges in endless personal attacks, mean-spirited jibes, and rehashed \\"scandals\\" which were proven false long ago. She maintains the art of Clinton-hating at an almost pathological level, accusing the Clintons of every imaginable crime under the sun, ranging from murder to treason, with the possible exception of molesting Chelsea.She even manages to exhume Vincent Foster's 1993 suicide, which she and other professional Clinton-haters insist on branding as \\"suspicious\\" long after five separate Federal investigations all examined Foster's death and concluded it really was a suicide. She sounds like a bad thriller writer, begging us to keep paying attention to her, throwing around specious accusations of wrongdoing, all the while promising the explosive, convincing piece of evidence that never does appear.Tragically, Olson was killed in the September 11 terror attacks just before the book was published (surprisingly, there were no hints that the Clintons organized the attack just to bump her off), but this has helped insulate the volume from the criticism is so richly deserves. Any critique is answered with an admonition not to speak ill of the dead. And that's a pity, because Olson's final book is a masterpiece of spluttering incoherence, showing a woman so caught up in her own ineffective rage that \\"The Final Days\\" reads more like a never-ending free-floating stream of rambling hostility than anything else."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"The late Mrs Olson has offered us a thoroughly researched summary of the Clinton's era of public (dis)service in our nations highest office. Her use of quotes by the leftmedia in chapter 13 is of particular interest, for it was only during their final days in office that the blinders seem to have disappeared form the leftmedia's eyes.After reading The Final Days, those who continue to support any Clinton and still champion the legacy left by the sleaziest pair to ever to attain this high office I suggest that red and white striped canes be a requirement. This might cause someone to rescue them from the path of an oncoming truck for surely they can't see it."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"This book was a good read and Miss Olsen has a good grasp of the english language. But, to be short and sweet, this is just right wing conservative drivel that is still trying to drag Mister Clinton through the mud. Now that we have another draft dodging president and a former cocaine user in the White House, I understand that is must be difficult to find someone to to tarnish. When I read the \\"exploits\\" of misses Clinton, it sounded more to me like a Rush Limbaugh tirade then actual research. Basically she talks alot, but, she does not SAY anything. Clinton got busted for sex, Nixon got busted for abusing the Power of the CIA and the FBI and paying theives and assasisns to spy on his enemies. I will take a \\"draft dodging inhaler\\" any day over the Nixon type slime that she seems to be secretly defending."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"As a writer Olson lacks the dedication to detail and fact checking that are the mark of a good historian. I've done quite a bit of studying of the Clinton years and I've read a lot of books about his abuses of power. However too many of them lose site of the truth in their quest to convict. Now I don't like Clinton one bit - but there is no point inventing facts when the truth is damning enough. If you want to read a factual account of the Clinton scandals with a conservative viewpoint, dig up some old National Review magazines at your public library.

Barbara Olson writes with a style that is engrosing and entertaining while never straying from the facts. I highly recomend this book."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Barbara Olson, the late wife of Ted Olson who was George W. Bush's legal representative during latter's infamous rise to the presidency (and now rewarded with the post of Solicitor General in the Bush Justice Department), was on Larry King Live, Fox News, and every other cable news network during the last few years of the Clinton administration, bashing anything and everything the Clintons did. It was a relentless pursuit by the extreme right wing to discredit the Clinton administration and ignoring its legitimate accomplishments.This book just furthers that impression. It appears to be written with preconceived notions, starting with the first Clinton campaign to the last days of Clinton's presidency. It totally ignores the fact that Clinton was ELECTED by the American people because the elder Bush, with the help of the Reagan administration, had made a mess of the economy, and had refused to accept the recession of the early 90s. It ignores the elder Bush's pre-occupation with the pursuit of Manuel Noriega and Saddam Hussein and ignoring domestic policies.It ignores the fact that, after the 1994 elections, Newt Gingerich wielded his power as speaker of the house (of Congress) to obstruct the conduct of government, or that conservatives like Jesse Helms in the Senate refused to confirm several dozen Clinton appointees for no particular reason and went on record to say just that, and otherwise refused to co-operate with Clinton - almost as a matter of policy!It also ignores the relentless harrassment of the Clintons and their supporters by Ken Starr, the special prosecutor appointed by a panel of three ultra-conservative judges in the 10th District. Starr spent over $40 million of taxpayer money, winning a few minor convictions but, essentially, wasting most of that sum in what were wild goose chases (especially with the Whitewater investigation.) His successor finally dropped the investigation during the last days of Clinton's presidency.It also ignores a couple of additional legal issues: a) why, despite rigorous efforts by Starr and his supporters, no charges could be brought against (now New York Senator) Hillary Clinton regarding her activities at the Rose Law Firm in Arkansas, and b) why the ultra-conservative Rutherford Institute was paying for Paula Jones' legal action against Bill Clinton.Unfortunately, this book is full of political angst and frustration, and truly expresses the vendetta the conservatives still felt after they lost the White House after 12 years.

To a person who has never heard of the Clintons it will be almost unbelieveable. (At least in two decades I hope that a president acting in the way would be unbelieveable.)However with the Clintons still hovering all I feel is exaustion. We don't expect any better from them. Barbara's tome describing the pardons, the gifts the book advance and the dodging of this stuff just can't get out of the box. We know who and what these people are, of COURSE they acted this way. I've seen it for 10 years and just want them to go away.Only they won't go away. It is WHAT ABOUT BOB without Bill Murray's good qualities. Reading about this years later just leaves me tired.Unlike Chris Hitchens who's words are so passionate and his insights so unique that I kept reading, Barbara just can't generate the STORY.

The main complaint I have with The Final Days is that there is scant historical context and not much of a base point to which to compare the Clinton White House. This is hardly an accident. For instance, few would disagree with Olson that President Clinton made some ill-advised decisions regarding last-minute pardons. Unfortunately, many in the American right have gone as far as to accuse President Clinton of emboldening the 9/11 hijackers because of his pardons of some Puerto Rican nationalists (who had served sentences longer than current federal sentencing guidelines and were not convicted of killing or injuring anyone). However, President George H.W. Bush pardoned a Cuban terrorist whom U.S. intelligence and law enforcement believe was responsible for the downing of a civilian airliner (killing 76 people) and whom the FBI indicated had \\"repeatedly expressed and demonstrated a willingness to cause indiscriminate injury and death.\\" If any President's pardons indicated softness on Bin Ladenesque terrorism, it was President Clinton's predecessor.The torrent of venom in this book is so unrelenting that Olson flailed the Clintons and their associates for petty, often imaginary shortcomings. For instance, Olson wrote: \\"Contrary to the Lincolnesque myths created by their Hollywood friends, neither Hillary Rodham nor Bill Clinton rose from log cabins or poor circumstances to become America's most luminous couple. Both came from solidly middle-class families of sufficient means to enable them to attend privileged-and expensive-private educational institutions such as Wellesley, Georgetown, and Yale.\\" The idea that Bill Clinton could have attended Georgetown or Yale without financial aid or scholarships is silly. Similarly, the supposed attempt by unnamed Hollywood friends to depict Hillary's upbringing as proletarian was nothing more than a fiction fueled by Olson's jaundiced projections.Moreover, Olson was intent on portraying every accusation against the Clintons as established fact, even to the point of repeating urban legends. Olson wrote: \\"Some even noticed that when Clinton was President, Marine guards failed to execute a right face to stand facing his back as he walked away. The Marines somehow relearned this maneuver on January 20, 2001, when the new Commander-in-Chief, President George W. Bush, took office.\\" This petty smear of President Clinton, debunked by several urban legends web sites, is especially pernicious because it besmirched the reputation of the guards, who have no dog in the fight. No big surprise: Olson referred to President Clinton's mother as \\"a barfly who gets used by men.\\"I tried to give The Final Days zero stars, but Amazon doesn't give that option. Although The Final Days is a run-of-the-mill Regnery screed, I suppose it deserves one star for at least not repeating the smear fed to the press by the Bush White House that members of the Clinton White House trashed the White House, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of damage. I guess that should count for something."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"As I started reading this book, I thought Olson was writing about another first family. It's clear to see Olson's obsession with the Clinton family all through the book which shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. I found it amusing how she ranted on about the pardon issue, avoiding the draft, how Hillary ran health reform behind closed doors, but neglected to mention the pardons given by the previous presidents. Clinton was elected for two terms as president of the US., guess that shocked them all. Sorry, I couldn't recommend this to book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"What a terrible and painful irony that this book should be Barbara Olsen's final work because it was the very same Bill Clinton, who as President did absolutely nothing when given the chance to take down Osama bin Laden. And yet, this book is probably as fine an epitaph as anyone could ever write or conceive.This is a very well documented distillation and revelation of all of the final abuses of power, corruption, pardons, executive orders, outright theft and other felonious behavior by two of the most vile, venal and vindictive people to ever occupy the \\"People's House\\" at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in the District of Columbia.Some of the other reviewers have dismissed this book as nothing more than a \\"right wing slam\\" against the Clintons. They are probably part of the same 42% who elected the thief and liar in the first place and will defend these two depraved criminals till the crack of doom. What they failed to see is that the late Mrs. Olsen was an incredibly fine writer, who unlike her subjects, was possessed of an extraordinarily high degree of character, honor, integrity and personal courage. Something that Slick Willie never, ever had.Mrs. Olsen had the uncanny ability to document her case in the minutest detail and this single volume expose is her legacy to us and to the world of journalism. I say that because Mrs. Olsen was tragically killed when the airliner she was flying on was crashed into the Pentagon by the same terrorist fanatics who attacked the WTC in NYC. Courageous to the end, she called her husband several times to keep him and the nation informed as to what was happening and it was that courage, that grace under pressure that makes her a true Patriot, a hero and an outstanding American. Something neither Slick or Hillary will ever qualify to be called.The really outstanding service that this book provides is the revelation of additional debauched conduct by the power couple that was never released by the mainstream media and the reason for that is obvious. As Bernard Goldberg (himself a liberal) points out in his current bestseller BIAS, the maninstream media is so biased that they would never totally hatchet their darling power couple. This deliberate failure on the part of supposedly professional journalists is despicable. Barbra Olsen, an attorney in the Justice Department and the Senate was a truer, more professional \\"journalist\\" than Dan Rather, Peter Jennings, Tom Brokaw or Charlie Gibson could ever hope to be.This book could be called a labor of love. It is so because Barbara Olsen loved freedom and the United States. She loved and embraced individual liberty and she held fast to her principles that the United States of America was, is and must always remain a nation of laws. The Clintons abused that notion from start to finish and it begs the question: if Bill Clinton lost his law license for 5 years as a result of his vile deeds and obvious lies, why didn't Hillary? After all, she was the co-president and just as culpable in the misconduct that permeated the White House during the 8 year Clinton \\"reign.\\"What this book also does so magnificently is point out how the American people could be so blind and uncaring about all these crimes and the fact that the press 'white-washed' most of them. It is particularly saddening that much of what we learn here comes to us as a \\"dying declaration\\" from a woman so full of life, honesty, dignity and love of country that her contributions are yet to be accurately measured.Every calumny uttered by Hillary about \\"vast right wing conspiracies\\" rings shrill or hollow when the reader learns of her perfidy during the couple's final days at the White House. What is especially frightening is that the people of my former home state New York, were SO UNBELIEVABLY STUPID as to buy into her \\"I am a victim\\" act that they elected her the junior Senator from the state, thereby giving her a public platform to continue to spin lies, twist the truth and spew venom at people who disagree with her.Thousands of people died on 9/11; one of the real tragedies is that Barbara Olsen was one of them. While her husband will grieve for her for years, the rest of us have lost a true friend and defender of freedom. That loss will leave a large hole to fill. Had she lived, I am sure that Mrs. Olsen would have continued to investigate and expose the nefarious behavior of NY's junior Senator. We can only thank the God that Hillary secretly reviles that there was a Barbara Olsen who had the courage to stand up in the face of tyranny and to expose that tyranny and corruption for what it really was - SLEAZE.My heart goes out to Ted Olsen and the rest of his family as well as to Barbara Olsen's. All Americans who love liberty will miss her. I can't say the same for Bill and Hillary.Paul Connors"},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Some readers would accuse her of hate. Barbara simply exposed truth that we as a people are often too busy or careless to look into. Is it hate to expose that so many were released from prison on the last days of a Presidency?To keep our people free we need to care about what happens in our government. This book has a lot of sources, and quotes are usually without right wing invective. I think Barbara's book hit the mark on information we needed to know about for our future. But alas, America tends to forget.May we remember Barbara and her life, she died on 9-11, she was on the plane that crashed into the Pentagon."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"This is the definitive explanation as to why the Clinton presidency was so obscene. Barbara Olson reveals in detail the abuses of both Bill and Hillary, focusing on the frenzy of last minute pardons and the meglomania of this couple. For instance, in regards to the FALN pardons, this &quot;was the first time the president used his pardon power to grant clemency to terrorists.&quot; There are numerous incidents explained in detail that haven't been revealed until now. As Mrs. Olson states at the end of the book, &quot;To avoid repeating the errors of the past and reliving the same situation of the Clinton years, the American people should ponder the Clintons' lifelong goals in light of decades of hard and provable history.....When Ameicans think about the Clintons, they had better not forget about our yesterdays.&quot; Barbara, we won't forget and we will be forever grateful to you."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Barbara Olson wrote this comprehensive guide to fraud, malfeasance, and deception in the Clinton White before she was tragically killed by the 9/11 terrorists. While there is not a lot of new information here, Olson puts the sordid tale in perspective and adds much useful analysis and commentary.Especially useful is her take on the 24th hour Clinton pardons, which the main-stream media chose to cover lightly, if at all. There is clear evidence here of an influence peddling scandal with these 2001 pardons, with the most flagrant case involving fugitive Marc Rich. After reading this, one must ask how did the Clintons win all those elections, especially the New York Senate race, after Mrs. Clinton was clearly exposed by eight years of negative reports. My only concern now is that it might be possible for one of the Clintons to win another national election. Like Rocky or Freddy Krueger, we may find them back again, if not enough Americans read this book.The sections on Mrs. Clinton's ethical lapses are outstanding as well. Again, I think that the main-stream press did not adequately cover that Mrs. Clinton violated Senate rules in taking a large advance on a book deal. Technically the rules do not apply to a senator-elect and apparently no rules apply to the sitting First Lady. Remember that Newt Gingrich was nearly run out of town for taking a much smaller book advance."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Barbara Olson is a hero. She actually accomplished something in her life and her last act on this earth was trying to save the lives of those on her doomed plane. She, not the former First Lady had the qualifications to actually be a senator. She got to where she did by hard work and accomplishment. That ethic is brilliantly displayed in the book, \\"Final Days.\\"After reading both \\"Hell to Pay\\" and \\"Final Days\\" it is clear to me that the media has done little to let truth be known about the Clinton regime and its inevitable effects(of it)on the nation's future. The sleazy deals and power grabbing of the last eight years will come back to bite us all hard. This book is sure to shock even the most politically savvy reader.Ms. Olson did not wake up one day and say, \\"I don't like the Clintons.\\" She formed her opinions from facts she gathered during a federal investigation. The lies, slimy dealings, cover-ups and the ultimate abuse of power--the pardons--will leave any reader doubtless that William Jefferson Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton were not only co-presidents, but also co-conspirators in a myriad of slimy acts which will eventually stain the former President's legacy forever.May Mrs. Olson rest in peace knowing that she was a hero, a true patriot and the absolute antithesis of her subject."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Actually, I believed every word. What an embarrassment the Clintons were to this country. The only people who would doubt the veracity of this tome are those die-hard Democrats who would forgive Slick Willie and his partner-in-crime of all wrongdoings and those people from New York who must justify their voting for Hillary. A five-star book!"},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Olson's legacy will be as a champion of justice, she exposed the corruption of Bill and Hillary Clinton and this book is the best yet!Unlike the claims of those bitter liberals.. Bill Clinton is a very dishonest man and while people were looking the other way at his deeds, Barbara was putting them in the notepad. Unlike the claims of the bitter liberals this book is chalk full of facts.This book exposes the fact Bill Clinton refused to use the DOJ for screening pardons and there is no way people like Rich and Vignali would have been approved by the DOJ.This book follows the pardons in depth and it's a must read"},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"This will be one of the books that will be read years from now by people wanting to know about the corruption and decadence of the Clinton administration. It is well researched, and the references are right there at the end of the book.The book does not break a lot of new ground. Had one read the newspapers, watched the news shows and perused the internet one would have already heard about what Olson discusses in pretty good detail, but Olson summarizes things well in a compact book that is easy to read, and actually is entertaining to some degree.Ignore the bizarre pro-Clitonites who continue to prevaricate about these scandals, saying either they didn't happen or don't matter. They're taking a page out of the Clinton playbook, meaning they believe if they just deny everything over and over people will be dumb enough to believe them. The fact is these scandals did happen and they matter a great deal.The documentation is there. It's here in this book, it's in media reports, and it's in other books about the Clintons. One of the keys to making sure that we never wind up with someone like Bill Clinton again is to understand what happened here. And this book goes a long way towards explaining that. Read it, and remember it."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"A tragic accident took an educated articulate young woman by being a passenger in the plane that crashed into the Pentagon. Barbara Olson's book The Final Days is her research into the Final Days of Bill and Hillary Clinton's final days in the White House.Her style of writing is breezy and sounds so much like her, when I watched her on many of her TV appearances. She did a lot or research in this book and it brings back all the memories of those last days of the Clinton Presidency. She brings up so many things besides the pardons, the executive orders and decrees that Clinton carried out until his final hours. How family members manipulated things to get pardons and the biggest of those was the Rich pardon.We will miss Barbara and her intellect and her strong belief in the law."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Who was it who said something to the effect that anyone who wants to be president is, because of that desire, unfit to hold the office? Perhaps the more one desires it, the less fit one is. And has anyone ever wanted it more than Bill (and now, Hillary?).The second quote -- or paraphrase, since I don't have the article at hand -- comes from George Will, who said that Bill Clinton was not the worst president we've ever had, but was the worst man to ever hold the office. Olson's book well supports his contention."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Barbara Olson left behind as part of her legacy a truly engrossing account of the greed driven Clinton administration, particularly in its last months. Barbara's literary style is breezy but compelling. When I completed reading this book I was paradoxically filled with admiration for the author, who presented a detailed and damning story on the subject matter, and at the same time I was filled with revulsion toward both Bill and Hillary Clinton. Such greed and abuse of power on both their parts likened them to me in my mind to the Marcos regime in the Phillipines during their reign of power in the 70's and 80's. Their collective attitudes could be summed up with the following: Do the right thing? What's in it for me? Do the wrong thing? Grease my palm and I'll consider it. Those who value history should consider Ms. Olson's book for their personal library. It's a keeper and a call to vigilance to voters when they again consider questionable characters for high office."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"In the final days of their co-presidency, the Clintons flipped off the American people one last time. After two terms of lies, corruption, slander, and immorality that were their trademark, was another book about the Clintons really needed? If only to reveal their contempt for the nation and Constitution, if only to see that eventually even Democrats had had enough-- yes, this book was tremendously necessary.The Clinton presidency was like none other. The man who called late at night to proposition Cyd Dunlop in the hotel room where she stayed with her husband, who was forced to confess on national television to his affair with Gennifer Flowers, brought a New Republic editor to conclude that his persistent adulterizing revealed \\"a frightening lack of self-control.\\" Arkansas troopers admitted that they had procured more than a hundred women for Clinton.One of those women refused to be cowed and became the bane of his presidency: Paula Corbin Jones would pay dearly at the hand of the savage Clinton slander machine. Eight years later, in return for immunity from prosecution, Clinton landed a sweetheart deal in which he admitted knowingly violating a judge's order to tell the truth. A federal court held him in contempt for making false statements in a federal proceeding, and Arkansas disbarred him for five years.Upon leaving the White House, they rather unsubtly opened gift registries with luxury retailers, and Clinton acolytes took the hint. Expensive White House art was shipped to the Clinton Library, and furniture to their new upstate New York home. Terry McAuliffe financed that home and was rewarded with the leadership of the Democratic National Committee.When Newt Gingrich accepted a $4.5 million book advance, Democrats howled in protest, so he returned the advance and settled symbolically for one dollar. When Mr and Mrs Clinton accepted $8 and $10 million respectively for their ghostwritten books, there was no outcry. Senator Hillary refused to have her deal vetted by the Ethics Committee.Hillary is one tough cookie. Author Michael Tomasky: \\"With Hillary, there was something about the way she answered questions that only raised other questions.\\" In 1991 she reportedly chewed out an Arkansas state trooper: \\"Where is the [g-dm] [f-ing] flag? I want the [g-dm] [f-ing] flag up every [f-ing] morning at [f-ing] sunrise.\\" Did she really once claim her husband and daughters's used underwear as a tax deduction? She interned for Communist Party lawyer and Stalinist Robert Treuhaft and later admitted to a journalist that \\"I want to run something.\\"She demonstrated her respect for New York taxpayers by renting her Manhattan offices at more than half a million dollars per year, more than double the amount paid by her co-Senator Charles Schumer. Bill billed the government $830,000 for the entire 56th floor of the Carnegie Hall Towers, almost three times more than any other president.But most flagrant was the spasm of executive orders and pardons issued on the very last day of his presidency:* Drug offenders, including one money launderer for the Colombian Cali cartel.* Major cocaine dealers: one made a $200,000 payment to Hillary's brother, and another $200,000 went to his law firm one day after convicted swindler Braswell was pardoned. A $175,000 donation from this same crook to the Republican campaign was returned when they learned of his felony record.* An automobile dealer convicted of fraud was pardoned two weeks after his friend made a $500,000 pledge to the Clinton Library.* Symbionese Liberation Army guerilla Patty Hearst, and hard-Left celebrity Susan Rosenberg of the Weather Underground who had killed a guard and two police officers.* In return for votes for Hillary's campaign, FALN terrorists (who hadn't even petitioned for a pardon) and four ultra-orthodox New Square fraudsters.* Whitewater partner Susan McDougal, three of his Cabinet-level appointees (Espy, Cisneros, and Deutch), and the first ever presidential pardon of a family member (his half-brother Roger).* Billionaire Marc Rich, who sold oil to South Africa (then a pariah nation), traded with Iran after Carter had embargoed it for holding the American Embassy staff hostage, terrorist Libya in contradiction of an embargo, the Soviet Union, and Cuba. He tried to buy oil from Iraq during its embargo after invading Kuwait, and committed the largest tax fraud in American history. Having fled to Switzerland and living in luxury, his wife donated $15 million to Clinton causes. Rudolph Giuliani was so incredulous that he asked an aide to recheck the news, and still refused to believe that Clinton would have pardoned this fugitive who had avoided a trial and never spent a day in prison.Seeminly unruffled during the preceding eight years of perfidy, this last orgy of abuse was too much even for fellow Democrats and liberals.A DNC official: \\"Mr Clinton didn't just take the White House china; he took its soul and flushed it down the toilet.\\" Chief of Staff under Carter, Hamilton Jordan declared that if he had petitioned a pardon of a contributor to his library \\"he would [...] probably have fired me on the spot.\\" New York Times columnist Bob Herbert: \\"With Mr Clinton at the controls, the party won the White House twice. But in the process it lost its bearings and maybe even its soul.\\" Dick Morris, who helped his 1996 reelection, opined that history would judge Clinton as \\"one of the most corrupt US presidents.\\"And New Republic columnist Andrew Sullivan: \\"We asked for it. We elected him.\\""},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Jefferson has Dumas Malone, Lincoln has Carl Sandburg, and Bill Clinton has Barbara Olson -- the biographer who, if there's any justice in the world (for him, if not for her), will be associated with his name for the rest of time.Olson's final book is a chronicling of the last weeks of Bill and Hillary Clinton's co-presidency. She gives us a quick, but important, survey of a number of Clintonian outrages, including massive land and power-grabs, Senator-to-be Hillary's shameless and desperate panhandling of expensive gifts before she fell under the Senate's ethics rules, and Slick's international 'farewell tour' of foreign countries -- a field trip that cost taxpayers billions and gained us, diplomatically, less than nothing.But where Olson's analysis really shines is in her efforts to get to the bottom of 'Pardongate,' the wave of commutations, clemencies, and pardons that Clinton dished out, some literally in his last minutes in office. About a quarter of the book is spent detailing Clinton's most outrageous pardon, that of multi-billion dollar tax cheat Marc Rich. The last quarter or so discusses his other pardons, handed out to a rogue's gallery consisting largely of relatives, business partners, ex-girlfriends, Cabinet members, and cocaine dealers.Even as skilled a reporter as Barbara Olson is at a loss to explain why Clinton chose to pardon who he did, or why he consulted so few people before issuing the pardons. One of Olson's theses -- both provocative and believable -- is that Clinton was so outraged at being compelled, on his last full day in office, to sign a deal with the independent counsel admitting his wrongdoing in the Lewinsky case and disbarring himself from the practice of law, that Clinton chose to lash out at his own 'persecutors' by granting clemency to criminals whom police and prosecutors had spent years pursuing. As one of Clinton's own Justice Department lawyers noted, 'He [Clinton] just can't stand law enforcement' (p. 141).Ultimately, Olson helps us put Clinton in context, marshalling observers from Left and Right before drawing her own conclusions. Forrest McDonald, acclaimed historian of the American presidency, asks simply, 'What did [Clinton] get done? Was there any major legislation he was responsible for? ... Everyone approves of what he's doing, but no one can say anything he did' (p. 212). More directly, Andrew Sullivan of The New Republic notes, 'In Bill Clinton, we had for eight years a truly irrational person in the White House, someone who, I think, lived on the edge of serious mental illness. He was and is a psychologically sick man' (p. 199).It's clear to see why -- if reports are correct -- Hillary Clinton was so anxious to get this book silenced following Barbara Olson's death. If, as it's said, people in democracies get the leaders they deserve, we can at least repay the favor by making sure our 'leaders' get the biographers they deserve. There's no question that Barbara Olson is the biographer Bill and Hillary Clinton deserve, and it's just one of many reasons to mourn her untimely death that she will no longer be able to chronicle this venal and dangerous politician ... and her husband, America's most corrupt president.Let this book be (part of) her memorial."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Barbara Olson gave a very personal account of Bill and Hillaray's granting of favors, lying, and manipulating during the last years in the White House. It was a powerful read because of Barbara's professional relationship with the Clintons as a lawyer charged by the US Goverment to aquire information on suspected misdeeds of Hillary. I was a little put off by Barbara's pejorative tone at times but I came to understand her attitude after reading &quot;Hell to Pay.&quot; She has devoted years of research into these two people and has shown how their past ideologies have been inflicted in a secretive, manipulative way on the unsuspecting citizens of America. I feel it should be required reading for anyone who wants to support Hillary in any further elected office. It is well worth anyone's time who wants to have a better understanding of what really happened behind the closed doors. It is very readable because Barbara's writing style keeps the reader engaged."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"I've just finished reading this book and agree with those who gave it five stars...It's well written, deals with facts, with touches of Barbara's humor, and with excellent notes backing up the quotations...It's interesting to note that many of the most damning observations come from George Stephanopolous's book, as he was a close advisor to Clinton during his administration, and certainly knew the Clintons as well as anyone did. If I have any criticism of the book it might be that it is a much better assessment and portrayal of Hilary than of Bill, probably because Barbara had previously written an excellent book about Hilary, which I am now reading, Hell to Pay."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"I hope everyone who cares about democracy will read The Final Days.Reading this book is a poignant experience for several reasons. First, reading about the last days of the Clinton administration seems like thinking about the good old days compared to our current trauma with the terrorist attacks on September 11. Second, Ms. Olson, the book's author, died in the plane that crashed into the Pentagon on that day that will live in infamy. Third, the issues she raises in this book no longer receive any significant attention . . . yet are probably a greater threat to our democracy than any group of terrorists ever can be.Democracies require honest leaders as well as leaders who appear to be honest. Regardless of what you think about former president Clinton and Senator Clinton, the latter standard was breached. Many people will feel that the former standard was also breached. What this book provides is a fairly detailed outline of the actions taken in the last few weeks during the Clinton presidency, and explores the actions for their meaning. Although you will have read about almost all of these matters before, there's a cumulative sense of inappropriateness that is overwhelming when they are considered together.The president has the unlimited right under the Constitution to pardon anyone for any crime against the United States. There is no review of this right. The book details the 140 pardons and 36 sentence commutations that Mr. Clinton provided on his own authority in the waning days of his administration. Many of these went to those with access, political clout, and who had made political contributions and payments that benefited the Clintons. The most outrageous one was to Marc Rich, a tax-fraud fugitive from justice, who had been running his billionaire operations from Switzerland for years, through contacts made by his former wife and co-owner of his holdings, and generous contributor to the Democrats and Clintons. Other than Marc Rich and his ex-wife, there is probably no one who thought Mr. Rich should be pardoned. Big-time drug dealers were released. The president's brother, Roger, was pardoned. Susan McDougal, who was in prison for contempt for refusing to testify about the Clintons' involvement with Whitewater, was also pardoned. You may also remember that Puerto Rican terrorists were part of the group, just before the New York senate election (where there are 2 million Puerto Ricans). Many of these pardons and sentence commutations were not reviewed or recommended by the Department of Justice in the normal legal process. You get the idea of how all this appears. At one point, Senator Clinton's brother was even accepting payments to represent those seeking pardons. He reportedly agreed to return the money after this became public, but Ms. Olson was not able to find a record that this occurred.The Final Days also describes the way that Senator Clinton maneuvered the timing of her book advance so that she would not be subject to the Senate's ethics rules, and receive $8 million.What was new to me was that there was concerted fund-raising to get furniture for the Clintons' new house in Chappaqua, New York. Furniture and art from the White House were also sent there, apparently including some that belong to the United States.Senator Clinton's new office will cost the taxpayers twice what Senator Schumer's office does in the same neighborhood because Senator Clinton took twice as much space. You probably remember that the president's new office near Carnegie Hall was going to cost so much that he decided to move into less expensive space in Harlem, after a major uproar in the press.In The Final Days, you will also learn about last minute judicial appointments (something many presidents have done), creating new commissions and making appointments to them, 4000 pages of new government regulations, and creating 5.6 million acres of new national monuments.The details of the president's plea bargaining over his lying in the Paula Jones case deposition are also included here.Ms. Olson also questions the $500 million spent on foreign travel by the Clintons, using the president's trip to Vietnam as an example of how relatively unimportant these visits often were. Cumulatively, one year out of the eight that the president spent in office was involved in foreign travel.As a way to put these actions in context, Ms. Olson quotes liberally from what political figures and press commentators had to say. In some cases, she only had to quote Democrats to make her point.The pattern that emerges is that the Clintons would stick their necks out to gain an advantage. If no one complained, fine. If someone did and there was a political backlash, they would slowly backpedal. For example, Senator Clinton complained about the Puerto Rican terrorists being pardoned. The defense would often be a legalistic one, that would probably be appropriate, if extreme, for a private citizen.The book's weakness is that the author has a flair for dropping extreme rhetoric into her descriptions that exceed the details that she presents. \\"Think of a suburban swap meet combined with an open house at a bail bondsman's office.\\" \\"Liberal-left progressive politics meets traditional corruption resulting in a synthesis of boundless arrogance and entitlements.\\" These characterizations were really unnecessary because quotes from the Clintons themselves could have provided all of the rhetoric anyone needed for this book. As the former president said about his choice of a new office in Harlem after the protest about the expense of a mid-town site, \\"That's why I went to Harlem . . . Because I think I am the first black president.\\"Where do your actions cast doubt on your motives and honesty? How can you both be honest . . . and appear to be so as well?"},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Barbara Olson's skill as an investigator comes through well in the writing of this book. She focuses very exclusively on the abuses of power that occured in the last few days and hours of the Clinton presidency. She uncovers the arrogance that was commonplace in their administration. While I was always tempted to give the Clintons the benefit of a doubt, this book totally changed how I viewed the Clinton presidency.Olson picks apart each Clintonian denial and points out their faults with solid evidence. Whether or not you liked Bill Clinton, this book will open your eyes. I was personally surprised at how many legislators from Clinton's own party criticized his 11th-hour actions.Although \\"The Final Days\\" can get a bit dry in sections, and is perhaps a bit long-winded, it gets the point across well."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"I closely followed the daily news stories during the Clinton Administration and wondered if Olson's book would be only a simple retelling of Clinton scandals already too familiar. It is not and that is what makes it an engrossing read well worth the time. For example, in these times after September 11, 2001 we are concerned to give no quarter to terrorists, yet exaqctly two years earlier fourteen of sixteen convicted and unrepentant violent Puerto Rican terrorists from the FALN accepted a clemency offer made by Bill Clinton, in spite of the strenuous counsel and objections of every law enforcement agency and of Puerto Rican authorities, themselves. Clinton's unprecendented offer coincided with Hillary's bid for election as New York's junior senator and an effort to gain support in the Hispanic community there. Olson describes in detail the normal criteria for presidential pardons, gives a history of government policy toward Puerto Rican radicals beginning with the Truman years, and describes the reaction of both prosecutors and victims of those released to live freely among us. These things are background material we did not often get in our newspapers and TV news programs.In more than eight years of the two Clintons we became numb to the daily dribble of news bits about scandals. Olson's book gives a good concise reminder of what the Clinton's were and are so that those who read it might not become seduced by their kind again. The book is especially good as a reminder of Hillary's determined ambitions to be powerful coupled with the extent of her Marxist indoctrination. This book is recommended reading for anyone who might be faced with the choice of voting for Hillary or Bill for public office. Now I am eager to read Olson's book on Hillary \\"Hell to Pay.\\"This is not a simple Clinton bashing book. It is a timely, well-documented reminder of the principles on which our nation is based and how even ardent supporters of the Clintons finally decried the many ways the Clintons flushed those principles down the toilet for personal gain."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Barbara always was a tireless defender of decency, her final gift to us was this book. She chronicles the staggering level of corruption and abuse during the final days of the Clinton Reign. Most chilling of all, she sends a warning about Clinton's dismissive attitude toward terrorists, and his complete refusal to heed those in his own cabinet who tried to block his pardons of no less than 16 vicious terrorists as well as those who never could convince Clinton that politics does *not* always come first, above national security.It's especially tragic that she lost her life as a result. Keep this book on hand as a reminder."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Barbara Olson lived a life of such unflinching integrity and veracity that even in death she continues to defy terrorists. Sadly ironic in its title, \\"Final Days\\" is a clarion articulation of the former first grifters in their ultimate Clintonian moment. Beyond Monica, Paula, Jaunita, Kathleen and legions of Jane Does, more so than Travelgate, Filegate, Pay-per-slumber parties in the Lincoln Bedroom, campaign finance chicanery, quid pro quo contributions from Communist China, and the who' who of other ethical transgressions, even outdoing Waco, the Elian Gonzalez raid and kidnapping, missiles fired at questionable targets merely to create diversions etc.: perhaps no disreputable shenanigan was as quintessentially Clinton as the unfathomably dissolute shamelessness that marked his/their last days in office.The much talked about Marc Rich pardon has become an appropriate symbol of the entire eight years, but Mrs. Olson does a commendable service by clearly detailing the effrontery of his (Rich's) misdeeds, and an even more skillful demonstration of the President's specious and insulting attempt to justify this shocking act. To add fuel to her raging fire, she quotes former President Jimmy Carter who openly stated \\"I don't think there is any doubt that some of the factors in his pardon were attributable to his large gifts. In my opinion that was disgraceful.\\"However it is her dissection of the many other pardons that really makes this work a vital read. The hodgepodge of unrepentant drug dealers, swindlers, and--with tragic irony--terrorists who received Clinton's boundless 11th hour clemency should elevate the 42nd president to a unique plateau in American history; one currently occupied by Benedict Arnold.As in Mrs. Olson' previous handling, \\"Hell to Pay,\\" she authentically treats the Clintons as an entity of one. Few would deny that their loveless marriage is anything more than another one of their poorly concealed shams, but the conjugal co-conspirators are forever intertwined. Both know where countless bodies are buried, and if their self-perpetuating union ever comes asunder, each would gleefully destroy the other. Both are experts at dishonestly denying any knowledge of their sins, and while the trust that graces most marriages is visibly absent, either Clinton will artfully lie to save the other one.\\"Final Days\\" is not only a fitting obituary to the Clinton Presidency; it is also a tribute to its author. Throughout the heavily annotated work she meticulously skewers the Clintons' for their devotion to nothing more than their own advancement, and by truthfully uncovering their tracks, she reveals what kind of person she was. Of the Clintons, she writes, \\"it all came down to one thing: Character. Here the gage rests firmly on empty.\\" In Barbara Olson's tank the gage constantly registered \\"full to overflowing.\\" As in her frequent TV appearances, Mrs. Olson never shies away from telling it like it is. On occasion her frank quotes from the depths of the Clintons' well-known, foul vocabularies will make readers cringe, but these are among the unpleasant details essential to truly grasp the multifarious quiddity of two power-lusting libertines.No doubt the Clintons depravity was particularly revolting to the author because it stood in stark contrast to the way she lived and died--calmly warning her husband of the terrorist attack as it was in progress. As tragic as her death was, some comfort can be taken from the fact that she died knowing America had ridden itself of the scourge of Clintonism. Modesty may have compelled her to ignore the fact, but even before this posthumous publication, Barbara Olson was an American hero for the tireless way she elucidated the true nature of the couple from Arkansas who went to New York and stomped on the Constitution on their way.No line from the book better delineates the antipodal essences of Mrs. Olson and the Clintons than a comment she made in relation to the former first couple's lackadaisical attitude toward terrorism, \\"Since the end of the Cold War, Soviet Aggression has been replaced by a number of particularly venomous threats from Timothy MacVeigh to Osama Bin Laden.\\" Her murder makes the accuracy of that insight almost unbearably pungent.Rest in peace Barbara! There is a place in Heaven for you among America's other heroes; many of whom arrived there on the same day you did."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"A factual and documented telling of the abuse of Presidential power during the 8 years of the Clintons' occupancy of the White House.All students of The American Presidency should be required to read this book and it should be part of every history class taught."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"It's sad to know that Barbara Olson was killed on 9/11 with other great American heroes but it makes sense she was on the plane that went down in Shanksville, PA; the only plane that valiantly took on it's terrorists. It's sad because it means that no more books will be penned by this solid investigative reporter & I think that is something as a nation we need.And yet the Clinton \\"mandarin\\" dynasty is not unique to the USA and if you wonder how those under dictatorships elsewhere keep their mouth closed and just muddle on, read Olson's book and learn about the Clinton era where everyone ignored his abuse of power because there was a 'feel-good' bubble economy going on. It's no different in those other dictatorships; it's a relative answer.All in all this is a greatly disturbing dark tale; one that gives no hope to the USA marching on the road to serfdom, because of the incredible amount that the Clintons stole & got away. In fact it portends something far worse the 'informed' populace looks no brighter now then it was then, still listening to the Media and their self-interest & still being denuded of their rights for a miniscule 'spoil' of the riches.An incredible story; how can this be true? How could this be America? Nixon & Watergate was small potatoes compared to this outrageous horror story."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"No matter how many books come out, revealing the decadence of President Buttafucco and his sleazy wife Hillary, there will always be the blind devotees, who swallow...everything the Democrats and media feed them.Barbara Olson's magnificent book is just such a tome. It speaks the truth. She is not just sitting back, concocting stories; she investigates everything. She quotes others, she interjects her own thoughts. She even uses former insiders, such as George Stephanopolous! She quotes Democrats who now, only in hindsight, are being forced to admit what a couple of true dirtballs these Clintons are . . . something Republicans and conservatives have been saying for eight long years! It is because of these quotes from Democrats (including former president Jimmy Carter), that prove this is not just a book from the non-existant \\"vast right wing conspiracy\\" which the liberals throw out whenever they have no other defense for the actions of a corrupt man.The blind devotees continued to swallow the lies til the end. He claimed he asked for forgiveness for his shortcomings, and they believed him; yet he gave America the middle finger, so to speak, by pardoning fugitives, druglords and terrorists in his final days; in all cases going over the heads of the Justice Dept. to get the pardons completed! Is that someone you can respect??? Is that someone interested in the rule of law????This book speaks the truth: we made a mistake electing this man. And we are going to be paying for this mistake for years to come. Prayerfully, we will learn from our mistakes!!"},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"\\"The much talked about Marc Rich pardon has become an appropriate symbol of the entire eight years, but Mrs. Olson does a commendable service by clearly detailing the effrontery of his (Rich's) misdeeds, and an even more skillful demonstration of the President's specious and insulting attempt to justify this shocking act. To add fuel to her raging fire, she quotes former President Jimmy Carter who openly stated \\"I don't think there is any doubt that some of the factors in his pardon were attributable to his large gifts. In my opinion that was disgraceful.\\"Naturally, given her neo-con bent, Ms. Olsen failed to mention the extremely salient point that the attorney representing Marc Rich's pardon application was none other than Scooter Libby, Dick Cheney's aide."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"\\"The Final Days\\" is one of the best political books of the time. Many of Bill and Hill's fans for the past several years will no doubt cast this book aside as part of the famous \\"right-wing conspiracy\\" as Hillary so nicely put it, but if one keeps an open mind, he or she will see the amount of time and painstaking effort that Barbara Olson put into this great book.It really exposes all of the things that our two co-Presidents took part in for eight years, and will continue to take part in until Americans put down their foot and say no more. This book relies on facts, not made-up partisan language, that are intended to give all Americans a good idea of the unspeakable things that went on inside the walls of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue for eight years while the media turned a blind eye to it all.If you are a Republican, Democrat, or Independent, I urge you to read this book. Keep an open mind and just ask yourself if you would really like to see 'ol Hillary sitting in the oval office. It really does make you think.May God Bless You, Barbara. You were one fantastic lady whom we will never forget."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"This book is great. Inside Olson reveals how Bill Clinton used his final days in office to pardon convicted murders, terrorists, cop killers, family friends, and seemingly anyone else that could afford his pardon. Moreover, she shows how money hungry the Clintons were/are by the blant use of accepting money for bedrooms in the white house, pardons, and nuclear information. This book reveals the shameless acts of the Clintons while in office. The Clintons looted the White House when they left. They took items that were given specifically to the white house, and yet when they left the white house they took them as gifts as there own!Someone talked about the numbers not being arcuate, that there are better sources out there. But where is Barbara Olson wrong? Where are her numbers wrong? Is it when she reveals Bill Clinton spent over a billion dollars on trips to other countries while in office? Or is when Olson reveals the 140 people pardoned by Bill? Maybe Olson was wrong when she reported on the 8 million dollar advance Hillary would receive from her book deal? Please! If you are going to proclaim the facts are wrong, at least have enough fortitude to show why. If you are just going to blow smoke, then perhaps you are better off not revealing your name at all. It sure must be nice to remain anonymous when you make claims that has no creditability at all.Overall, a great book with the main focus on the pardons. It is a shame Mrs. Olson is no longer here today. Her work is really top notch and is worth reading."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"I was really curious as to what were the \\"desparate abuses of power\\" compelling Ms. Olson's \\"outrage.\\" I was shocked to find that President Clinton did such awful things as continue to do his job until the end of his term by visiting trading partners and issuing regulations that had been in the works for years (and required by law).My favorite \\"abuse\\" is her chapter on Clinton's trip to Vietnam. Ms. Olson screams that this was a waste of taxpayer dollars as the U.S. has absolutely no interest in Vietnam since they are a poor country and therefore cannot buy any U.S. goods. I'm sure the American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi and Saigon (whose members include Catapillar, Citibank, Compaq, Ford, GE Motorola, Hewlett Packard, Johnson & Johnson, Microsoft, Price Waterhouse, Unisys and many others) got a good laugh over this one.The most troubling thing about this book is that its sole purpose was \\"a last desperate\\" effort to spew one last ounce of venom at a twice elected President whom the right refused to recognize as President. Instead of discrediting President Clinton, this book only shows how mean-spirited, petty and undemocratic the Republican right have become. What September 11 has taught us is that we need to move beyond petty attitudes such as Ms. Olson's and Tom Delay's that Clinton was not their President. We are one country inspired and united by a Constitution providing for a single President for all Americans."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Do the critics of Barbara Olson just totally disregard the quotes she cites at the end of the book from former left-wing supporters of Clinton, who finally saw him and his wife for what they are? Apparently so. Those Bill and Hillary supporters should read some biographies of presidents who truly brought dignity and respect to the office; Washington, Lincoln, Truman, to name a few. Then they can really see how their hero stacks up against the great men that led our country. Clinton was a disgrace to the office."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"&quot;The Final Days&quot; by Barbara Olson was a much needed work. It was thoroughly well researched and documented and it will make your blood boil.Read about how Clinton abused his pardon and execuctive order priviledges. Check into Hillary's 2000 Senate Campaign dealings.Barbara Olson will be much missed, may she rest with the angels. She is dismissed as a right wing ideologue, but let's step back from that for a moment. Barbara Olson uses well-documented resources and backs up her assertions with facts. It has become too easy for the left to just say &quot;oh so-and-so is a right-wing chest-thumper&quot; and not have to adress their logic, nor make any attempt to refute their facts. Looking at it in this manner, one cannot refute Mrs. Olson's well-documented logic.Everybody who is concerned about the fate of this country should read &quot;The Final Days.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Why is it that reading reviews is such an interesting passtime? Because you can spot a Blind Liberal review a mile away. They seem to have only one pattern for reviews of their beloveds- like Bill & Hilary. That pattern is pointing out Republicans who have also abused power as the justification for ALL in the future to not only repeat that, but to improve on it. I would like to know how liberals got the label of being the open-minded crafters of a better society. Look at America's state of affairs since WWII and whose leadership precipitated our great declines. At least Clinton has a loyal, ugly, and equally greedy co-dependent wife to enable him to carry on his lifestyle with no fear of repercussion! Certainly not from his loyally BLIND constituency anyway!"},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"As a writing instructor, I try to get my students to see that my comments about their writing are not to be taken personally. Their \\"literary personae\\"--of themselves as well as their characters--are not necessarily identical with their own or their characters' actual selves. In \\"The Final Days\\" Barbara Olson creates, on the one hand, the picture of an arrogant, wildly irresponsible, yet strangely fatuous president and, on the other, an \\"omniscient\\" narrator passionately devoted to exposing his carefully guarded inner core. Mr. Clinton does not eat food but \\"wolfs\\" it down; he does not hear applause but \\"basks in public acclaim\\"; he doesn't give a farewell speech, he \\"does a George Washington\\"; even the evidence of a photo of his resigned features misrepresents the \\"fact\\" of his internal ambition. And should we have any doubts about the actual extent of his hubris, the narrator compares the seventh day of the God of Genesis with this president's Sabbath: \\"the Baptist president decided he [in italics] was not going to waste his [in italics] final days.\\"As an example of much present-day political writing, of so-called inside-the-beltline brawling, \\"Final Days\\" delivers the goods, creating memorable, bigger-than-life portraits of its two main characters--a deceiving yet self-deceived emperor and an undeceived narrator determined to show there are no clothes. True, it's acrimonious prose that probably makes no fewer assumptions than it accuses its subject of making--in fact, the fire and passion is reminiscent of the famed gloves-off, verbal sparring matches for which writers like Milton, Dryden, Pope, and even Dr. Johnson himself were renowned. Whether the book deserves high marks as \\"history\\" or \\"reportage\\" I leave to the scholars and political scientists. But Washington books seem to belong to a different genre requiring different criteria."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Yes, I am a democrat. Yes, I voted for a Clinton three times (President twice, Senate once). This book is an wonderful romp (and wonderfully, sometimes laughably, skewed to the right) that gives you one person's view of Clinton's last days in office.Barbara Olsen has made virtually made her career bashing the Clinton's and she brings out the claws and starts scraping away in this book. Trust me you can't put it down."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"All of you Clinton lovers should actually learn to not turn the blind eye on many of these things Clinton did during his presidency. The last few minutes before he was impeached.I can admit George Bush is a bad president himself but I can also admit what Bill clinton stood for. Corruption!See the pardons such as the nationalistic terrorist group from Puerto Rico plus the tax cheat and a whole list of other losers that Clinton pardoned."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"It is of course tragic that Barbara Olsen perished on 9/11, but nevertheless I must say that while I looked forward to this book because I want to believe the worst about Bill and Hillary, and while it was entertaining for putting them in a bad light, I didn't really find it convincing from a research/evidentiary point of view. For one, the author's bias was all too evident; for another, many of the points seemed to be just rehashed public domain material or speculation. Put another way, sure the Clinton's probably did some bad stuff in their final days, but this book hardly lives up to its promise to show them as serious abusers of power."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Barbara was a regular on Larry King and other TV talk shows, she seemed like part of the family because she was so in tune with our values. When 9-11 happened we were very saddened to hear of her passing. We wanted to somehow continue our contact with Barbara. Her story of the Clinton's last days is so typical Barbara, remembering her feisty style when expressing her conservative views. Anyone who enjoyed Barbara will enjoy her book. You continue to see her smile throughout the book."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"I was enthralled with the investigative work that went in to this account of the last days of the Clinton White House. I believe the facts presented are ones that the world needs to know about. It is evident by her resources that Ms. Olson speaks the complete truth. I am very sad that her voice has been silenced. Why are people afraid of the truth? Because it exposes their darkness, maybe?"},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"I will always remember Barbara appearing on the evening cable news shows as the sole defender of truth and what is moral in public life while being shouting down by the trial lawyers-defense bar. But Barbara gave us her writings, uninterupted by those who tried to defend to indefensible. God bless you."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Two years ago this may have been an important book, but today this remains one of those books (like those of Limbaugh, Hannity, Coulter, Buchanan) primarily for people who still wake up each morning determined to see to it that the Clinton legacy is a little more tarnished before sundown. The main issue here is the Clintons' truly aggregious use of pardon priveleges to pay back political supporters. However, this point will probably lose its shock value for objective readers, when we consider the number of G.W. Bush campaign contributors (several of them former Enron execs and execs from other failed energy concerns) who seemingly bought their way into President Bush's cabinet and administration with no apparent skills for the jobs they assumed. Thus, many readers may have already concluded that while Clinton repaid his supporters on the back end of his administration, Bush entered office paying his supporters on the front end, and in realizing this most readers have probably already resigned themselves to the fact that this (sadly) is just business as usual. So, most readers who pick this book up today will probably not be alarmed by the contents.The book is also less shocking considering the pardons of Clinton's predecessor, Bush Senior, who pardoned those convicted in the Iran-Contra scandals who did their best to conceal the involvement of both Bush Sr. and Ronald Reagan. Some might say that this was worse than all Clinton's pardons combined. President Reagan also left office declaring that all states would raise their drinking age to 21 or else lose federal highway funds, a coersive abuse of state's rights which cost many states millions of dollars in litigation. Some might say that this was a more flagrant abuse of power than the national monuments established by Clinton when he left office (later repealed by GW Bush). While Olson makes a minor note of such details, she plays them down to make it appear as though Clinton invented the last-minute abuse of power.These and many of the other highlights detailed in Olson's work were reported by White House correspondents for National Public Radio, and quite thoroughly debated on N.P.R. if not other news outlets. So, this is not necessarily \\"exclusive\\" material, mostly old news colored with a conservative spin."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"The very same disgraceful administration she lays out all the facts to us about, in a way are very responsible for her untimely death. Had Sept.11 never occured, this wonderful peice of investigatory work would have never had as many poeple read it. God works in mysterious ways and I beleive this is a wake up call to everyone who has the morals, but have just stood on the sidelines to take this country back from all who have made deals with the dark side."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"After reading this book I am wondering if either the author was a ex girl friend of the President or maybe lost some money in the Whitewater real estate investment. I was hoping to learn something from the book even though it was known to me that the author was a detractor of the Clinton's. Unfortunately, the unproven, half-truth accusations that the book is full of makes one question if any of the information contained in the book is the full story or even factual. The author goes out of her way to include nasty comments in almost every sentence - little words and phases that are better used to describe Stalin or Hitler then even the combination of the worst traits of all the American Presidents combined.There are two overriding themes to the book, one is that the Clinton's took advantage of everything possible during their term in the White House and that both the Clinton's are power hungry. She uses as justification of this theory that Clinton rode around on Air Force One, that he helped with DNC fund-raising efforts, and that he went on a number of foreign trips. Unfortunately, the author either forgets that all other Presidents do the same thing or she only thinks Clinton should not have. Also when has it been a crime that people in the U.S. are power hungry - - when was the last President elected that was not power hungry - Adams? The author just does a bad job of documenting research that would add credence to her over the top claims.There is some interesting information on the pardons, which probably deserves a look to see if this is a power that needs to continue with the Presidents going forward. It is just that if you are looking for a fair and balanced review of the last year of the Clinton presidency this book will not give it to you. The \\"outrageous\\" items detailed are unfortunately, part of the current American political landscape and for each item identified one could look into the history of the last 5 Presidents and find those same issues. I doubt this book will stand up to the passage of time as a well documented and researched historical review. What the book does give you is a tabloid style review geared to the person that already has a negative opion of the Clinton's. If you fall into this category the book will probably be very enjoyable for you."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Where this tome may provide some entertainment on a dull flight, don't fool yourself into thinking that this is a 'Book'. Political pamphlet is the better term and a rather crude one at that. The author's extreme right wing philosophy drips from every page (no exaggeration)thereby destroying any credibility her statements might otherwise have.No biased rumor is too vague, no 'liberal' intention too suspicious to serve as a reliable basis for pointing the finger at another 'liberal outrage'. That the man, Clinton, might have any redeeming value at all is too preposterous to contemplate.No matter what your political views are, this is a junky book, probably written in less time than your flight."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"I listened to the audio version of this book. While most of the things said in this book may be true, it appears a bit biased. In addition to facts, the author uses some adjectives which show her personal dislike of the famous couple.In the end, I had an impression that this book grew out of author's frustration upon Mark Rich pardon. Many chapters are dedicated to that case.A disproportionately large portion of the book is devoted to two topics: pardon and donations. At one point the audio book spends a large amount of time only listing names of who donated what item. It goes on and on and on with names that make no sense and contribute nothing much to the story. That could have been moved to the appendix to keep the flow going.I was hoping to find details about mischievious behavior by Clinton staff during the last days. There was no mention of that."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Yes - yet another book for those who can't get over the fact that Bill Clinton is no longer the President. Barabara Olson writes several facts in her book, then proceeds to fill the rest of the book with distortions, half-truths, and innuendo. The most shocking fact in the book is that it's labeled &quot;non&quot;fiction. If you're a fellow right-winger, grab your wallet. If you have a brain, on the other hand, look for something that really is nonfiction."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"This book is nothing more than a poorly researched vendetta against Bill and Hillary Clinton. I would rather not speak ill of Ms. Olson, who died very tragically on Sept. 11, but the fact is that much of this book puts words and thoughts in the Clintons' minds that are pure speculation.There is a legitimate case to be made against Bill and Hillary Clinton, but if you are interested in a fact-based and fair-minded effort, then you've come to the wrong place.If you want a piece of work that reinforces your own negative impression of the Clintons without challenging any of your assumptions, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"While I'm not a fan of political books, this one was good when Ms. Olson stuck to the facts. There were a few times that she seemed to go off on a \\"Rush Limbaugh-type\\" tangent and had no evidence to offer for what she was speaking of. A few of her bibliography references weren't accurate or were taken out of context. It is clear from reading this book that this author was biased and VERY Republican. That took away from my experience.Just to be fair, if you insist on reading this book, you should also get \\"Stupid White Men\\" by Michael Moore. While Ms. Olson may talk about the \\"abuses\\" of the Clinton administration, you should read the abuses of the current Bush administration! It wasn't as if Clinton were the only one to abuse his powers while in office, and I'm sure he won't be the last."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"The late Barbara Olson reveals nothing new in this book---precisely because she has previously made no secret of her hatred for the Clintons both politically and personally.Everything that has been printed can easily be found in other authors works on the same subject, and therefore only accomplished the task of depleting a forrest and printer cartridges. While this assessment ironically does lend credence to the idea that anybody can become published in this country if they are sensational and partisan enough, it also reveals a very embittered spoiled woman who was almost fanatical in her disregard for the very concept of ethics she was bent on investigating others for violating."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Barbara Olson seems to be a good writer who can't get her emotions under control. The tales in this book have already been reported and many of them have been debunked as either completely wrong or slanted in a way that makes the story inaccurate. The Clintons deserve the scrutiny they are under, but we want to know the truth, not just listen to a Clinton hater throw everything bad she can find into a book."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"If you are considering buying this book, you might want to first fill your heart with hate (if you haven't already done so) and stop by for that brainpickling appointment that you have put off for so long. Otherwise you might find it difficult to understand how someone writing such an obviously biased attack could actually get published. Nobody's saying Bill and Hillary are sqeaky clean here, but if Ronald Reagan receiving a multimillion dollar house in Bel Air and million dollar speaking engagements just post presidency doesn't set off alarm bells, why should we worry about amateurs like the Clintons?"},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Ms. Olson spends a great deal of time trying to convince everyone that the Clinton's and the Democrats were nasty people. She forgets that although Clinton was impeached he was found NOT GUILTY. I guess eight years in office was just too much for any conservative to swallow. Olson repeatedly tries to tell us how bad things were. No so, we really enjoyed some good living while the Clinton's were there. I believe if she went back in time other President's, i.e. Nixon, would make the Clinton's look like a bunch of amateurs. At least Clinton didn't try to distroy the country."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Amazon: Why can't you give a book NO stars? Because that's what this one deserves. Barbara Olson is gone, but her hate and smear-mongering live on. This book could have used a good fact-checker, as most of it has been proven false. The things that do have a kernel of truth are exaggerated wildly, while of course Olson never troubled her bleached-blonde head with the terrible abuses of power of Presidents Reagan and Bush Sr., the latter of whom used his pardon powers to pardon his fellow co-conspirators in Iran-Contragate, to cover his own hide.This is yet another one-sided, ill-researched, vicious smear campaign against a President that the rich and privileged types in Washington, including Babs and her husband Ted, couldn't bear to see occupying the White House and actually fighting for working Americans.Clinton created 22 million jobs and brought two terms of peace and prosperity; what, exactly, have the Olsons ever done for this country? As for the Clintons \\"values,\\" I believe Babs was Ted's third wife. So much for family values. The only thing the Olson family valued was a quick buck, through muckraking stuff like this."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Barbara Olson was certainly no fan of the Clintons. However, she does show fairness in this book by agreeing that there was justification for some pardons by Clinton. She also quotes some liberal Democrats who express their disgust with Clinton's last minute pardon escapade. She does point out that these same Democrats could not bring themselves to condemn Clinton for some of the earlier scandals while she maintains that the pardoning and White House furniture scandals of the last days of his term were only a continuation of the character displayed in the earlier sexual scandals. The Marc Rich pardon of course receives special attention in the book and leaves one wondering how someone with integrity could justify such a pardon of one who at the time was on one of the Justice Department's &quot;most wanted&quot; lists.Sometimes there is a little too much detail such as several pages listing the names of the pardoned. But overall, I found the book both interesting and informative."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Okay, I have a bias and this book feeds that distrust of the Clintons with fact and a little spin. Only in few places did Barbara Olson manage a few shots--which were funny. But, clearly even the most ardent Clintonite supporter would have trouble disputing Olson's facts presented in her final book. These people, the Clintons were, are [low class] hey, I grew up as [low class] and can see their ethos of entitlement in my neighbors while growing up.I rated it a 3 only because of its breverty and a storyline (timeline) that jumps around a bit. In no way does this dimmish what Olson presents. I had trouble putting it down long enough to stop yelling at the characters in this book."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"I'll say right off the bat that I liked Barbara Olson. Whether she was making a point, confronting a &quot;neutral&quot; interviewer or debating with the Left she was always passionate and polite. But this book is not well written. It is more in the style and tone of a polemic.Nobody needs to be told that the Clintons are political animals first, last and always. There is an element of smarminess, scheming and politics surrounding every public utterance. Who can forget the tales of those closest to them - his obscenity-laced tirades every morning, her railing at unknown enemies, the politicizing of every event in the nation? One can safely state that no two people have had more (former) friends write bad things about them than this pair.The mythology is still there - he was good for the Democratic Party (under his &quot;leadership&quot; they lost the House, Senate, most the governors, the Presidency), she was co-President (they did not talk over long periods of time) and that Clinton was some kind of ideologue on the Left (he was an opportunist who ruledaccording to polls). The author is torn between reporting the outrages of the final days and the chance to hit at Hillary who she has consigned to a lower rung of Hell than Bill. This could have been an important book if handled differently but now it will be judged solely on one's ideological viewpoint - the Right will like it, the Left will despise it."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"The astonishing Clinton administration is brought into greater focus in this hard to put down book. I found myself rereading chapters because I couldn't believe what I had just read. The Clintons were the biggest embarrassments this country has ever or will (hopefully) ever see again. Barbara's writing is excellent though some might find some repetiveness in the chapters but being a loyal Clinton-hater I enjoyed every sentence."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"The first in what I'm sure will become numerous accounts of the final days of the Bill Clinton administration, Barbara Olson presents a scathing and eye-opening narrative of the disturbing and at the same time fascinating closing of Clinton's 8 years in office. Notwithstanding Olson's untimely death aboard the plane that struck the Pentagon on 9/11 and the fervent rush to immortalize her, this book should still be popular years later for all who are curious about these final, confusing days. Written in \\"news-reporter\\" style, this story is based on solid reporting and research and stands as the definitive account of Clinton's actions as he vacated the Presidency.This book covers approximately the last quarter of Clinton's term and documents one un-believeable story after another as Clinton embarks on a \\"pardon frenzy\\" while he and Hillary \\"loot\\" the White House of it's furniture, china...etc. Famous and not-so-famous recieve pardons as Clinton administers 140 Presidential pardons and 36 commutations in record time closing out his administration. Olson's enmity towards the First Couple is at times almost overbearing as she catalouges each Clinton action and the reasons why each was so repulsive. Hillary also recieves her share of the blame as Olson continues her vehement dislike of the First Lady (started in Olson's previous book \\"Hell To Pay\\") while documenting the absurd political maneuvering the Clintons performed while trying to get Hillary elected to the Senate.Nmerous contemporary interviews are included that add depth to these charges, while also making for fascinating reading. For example, former Jimmy Carter Chief-of-Staff Hamilton Jordan states the following: \\" 'It is incredible that the ethical atmosphere of the Clinton White House had sunk to a level whereby the constitutional power of a president to issue a pardon was discussed among Mr. Clinton and his White House staff as just one more perk of office.' Clinton, he said, had disgraced and demeaned his office by treating the pardon power in the same manner as giving campaign contributors overnight stays in the Lincoln bedroom or flights aboard Air Force One. The Clinton's, he went on, 'are not a couple but a business partnership, not based on love or even greed but on shared ambitions...The Clinton's only loyalty is to their own ambitions.' \\"A fairly fast read (I read this in a 4 day weekend while on vacation) and written in that news reporter \\"to-the-point\\" style, this account should be read by all who are even mildly interested in politics as it shows how the abuses of power have virtually destroyed Bill Clinton's legacy and continue to make Hillary Clinton's Senate term suspect."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"I have read this book 2 x's and for some critics to berate its content is an attempt to stifle the &quot;truth&quot;. Ms. Olson has an uncanny ability to blend fact and prose and make this book as interesting as a novel--unfortunately for America, this is not fiction. Her accounts of the crimes the Clintons'perpetrated are legion. It's unfortunate that despite these factual accounts, there still are Clinton enablers and sympathizers who overlook the myriad violations of laws commited by the Clintons and their cronies.This book is must reading for all who want to see what travesties some elected officials are capable of perpetrating. Hopefully, this book will lead to widespread awareness of the corrupt government we tolerated for too many years."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Barbara Olson may have died during the 9-11 terrorist attack, but her legacy of courage, honor and patriotism will live on. Olson's expose on the final days of arrogance, decadance and abuse of power of the Clinton Administration only illustrate the fact that William Jefferson Clinton's legacy will continue to grow more soiled with each passing year."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"This thin volume provides a nice summary of the many scandals of Bill and Hillary Clinton. It does spend some time on well documented and well known scandals, but the core of the book is the pardons Bill Clinton provided during his last days in office. The extravagantly outrageous pardons of Marc Rich and Pincus Green receive detailed attention. The author also takes us through the pardons of drug dealers who had ties to the Clintons through relatives and political cronies who also got off.The book details how the Justice Department was circumvented and/or ignored as these pardons were decided on and why Clinton's pardons fall far outside the customary guidelines and procedures for Presidential Pardons. I particularly enjoyed the summary of the lame excuses and rationalizations provided by Bill and Hillary when the public expressed outrage. But it saddened me that the Clintons new their supporters could be counted on to forget their outrage and line up behind them again. Of course, the Clintons know their supporters.The book also provides a good documentation of all the gifts the Clintons shamelessly solicited and received in their last days in office when Hillary had that window as first lady and before she became the junior senator from New York. Then, with nary a twinge of conscience she said she would vote for legislation that would prevent new senators from engaging in the behavior she was busy completing. Amazing!It is no secret that the author, who was murdered by terrorists on 9/11 in the jet that was crashed into the Pentagon, had no love or admiration for the Clintons and that most of the readers of this book will also fall into that category. However, I think that it will provide a nice single volume summary of the Clinton Scandals for those who come later and want to read about the strange presidency of Bill and Hillary Clinton."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"This former prosecutor details how the Clinton's up until the very end never gave in to the rule of law. They just kept on insulted the country by rubbing our faces in their amoral, political agenda for fame and power.As the author records one account, \\"On the very last day more criminals were liberated than at Bastille.\\"Sad to have to see the conartists they are at work to liberate such as caught, convicted terrorists for the sake of political advantage. That's all there is with these two--exploitation of everyone to achieve their goals, not the countries.How dare them then spin it to make the conservatives look like uncompassionate, ruthless leaders. These two will certainly go down in the annals of American government as poor examples of what America is about.Articulately Olson shows the lengths the Clintons went to vent their anger on traditional values and institutions, when advancing their own liberal bents, delighting in mocking the office and even site of the centre of power and influence not only in our nation, but the world, The White House.The connections with relatives and friends and financiers is all here, with enough tantalizing details and media accounts to force the reader to ponder the conscious of the Bill/Hillary team towards anything wholesome.So descriptive of this is Bill's continuing need to be out in the spotlight, as an ego need and as a strategy to detract from other spotlights when they get close to unturning the truth.This work will contribute to the mounting documentation of the saddest holdings of this nation's highest office. What honor Olson and her husband Ted in contrast provide the country with, honor and dignity and a resolve to get the truth out.Honored likely along with many others of this book to contribute to the scholarship fund in honor of Barbara's life. Details available from the publisher."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"This book should make any American angry. Olsen succintly documents the final days in Clinton's presidency; days that are all too fitting a crown to the eight years he and Hillary reigned. (And make no mistake about it, \\"reign\\" they did...)Yes, this book is one-sided. Yes, the author is probably biased. But sadly, all of what she describes has been documented, and can be confirmed.Olsen touches on several events in the Clinton's last days (and lightly on a few events before that), but the largest portion of the book is spent on the fiasco over the last-minute pardons of drug-dealers, tax cheats, frauds, and fugitives that the Clintons passed out, sold, and traded for votes.(I'll bet you can tell that I'm no fan of the Clintons, huh!)Most if not all of what Olsen talks about was in the media in early 2000, but the events deserve an extra spotlight, which Mrs. Olsen so adequately supplies. Regardless of one's political leanings, I highly recommend this book. It shows the debauchery that we can succomb to when \\"It's the Economy, Stupid!\\" and character no longer counts.One last thing: Call me a prude, but the book does contain some PG-13 language. While its use is restricted to direct quotes of the characters (primarily the Clintons), there are ways to avoid it."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"If THE FINAL DAYS were made into a movie, no one would believe it. It's too fantastic, too incredible, too cynical by even Hollywood standards; there is no way a president who abused his power, his people, and the U.S. Constitution this badly should ever have even been elected, let alone ravaged the country for eight years. Yet we know it's true; we read story after story about it in the papers. We thought we knew the whole story.But, as Barbara Olson's final masterpiece details, we didn't.The surrealistic saga of Bill and Hillary Clinton's desperate power grabs over the last days of the Clinton presidency is truly frightening. How in the world does anyone have as much of a sense of entitlement as the Clintons obviously did and be taken seriously enough to get elected to public office? Olson details in no-nonsense fashion documented with thorough footnotes and extensive quotes the depths of the Clintons' depravity that was only hinted at in press stories. The &quot;stroke of the pen, law of the land&quot; executive orders. The massive Federal land grab. The bridal (sorry, new senator) registry and gift grabbing, trying to sneak by Senate ethics rules. Hillary's $8M just-under-the-wire book deal, another attempt to circumvent ethics rules. Pilfering White House furniture and artwork. Rerouting of money and property in clever accounting techniques that even the likes of Enron wished they had. Dueling Manhattan office spaces, at taxpayer expense.Oh, yeah, and then there were the pardons. To paraphrase Dennis Miller, if there were any more symbolism to pardons bought with bribes by guys named &quot;Rich&quot; and &quot;Green&quot;, Andrew Lloyd Webber would be writing music for it. The Rich/Green pardon scandal would be bad enough for any one president's image, and Olson documents it throughly, giving a detailed explanation of just what kinds of traitorous criminals Rich and Green really were and how egregious this pardon really was. But more importantly, she delves into the rest of the Clinton pardon list, the remainder of which were just as outlandish as the two most prominent ones. If you have any doubt whatsoever that the Clinton pardons were mere commerce, mere sales transactions, bought and paid for by donors willing to give up money, votes (the Hasidic Jewish town that went almost 100% for Hillary after its four favorite sons were pardoned), and any remaining ethics they may have possessed beforehand, you REALLY need to read this book. Citation after citation, scrupulously documented, thoughtfully written, calmly rendered, this one chapter is worth the book's entire purchase price.Someone should make a movie about Barbara Olson's life. A true American patriot, she had the courage of her convictions, was never afraid to speak her mind even if it was unpopular, and even risked her own life on that fateful September morning by calling her husband and relaying vital information about the hijacking, serving her country until her last breath. THE FINAL DAYS is a fitting tribute to Mrs. Olson's courage, her intelligence, her dedication to her country and her beliefs. Buy it."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"I would like to say to the last reviewer that he has a lot of nerve to complain about the \\"hate\\" in Barbara Olson's book (without once documenting any specifics) and then in the same breath declare how glad he is that she was a victim of the tragedy of September 11 because it means that her voice has now been silenced. It's that kind of perverted double standard in the ranks of the American Left that people like Barbara felt the need to speak out against, and in her last work she does a masterful job of showing how the stench of corruption that was the Clinton Administration carried up to the last minute."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Clintonians need not apply to read this lest they be offended at their once and still but fading demigod(after all he/she has been no pun replaced by a newer failure),The Rampant Corruption no matter your affiliation that existed,Lying under oath to A Grand Jury,Selling Pardons,even If I were to remove the Immoral Aspect of it which is throughout the eight years then one can still have an idea that even beyond the lack of intelligence(I think it is More a Nihilism)on this couple's part.From Whitewater,Travelgate,Filegate,Lewinskygate and ElianGate. one sickening betrayal to the American voter after another,Although I would have like to seen more on the Elian matter and on Reno The book is not something to be ignored or to take in Denial,Sadly Mrs.Olson did pass away(God Rest Her soul)during the attacks upon America but her Legacy in her writing this book and the previous live on,give it a chance and ignore the Clinton's \\"Legacy\\"(Fannie and Freddie,Bin Laden,Mcveigh,ATF/Waco,and of course an Surplus which now we know is all smoke and Mirrors.)Even Carter and Carville could not defend their boy or their girl."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"I would have bought this book under any circumstances, but the murder of Barbara Olson makes me treasure this as her last &quot;gift&quot; and lasting legacy to all patriots who care about good, honest government.As a former congressional investigator who likely knew more about the Clintons and their corruption machine than most decent people can stomach, she not only knew where to look but how to place it all into proper context.How tragically ironic that the most compelling critic of the Clintons -- the most corrupt and base politicians in the history of the nation -- was murdered because of Bill Clinton's incompetence and indifference toward fighting terrorism.What I found both sad and chilling is that she pretty much predicted an increase in terrorism, thanks to Clinton's negligence regarding foreign policy and terrorism.After reading this book, it's obvious why the friends and minions of the Scariest Woman in the World tried to suppress this book and even threatened to post-humously smear Mrs. Olson.We'll never forget Barbara Olson and will keep her legacy for truth and decency in government alive forever."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"The editorial review speaks for the content. This is an enlightening read, and highly recommended. I read it through without stopping, shifting from bitter amazement to surprise, as I read many details that never fully made their way into the newspapers (again and again)."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"I surely hope this book will be a wake up call to those sympathetic to Bill and Hillary Clinton's political agenda. While I do not completely disagree with their views, I am appalled by their selfish desire for personal gain and glory at the expense of the American public. Olson's book is a thoughtful, sobering look at the Clintons' final days in the White House. It isn't a disingenous attack on the Clintons themselves, but a thorough, often painful to read, recounting of the Clintons' excessive greed. Olson makes a very persuasive case for the Clintons viewing themselves as above the law. One wonders what might happen if Hillary Clinton was elected President. Undoubtedly, there would be more of the same political malfeasance, selfishness and greed we've come to expect from Bill and Hillary Clinton. Let's hope that we, the American public, aren't fooled again; surely neither Bill nor Hillary Clinton should earn the right to occupy the White House again."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"This book was written by Barbara Olson prior to her tragic death in the 9/11 terrorist attack on the pentagon, and published posthumously. It is a well researched, frank, hard hitting book, and Ms. Olson tells it like it is.Chapter by Chapter Ms. Olson takes up abuses of power in the Clinton administration from spending billions of dollars of taxpayer money on personal travel; abuse of the executive order; lying under oath; presidential pardons and sentence commutations of fugitive money lenders, former members of Congress, a former CIA director, friends of Jesse Jackson, Clinton campaign contributors, a cross section of the Clinton cabinet, bank robbers, small- and big-time crooks, friends, relatives, ex-girlfriends, con men, terrorists, perjurers, and tax evaders, all for personal gain; to stealing literally truckloads of furniture and furnishings from the White House that belonged to the citizens of the United States. These things and many others the Clintons did with almost total impunity and with little scrutiny from the press until it was long overdue.It took Barbara Olson almost to the end of the book to come out and say it. Bill Clinton was for eight years a truly irrational person, someone who lived on the edge of serious mental illness. He was a psychologically sick man who, first as governor and then as president, risked his marriage, his office, his bond with the voters, and the creditability of his party to gratify his personal needs. Hillary was more than an accomplice; she called the shots, only to have no knowledge of what went on, or any recall of it.This book published before its time. It should be on the best seller list now to refresh people's memories.Now Hillary wants eight more years for her and Bill in the White House. I guess they didn't get finished looting the place or fleecing the taxpayers the last time. We certainly need Barbara Olson today more than ever. May she rest in peace?"},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"This book will overwhelm you with the unbelievable abuses of power and position practiced by Hillary and Bill Clinton during their last days in office. It is tough to believe that this couple was allowed to get away with all that they did, yet every bit of infomation in Barbara Olson's latest book is verifiable. It is sad that William Clinton and Hillary took the highest and most honorable office in the U.S. and tried to turn it into a circus, but it is sadder still that they attempted to make laughing stocks of the American people. The one thing that Barbara Olson's novel teaches is what we all will never forget: We won't have another Bill Clinton in charge - ever! Sadly, Ms. Olson has passed away, on the hijacked flight that crashed into the Pentagon on September 11, but she has left an outstanding legacy. As an American, it is almost a duty to read not only this book, but her book &quot;Hell to Pay&quot; also. A fabulous author who tells it like it is. She will be sorely missed."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"That the citizens of NY could be duped into voting for Hillary Clinton still amazes me.From Co President Bill Clintons pardoning of the Puerto Rican terrorists to ostensibly get the N.Y.Puerto Rican vote for Hillary,to her vote dealings with the Hasidic Jews in a quid pro quo affair where the payment was made in Bills final day in office,should turn every freedom loving American's stomach over.That the American media wouldn't cover this ,can only be explained after reading another very good book,Bernard Goldberg's\\"Bias\\".Read this book then buy a copy of \\"Bias\\"..."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"...Olson simply presents the facts and offers possible explanation to the link the facts together.

But,if Mrs. Olson would be with us today, I wonder what she would say about what's going on today with Mr.G.W.Bush...

It grabbed my attention right from the start. The author was prepared all right, prepared to blow the doors wide open on all the disgusting, dirty little secrets covered up by POTUS AND LOTUS. There is Hillary's remarkable interest in Communism and leftist ties not to mention all the little details about how the bribery for the Marc Rich pardon came about. Also included are the many pardons of some of the most criminal elements society has to offer not to mention their friends and family members. And last but not least is their midnight runs and the &quot;looting of the nations &quot;White House&quot;. There for all the world to see is their greedy, shameful and disgusting rise to the top. It makes you want to be careful, very careful who you vote for."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"You won't be voting for Hillary if you read this book. Shame on both the Clinton's.

I read in horror and shock as the business partnership, not anything remotely resembling a couple, that is Bill and Hillary, or PLOTUS and FLOTUS as Barbara succintly refers to them as, time and time again committed heinous injustices.\\"Not since the opening of the gates of the Bastille have so many criminals been liberated on a single day.\\" On his infamous last day as Commander-in-Chief, Clinton granted 140 highly dubious pardons along with 36 commutations to bring to a deplorable record grand total of 450 for his tawdry tenure of depravity. Olson masterfully documents the infamous Marc Rich as Clinton pardons the #6 Most Wanted Fugitive by the Justice Department saying that the biggest tax defrauder in U.S. history, who by the way had renounced his U.S. citizenship and was conveniently \\"living abroad\\" and whose ex-wife channeled countless donations and gifts to the Prez, was \\"wrongly indicted\\".Among the shady and unscrupulous criminals pardoned were Bill's cocaine-snorting and habitually law-breaking half-brother Roger Clinton, as well as ex-lover Susan McDougal, drug king pins(whom Clinton had pledged to put away only 8 years ago apparently in meanignless campaign rhetoric, notorious cop killers, convicted anti-American terrorists, and a slew of other so-called unfairly indicted miscreants. Olson tells of the ostensibly coincidental(as Hillary calls it) DNC, Senate, and Clinton Library contributions and gifts well in excess of a million dollars that were gratiously received by Bill and Hillary in exchange for the unethical and as if it matters to Bill - highly illegal as well -quid pro quo deals for immunity and pardons. From the Secret Service's codename for Roger(Headache) to the White House Lawn Marines' refusal to right face when the draft-dodging, military-gutting Clinton walked past(and how they miraculously reconvened the first day of George W. Bush's tenure) are just a couple of the insider tidbits that the articulate and dearly missed Barbara Olson conveys to the reader in this entertaining and informative short read. The benefits and knowledge of the real & unadulterated truth - the stuff the liberal media conveniently let slip through the cracks - proves worth the little time needed to read this compelling book."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"This book was Great!! It was good reading from the first page to the last page. I admire Barbara Olson for her courage to write a book without any spin.

Barbara Olsen has brought it all together in a concice and compelling case of the Clintons' abuse of power.

Barbara Olsen was a crusader for truth and justice. Our country misses her insight."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Being a former Clinton admirer, I wasn't too sure I wanted to read this book by Ms. Olson. However, she presents the facts well and in an unbiased way. I was stunned to read some of the things that didn't make it into the newspapers. We need more writers/reporters like Ms. Olson. I was saddened to hear of her death."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"The loss of Barbara Olson is a national tragedy, which will undoubtedly create a hole in the fabric of fair and balanced political debate. The scales of journalistic, commentary and literary debate that hold the left and right in balance before the American people has been offset by her loss.Only the work of someone like Mrs. Olson and the honesty and openness of many of her associates from both sides of the isle will fill the void. Bernard Goldberg, David Shippers, Dick Morris, George Stephanopoulos and yes Barbara Olson are just the tip of the iceberg. Larry King was exactly right &quot;Barbara was a special lady. We will miss her.&quot;It is not necessary for most Americans to read the plethora of books from conservatives and liberals alike who were both outside and inside the Clinton administration to &quot;get the picture&quot; that this was the most corrupt, power crazed and unethical group of individuals to ever inhabit &quot;The Peoples House.&quot; I include in that group any and all who allowed themselves to look like total fools by coming out and denying in front of the cameras what they knew was the truth. That the boss was a dirty old man, a liar and corrupt to his very bones.Sure every single administration in existence has had errors or mistakes and a skeleton or two in the closet that they want to remain buried.But Bill and Hillary Clinton and their administrative enablers created armies of skeletons and piles of bones and half rotting corpses of political, ethical, financial and failed character errors that surpass all others.Their misuse of power, office, governmental agencies, privilege, influence and the &quot;peoples trust&quot; is beyond equal and should remain a permanent example of how power and greed and lust can corrupt even the most, well intentioned. But when it comes to their rein of terror upon the American People no one in America's past, present or future will be so blatantly oblivious for the wrong they have done and the harm they have caused to this great country of ours.Barbara has done a masterful job of adding to the chorus of voices and material that has exposed this blight upon the reputation of American Government. The utter failure of the Clinton's and their appointees to uphold the &quot;rule of law&quot; and the &quot;honor of the office&quot; is only equaled in treachery and ridiculousness by seeing the Senate of the United States of America. Those whom the founding fathers believed would be the true intellectual, rational and patriotic conscience of the country through thick and thin. Turn away from their sacred oaths, their duty and their most fundamental obligations to the Constitution and the founding principles of this Republic, to support, protect and defend their traitorous boss. It was simply a traitorous act to leave this criminal and his first-lady-accomplice in office. And they will never live it down as long as they live. Perhaps even after. Benedict Arnold had nothing on that completely partisan and unprofessional Democrat Senate Vote.Dick Morris summed it up on page 206 when he said, &quot;the reflections...of a nations longtime heedlessness, surrender, and in many cases complicity, [towards the Clinton corruption], will be ugly. Refusing to face the Clinton [true legacy] is a national transgression from which there is, and should be, no pardon.&quot;In other words as Bill and Hillary Clinton virtually destroyed the reputation, honor and dignity of the office to which they were elected while dragging the American people, half of whom were willing disgraceful participants, into the gutter of degeneracy, disgrace, lies, abuses of power and criminal activity. We became almost as disgustingly passive and surrendering to them, as the German people were to Adolph Hitler. God forgive us all for that.The only thing we can be thankful for is that they did not have aspirations of being King and Queen of the whole world just the United States of America.If we...left, right and center, do not look at this corrupt regime for what it really was, Dick Morris' words would be completely appropriate. We will never find redemption.This book is as important to the abuse of the pardon power by Bill Clinton, as David Shippers book is to the failure of the United States Senate to do it's duty, or Bill Oreilly's is to a failed media debate, and Bernard Goldberg's is to exposing the unquestioned bais in the major TV News outlets, or Willima Bennet's books are to exposing the failed character and culture of the political left.Thank you Barbara for adding just one more piece to the puzzle that was American worst political failure and long running nightmare yet."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"This book is written so well that you feel you are right there with these people as in the same room, or on Air Force One, or wherever they are! Barbara Olson has acutely placed the Clintons where they should have been placed the first four years of Bill and Hillary's term as President of the United States. Yes, that's right! Bill and Hillary! She ran the show the whole time. He wasn't strong enough without her. He was the puppet and she was the puppet master.

PLEASE!"},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"For many of us, the terrible events of September 11, 2001, were made even more tragic when we learned that Barbara Olson was on board the plane that crashed into the Pentagon. Barbara Olson was a noble, articulate, witty woman who put aside material interests in order to passionately, bravely defend the ideals she believed in--the very opposite of a Clinton. It is fitting that her final contribution to American ideals comes in the form of this biting condemnation of the Clintons' final days in office. For those who closely followed the revelations of Clinton's final days of self-indulgence and influence-peddling, there is not a whole lot of new material to be found in this book; for those who did not pay attention to the spectacle of those days, this book will be an eye-opener. Truly, the only people who cannot see the Clintons for what they were (and are) are the willfully blind.This book provides an excellent summation of the Clintons' final actions and the aftermath of disbelief and almost universal condemnation they inspired. These are the acts that forced even Clinton's own liberal defenders to come forth and question his morals and ethics openly and forcibly: the outrageous pardons of Marc Rich, Pincus Green, Carlos Vignali, and an assortment of other terrorists, drug dealers, con artists, Clinton cronies and family members; the despicable pilfering of White House furniture; the shameless solicitation of bawdy gifts from supporters; the almost unlimited issuance of federal regulations and executive orders intended to help pad the Clinton legacy and to stymie the incoming Bush administration; and further abuses of power. Olson forcibly shows the Clintons' explanations of themselves to be morally repugnant, self-serving, easily transparent, and laughable.This is not psychobabble; it is a delineation of facts, with random jabs of wit interspersed throughout. The facts as Olson presents them compel any reasonable person to conclude that Bill Clinton was by far the most corrupt President this country has ever put in office. With Hillary's political ambitions almost certainly set on installing herself in the Oval Office in the future, Olson's warnings are timely and important. This book is rather short and is a very quick read, which disappointed me somewhat. I am sure the author could have devoted thousands and thousands of pages to the moral repugnance, greed, and complete lack of morals that define the Clintons even in their final days in power, but I imagine that it was Olson's purpose to reach and inform as many people as possible about the true nature of the Clintons rather than produce a weighty tome for scholars (most of whom, being liberals, would not have read it anyway). There is but one question in my mind after reading this book: if Bill Clinton were still President, would he, for the right price, pardon the evildoers responsible for the untimely loss of Barbara Olson and thousands of innocent Americans on 9/11?"},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Mrs Olson's book should be required reading for every middle of the road liberal / conservative. The true die hard liberal Democrats will never bring themselves to think that Royal First Family did nothing but walk on water. And of course the ultra conservative, vast right wing already had them pegged. Its the middle group that needs the learn about just how bad these people truly were.Mrs Olson starts off slowly but by the time I finished chapter 11, I needed a dose of valium. The clincher was the pardon of a Jesse Jackson crony that stole $1.2 million in government grants intended for homeless, minority children and used it to buy a fur coat, Mercedes and clothes for a live in boy friend, among other self indulgent items. Unfortunately, she was only typical of the pardons Bill Clinton granted as favors to friends, family and paying customers in the last days.I had tried to understand why so many seemingly intelligent people (including a lot of my black relatives, friends and co workers) still believe that the Clintons were the next best thing to the second coming of Christ. The quote from Saul Bellows, explains it all, &quot;A great deal of intelligence can be invested in ignorance, when the need for illusion is deep.&quot; The Clintons were, are masters of illusion."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"The loss of Barbara Olsen is truly tragic, but her voice continues to tell us how truly depraved the Clinton's are. This book doesn't mince words about the egregious wife of Bill Clinton and the ex-president himself. It belongs on every library shelf as a true history of the Clinton presidency. Mrs. Clinton has obtained the office of senator through a mendacious route that she has followed all her adult life. I will never understand the people who voted for her or why. She is [in my opinion] the epitome of effrontery to every decent American, especially women and Blacks.Barbara Olsen clearly defines Mrs. Clinton for the fraud she is and continues to be. Every book written on the Clinton's defines their unconcealed quest for power and money, other people's money, taxpayer's money by the truckload. The congress and the senate were/are too weak to stop her, especially the Democratic Party. Some twenty authors can't all be wrong just because they tell the truth.A must read book.

From arsenic to Mark Rich, the whole squalid tale is recounted by the superlative Barbara Olso, who sadly is no longer with us."},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"Barbara Olson's passing has left us not only with a hole in our collective heart, but also a valuable insight into some very frightening people -- thanks to this book. It amazes me how people who are supposedly &quot;reviewing&quot; this book can get their ridiculous accusations and personal attacks on the author in print here! One reviewer, in particular, barely mentioned the book at all.However, I will mention the book, and gladly. &quot;The Final Days&quot; should never have been Barbara Olson's last book. Those who accuse her of writing fluff, or writing out of spite, apparently did not read the entire book. In fact, they missed the entire section on her sources of facts! Even if I were a Clinton fan (which I am not, of any of them), I would find the facts within entirely too well-documented and too hair-raising to dismiss.Some reviewers question Barbara Olson's &quot;Washington insider&quot; status in an attempt to discredit her, which is a ridiculously desperate move on their parts. No one who knows who Barbara was (not even so much who she knew, but who she was as a person) would ever think of questioning such a thing. This book is not fiction, and the documentation is there for all who dare to acknowledge it.In essence, &quot;The Final Days&quot; is a factual, cohesive, and engaging presentation of facts about the ex-president and his ever-present, ever-scary wife. Mrs. Clinton's beliefs and politics are dangerous, and if We The People do not take heed of Mrs. Olson's written words, we may well live to regret it.Writing off this book as spiteful vitriol may be cute, but it is unwise. Mrs. Olson perished because of x42's administrative failures. So did thousands of other people; some were not American citizens, but most were. The horror of 9/11 could have been avoided, had we listened to Barbara Olson and others who tried to warn us. How many more of us are we willing to sacrifice out of either stubbornness or ignorance? Or both?Don't be stubborn -- read the book. Don't be ignorant -- believe what you read. We've had burning towers and a burning Pentagon; is a burning bush (no pun should be taken) really necessary?"},{"Title":"The Final Days","review":"...Regarding this book, it is well-researched (for those who care about FACTS) and an important read inasmuch as it reveals much that the Media never mentioned (or tried to whitewash) - and certainly covers that which the Clintons never intended to see the light of day! Any American who wants to be informed should read this book - objectively!!"},{"Title":"The Moon by Night (Cheney & Shiloh: The Inheritance #2)","review":"First of all, it is much, much better than the previous book. There are no &quot;my little cabbages&quot; from Shiloh. He does not become a whimp! The characters seem to be much more like we've come to know and love, but they are changing. I think it is more like they are maturing in ways. That would be appropo since they are getting older in the book's series. There are not as many Shiloh/ Cheney scenes as I would like. (Could there ever be enough?) However, Dev plays a bigger role in this book. I really liked how his character has developed and grown.The book's plot has a rather slow start. I didn't mind the slow start that much, however, because like I said before, it was kind of like getting reacquainted with old friends. While the overall plot is fairly complex, the book lacked the action/drama which would have made it a real riveting page turner.What I liked best was this book really opens up possibilities for the series to continue. It tidied up some loose ends and opens up new doors. Also, the struggles that Cheney and Shiloh are facing within their marriage seem very plausible. There are two additions to the family which also make the Irons-Winslow household more fun.While I am not the most critical reader on the planet, I am also not an easy sell. I really enjoyed this book. I could have enjoyed it more with more action between Shiloh and Cheney, but I still found it hard to put down. The many names of other hospital workers and patients sometimes became a little tedious. In the end, however, all the strings were neatly tied together and The Moon by Night made a nice March present for me.Should you spend the money on it? Well, I won't tell you how to spend your money. It was worth it for me. I also figure that if I want more books in this series, then the publishers had better turn a profit, so I'm also investing in Cheney and Shiloh's future which appears to have a couple of twists left."},{"Title":"The Moon by Night (Cheney & Shiloh: The Inheritance #2)","review":"In 1869 Dr. Cheney Duvall Irons-Winslow and her husband Shiloh Winslow return home to New York City to begin their respective jobs. Cheney is a senior partner practicing medicine at St. Luke the Physician Private Hospital and Dispensary while Shiloh returns to his managerial position at Winslow Brothers Shipping.Although Phineas Jauncy unsuccessfully tries to rob Shiloh who then hires him as a gentleman's gentleman the excitement resides with Cheney's work at the hospital. In spite of running a top rate operation (no pun intended) that is above the accepted standard, deaths are suddenly plaguing the hospital. Shiloh and Cheney wonder whether an angel of mercy, a serial killer, or a negligent medical practitioner is murdering the patients, but which one and why? While praying to God for guidance, Cheney with the help of Shiloh and a close friend from the police begin investigation the human caused tragedies.THE MOON BY NIGHT (the sequel to WHERE TWO SEAS MET) is an exhilarating inspirational historical thriller that brings to life post Civil War Manhattan through a fine cast of characters. The story line is very exciting just to follow the medical activities that showcase what is available and known in 1869 including how easy deaths of patients can occur. Cheney is a terrific female lead while Shiloh plays more of a support role for much of the tale to his dynamic spouse who in some ways seems more like a modern day woman. Though some readers will find the numerous religious references distracting, fans of the father daughter Morris team will appreciate that extra boost to a fine nineteenth century medical thriller.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Moon by Night (Cheney & Shiloh: The Inheritance #2)","review":"Hallelujah!Ditto to mostly everything in the reviews so far... from the lack of \`cabbages' to the more in depth study of the, up until now, minor characters.

At a basic and fundamental level, I see Housen's journey and actions as brave and true. I agree that she hit a point of no return in terms of honesty to herself and the need to accept and support the changes that were going on inside of her. I agree she needed solitude, reflection, and to demand the space and time to cultivate her creative expressions.However, the more I read on, and really thought about how she was framing her decisions, the less I thought that leaving her family was truly the necessary way to go. Perhaps they should have still hired the au pair, a housekeeper, rented a separate apartment of the beach. Perhaps she still needed to demand space to drink her morning coffee, throw starfish in the ocean, be honest, and write. Perhaps when family life started clouding her own reflections, she needed to go to that other apartment and claim herself again. I am in complete understanding and agreement, as a mother and creative individual myself. Yet, she short-changed herself, her growth, and most certainly her children in her thinking/decision that the only way to be that woman was to fully leave the woman she already was. The creativity, strength, and growth that comes from demanding space and honorment for your true self and your true creative journey WITHIN the responsibilities you have already created for yourself - most specifically your relationship with your children - is an opportunity for, not a refusal of, growth. I do not doubt her love for her children - no true mother ever would once you see for yourself what that love is like - but I am highly skeptical of the happiness she truly ends up with. It seems like she threw the baby out with the bathwater - or rather, three babies. There ARE ways to embrace deep and fundamental personal changes while still allowing yourself to care for your children.I don't fully blame Housden for what I think is a lack of insight. No doubt society sets us up to believe in the black or white dichotomoy - either you give up your life for your children, or you give up children for your life. It is untrue and the way to have passion for the caregiving of your children, family life, and most especially yourself, your creativity, and your soulfulness is to work - constantly, endlessly, in micro-moments of the everyday to demand that space, that solitude in the midst of the hands-on work of children.Should she have given up the woman she was becoming? Certainly not. But did she give up too much in thinking that the ONLY way to become that woman was to leave? Yes, she did. To her own detriment, let alone that of her children.I think had the storyline of her life gone in another direction - she moved out, she took the time and space to explore, she embraced the woman she was becoming, she became an artist, and then she moved back to her children and worked to be the creative simple soulful caregiver (sorry, 14% of her children's life doesn't exactly count as caregiving, she sounds more like a favorite aunt or the grandparent) writer - then I would have fully embraced this story as a contribution to the dilemma that mothers today face. So, in the end, I was moved, and I was moved to think, but I don't fully agree with where she took her life ultimately."},{"Title":"Unraveled: One Woman's Story of Moving Out, Moving On, and Becoming a Better Mother","review":"The author Maria Housden is indeed a woman of great strength and courage to have been able to make the difficult choices she has made in her life. Being authentic and coming from a place of true honesty and openness is not easy in our society and yet Maria continues to do so regardless of what others think. And she does so from a place of love.There's no doubt that Maria's choices are not for everyone. However, I wonder how many of us have the courage to be true to ourselves. How often do we live out of fear of what others will think or in a way that fits the \\"shoulds\\" in our mind?

I really miss my passions, and can relate to how a crisis with an ill or dying child shakes a family and relationships of all kinds to their roots and many sacrifices are made and the world never quite looks the same.This book was written so you can see into Maria's soul, and she is brave about baring truths that most women wouldn't let see the light of day.I would love a sequal to see how her life changes.

It is a great resource!"},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Modern English Usage","review":"It is somewhat amazing that this book, first published in 1926, is still in print. The language has changed quite a bit since then; thousands of words have been added, hundreds have gone obsolete, and hundreds more have had their meanings shaded; and of course many of Fowler's pronouncements are now merely echoes of battles long lost or won. Not only that, but two newer editions of A Dictionary of Modern English Usage have been published, the excellent second edition edited by Sir Ernest Gowers in 1965 (now ironically out of print while the original finds yet another printing), and the not so entirely well-received (but underrated in my opinion) third edition, edited and revised by R.W. Burchfield in 1996.How to account for this phenomenon? Part of it is because Fowler's reputation only grew after his death as several generations of writers sang his praises and adhered to, or sometimes fussed about, his many dicta on usage questions both great and small. And as the years went by, and as the pages of his masterpiece gave way to wine stains and silverfish or the few remaining copies disappeared from libraries, he himself became a legend. Not everything he wrote is considered correct today, nor was it then. And sometimes the succinct yet magisterial little essays he wrote were followed by other little essays that were all but impenetrable, obtuse and somewhat overbearing. No matter. The good greatly outweighed the occasional misjudgment, and the education he afforded us remains.Another part of the story is that there is something very properly English and wonderfully nostalgic about the man himself. He was a bit of a character who lied about his age and joined the army when he was 56-years-old to fight the Germans in the Great War (only to faint on the parade grounds), a man who earlier gave up a teaching career because he did not feel it was his responsibility to prepare a student for the seminary. More than anything, though, the fact that this book is still in demand is a testament to the high regard and affection felt by the literate public toward Fowler himself.What Fowler knew and preached was that before we could presume to be literary artists or journalists or even authors of readable letters we must of necessity, if we are to be effective, be craftsmen. Central to his purpose was the belief that the right word in its proper place and context constituted the backbone and much of the muscle and sinew of forthright and effective writing. That belief along with Fowler's celebrated passion for the concise and the correct, and his intolerance of ignorance and humbug, coupled with his sometimes incomparable expression, long ago won him the undying respect and admiration of careful writers of the English language the world over.But this is something of a problem. Since Fowler last set pen to page some seventy-one years ago (he died in 1933), the English language has changed and grown enormously. What was correct and effective then, as well as what was ineffective, offensively brash or downright ugly has in some cases become acceptable and even felicitous. So, like it or not, Fowler had to be updated, and of course there was no shortage of lexicographers, linguists, grammarians, journalists and others looking to do the job. Furthermore, the &quot;Great Divide&quot; between American English and British English needed to be explained, recorded, and codified. Some of the people who have joined in this enterprise over the years have been H. L. Mencken, Jens Jespersen, Margaret Nicholson, Dwight MacDonald, Bergen and Cornelia Evans, and more recently, Bryan A. Garner and R.W. Burchfield, and many others. I think all of them, if they looked over their shoulder would see upon the wall an especially sober portrait of Fowler passing silent judgment upon their protracted labors. Certainly on their desks would be this book.So I recommend that you buy that very impressive book by Garner (Garner's Modern American Usage), especially if you are an American, or splurge for a copy of that underrated third edition edited by Burchfield, and that you consult them as well as this venerable authority. As you use the books you may compare and contrast and get a nice feel for where the language has been and where it is headed."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Modern English Usage","review":"Together with his and his brother's \\"The King's English,\\" Fowler's \\"Modern English Usage\\" is the classic guide to writing good English. Those that say that Fowler is overly prescriptive are wrong; on the contrary, Fowler thinks less ill of split infinitives and prepositions-at-end than many more \\"modern\\" usage know-it-alls. I think that Fowler approaches writing in the English language as an engineer approaches designing a machine. The idea is \\"get the job done\\"---\\"how can I say this in the fewest words with the least ambiguity?\\" And that is what he teaches. Split infinitives aren't bad because they don't introduce ambiguity. The fused participle, on the other hand, introduces ambiguity, and should be avoided. \\"Good\\" Fowler English isn't just \\"proper\\" English, but English that is unambiguous and to the point.Everyone that writes should have a copy of Fowler. But please, don't buy the \\"Third Edition,\\" which isn't really Fowler. The second edition (edited by Gowers) is OK, but the first is really the nonpareil. The first edition is still in print (Wordsworth or a special Oxford reprint?) or you can buy it used---there arelots of original Oxford University Press hardbacks floating around used here on Amazon[.com] that were pulled off high school shelves years ago."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Modern English Usage","review":"There is of course more than one reason for its popularity. But the dominant one is undoubtedly the idiosyncrasy of the author, which is revealed to an extent unusual in a 'dictionary'. -Sir Ernest Gowers, Preface to the Revised EditionHere in the States we have our beloved Strunk &amp; White to give us guidance on matters grammatical, and it remains an indispensable reference work, even in its original form. The British counterpart to Elements of Style is this unique work by H.W. Fowler, minimally revised and edited by Sir Ernest Gowers. It too remains useful, though many entries have grown dated, but it is so idiosyncratic and amusing that even the most obsolete of Fowler's rulings and admonitions are worth reading if for nothing more than simple amusement. Here are just a few of the more enjoyable ones that I found :continental. 'Your mother,' said Mr. Brownlow to Mr. Monks in Oliver Twist, 'wholly given up to continental frivolities, had utterly forgotten the young husband ten years her junior.' This use of continental reflects the common belief in England that the Continent, especially France, offers unwonted opportunities for gaiety and self-indulgence. It persists in such expressions as c. Sunday, c. cabaret, now not necessarily in the pejorative sense intended by Mr. Brownlow but suggesting either envy or reprobation, or a mixture of both, according to the taste of the user. Such feelings toward what we suppose to be the continental way of life have no doubt changed with the mellowing of Victorian prudery, but are unlikely to disappear so long as we are not allowed to gamble where we please or to drink whenever we are so disposed.paragraph. The purpose of paragraphing is to give the reader a rest. The writer is saying to him: 'Have you got that? If so, I'll go on to the next point.' there can be no general rule about the most suitable length for a paragraph; a succession of very short ones is as irritating as very long ones are wearisome.reactionary. 'Except for its technical scientific sense, to which it would be a mercy if it were confined, reactionary is a word so emotionally charged as to be little more than a term of abuse' (Evans). That is no less true of Britain than of America. The word derives its pejorative sense from the conviction, once firmly held but now badly shaken, that all progress is necessarily good.split infinitive. The English-speaking world may be divided into (1) those who neither know nor care what a split infinitive is; (2) those who do not know, but care very much; (3) those who know and condemn; (4) those who know and approve; (5) those who know and distinguish.1. Those who neither know nor care are the vast majority, and are a happy folk, to be envied by most of the minority classes.As Sir Ernest says in the epigraph to this review, that's not a style we're used to finding in dictionaries.Meanwhile, unbeknownst to the rest of us, there's apparently a battle amongst lexicographers, of some years duration, over whether such usage manuals should be prescriptive or descriptive. If descriptive, they would merely describe what the masses have adopted as common usage. If prescriptive, the author tries to offer guidance and to influence future usage. Fowler seems, to at least this non-professional, to have struck a nice balance between the two. He certainly has pet peeves (more than a few) and quite forcefully argues for spellings and definitions which he feels ought to be either stuck to or adopted, but he is also sufficiently democratic to recognize that many of these struggles, though he might have favored a different result, had already been decided to his disfavor. Here is but one example :contact. The use of c. as a verb (get into touch with) gave no little offence when it first appeared here from America. But convenience has prevailed over prejudice, and the dictionaries now give it full recognition : after all, it is an ancient and valuable right of the English people to turn their nouns into verbs when they are so minded.Given this realistic attitude, one assumes he would have been able to gracefully handle the fact that many of his suggestions have gone unheeded.At any rate, from what the reviewers have to say about the most recent version of the Modern English Usage, Fowler's successor, Robert Burchfield, would appear to have produced a work that is not only overly descriptive, but that tends to vacillate over certain usages, as if Burchfield is unwilling to have events prove his judgments wrong in the future. There is no such waffling in the original, and it is a much better book for the firmness of its author's often hilarious opinions. This is one of those books that belongs on every desk in the English-speaking world, alongside Strunk &amp; White and the OED, you'll refer to it often, but browse for pleasure even more frequently.GRADE : A+"},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Modern English Usage","review":"Excuse the superfluous capitals.

If you've ever wondered how the words residence and residency both made their way into the language, the answer awaits you within these pages.This isn't the place to get started with learning to write though. For those whose primary endeavor is not writing Strunk and White's Elements of Style or The Practical Stylist by Sheridan Baker will offer much to you on the practice of writing. These titles will also offer you many tips on constructing a piece of writing that you won't find in Fowler.For those interested in a thorough treatment of usage and language you can't go wrong with Fowler though."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Modern English Usage","review":"Once I saw this book as a young teenager, I never worried about grammar snobs again. I had great confidence in writing. Along with Strunk and White, it exposes the arbitrariness of grammar and the phoniness of many grammar snobs. My children are superb writers and 2nd generation Fowler beneficiaries."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Modern English Usage","review":"Before we presume to be artists or journalists or even readable purveyors of newsletters (or Internet blogs, for that matter) we must of necessity, if we are to be effective, be craftsmen.Such a sentiment would, I imagine, sit well with Henry Watson Fowler who, some eighty years ago in collaboration with his younger brother Frank, wrote this famous book of English language guidance and prescription (and proscription!). Central to his purpose was the belief that the right word at the right time in its proper place and context constituted the backbone and much of the muscle and sinew of forthright and effective writing. That belief along with Fowler's celebrated passion for good writing and his intolerance of ignorance and humbug, coupled with his sometimes incomparable expression, long ago won him the undying respect and admiration of careful writers of the English language the world over.And this has been something of a problem. Since Fowler last set pen to page some seventy-one years ago (he died in 1933), the English language has changed and grown enormously. What was correct and effective in 1926 (the year the 1st Ed. of A Dictionary of Modern English Usage was published), as well as what was ineffective, offensively brash or downright ugly has in some cases become acceptable and even felicitous. So, like it or not, Fowler had to be updated, and of course there was no shortage of lexicographers, linguists, grammarians, journalists and others looking to do the job. Furthermore, the &quot;Great Divide&quot; between American English and British English needed to be explained, recorded, and codified. Some of the people who have joined in this enterprise over the years have been H. L. Mencken, Jens Jespersen, Margaret Nicholson, Dwight MacDonald, Bergen and Cornelia Evans, and more recently, Bryan A. Garner and R.W. Burchfield (who edits the Third Edition of this book), and many others. I think all of them, if they looked over their shoulder would see upon the wall an especially sober portrait of Fowler passing silent judgment upon their protracted labors. Certainly on their desks would be this book.And of course there is Sir Ernest Gowers who revised and edited this celebrated Second Edition. He writes in the Preface that the most important changes he had to make were those of vocabulary itself. &quot;Words unknown in Fowler's day--teenager for instance--are now among our hardest worked.&quot; He adds that &quot;Vogue words get worn out and others take their place.&quot; He admits to having omitted &quot;one or two&quot; of Fowler's famous little essays as being &quot;no longer relevant to our literary fashions.&quot; (Would that he had preserved such specimens in an appendix.) He also allows that &quot;many&quot; of Fowler's &quot;articles&quot; called &quot;for some modernization,&quot; and therefore, &quot;a few have been rewritten in whole or part, and several new ones added.&quot;So this is not your pristine Fowler's, yet so carefully did Gowers preserve and build upon that earlier edifice that most people have been quite pleased. In fact so nearly universal has been the admiration for this particular book that the so-called Third Edition of 1996, edited by the aforementioned Burchfield, has yet to receive universal acceptance and is indeed disparaged in some circles as not being true to the letter and spirit of Fowler.For me two things stand out in this much admired Second Edition: (1) the absolute delight one finds in the many pronouncements on language; and (2) the odd but satisfying mix of the old-fashioned prescriptive grammarian commingled with someone who disdains pedantry for its own sake, and condemns what is seen as unnecessarily purist. Perhaps more than anything what one loves about this book is Fowler's incisive dry wit. Here is Fowler/Gowers on two words easily confused (those are my quotation marks since Amazon does not support the italics used in the original):prescribe, proscribe. These words are often confused, especially by the use of &quot;pro-&quot; for &quot;pre-.&quot; &quot;Pro-&quot; means to put outside the protection of the law, to denounce as dangerous; &quot;pre-&quot; means to lay down as a rule or direction to be followed. &quot;If I look at the list of proscribed authors in our various universities, I notice with pleasure that since 1940 no year has passed without Jane Austen appearing in the syllabus of at least one.&quot; The speaker clearly did not mean, as one might infer from the word he used (or perhaps the printer substituted), that Jane Austen's works were on the Index.Also of interest here is Gowers' Preface which amounts to an understanding and appreciation of Fowler and his work."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Modern English Usage","review":"If you want to learn to write, start with 'The Elements of Style' - concise, clear, good advice, short and cheap. But if you want to learn about using English, from a wise opinionated teacher at once wry and passionate, start here.Other reviewers have said what needs to be said, but I'll summarise: it's out of date; it's written in an old-fashioned curmudgeonly prescriptive style; you can learn more about using English from this than from five other books of similar intent.Don't - please don't - even think of adhering dogmatically to Fowler's dictums. I think he'd turn over in his grave if you did. What you say and write is your responsibility; agree with him or disagree, but know why and everyone subject to your words will be better off.Oh, and the third edition is worth getting too, but is not readily comparable to this. It's a different style, and not as easy to use, I find. However, it's obviously far more current. In any event, since you can buy this edition for little more than postage, I'm aware of no better value deal on Amazon."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Modern English Usage","review":"In The Writer's Art, Mr. Kilpatrick has described this work as a necessary tool for any writer, serious or not. He states that the book, &quot;lives on a shelf about three feet from my typewriter. The work is valuable not merely for the purpose of reference, but also for a quality rarely found in books that deal with grammer, syntax, and symantics: It is great good fun to read.&quot; I am buying the book on the strength of Mr. Kilpatricks recommendation, as I admire Mr. Kilpatrick's writing ability, even if his political philosophy is not always my cup of tea. Yes, Mr. Kilpatrick, I used that cliche on purpose, just for your benefit."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Modern English Usage","review":"This is a wonderful book, and beats the more recent revision. Fowler goes through all the hard problems of word usage (or at least all the ones that seemed hard when he was writing) and decides them in authoritative fashion. Burchfield's edition might be a more reliable book about the way people use the language now, but it isn't a classic like Fowler's because Fowler is a more interesting companion. His guidance is sharp and demanding, and his sensibility is addictive. This is one of the best of all books for people who love words. As the years go on, it seems to me to be timeless, like Johnson's dictionary is timeless."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Modern English Usage","review":"Nothing replaces Fowler. Buy this after your dictionary and before a thesarus.The 2nd edition is better. Buy one if you can find one. I use Fowler every timebefore the OED (I'm not rich and I don't want to go blind). Worth more than everypenny."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Modern English Usage","review":"The content of this book is quite interesting, including all kinds of history of the usage of various words. However, it's very difficult to read, because the print is very blurry. It looks like it was photocopied from an older photocopy. They really need to redo the original."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Modern English Usage","review":"This book is excellent for anyone writing books, newspaper articles, blog pages, etc. since it helps correct mistakes in usage."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Modern English Usage","review":"I was looking for a book that focused more on which word(s) to use when their meanings are similar but one is more appropriate than the other. It still might be okay. The picture on Amazon is not the book that I received which might be the problem."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Modern English Usage","review":"Not much to add to other positive reviewers: it's a very entertaining and enlightening little book, but I would like to mention one thing: it cannot be used directly according to its title: it is absolutely not good as a reference to the modern usage. Read it leasurely, a chapter or two at a time, as you'd read a book of essays. But beware of using it as a reference -- it's nearly a century old, it's British, it's Victorian, and while a lot of things there are very intelligently explained and still remain valid (like subjunctive, for example), there's also an awful lot of useless nonsense ranging from quant (e.g., \\"ate\\" must be pronounced [et] not [eit]) to downright absurd (borrowed words must be \\"englished\\" phonetically, thus \\"garage\\" is to be pronounced [gay ridge]). Well, I prefer my ridges sad and boring hetero, so this book can at times be annoying -- and, unless you happen to know better, misleading. Especially non-native speakers should beware of the nonsense in there.So, long story short: if you're a native (or a very competent non-native) speaker, buy this book for good entertainment/bathroom reading sort of thing; if, otoh, you need a usage guide, avoid this one and get something modern (I use the Chicago Manual of Style). Or, actually, get it whoever you are, but don't trust its usage precepts. With that proviso, very highly recommended. I've had it for about a decade already and I constantly read it, a page or two at a time, with great enjoyment."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Modern English Usage","review":"The historic quaintness of its grammar informs me and often makes me titter while reminding me of my birthright.

For those musicians that are looking for well researched biblically based material focusing on the area of music and musicianship, finally someone has come up with one. It is well thought out by a true Christian musician with a lot of bible references. One purpose of this book is to spiritually unite band members in Christ and to build the Kingdom of God and bring glory to His name. It's also a guide on how to treat the authority in the band and how the authority is to treat it's members. It even helps with the business side and keeping the balance of money and God in check. Too many people that hire small time bands feel it should all be done on volunteer basis and bands are embarrassed to ask but &quot;the laborer is worthy of his wages.&quot;It covers just about all ends of the spectrum of music while making sure it stays on track biblically and within Christ teaching.In summary: Highly recommended for all Christian musicians and especially for band leaders in making sure you keep on track with what your calling from God is. It's also a must for Praise and Worship teams."},{"Title":"Jack Sheppard (His Historical romances)","review":"Three cheers for Broadview press!

He said it was exciting and interesting to me because it has a cat. I like any book that has a cat because I have five cats of my own. I read the back of the book and it sounded sort of interesting to me.The book was about a cricket that gets lost by being trapped in a picnic basket. He is somehow transported to Times Square. A boy named Mario took the cricket and kept it as a pet. The cricket meets some other animals in Time Square. They were Tucker mouse and Harry cat. The cricket became famous because he could play songs by using his wings and his hind legs to make a violin. It attracted many costumers to Mario's newsstand.My favorite part of the book was when the cricket was playing his songs because I thought it was cool.

He changes his voice for the different characters dialog that matches well with the character. The background music and sounds blend in nicely with the narration. We listened to it on a long road trip and it definitely made the time seem to pass quicker. At 2 and a half hours it's great for a leg of a trip before a potty break.Parents be warned though, you may need to explain some outdated references and some stereotypical characters (like the Chinese gentlemen).My children (6 and 11) loved the book and are looking for more to read!

Chester became friends with other animals like Tucker Mouse and Harry Cat. The boy, Mario Bellini, really liked the cricket and got his parents to let him keep Chester in their newsstand. Mr. Smedley was a friend of the Bellini family who was a music teacher. He wrote a letter to the newspaper so everyone found out about Chester's beautiful music. People were shocked when they heard how talented Chester was. During his adventures, Chester met Sai Fong who gave him Chinese food, mulberry leaves, and a pagoda. Our favorite part was when Chester ate the $2.00 bill because he was dreaming. It was very funny and exciting when they had to figure out what to do about it.We got to know all of the characters in this book, but there were a few that were our favorites. We liked Chester because he had a way with words. He liked to eat liverwurst and mulberry leaves. Chester was nice, caring, and musical. Some of us have heard crickets chirping outside on nice nights, so we could picture how he looked and sounded. We also liked Sai Fong because of the way he talked and Tucker because of his sense of humor.This is a perfect book for kids of all ages. It is good for learning new vocabulary words. We loved reading The Cricket in Times Square and we think our friends would enjoy it too! It was fun to read, it helped us learn all kinds of things, and made us laugh.

It reminded me a lot of \\"Stuart Little\\", which is a good thing. Themes of strong friendship run through the story, and there are no mean or evil characters. The plot is whimsical and amusing, and stars characters that are wholesome, yet still funny and varied. The book is a little too short and easy for older readers, but it's a quick treat that'll leave you smiling."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"I think this book is a very interesting and adventurous story. The characters that appear are a cricket, Chester, who came from Connecticut and a boy, Mario, whose parents run a newsstand in Times Square Station in New York where a mouse, Tucker, and a cat, Harry, are living. Chester is shy, Tucker is a good joker, Harry is funny and cool, and Mario is a very nice and responsible boy. Tucker is my favorite character. They get in a lot of mischief but they try to solve the problems helping each other.In my favorite part of the book, Mario goes to Chinatown because he doesn't know how to take care of Chester so he goes to the Chinese man called Ms. Fong who tells a story that crickets are a symbol of good luck. But Chester sometimes brings Mario's family bad luck instead.You may feel sad when Chester gets homesick and wants to go back to Connecticut because four of them become best friends eventually. I'll never forget this book, and I'm sure you'll enjoy the story. I also read another book called Chester Cricket's Pigeon Ride. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the books about Chester and his friends.(...)"},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"One of the most pleasurable aspects of reading a good story is the experience of actually being in the adventure without getting up from your cozy reading chair. What kind of adventure will you have with Chester Cricket from the Connecticut countryside? With Chester, you will become the typical Big Apple Tourist! Lose yourself in the subway among the heaps of rubbish and waste paper. Keep yourself from getting squished by the hundreds of commuters charging in and out of subway trains. Meet an Italian family from Naples and enjoy their hospitality. Make friends with a street-smart rodent who knows all the good places to get a meal and a cultured cat who goes to the Opera and listens to chamber music played in Central Park. (Where else but in New York can you have chamber music performed out in the open air?) Be dazzled by the lights in Times Square. Eat authentic Chinese cuisine in Chinatown. Get your 15 minutes of fame performing in the NY streets. Survive an attempted robbery of your only possession in the world. And finally, ask yourself whether you want to stay in the city or to go back to your tranquil country home.This story is fast-paced and is a fast read. The plot is engaging. One constantly wonders: What can possibly happen next? Will Chester find life exciting in the Big City and stay? Will he go back to Connecticut? Will the Bellinis' lives get better?The characters are very likeable and are well-developed. They are not cardboard cut-outs of stereotypical New Yorkers. For example, although hardened city-dweller Tucker can easily be perceived as a fast-talking and rather materialistic mouse, one sees his generous and helpful side as well. The same thing can be said about Harry Cat. He is cultured, world-wise and also kind.The Cricket in Times Square is good, clean fun. Buy a copy for the kid on his first trip to Manhattan.

Chester was so famous and Mario family was making so much money off of his fame that helped Mario's business. Plus Chester didn't want to hurt his friend's feelings by leaving. Chester had to come up with a plan. After his final performance he had to stay safe by going back to Connecticut! After Chester retires and leaves New York, when Harry and Tucker won't have much company around, maybe they will visit Chester that next summer."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"...Your going to want to keep your ears open for any singing! Selden wrote such a story that you'd have to call it a pure classic. The book was about a little cricket from Connecticut who ends up in the state of New York. A boy named Mario Bellini then finds him, and after giving him a new home in there small newsstand. They name him soon \\"Chester\\" and leave him in a small match box by there cash register. His guides are a mouse named Tucker and a cat named Harry (Harry's adorable!). But nobody knows that the little cricket has gotten a talent, and he's a star. The book not only follows how much the Bellinis, Harry and Tucker are touched by the cricket, but how the whole city of New York are enchanted by his talent: singing. I loved the book a lot. I recommend and think that anyone can read this book.-Gina Marie Bertaina, age 10"},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"I've loved this book for years and was well pleased with the copy that I purchased.

We started reading it last week and discovered that there are about 14-18 pages that are blank. The print quality for this book is poor. I'm hoping as we go through the book we can figure out what is missing so that she can complete the book report that is due the first day of class."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"50+ years on, this book remains a children's classic, with a country lad/cricket visiting the big, bad city (New York City, of course) and trying to make his way there in the urban jungle, making some animal friends (mouse, cat) along the way. Looking back as an adult, it's actually surprisingly sophisticated in its undercurrents, about music, career and work, especially with how the story resolves. The adventure story aspects remain enjoyable, as is the general air of friendship between Mario and Chester, and Chester and Harry and Tucker.On the PC-radar screen, the treatment of Sai Fong and his pidgin English dialogue obviously dates the book and is not very PC. Below the surface, however, Sai Fong remains a sympathetic character. Likewise, in the internet age and with different immigrants coming to the USA, the aspects of the story like the Italian immigrant family and even just the newsstand itself give the story a feel of nostalgia. But for all that, I still have my copy from elementary school, for a reason."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"I found my dvd of \\"Cricket In Times Square to be exactly as the seller presented it.

Discovered by Mario, the son of a newsstand owner, he soon befriends Tucker Mouse & Harry Cat. Feeling out of place at first, he soon discovers a hidden talent that brings notoriety to himself as well as Mario's family.

The animal characters are as tough and diverse as the population of the city, but when faced with a challenge, they pull together. Some of us might wince at the ethnic representations (&quot;Hee hee! You have Clicket! ,&quot; sez the man from Chinatown), but they're not the focus of the book, and might even spark a discussion between parents and kids on how much things have or haven't changed since the early '60s when this book was published.

One reason is because you will absolutely love these characters! Tucker the mouse is witty and clever, Harry the cat is sweet and giving, and Chester the cricket is always thinking about others. This book was never boring because some type of experience happens in every chapter. For example, in a chapter called \\"The Dinner Party\\" the three friends have a little party at the newsstand but by mistake, they end up putting the newsstand on fire. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a short story with an uncommon, but interesting adventure."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"A cricket in times square is a great book to read about true friendship!

This cricket is just no cricket, he has special talents. To find out what special talents and the relationship with the book, then read this book."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"This was a nice children's story about a country cricket named Chester who accidentally finds himself taken to New York City. There he is rescued from a pile of dirt in Time Square's Subway station by a little boy named Mario, and he takes Chester in. Mario and his mother and father, Mr. & Mrs. Bellini, own a news stand at the station and that becomes Chester's new home. While he is staying at the stand Chester meets a mouse named Tucker who lives next to it in a drain pipe, and a cat named Harry, and they all become great friends. Tucker and Harry tell Chester all about New York, and make him feel welcome. Mario has never seen a cricket in New York before, and he really isn't sure how he is supposed to care for one, so he looks for some advice. He remembers seeing some cricket cages in Chinatown, so he goes there with Chester to find some information about crickets. There he meets a wise old Chinaman named Mr. Fong. He informs Mario that the Chinese believe crickets are good luck and tells him a story about the first cricket. The story Mr. Fong tells is about a man who knew all things, and spoke only truth, but his enemies wanted to kill him for speaking the truth. The gods loved him so much however that they wanted to protect him, so they turned him into a cricket. They say that now even though people can not understand the cricket song, it still fills them up with love because it still speaks of wisdom and truth. After that Mr. Fong and Mario become close friends. He sells Mario a cage, gives him a present of a bell for his cricket, and tells him he can come back anytime to take leaves from his tree to feed the cricket. Mario returns home and they are all happy for a while, but rather than bringing the Bellini's any good luck, Chester seems to bring only bad instead. Several accident's ensue, caused by Chester, Tucker, and Harry Cat. It looked like Mama Bellini was going to want to get rid of Chester, until they discover that he is a musical genius who can play any song perfectly. People then come from all over New York to see Chester play. This makes Chester very famous, but not very happy. As the season changes Chester has a dilemma on his hands as he becomes very homesick and wants to return to Connecticut, but he doesn't want to leave Mario, and his other new friends. My girls who are six and seven loved this book. This seems to be the first book in the series by George Selden, and there appear to be other adventures of Chester, Tucker, and Harry, that we'll have to go out and pick up next."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"This book will make you click out of your seat!

Chester made some new friends like Tucker mouse and Harry Cat. Some bad things happen but with the help of his new friends everything turns out okay.If you want to see what really happen read the book!"},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"This is a fun book. It's a nice book to read a chapter at a time as a bedtime book, because nothing particularly stressful or traumatic happens. The chapters are reasonable short and benign. There is tension, there is some drama, there are rich characters struggling with their individual challenges. But there aren't many chapters ending on cliffhangers that will leave young readers or listeners feeling unsettled.The strength of the book is the warm friendship between a displaced country cricket, a scheming but kind-hearted urban rodent, and an unflappable feline. There is also the human protagonist, Mario, a young boy who labors in Grand Central Station at his parent's newsstand. Mario's family dynamic, with the passive dad and the hard-boiled, derisive mother, sets up a nice juxtaposition. We see the sweet sap of childhood innocence standing its ground against a well-meaning but distrustful adult world.I bought this book to read to my kids because I remember loving it so much as a little kid myself, both the book and the filmstrip adaptation, which I believe I can picture myself watching in an overcrowded mobile home that was functioning as a second grade classroom.There's one distressing flaw to the book, which I don't remember from my own childhood because I wouldn't have noticed or cared at the time, but there is a part of the book that takes place in China Town, where it feels as if the story gets a dose of 1950's borcht belt race humor. The wise old Chinese man's dialect is achieved by switching every \`R' into an \`L.' As is \\"Vely solly.\\" Since I was reading it to my kids, I just improvised a little and avoided doing the accent, but if an older kid is reading the book for themselves it merits a discussion. A little social-historical context.That aside, we had a great time reading this book. The part I am asked to reread is when Chester Cricket, while dreaming that he is home eating leaves, waked up and realizes he's half-chewed through a two dollar bill borrowed from the newsstand register. There's brief panic and then excited brain-storming with his mammalian accomplices. As always, some credit goes to my unsubtle vocal performance, and I'm sorry, you can't buy that at Amazon. But it is funny stuff."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"The Cricket in Times Square is the first book in the series. It's about a cat named Harry, a mouse named Tucker, but it's mostly about a cricket named Chester. Chester lives in Connecticut. He was found by a lady who stuffs him in her purse. He gets carried all the way, to New York in a subway station. There's a family who sells newspapers in the subway station. And there's a boy who finds Chester and picks him up and buys a special golden cage with a bell that hangs down. Once Chester hears the bell he is able to sing. Then Chester has his own concert.My favorite part is when Chester has his own little concert and he makes a lot of money because Chester makes beautiful music.I would recommend this book and series to grade two to six because they are great fantasy stories about animals, but I would recommend them the most to people who like fantasy and animals.By the way this book is the first book out of seven books. They're great books to read."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"My 2nd grader and I listened to the audio book on a long drive, and then he read the book himself early in third grade. It is a quiet, slowly-unfolding story, with memorable characters, as well as a great tribute to \\"old\\" New York City. Characters include a very realistic Italian immigrant family who own a newsstand underground at a subway entrance, an elderly Chinese man, exotic to the young lead boy character, yet approachable and very kind, and a host of helpful and sometimes mischievous animal life that gets particularly busy when no humans are around, including of course, the cricket with a talent for opera singing.My son and I are voracious readers, and we rate this evocative, tender, and imaginative story in our top 5 of all time, along with classics like Charlotte's Web."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"This book is about a cricket named Chester who finds his way to New York City in a picnic basket.

These friends have many great times such as; when Tucker manages to get the gang some scraps of food. But they also have some bad times, like when Chester dreams of a willow leaf, and eats a dollar bill, but all together they manage. These wonderful pals go on some more pretty great adventures, Chester even becomes a celebrity.

The ending is somewhat, well different, but it doesn't leave you sad or hanging. I would recommend this book to other thirteen-year-olds. It is not way to easy, or overly difficult to read. I would actually reccomend it to ages 11-14. All in all it is a good beginning book for a series of entertainment."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"This was a big hit with our three-and-a-half year old. It was the second chapter book I read aloud to him, and perfect for his age. As other reviewers have noted, the tense scenes are minimal, all the characters are appealing (although there is a bit of ethnic stereotyping), and the themes of friendship and loyalty are positive."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"It all started when Mario found his new best friend in a pile of dirt. He met Chester, Chester the cricket. Mario lives with mama and poppa, but they don't have a lot of money. They own a newsstand in Grand Central Station. Chester meets two other friends besides Mario. He meets Tucker, a mouse and Harry, a cat. Quickly these four learn a lot about each other and become best friends. The four friends work hard to bring success to Mario's newsstand. I think this book is great. When I was reading I couldn't put the book down because you never know what's going to happen next so you have to read on. I think many other people should read this book too. It so detailed so you can see every little part in the book happening in your head. This book is one of my favorite books I have every read in my whole entire life. There's nothing good missing in this book, it's great. I would most certainly recommend this book to anyone who likes to read. The four friends work hard to bring success to Mario's newsstand.

I enjoyed the book because the author, George Selden, used good vocabulary words to describe his characters and settings. The story was easy to follow and fun to read.The Cricket in Times Square is about a cricket named Chester. Chester lived in Connecticut. One day he smelled some food from a picnic and went over to investigate the smell. While sniffing, he got caught in a bag with sandwiches. The family eating the sandwiches got on a train to New York City. When he got to New York City, one of the main characters, Mario Bellini, found Chester outside. Chester was next to Mario's parent's newsstand so Mario picked him up and put him in a matchbox. While at the newsstand, Mario asked his mom if he could keep the cricket. After a few days Mario took Chester to buy a cage at a Chinese store. The cage was shaped like a Chinese building.At the newsstand Chester met a mouse named Tucker and a cat named Harry. Chester became good friends with them. Chester became a very famous cricket and played his beautiful music at 8:00AM and 4:30PM for all the people at the newsstand.If you want more details about Chester's exciting adventures, read this book or other books by George Selden!

I tried to introduce him at age 3...but it was a little heavy for him. By age 6, it was perfect. We read it to him again at 7 and 8.

It all started at the newsstand, when Mario was selling newspapers and magazines. Suddenly, he heard a cricket!! Mario went to the place where he heard the cricket chirp.

His name was Tucker. Chester made friends with him. Then Chester saw a cat! Chester ran and his in his matchbox. Tucker Mouse told him that it was Harry Cat. Harry wasn't mean to mice, so they all became friends. The part I liked was when Chetser became famous for his songs and everybody started coming to the newsstand to hear him chirp beautiful music.

Certain scenes stick out in my mind like it was yesterday and give me much joy when I think of them. As with any classic childrens' book the pictures are as important as the story and pulling that duty here is Garth Williams, illustrator of two of my all time favorite books growing up, Stuart Little and Charlotte's Web.

The characters are clever, some even wise, they have good friendships, good habits and a sense of humor. This is also part of a series that does not go bad in sequel, another uncommon feature. I won't tell you the plot, but my son and I had a great time following cricket and his friends."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"\\"The Cricket in Times Square\\" is a book about a cricket named Chester who accidently left Connecticut and ended up it in New York. In New York, there is a boy named Mario Bellini, who works in an unsuccessful newsstand. One day, Mario hears music in the back of the newsstand and goes to check it out. Mario finds a cricket and decides to keep him as a pet, but his mom wants him to throw it out because she thinks the cricket has germs. Mario did not want to throw Chester away, so his mom let Chester sleep in the newsstand. Mario takes Chester to Chinatown to buy a cricket cage for him. At first, the cricket cage was going to cost a lot of money, but because there were not that many crickets in Chinatown, the owner let Mario have the cage for fifteen cents. Chester made two friends, Tucker Mouse and Harry Cat, but Mario becomes his best friend. Mario takes Chester everywhere he goes.The funniest part in the book was when Chester ate half of a two dollar bill and started playing Music. Mario's mom heard him and told Mario's dad. After a while, Mario's dad told the \\"New York Times\\" about Chester and his music. People came from all over to hear Chester play and the newsstand started making money. One day, Chester got tired of playing music, so he left New York and went back to Connecticut. It was sad when Chester was about to leave New York.I did not like \\"The Cricket in Times Square\\" that much because it was not funny enough."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"I really like this book. I wish it had more action/adventure, but it is really good."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"The Cricket in Times Square was a book that I enjoyed very much. Even though I'm only 7, I had a fun time reading it in my second grade class. My favorite character was Tucker Mouse. I do a lot of scurrying myself. But I didn't like the last part when Chester went back to Connecticut. Right now I'm reading Chester Cricket Finds a New Home. I'm enjoying that, too. I recommend the Chester Cricket series to kids of all ages."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"I enjoyed this book. I particularly liked the part when Chester meets Mr. Smedley, who is a music teacher. Mr. Smedley is so surprised to learn that Chester, a cricket, can play scales and songs! After reading The Cricket in Times Square, try The Phantom Tollbooth, one of my favorites. It also has both animals and humans as main characters."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"I loved this book as a fourth-grader. The story was captivating and the characters likeable. However, even as that 9-year old fascinated by the adventures of Tucker Mouse, Harry Cat and Chester, the racist stereotypes disturbed me. The \\"Chinaman\\" Mr. Sai Fong in the story is a stereotypical Chinese man who owns a laundry, speaks English incorrectly and um...wears kimonos, not to mention the fact that CHINESE don't wear kimonos, JAPANESE do. Mr. Sai Fong portrays the typical stereotype of the sage old Chinese man who offers wise old sayings to young Mario and gives him fortune cookies and chow mein (even though fortune cookies aren't even Chinese). Obviously George Seldon didn't do his research. As a fourth-grader, I shook off my nagging notions that maybe this book was racist. However, now that I return to this book 7 years later, it only disturbs me more that such a book could become so popular despite its racist undertones. It's a pleasant little story, but succumbs to racism. But the book may not have to be omitted from a school curriculum: perhaps it can offer some good lessons on racism for young minds."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"The Cricket in time square is a worderful book about...

A boy named Mario found him and took good care of him. When Mario found out that Chester had a talent in chirping, everyone in New York City knew about him. Business became good for Mario and his parents, but Chester wasn't happy. He didn't like to be looked at and he didn't get to be with Mario. In this book, you never knew what was going to happen next. I liked it because it had animals as characters. What I didn't like about it was that the book didn't have jokes."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"This book is about a boy named Mario who finds a cricket named Chester. Mario wants to keep Chester, but his parents say no, because they think crickets carry germs. They eventually let Mario keep Chester.

This kid named Mario finds him and buys a cage for the cricket to live in. The main part of the book is about a friendship between a boy and a cricket.

Can he make friends and influence people among the callous commuters? Can he find musical fulfillment in a noisy subway station? Well, Chester is an excellent musician (who regretfully acquires a guilded, oriental cage) but how can he be heard in his new environment?Honest and grateful as well as talented, Chester wants to help his hosts--the Bellini family--at their struggling newspaper stand. But will his noble ideals be tainted by metropolitan animal riffraff? He is bombarded by contrasting values: greed and compassion. Most of all, how can he reach an understanding about his personal freedom, without hurting the feelings of the gentle boy who cares for him? Or will they both be exploited on some TV talk show? A cute story which will amuse the reader."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"This book is about a little mouse who was Tucker, a cat whose name was Harry, a kid named Mario. Mario owned a newsstand which was not going really well.In the meanwhile a cricket named Chester arrives in Times Square, from Connecticut. The four decided to make Mario's bankrupt newsstand become popular once again. Later in the book everone decided to put Chester (the lucky cricket) on the newsstand so people could be more attracted to it. Then their plan was successful, hundreds and hundreds of people came.I liked the book because it was really interesting finding out how they could make the bankrupt newsstand successful. Then again most books are kind of boring because it keeps on saying the same things over and over again. This book isn't boring because every page you turn something new happens, so this book is really exciting to read.My favorite part in this book was when Mario's newsstand finally became a success. It is my favorite part because it is kind of sad in the start of the book because it seems like Mario's life is very poor and trying to struggle just to make his newsstand right. Then, when you see that they brought up with a great plan, and Mario's newsstand is filled with people now."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"When I read Wind in the Willows, I thought no other book could match its calm, slow, elegant pace, but this book does. However, I didn't find it measuring up to Wind in the Willows as far as a literary work goes. Why not? They're both written very eloquently (although I did think Wind in the Willows had some unnecessarily advanced vocabulary) and they both had outstanding and lovable characters. What's A Cricket in Times Square missing? I looked at all of the reviews here, and couldn't figure out why I didn't want to give A Cricket in Times Square any more than three stars. Then it hit me. Location! Lack of location to be exact.When I was at the bookstore trying to decide if I wanted to get this book or A Wrinkle in Time, I picked A Cricket in Times Square because I expected to see a lot of cricket and a lot of Times Square. I did get a lot of cricket, but unfortunately I didn't see much of Times Square. I mostly saw an unsuccessful newsstand, and a Times Square drainpipe, but not much else. A (very) brief time inside of a soda shop, and two visits to China Town were the only other things I got. However, there's no denying Mr. Selden couldn't have written a better story where 90% of the action happens at a drainpipe and a newsstand four feet away.For most of the story, I wondered why the setting even had to be Times Square. It wasn't until the second to last chapter that I found out. At this late point in the story, Mr. Selden describes an extraordinarily beautiful scene where the busiest part of the busiest city in the world sits in stunned silence, listening to the music of one tiny little cricket. A wonderful demonstration of writing that almost convinced me to change the three star rating.Some examples of humor are demonstrated in the story, but these examples are not often occuring. The real focus of this story is cute characters who become friends and encourage the showcasing of each others' talents. In other words, it's a book perfect for kids who don't desire a complicated story. If you're into simplicity, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"I liked this book. This book is about 3 animals named Chester Harry and Tucker.

Now my daughter has to read it for school, and it's brought back some fond childhood memories. It is a wonderful story about an unusual friendship. An all-time classic!"},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"I enjoyed reading this book to my 11 year old and 9 year old. It made for a good read-aloud. The characters are warm and friendly, and the story draws you in. The last few chapters are especially good. We can't wait to read more books in this series and follow the adventures of Chester the cricket, Tucker the mouse and Harry cat. As with all good books, these characters feel like old friends."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"I bought this book for my 9year old for Christmas remembering how much I had liked it when I was young. Although he is an excellent reader it is sometimes hard to get him to actually sit down and read. When he first opened the gift he seemed genuinely disappointed to see that it was a book and not a video game, but once he started reading it took him little time to finish it on his own. Not only that, he has asked me to get another book from the series."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"Great children's classic! I read it to my niece and nephew over a couple of weeks, reading a chapter or two in the evenings. My nephew is 8 and my niece is 5. This is the first long book that has held both of their interests, and they eagerly looked forward to each session. My niece would often ask during the day if we'd be reading \\"the cricket book\\" that night.Believe it or not, I had never read THE CRICKET IN TIMES SQUARE before, and I found myself reading ahead after the kids went to sleep because I just had to find out what happened! And why not? This is a charming story full of adventure, friendships, and whimsy. I don't think anything I say would improve on the abundance of accolades showered on this book through the decades since it was first published in 1960. All I'm going to do is give it a big thumbs up and encourage anyone who hasn't read it, to do so -- with or without a kid at your side! It's thoroughly enjoyable!"},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"This is an excellant audio book. Tony Shalhoub's voice is so soothing and the voices he does for each character is hilarious! Very enjoyable!"},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"I bought this set of CDs two years ago for my daughter. She likes to listen to books-on-CD at night while she is going to sleep. I have bought a number of CDs and I have to say that this is one of the better ones. She still listens to it 2 years later!"},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"After Chester Cricket is inadvertently transported via picnic basket from his rural Connecticut home to New York City, he becomes the much-loved pet of a sweet, responsible boy named Mario, whose Italian-immigrant family is trying to make ends meet running a news stand in Times Square. With help from his newfound four-legged friends, Tucker Mouse and Harry Cat, this musical insect helps his adoptive family in their quest to achieve the American Dream. But in spite of the winged-instrument-playing critter becoming the talk of the town, he can't shake the feeling that...there's no place like home. That gained in the book on CD, with the most offensive part, the kind Chinese storekeeper's stereotypical language (rs substituted with ls) replaced with Chinese-accented English, is lost in the portrayal of Chester's musical talents, which is better left to the imagination.The Cricket in Times Square, G-rated and with excellent illustrations, is an uplifting, inspiring story of friendship that is best when read aloud to your favorite six to eight-year-old bookworm. Also good: The Tale of Desperaux by Kate DiCamillo, Emmy and the Incredible Shrinking Rat by Lynne Jonell, and Frederick by Leo Lionni."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"This book was a favorite from my youth. Since my kids are becoming readers, I thought it would be great for me to read this book to them. They loved it.

It was a walk down memory lane to read this book to my kids."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"Still a classic. I remembered this book from when I was a child.

I think that you should read this book its a really good book Read The Cricket In time Square."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"This book portrays very old racist stereotypes of Chinese people. It portrays Chinese people as speaking in stereotypical accents with all r's replaced by l's. It portrays Chinese people as not knowing when to stop bowing to each other. It portrays Chinese people wearing Japanese Kimono's. If you MUST buy this awful ignorant book, do not let your child read it without teaching them about the racism and teaching them how not to be as ignorant."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"This is about a boy and a cricket. Mario, the boy, is working at a newsstand when he hears a noise. He looks under a trash can and finds a cricket. He buys a cage for the cricket, and that's how it turns out. The part I liked is when the cricket chirps and asks the man who was going to steal the bell what he was doing. I did not like the rest."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"This was my favorite book while growing up.

It has many surprises and is very heartwarming. We recommend this book for people who like fantasy books and talking animals because there are lots of them.

Read this book to find out if the newsstand goes bankrupt. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"THE CRICKET IN TIMES SQUARE is a classic children's story. Written in the 1960's and the winner of a Newbery Honor Book award, THE CRICKET IN TIMES SQUARE has wonderful staying power. Now, courtesy of Macmillan Young Listeners, the tale truly comes to life.The story finds a country cricket, Chester, unwittingly stranded in New York City. After falling asleep in a picnic basket in Connecticut, he wakes up in a world that is totally different to him. He is befriended by Mario, a young boy who helps his parents run a newsstand in the subway. Chester encounters Tucker, a wizened city mouse, and his friend, Harry Cat. The two teach Chester how to live in the city and enjoy the wonders of the subway.Soon, everyone learns of Chester's talent of recreating any music he hears, and spellbounds Mario's parents, music critics, and subway commuters alike. But Chester quickly becomes tired of the constant performing, and misses his quiet country life. Tucker and Harry do their best to ensure that Chester finds his way back home.With the talents of Tony Shalhoub, Chester Cricket, Harry Cat, and Tucker Mouse become real characters that the listener can instantly relate to. Even though the story is about animals in a Times Square subway station, the listener gets drawn in and wants there to be a happy ending.Mr. Shalhoub creates unique voices for each of the characters, and from the very beginning, it is easy to decipher which character is doing the speaking. I listened to the story (an unabridged production on two CDs) with my two children and they were immediately enchanted. With classical music signaling the end of each chapter, they both would shout out the next one.For anyone not familiar with the classic tale, listening to it will be an adventure. And for those that know the sweet tale of Chester finding himself in a foreign land (at least for him), listening to the story will be a treat. No one will be disappointed!Reviewed by: Jaglvr"},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"There's a cricket named Chester. He was born in Connecticut.

His voices are right on. The cricket's voice is a little annoying, but he doesn't talk much, and he's a cricket.I read this story when I was a child, and when my daughter read it at school a few years ago, I was so happy that she enjoyed it as much as I did.

This means that I like things likeaction and impossible missions. Chester helped earn money and theBellinis became rich. This was my favorite part of the story.Bryan Chang"},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"I'm a New Yorker now living elsewhere, and when I read the book to my son I quickly realized I had to give Tucker Mouse an authentic New York accent, he's such the quintessential New Yorker. Selden's writing of Tucker's dialogue is just brilliant, captures exactly a certain kind of New Yorker - seemingly rough on the outside,heart of gold inside. Brings back lots of memories for me and makes me quite homesick. My son is always in stitches whenever Tucker speaks. We are now reading the sequel, Tucker's Countryside and it's Tucker that makes the book. Chester's kind and quiet ways make a good counterbalance, but I can't imagine the series without the wise-cracking eloquent Tucker. What a well-written character - read the book just for him."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"So, where do you stand regarding books that are remarkably good, but riddled with casual insensitive racial stereotypes? Wherever you are, you'll have to bring that position to bear on this book.The writing is marvelous. The central characters have spirit and style. This book screams \\"New York City attitude\\", in a good way. You feel you are in Times Square Station. You feel the time period. You know these people. They have charm and decency and grit.And then you hit the Chinese characters. The most laughably offensive fake Chinese pidgin English ever. And you cringe. Which is a terrible shame, since the Chinese gentlemen who are portrayed are kind, gentle and generous.So what do you do. Explain the book? Skip the Chinese parts? Just avoid it? That, of course, is up to you. Just bear in mind that the book itself is worth the trouble of trying to figure out a solution that lets you read it to your kids."},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"I read a book named 'The Cricket in Times Square' and I really liked it.The reason why I liked it is because it gave us lessons about friend shipand loyalty.

My students fell in love with Chester, Harry and especially Tucker. My young students understand the humor but my older students gleen a deeper understanding of friendship and its joys and responsibilities.

My favorite part of the book was when Mario and Chester went to China Town and ate the Chinese dinner with Sai Fong and the Chinese gentelman. My favorite charaters were Chester, Tommy cat, and tucker. It was a great book to read!! I recomend this book to you.-Lyla"},{"Title":"The Cricket in Times Square","review":"This review is about The Cricket In Times Square and it is by George Selden. It starts out about a boy that finds a cricket in a subway station. The cricket is named Chester. Chester has two friends, and one is a cat and one is a mouse. The cat's name is Harry and the mouse's name is Tusker. In the book they have to save a newstand. To find out if they do it, you will have to read the book. It is a mystery but it is not like other mysteries I have read. This one is different because in all the other mysteries I read there is someone who dies but this one is how to save a newstand. I do not recommend this book to high school students because it is a book for little kids. I do think younger ones will like it because it is a mystery that little kids would like.

It was adequate as the topic relates to the european or white settlement of the area, but it is dramitically lacking detail as regards the identities of aboriginal inhabitants at the time of discovery. I was really hoping it would provide more detail on that subject.The author jumped around quite often and at times I got lost in the journey and tracing the relevance. Overall, it provided insight into how the region was settled and there were some enlightening vignettes of live during the periods discussed. Not extensive detail, just enough to make the points the author wished to convey. For the serious historical researcher there are enough footnotes to guide additional research to perhaps gain the additional detail that is lacking.The author had her own unique way of writing, but it does not neccesarily equate to a true literary form. It was worth the price for the read, and for the identification of source material for a deeper historical research project. It It is a bit 'one-sided' from the cultural anthropological perspective in favor of the dominent society over the aboriginal view."},{"Title":"By Any Other Name","review":"Yes, this is a re-release of previously published material, but good luck finding it anywhere else! It took 3 years for Amazon to come up with a used copy of Antinomy for me, and when they did, they wanted $27.00 for it (paperback) and no I didn't buy it. And I have yet to see it in any used book store. Moreover, without your support, authors like Spider Robinson will find it increasingly difficult to stay in business.And THIS book is WONDERFUL, and worth every penny. I am having trouble thinking of a single instance in which Spider Robinson has ever published a clunker, and some of the stories in this book are among his best, IMO. Melancholy Elephants, Antinomy, Satan's Children, Apogee, and True Minds are among my favorites in the book (I've yet to read the last two). As always, Spider's writing is sensitive, thoughtful, and very, very human, just like the author himself. Strongly influenced by the work and life of Ted Sturgeon (whose work is also a must-read if you haven't yet) his stories are sometimes poignant, sometimes hilarious, and always a good read. Buy one for yourself, and three to give away."},{"Title":"By Any Other Name","review":"Here is a collection of short stories by Spider Robinson that have nothing to do with Callahan's Saloon. This is the second of his short story collections without the Irishman's bar. And is as good as the first. Where the first short story book, User Friendly, gave the reader the warm fuzzies wrapped around great SF stories, this book puts the reader on a roller coaster of emotions. From the depressing to the thoughtful, from the punny to the erotic, By Any Other Name, is a book to read. A word of warning, from me, and somewhat from Mr. Robinson, the stories are mixed in a way that there is generally one happy story, then one depressing one. Read a depressing one, then a happy one. You'll end up liking yourself better!"},{"Title":"By Any Other Name","review":"True, this is a collection of Spider's older work, but those works are out of print. People who shop at used bookstores, instead of paying the extra money (when they can afford to) will put authors out of work. OK, business lecture is over. On to the reviewAll of the stories in the collection are excellent, but some stand out more than others. The title piece, which incidentally is at the end of the book, _By Any Other Name_, has a protagonist who has descended into the ruins of a post apocalyptic NYC to kill a mad scientist responsible for a plague that killed off most of man kind. In true Spider Robinson style, the base concepts of revenge, killing, fear and who is or isn't one's enemy come ot the forefront. The science takes a back seat to the moral dilemmas, which are deep, and meaningful to anyone at any time.The rest of the stories share that style. They ask us to question our emotions and our values by presenting people who are forced to do so through such plot devices as a drug that addicts people to tell the truth, perpetual copyrights, and a host of other causes that have unforeseen effects. It is his ability to ask those questions that separates Spider Robinson from so many other Science Fiction authors who craft good stories, but never made me *think* about the deeper things.For those people out there who agree with the first part of my review on supporting authors by buying their books and not getting a cheaper copy at a used bookstore, try checking out http://www.spiderrobinson.com, and following the amazon dot com link back to here. That way you not only support Spider by buying his book, but also by his amazon dot com affiliate site."},{"Title":"By Any Other Name","review":"Spider Robinson is one of the Great Ones. He's Part Heinlein, part McCaffrey, part Brin (from his early days when he had hope), and part something undefinable yet incredibly special. I don't like short stories (I usually end up feeling gipped), I get emotionally vested in the characters and then the story is over. These stories are worth it. Despite the disimilar settings each story is really about people and relationships, and the darkest story still has a ray of hope. I've been recomending Spider Robinson's stories to people since 1989, so far every person I've recommended him to has fallen in love with his characters."},{"Title":"By Any Other Name","review":"With one or two brief exceptions, this (as well as Robinson's other recent anthology &quot;User Friendly&quot;) is a reissue of material from his out-of-print anthology &quot;Meloncholy Elephants&quot; and the still older &quot;Antinomy.&quot; Hit the used bookstores first, save your money."},{"Title":"Chronicle of John Malalas Books VIII-XVIII","review":"John Malalas (c. 491-c. 578) was a Byzantine historian of Syrian origin who wrote in Greek. His 18 book long History covers the years from Creation until 565 (or 574) however, the manuscripts historians have found end around 563. This edition covers from the death of Alexander the Great to sometime during the reign of Justinian. Although this text is not the most historically accurate of Chronicles from the period, it is still useful in understanding the first half of the 6th century. The period around Justinian's reign is by far the most historically accurate (of a rarely accurate work) although John has a definite pro-Justinian bias. The work is also centered around the city of Antioch.Perhaps the most interesting (certainly for my research) was John Malalas' opinion of the normally reviled Roman Emperor Nero. Malalas describes Nero as \\"tall and thin, gray, with a heavy beard, able\\" who was interested in the teachings of Christ (57) while Suetonius and other Roman historians have completely different descriptions. Suetonius writes that Nero was \\"of good height but his body was blotchy and ill-smelling... his stomach protruding, his legs very skin\\" and took pleasure in burning the Christians. This is one of the only texts existent that Nero is described in an overall positive light. Nothing is mentioned about how Nero killed his mother, burned parts of Rome, and all his sexual debaucheries.This is an awful edition to a fascinating text. I understand that Matthew Spinka's purpose was simply to translate the Slavonic version (from 1262) of the text so that others will make conclusions about its veracity etc. However, that does not mean ignore EVERYTHING that an introduction is supposed to include. There is no mention of such basics as when John Malalas was born, who he was, where he is from, or what the text covers. When the text begins it is impossible to follow along since no dates are placed in the margins for the reader. Sadly, to my knowledge there is no other translations. If anyone knows of one please make a comment on my review."},{"Title":"The U.P.

Trail","review":"\\"The U.P. Trail\\" is basically the story of the endless perils of young Allie Lee. And when I say endless, I mean endless. Allie and her mother are fleeing her nefarious step-father when their wagon train is attacked by Indians. Everyone but Allie is killed. She's rescued by the man who will become her one true love. She goes to live peacefully with an old trapper. Things are fine until she's kidnapped by some rough desperados. Before they have the chance to do anything to her, the whole gang is attacked by Indians and Allie is taken captive by the Sioux. She manages to escape the village and finds another wagon train. Who should be in this group but her evil step-father she was trying to escape from in the first place. This means she has to escape him yet again. Briefly she's reunited with her one true love. Then the outpost is attacked by Indians, during which Allie is kidnapped by outlaws and returned to her stepfather. With help she escapes from him again. For a short time she's imprisoned in a bawdy house but with help escapes from there, only to be captured again by her evil step-father. This is it. This is the whole book - Allie being held against her will by someone and the Indians having nothing else to do but constantly attack. If you approach the book one way you may enjoy wondering just what else will happen to Allie to keep her separated from her one true love. Have fun wondering what crimes did she commit in a previous life in order to deserve all this."},{"Title":"The U.P.

Trail","review":"I downloaded the book so that I will have something that I may want to read. I will read it on one of my overseas flights."},{"Title":"The U.P. Trail","review":"I started reading Zane Grey's novels about 15 years ago, when a great-uncle told me of the times, as a youth in the 1920s, he had read Grey's novels on cold nights in front of a fire. It must be close to a decade ago when I first read this title, and I can't help but re-read it every few years. It infuses me with wonder and awe every time.I knew enough about Grey's novels, by the time I read this one, to know that Riders of the Purple Sage was considered his best. But when I got to the end of The U P Trail, I said to myself, &quot;This is the greatest book I have ever read.&quot; This novel, which is focused upon the construction of the Union-Pacific Railroad, has something incredibly passionate and elemental about it that not only elevates it above Grey's other numerous titles, including Riders, but makes it a giant in its genre. Grey himself says in his dedication that &quot;it is the book for which I have written all the others.&quot;The book's scope is akin to a giant mirror being held up to reflect, in one grand and allegorical image, the breadth of the human experience in the building of the American West, and the destruction of its frontier culture. It's a tale of heroism, virtue, sacrifice, greed, personal ruin, redemption, betrayal, saintliness, violence, bigotry, lust, depravity, nobility, and so many other aspects of human nature it's hard to list them all here. It is filled with unforgettable characters who represent every social group involved with both the building of the railroad itself, and the white man's ambition to expand the nation to the Pacific coast. Some of the incidents and moments created by Grey will remain with readers long after they have finished the book, if not forever. And central to it all is the tortured story of the lovers Neale and Allie.As to drawbacks: modern readers may struggle, in places, with the novel's tone and language. The dialogue of its characters sometimes contains the vernacular and political perspective of the era in which the book was written, and held up to modern standards it could occasionally be labeled politically incorrect. Readers may also have trouble accepting the extra-innocent, almost saintly Allie, and the numerous occasions in which her virtue is preserved against all odds.Generally, though, I believe that the power and beauty of the book will be the primary impression left with those who read it. It should not be missed by anyone who is a Zane Grey fan OR a fan of historical fiction pertaining to the American West. It's a great view of the legacy in which all Americans live today."},{"Title":"The U.P.

He gets tedious at times describing the terrain as did L'Amour, but the meat is worth the gristle. He tells a hell of a story that you can't put down any more than the latest Stephen King thriller.

Prof. Ehrman scrupulously analyzes the available sources, and the research and opinions of other historians, to paint as detailed a picture as possible of Jesus' life, as well as the historical context in which he lived.Ehrman does a fantastic job of explaining the criteria which historians use to determine how likely it is that something described in the Gospels (and other sources) actually happened. He is careful to make the distinction between what a historian attempts to do, versus what a theologian is after. Whether or not you agree with Ehrman's conclusions, this is an eye-opening course from which Christians and non-Christians alike can learn much.Since the Gospels and the rest of the New Testament were written at various times, at least 30 years after Jesus' death and some much much later, this course has made me very curious as to how the books of the New Testament came to be assembled... Prof. Ehrman has a course called, I believe, \\"Lost Christianities\\", which deals with this subject, and which I will probably dive into soon enough.The cds are accompanied by two small books, which provide an outline of each lecture, and a bibliography, for review, and are housed in two sturdy plastic cases."},{"Title":"Croatian Tales of Long Ago, Volume 1 (English, Croatian and German Edition)","review":"Hyperliterature is literature which cannot be fully reproduced in print, because in one way or another it takes advantage of the computerised medium - via sound-effects, animation, nonlinear structure etc. One of the most obvious commercial applications for this is in children's literature. Imagine a pop-up book where the pop-ups worked over and over again without ever getting creased or tearing! Up until now, however, the possibilities of children's hyperliterature have hardly been explored.Croatian Tales of Long Ago (Part One) changes all that, although it can be expected to appeal to adults just as much as children. It is a really exciting piece of hyperliterature: unpretentious, with genuine popular appeal, but not in the least shallow, sentimental or patronising to its audience. It has rightly won a hatful of international awards. If this CD and its companion volume meet with the commercial success they deserve, we can expect to see a lot more work of this type appearing in the next few years.

Dictionaries have limitations, to be sure, but in Pali (as in English) if you are confused or curious about the precise meaning of a word you have no substitute for a good dictionary, and incompletely translated terms can significantly interfere with your understanding. This is as true for your native language as for a technical professional discipline.-Here's an example. I recently prepared a talk on the Dhammapada and commented on Byrom's translation of verse 95 (yes, yes, there are far more literally accurate translations, and you bet I backed it up with Carter and Palihawadana and Thanissaro, but Byrom's stylistic beauty makes it a popular text which most people in the class seemed to be using. Other translations have challenges, too). Byrom describes arahants as \\"yielding like the earth.\\" Yielding? This word conjures up images of a passive, floppy, Alfred E. Neuman attitude which would be indifferent to grave injustice. That just didn't seem right, but other translations only threw confusion on the issue. Well, when all else fails, read the directions in the original language. The dictionary showed the Pali word meant \\"without resistance; without hostility.\\" So...in the original language, the verse probably meant one could resist injustice and untruth, but one could never skillfully do this using hostility. Problem Solved. Consistency Re-established. This is but one example where a dictionary, especially in a precise and meaning-rich philosophy like Buddhism, is enriching and even crucial, especially for one not fluent in the language. Goodness only knows how many other misconceptions I have, based on inaccurate or incompletely explained translations.-Other dictionaries exist, including web-based ones, by competent scholars and I've used most (though not all). But -- when I first looked into this text my jaw literally dropped because of the dictionary's comprehensiveness. The entry for \\"kamma\\" had 4-1/2 pages! It was like comparing a pocket dictionary with a Webster's Unabridged. The authors are the only ones I've seen who consistently give root verbs and Sanskrit analogues, which are enriching and crucial for understanding the Pali. Translating or explaining difficult terms without them amounts to malpractice. Furthermore, it is organized like my friendly old Macdonell's Sanskrit Dictionary, also a useful masterpiece of scholarship and precision. The authors also briefly introduced the problems any dictionary will have, including accuracy and precision.-No one with an intermediate or advanced level of interest in Buddhism should be without an adequate Pali dictionary to further explain difficult and controversial topics. End of discussion. Period. Dot. The Buddha taught no one should let someone else do their thinking for them! This Pali dictionary is far and away the most comprehensive and the best I've seen. Its main problem (being out of date) is far more easily rectified than having a trendy, modern text or translation which is neither as comprehensive nor as accurate. One really picky thing is that it doesn't give the Pali alphabetical order, but that's easy enough to correct by making your own chart (I'd suggest tabs, too).-If you like the Dhamma as explained by Theravada Buddhism, then buy this dictionary, even if you think attachment to material things is bad."},{"Title":"The hounds of God (Popular library)","review":"This is not one of Sabatini's better known novels nor is it in the same class as Captain Blood, Scaramouche, or Master at Arms. But if, like me, you love Sabatini, or if you are simply a fan of the historical swashbuckler, you will enjoy The Hounds of God (1928). It has the same careful attention to historical detail, sparkling dialogue, humor, action, and surprising plot twists that once made the author a household name. The protagonists, young naval hero Gervase Crosby and fiercely independent Lady Margaret Trevanion, are caught up in the groundswell of events surrounding the failed invasion of England by the Spanish Armada. Abducted and brought to Spain by shipwrecked grandee Don Pedro, both Margaret and her abductor, much to their surprise, both become grist for the mill of the notorious Inquisition. The author's portrayal of Elizabeth I is comic but pitch-perfect. Like many of Sabatini's villains, the urbane Don Pedro is a sympathetic and thoroughly human character, swept up by his own lust and emotions. Even the Dominican inquisitors are portrayed as deeply zealous and well-meaning, though purblind, creatures--which is what makes them so frightening and real, for their aseptic deliberations lead them to the most appalling conclusions and wicked acts. Perhaps the novel's greatest strength is in demonstrating so realistically how human beings can be led to such inhumanity by a fanatical devotion to the Truth. Sabatini was certainly capable of writing a potboiler or two, but I would not class this one among them. Although not his best, the novel is tight, well-written and suspenseful, with often fascinating insights into historical events and characters."},{"Title":"The hounds of God (Popular library)","review":"This book of historical fiction has been out of print and impossible to find for years.

Without it, arguably at least, consciousness itself borders on irrelevance, and identity no longer exists. Most of us think of memory, metaphorically, as shining a spotlight on images, sounds, and emotions from our past. Reading Daniel Schacter's fascinating text, Searching for Memory, The Brain, the Mind, and the Past, I realized just how deceptive and simplistic that notion is. In fact, every time you speak, or write something, or read, or drive a car, you're calling on &quot;procedural&quot; memory which allows you to learn skills and acquire habits, and/or &quot;semantic&quot; memory, which includes conceptual and factual knowledge. Even the spotlight-type memories you do have can be divided into &quot;field&quot; memories, which mimic your perceptions at the time of the original experience, and &quot;observer&quot; memories, which where you actually see yourself from the outside. (The latter is common when recalling early-childhood experiences.) Searching for Memory is beautifully written, and teeming with stories and anecdotes that illustrate the nature of memory in a way that makes the absorption of its insights effortless. My only complaint about this book is that my wife kept trying to read it over my shoulder. If you're married, I suggest you order two copies"},{"Title":"Searching for Memory: The Brain, the Mind, and the Past (Soft Cover)","review":"The title of this book is not very helpful in understanding what this book is about. There is a translation of Schacter's book (ISBN 3498063243) in German titled &quot;Wir sind Erinnerung&quot;, meaning &quot;we are recollections&quot;. These three words sum up the essence of the whole book much better than the original title. Really.Schacter seems to be one of the leading scientists in the field of research on memory. He coined several technical terms of the field and built theories about how humans remember, what they remember and how they fail to remember. This book is a summary of Schacter's work over the period 1980 to 1995 in plain words. While the main text uses very few technical terms, there are many many references to scientific papers. The Notes section stretches over 40 pages, the bibliography covers 35 pages, and the index is excellent. All in all a well written book about a scientific subject.If you are a scientist in the field, this book is not for you. You should read scientific papers instead of reading 400 pages of a paperback book. There are some other things I do not like about this book (which others seem to like). Schacter often refers to paintings of artists which are reproduced (in black and white, no colour) in the book. These pictures illustrate the way some artists feel about several aspects of memorizing. Well, I am not interested in such poor black and white reproductions, but perhaps you like it. Another annoying feature of this book is that there is often too much story telling in it. I would have liked more conciseness and precision instead of the many many cases a clinician sees through his career.

I personally did not enjoy the artistic aspest of the book, but many say it was complementing. Now there are much better cognitive neuroscience books on memory -Kandel and Squires books, Steven Roses, among others- but as for the psychological aspects, this book stands above all others. At times it reads too much like a collection of case studies, but few would deny that lesion studies have contribuited a lot to an understanding of the brain/mind.Most of the memory field is covered: recogntion vs. recall, implicit vs. explicit, episodic vs. procedural, short -long term, working memory, genral,emotional, semantic, etc..... but there is also a welcome and thorough discussion of false and recovered memories. In no other field can one see better the imediateimpact that cognitive psychology of memory has on legal and social issues. Schacter effectively explains everything we know about the phenomenon. As for the other themes, adequate and sufficient reviews are given. I personally would have liked a bit more of neuroscience, but it is a great read nontheless. There is also not much mention of the relationship between memory and other higher cognitive processes, like consciousness (a good place for speculation) or attention. But Schacter sticks to what is known, and does it well.AS an introduction to any aspect of memory studies, few texts are better than this one. But I would tell anyone interested to also read other Schacter books, as well as more pure psychology and neurological texts on the subject.

I now have a PhD in neuroscience, and i can say that this is a fantastic book for a serious reader. One thing that sets this book apart from other similar books (including Schacter's latter books) is that it is fully referenced. Every claim that he makes is cited, so the interested reader can easily follow up on a specific topic. Because of this extensive citing, i consider this to be more scholarly than popular science. But the style of writing is very fluid and keeps the reader interested.Schacter breaks down the different kinds of memories: episodic, procedural, source, etc. Explains what each is and where in the brain we think these memories are stored.You might think that you should get a newer book, since neuroscience is a fast moving field. When this was written it was the very beginning of functional MRI. Since then there have been many studies. However, I still recommend this book as a primer.

In many ways, however, it acts to spotlight more what we DON'T know about memory than what we do. It focuses on location of activity in the brain insofar as discussing how memories are made, rather than the nuts and bolts of HOW they are crafted. In other words, it's as if you were an observer on a hill far above a town and you, not knowing any history of transactions or how stores work, watched many people enter a building, and coming out with items. If you didn't know how monetary exchanges worked, you could still hypothecize that \\"something\\" occurred in that building that enabled people to go in empty-handed but come out loaded with goods. But you might have no idea about how money worked or how barter might work. You simply wouold have no way of really knowing what took place in those mysterious locations. So it is with Schacter's book: repeatedly he talks about the hippocampus or other location in the brain as being a spot of brain activity when memories are recalled, but that says nothing about how they are recorded. Thus, the book does not address the specifics of how immaterial subjects such as ideas could be remembered in the physical world of the brain. I for one liked the constant usage of paintings to make his points about the \\"fragile power\\" of memory--it is through painters and novelists (creators) that we can learn a great deal of the depth of power, angst, and despair that memories (or the lack thereof) can cause. Seems perfectly appropriate to me. A good read and focuses more on breadth than depth, which again, perfectly appropriate for a lay audience."},{"Title":"Searching for Memory: The Brain, the Mind, and the Past (Soft Cover)","review":"Your memory is certainly the most crucial aspect of who you are. Without it, arguably at least, consciousness itself borders on irrelevance, and identity no longer exists. Most of us think of memory, metaphorically, as shining a spotlight on images, sounds, and emotions from our past. Reading Daniel Schacter's fascinating text, Searching for Memory, The Brain, the Mind, and the Past, I realized just how deceptive and simplistic that notion is. In fact, every time you speak, or write something, or read, or drive a car, you're calling on &quot;procedural&quot; memory which allows you to learn skills and acquire habits, and/or &quot;semantic&quot; memory, which includes conceptual and factual knowledge. Even the spotlight-type memories you do have can be divided into &quot;field&quot; memories, which mimic your perceptions at the time of the original experience, and &quot;observer&quot; memories, which where you actually see yourself from the outside. (The latter is common when recalling early-childhood experiences.) Searching for Memory is beautifully written, and teeming with stories and anecdotes that illustrate the nature of memory in a way that makes the absorption of its insights effortless.

Recomended reading for any serious student of the language."},{"Title":"The Signs of Language","review":"This book is and was intended for use by linguists, educators, and others such as anthropologists who were in the 1970's and the 1980's beginning to realize that ASL was not a manual gesture system mimicing English, but rather a language in its own right. Dr. Bellugi and Dr. Klima have been working on exploring this language for the past 30 years, both in studying native signers (the prelingually deafened of deaf parents) and also in studying aphasics in the deaf community in comparison to aphasics in the hearing community. This particular book sticks mostly with elucidating the grammar, the lexicon, the syntax, and all the other components which make up ASL.As a Deaf person whose first language was English, and who was required in college to take a foreign language I had to, of course, learn ASL. I started using ASL when I totally lost my hearing to get information in my classes which I couldn't get through lipreading. As I progressed in Neuroscience and Science education for my Ph.D. I found that I needed to know more about ASL and the grammar and syntax of it. This particular book was required for one of my classes studying English versus ASL grammar. Because the book is so heavy duty, I did not read enough for the book or language to make sense. It wasn't until I read the book over summer vacation, very slowly, that I gleaned the vital information which I needed as both an educator and a neuroscientist.This is not an easy book to read. Many of the best books never are. This is not to say that the authors did not try to make the information accessible. They did, but the topic is very confounding. I recommend this book for anyone sincerely interested in learning accurately about ASL, no matter what their field, but with the warning to give yourself time to assimulate the information, and read the book. I personally would not require reading the book partially for a class, because it is only in starting from the beginning and going to the end that you can view the language as a whole.

Hatch's presentation of the subject is extensive, yet his writing style makes it accessible even to those without scholarly bent, providing a read that is as gripping as it is educational.Cheers!- Rodney"},{"Title":"The democratization of American Christianity","review":"Nathan Hatch leaves little ambiguity as to what his seminal work is about as he opens with the line, \\"This book is about the cultural and religious history of the early American republic and the enduring structures of American Christianity.\\" Hatch focuses the years between 1780 and 1830, a time he sees as a transitional period during which foundations for the future structures of American Christianity were established. Hatch follows five mass religious movements that developed during this time.As Hatch develops the stories of these mass movements within an American atmosphere saturated with revival and revolution, he argues that \\"the theme of democratization is central to understanding the development of American Christianity.\\" Readers discover that this shift towards democratization was greatly influenced by the politics of the time and ultimately led people to eschew religious authority in almost all its forms, emphasize the liberty of the individual Christian in matters of faith and conscience.The main points of Hatch's argument are revealed early on and are fleshed out as he engages various organizing themes. While this approach could bore the reader, his focus upon defined groups within one historical period leads the book to move forward with ease. Overall, I felt Hatch was persuasive. However, I believe he could improve his work by connecting the section headings he used to organize the book with greater clarity to each chapter's argument and by including more stories of women during this era given its equalizing impulse."},{"Title":"The democratization of American Christianity","review":"One of the best historical works I've read is The Democratization of American Christianity (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1989). by Nathan Hatch. As a professor of history and vice president for Graduate Studies and Research at the University of Notre Dame, Hatch clearly occupies an established niche in academia and writes as a professional historian. This book received the 1988 Albert C. Outler Prize in Ecumenical Church History from the American Society of Church History as well as the 1989 prize for best book in the history of the early republic from the Society for Historians of the Early American Republic. But it's more than a learned treatise for historians--it's a well-told, masterful tale, one which helps us grasp important aspects of this nation's religious experience. The title announces the book's thesis: Hatch \\"argues both that the theme of democratization is central to understanding the development of American Christianity, and that the years of the early republic are the most crucial in revealing that process\\" (p. 3). In that era revivalism, a \\"wave of popular religious movements,\\" mainly inspired and directed by Baptist and Methodist preachers, christianized the fledgling nation by mid-century.Given the democratic tendencies sparked by the American Revolution--\\"the most crucial event in American history\\" (p. 5)--those religious movements which incorporated democratic ideology and polity most easily prospered. Between 1780 and 1830, uniquely American approaches established what we no label \\"evangelical\\" churches, and this emergence \\"of evangelical Christianity in the early republic is, in some measure, a story of the success of common people in shaping the culture after their own priorities rather than the priorities outlined by gentlemen such as the framers of the Constitution\\" (p. 9). Ordinary men and women, many of them marked by the rough practicality of the frontier, installed an Americanist version of the Christian faith in the new nation. They had little interest in European traditions, formal education, or theological subtleties. Thus they nurtured and followed \\"populist\\" preachers--largely self-educated leaders like the Methodist itinerant Lorenzo Dow who freely charted their own course. According to Dow, \\"larning isn't religion, and eddication don't give a man the power of the Spirit. It is the grace and gifts that furnish the real live coals from off the altar. St. Peter was a fisherman--do you think he ever went to Yale College?\\" (p. 20).Democratic forces tended to disestablish the learned professions, law and medicine as well as the ministry. In \\"back country\\" regions, dissent thrived and democratic impulses throbbed. \\"In the wake of the Revolution, dissenters confounded the establishment with an approach to theological matters that was nothing short of guerilla warfare. The coarse language, earthy humor, biting sarcasm, and commonsense reasoning of their attacks appealed to the uneducated but left the professional clergy without a ready defense. The very ground rules of religious life were at stake\\" (p. 34). The ground rules shifted. People embraced populist preachers and democratic evangelicalism triumphed. New evangelistic methods, most notably the camp meeting, took American Christianity in novel directions. When Lorenzo Dow tried to implant the camp meeting in England, Methodist leaders opposed it, finding offensive its \\"uncensored testimonials,\\" emotionalism, and \\"use of folk music that would have chilled the marrow of Charles Wesley\\" (p. 50). But America, the camp meetings helped Methodists and Baptists reach \\"common\\" men and women; just as Andrew Jackson inaugurated the era of the \\"common man,\\" so too evangelicals inaugurated the church of the common man. With some accuracy Michael Chevalier described frontier camp meetings as \\"'festivals of democracy'\\" (p. 58).The individualism, as well as the democracy, of the new nation also shaped American Christianity. The proliferation of new religious movements, ranging from Freewill Baptists to Universalists, from Disciples of Christ to Mormons, from Cumberland Presbyterians to Shakers, testifies to the fact that individuals freely launched and embraced a multitude of denominations, sects, and cults. The freedom which enabled Methodist circuit riders to adapt to their audience and call into being a distinctive American Methodism also enabled less \\"orthodox\\" prophets to successfully cast their nets into the turbulent waters of the new republic.In a democratic society, where the will of the majority prevails, religious as well as political leaders must court the masses. Still more: they must grant each person the right to think for oneself, for the \\"new ground rules measured theology by its acceptance in the marketplace\\" (p. 162). Charles Finney, clearly the most successful revivalist, openly \\"called for a Copernican revolution to make religious life audience-centered. He despised the formal study of divinity because it produced dull and ineffective communication\\" (p. 197).Alarmed by such tendencies, Philip Schaff and John Nevin, scholarly architects of the Mercersburg Theology, asserted: \\"Anyone who has, or fancies that he has, some inward experience and a ready tongue, may persuade himself that he is called to be a reformer; and so proceed at once, in his spiritual vanity and pride, to a revolutionary rupture with the historical life of the church, to which he hold himself immeasurably superior\\" (p. 165). As German Reformed theologians, they knew traditional theologies, such as their own Calvinism, stood at a disadvantage in the struggle for the hearts of independent-minded Americans who instinctively sided with \\"free will\\" Methodistic proclamation.Hatch argues that the churches which reached the common man, preeminently the Methodists and Baptists, democratized American Christianity. They are, he argues, more important than the more sedate and scholarly churches which have frequently provided the focus for historians' presentations of American church history. Much like Timothy Smith, in Revivalism and Social Reform, Hatch insists we understand the religious dynamic of this nation by getting in touch with the distinctively democratic movements which shaped it. Rich with anecdotes and illustrations, thoughtfully analytical, balanced and judicious, this is a marvelous historical work."},{"Title":"The democratization of American Christianity","review":"If you want to understand why the twenty-first century American Evengelical Church is rife with heretical teachings and outright apostasy, read this book. In The Democratization of American Christianity, Nathan Hatch demonstrates how the American Revolution spawned the so-called Second Great Awakening, a religious rebellion, which led to an abandonment of Orthodox Christianity in favor of a pluralism that plagues American Protestantism to this very day. The egalitarian values of the Enlightenment that dominated the American conscience of the early nineteenth century allowed a host of false teachers to lead a revolt of the laity against a clergy that, while Biblically Orthodox in their doctrine, had allowed affluance and intellectualism to overcome their sense of Christian charity. Spicing their sermons with coarse language, emotional appeals, Jeffersonian quotations, quaint stories and rabald humor, these populists taught that every individual must interpret the scriptures according to their own conscience. These \\"teachings\\" led to an \\"anything goes Christianity\\" that included the embracing of such heresies as Arminianism, Mormanism, Perfectionism and Universalism, the apostasy of Unitarianism and even Transcendentalism: anything other than Biblical Orthodoxy. One hundred and fifty years later, this pluralism continues to permeate American Protestanism, currently manifesting itself in the Emerging Church movement, which is a blending of Christianity with New Age spiriualism that denies the authority of scripture itself. Though Hatch does not set out to do so, he demonstrates the great truth that heresy always leads to apostasy."},{"Title":"The democratization of American Christianity","review":"Thanks Mr. Hatch for writing this book!How did the church in America get to its present position where it fails to realize that the body of Christ is dependent on God raising up distinctly graced individuals to authoritatively, accurately, and relevantly preach the Word?

You can tell that this was originally a dissertation that was expanded into a book. The author just didn't have that much to say on the subject, and by the third chapter or so, he's kind of beating a dead horse. But he drives his point home, that's for sure."},{"Title":"The democratization of American Christianity","review":"I always like a book in which the author sets out his or her thesis clearly. In this case, such a statement comes in the first two sentences of Chapter 1!\\"This book is about the cultural and religious history of the early American republic and the enduring structures of American Christianity. It argues both that the theme of democratization is central to the understanding the development of American Christianity and that the years of the early republic are the most crucial in revealing the that process.\\" (p. 3)But the clear thesis statement is not the only reason why I enjoyed reading &quot;The Democratization of American Christianity.&quot; In presenting his argument, Hatch tells a highly entertaining story about a fascinating time in the history of the American Protestantism. It was a time filled with such colorful characters as Barton Stone, Francis Asbury, Lorenzo Dow, and Charles Grandison Finney. It was a time during which developed such famous -- or perhaps infamous -- American Church institutions as the circuit rider, the camp meeting, and \\"the anxious bench.\\" And, most importantly -- as Professor Hatch points out -- it was the time during which the spirit of independence and democratic idealism that had propelled the Americans successfully through the Revolutionary War seeped into the American churches, giving shape to the distinctive form of Christianity in present-day America.In this 312-page book, Hatch examines five separate religious traditions, or \\"mass movements,\\" as he terms them, that played upon the American stage during the early 19th Century: the Christian movement, the Methodists, the Baptists, the black churches, and the Mormons. Despite the wide-ranging theological opinions represented among these distinct bodies, \\"they all offered common people, especially the poor, compelling visions of individual self-respect and collective self-confidence.\\" (p. 4) Moreover, these movements \\"took shape around magnetic leaders who were highly skilled in communication and group mobility.\\" (p. 4) Hatch studies these men and others who rose to distinction on the American religious scene from the 1780s to the 1830s. He finds that \\"the fundamental religious debates in the early republic were not merely a clash of intellectual and theological differences but also a passionate social struggle with power and authority.\\" (p. 14) Hence, the story of American religion within this time frame mirrors the story of American politics; both tell \\"how ordinary folk came to distrust leaders of genius and talent and to defend the right of common people to shape their own faith and submit to leaders of their own choosing.\\" (Ibid.)Such a profound change within the religious realm implies a fundamental shift in theology. Indeed, the rise of popular religious leaders unschooled in theology did result in theological competition, with the popular theology eventually winning out. This is due, in large measure, to the transfer of authority regarding religious matters from the Bible to the sovereign mind of man:\\"The study of religious convictions of self-taught Americans in the early years of the republic reveals how much weight was placed on private judgment and how little on the roles of history, theology, and the collective will of the Church. . . . This shift occurred gradually and without fanfare because innovators could exploit arguments as old and as trusted as Protestantism itself. Luther, Calvin, Wesley, and Backus had all argued for the principle of sola scriptura; unschooled Americans merely argued that they were fulfilling that same mandate. Yet, in the assertion that private judgment should be the ultimate tribunal in religious matters, common people started a revolution.\\" (p. 182)Also significant were the means by which the new dogma was spread, and Hatch provides a penetrating analysis of these factors as well. The rise of the untrained preachers points to the fact that the ordained clergy \\"had lost their unrivaled position as authoritative sources of information.\\" (p. 125) Preaching became \\"increasingly folk- rather than clergy-dominated.\\" (p. 133) Moreover, popular religious newspapers provided a new forum for dissemination of ideas, \\"the grand engine of a burgeoning religious culture, the primary means of promotion for, and bond of union within, competing religious groups.\\" (p. 126) The medium of music was employed as well, as new folk hymnody wasdeveloped. Consequently, \\"[b]y systematically employing lay preachers, by exploiting a golden age of local publishing, and by spreading new forms of religious folk music, they ensured the forceful delivery of their message.\\" (p. 127)Religious populism even today \\"has remained a creative, if unsettling force at the fringes of major Protestant denominations. . . . American clergy have remained subject to democratic forces.\\" (p. 16) \\"[T]he people continue to serve as custodians for their own beliefs, communicating them in understandable terms.\\" (p. 218) This democratic ideal, penetrating more deeply into the soul of the American church than any theological dogma, has resulted in a polarization in American Christianity, as the two camps are drawn in opposing directions. The leaders of the mainline Protestants are oriented toward the norms of \\"high culture\\" and are \\"irresistibly pulled toward values and attitudes prevalent in the modern academic world.\\" (Ibid.) The opposite side is populated by the Fundamentalists and Pentecostals, who \\"share all the virtues and vices of popular culture\\" and -- most significantly -- have embraced social institutions and subcultures that \\"are still populist through and through, reflecting the deepest convictions of their own constituencies and anointing new leaders by virtue of their popular appeal. . . . They will not surrender to learned experts the right to think for themselves.\\" (p. 219) As Hatch concludes: \\"For two centuries Americans have refused to defer sensitive matters of conscience to the staid graduates of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. They have taken faith into their own hands and molded it according to the aspirations of everyday life. American Christianity continues to be powered by ordinary people and by the contagious spirit of their efforts to storm heaven by the back door.\\" (Ibid)"},{"Title":"The democratization of American Christianity","review":"Hatch's approach to the religion of the early republic is to define the principal conflict along class lines--the educated, eastern, Reformed, Federalist establishment versus the unschooled, western, anti-creedal, Jeffersonian populists. Judging from the prizes this book has won, numerous historians have considered it a landmark perspective on the early republic and subsequent American epochs, which must be taken into account in any future study.Hatch marshals a copious amount of testimonial evidence as to the methods and convictions of both the religious populists and the clerical aristocrats against whom they rebelled. Unquestionably, Hatch is on to an integral part of early 19th-century religious life. Unfortunately, though, we are left to take Hatch's word for exactly how much this class warfare dominated the religious landscape. Hatch provides little statistical evidence to back up the populists' claims of a vast gulf between rich and poor, and one is left wondering about an excluded middle. Imagine writing an account of the religious history of our time purely from the quotes of Jerry Falwell and Ted Turner, and you see the problem--a vast, silent middle ground of religious opinion is neglected amid the rhetorical blasts of the polarized belligerents.He never clearly locates the middle class (such as the mercantile bourgeoisie of New York City) on his socio-religious spectrum, only mentioning them in his penultimate chapter, which addresses the years 1830-1860. Similarly, though Hatch mentions a few counter-cultural educated Jeffersonians like Francis Asbury and Jefferson himself, he does not explore their unique fit into this era. Likewise, he implies that the entire under-class rejected clerical authority, never explicitly commenting on whether or not any of the illiterate laity remained faithful to their religious betters during this time.Despite these silences, Hatch's exciting work provides the basis for a new paradigm in the study of American religious history. After tracing the theme of religious democratization up to the Civil War, he briefly sketches the theme through the 20th century in an epilogue. Anyone who has lived and moved in contemporary evangelical circles plainly sees the cyclical legacy of the early republic: a determined populist insurgency rebels against moribund, worldly religious institutions, but in the following generation, the insurgency itself becomes institutionalized and establishes rapport with higher culture, providing the ground for a new populist insurgency to arise. With an evangelical in the White House and upper-middle-class evangelical churches and institutions entrenched in the suburbs, it would seem the dialectic may be about to turn again, especially if current evangelical materialism becomes full-blown apostasy in the succeeding generation."},{"Title":"The democratization of American Christianity","review":"The United States is unique among its peers due to the strong religiosity of its people in comparison to other Western industrial powers. \\"The Democratization of American Christianity\\" by Nathan O. Hatch, a highly influential scholar of American religious studies and current president of Wake Forest University, argues that this is due to the ongoing force of a populist strain of Protestant thought that first arose in the 1790s with the widespread demand that the Revolutionary rhetoric of freedom and democracy be fully realized in politics, society, and, inevitably, religion. The Second Great Awakening, which ran through the 1830s, was a time of millennial experimentation and renewal, as well as upheaval within the old Calvinist denominations.Impoverished Americans of the early nineteenth century have been nevertheless described as a \\"set of fierce republicans\\" fully aware of the Revolutionary promises of liberty and equality. The preachers of the Second Great Awakening frequently reminded their audiences of the humble origins of Christ and his early followers, as well as their oppression by the ruling classes - a theme that blended nicely with the fervent Jeffersonianism that characterized the early American republic. The post-Revolutionary era saw the rapid growth of newspapers, volunteer societies, the organization of political parties, new definitions of citizenship and the role of women, and virulent attacks on elite professions, especially the clergy. As forms of hierarchy in all areas of life began to collapse, radical Jeffersonians began to reclaim the Revolutionary rhetoric, which had once united colonists from all walks of life, to rouse the common folk against \\"aristocrats.\\" Drawing on the anti-Federalists, they scorned the idea of society as an organic chain of command and argued that it was instead a veritable motley crew of competing interests. Dissent, in other words, came to be defined against accepted tradition, especially as the rush to settle the frontier removed many citizens from established centers of authority. Meanwhile, the deterioration of their economic prospects in the 1780s and '90s, despite promises of prosperity, only deepened the rural poor's resentment and sense of social alienation. Within this milieu the \\"coarse language, earthy humor, biting sarcasm, and commonsense reasoning\\" of backcountry preachers held enormous appeal and left educated ministers at a loss. Instead of respecting \\"tradition, learning, solemnity and decorum,\\" upstarts such as John Leland, Alexander Campbell, Lorenzo Dow, and Francis Asbury exalted the individual conscience.For all their differences, however, each of the upstart leaders and sects arising out of the Second Great Awakening stressed the simple motifs of sin, grace, and conversion. They embraced spontaneous experience and dismissed any religion that struck them as cold, detached, and intellectual. Unlike their predecessors of in the eighteenth century, they quite self-consciously threw off the weighted traditions of the past and rejected learned theology; they also demanded that clergy and laity be placed on equal footing, sought to create a new history that called for inquiry and innovation, and, above all, proclaimed the inalienable right of every Christian to read and understand the Bible for themselves. The story of Christianity since the time of the Apostles, they charged, has been a sad conspiracy of elite clerics to keep the full Truth out of the hands of the people to enrich their own power. Stone and Campbell pushed this logic to its extreme and renounced any form of church government; Stone and his colleagues even dissolved their own organization. There can be no creed, many argued, but the Bible. This was a crucial departure from the First Great Awakening, which had not gone so far as to use the Bible itself to combat theology, history, and tradition. The Bible also provided solid footing for a populace shaken by rootlessness, political controversy, and fragmentation.Despite the radically decentralized nature of most of the period's religious movements - their overemphasis on subjectivity destabilized them in the long run - Hatch's book draws a clear line of descent from Second Great Awakening leaders such as Alexander Campbell, Elias Smith, Lorenzo Dow, John Leland, Francis Asbury, James O'Kelly, and Barton W. Stone and such modern Christians as Pat Robertson, Oral Roberts, the late Jerry Falwell, Billy Graham, Kathryn Kuhlman, Robert Schuller, and Jimmy Swaggart. The true power of American Christianity, Hatch asserts, has been its recognition of the supernatural in everyday life while maintaining the characteristically American values of autonomy and popular sovereignty. Fundamentalism, the Holiness movement, and Pentecostalism - dismissed by critics as \\"holdovers from an age of rural simplicity\\" - continue as vital spiritual forces to this day, especially among the rural Southern poor and urban working classes in the Midwest.Nevertheless, too many historians, Hatch claims, have dismissed the early American republic as a mere epilogue to the Revolutionary years and prologue to the Jacksonian era. The result has been an unfortunate lack of scholarship covering this period, as well as little recognition of the continuity between the Revolution and the Second Great Awakening. What little work that has been done has all too often merely reinforced the tired stereotype of religion as tool of social control and repression. In order to demonstrate the inherently populist character of American Christianity that has distinguished it from other Western nations, Hatch draws extensively on both modern scholarship and a wide variety of contemporary pamphlets, sermons, religious journals, memoirs, journals, and letters. Most intriguing, however, is his inclusion of an appendix of anticlerical and anti-Calvinist songs and poems by ordinary Americans that \\"translate theological concepts into language of the marketplace, personalize theological abstractions, deflate the pretensions of privileged church leaders, and instill hope and confidence in popular collective action.\\" Many were extracted from songbooks published by Elias Smith and Lorenzo Dow, demonstrating not only the spiritual sentiments of ordinary folk but of their leaders as well. All in all, \\"The Democratization of American Christianity\\" comes highly recommended, especially for anyone wondering at the comparatively religious character of American society."},{"Title":"The democratization of American Christianity","review":"This well researched and written book is worthy of the honors it has received. This book was suggested to us by our Pastor because of our prevailing struggle with a democratic view of the Church. Even though we are laypersons and not in the academic world, we found this work helpful in pointing to the root of our faulty thinking."},{"Title":"The democratization of American Christianity","review":"A precis: Hatch's thesis is narrow. The American Revolution spurred the democratization of American Christianity. But, at the same time, Hatch implicitly alludes to the effect of insurgent Christian sects had on American democracy. Hatch limits the book's chronology to c. 1780-1830 and the scope of discussion to the Protestant insurgent faiths of the Methodists, Baptists, Mormons and Christian \`generalists' who claimed no specific sect as their own. He does mention in passing the Congregationalists and Presbyterians, but essentially neglects Anglicans, Episcopalians and Roman Catholics, except to use them to illustrate a point about one of the other sects. To Hatch, it seems the older, traditional sects were spared the effects of democratization, save losing members to itinerant preachers. The primary effect on religion of the social democratization of the Revolution was to remove religious power from the few hands of the educated and organized traditionalists and put it in many more hands, similar to the Revolution's anti-aristocratic effect on the holders of political power. According to Hatch, anticlericalism gained strength at the end of the 18th century due to a profound upsurge to erase the distinction between gentleman and commoner[,] . . . reflecting the same fundamental division between those who believed in the right of the natural aristocracy to speak for the people and those who did not. (p. 44).Hatch reads Gordon Wood as suggesting &quot;that this issue was the essence of the struggle between Federalist and Anti-Federalists.&quot; (p. 44). Thus, the realm of religion was not immune to the same sorts of battles that were fought in the political arena. The substance of the religious battle was whether the illiterate and unsophisticated majority of Americans should get their religion from the traditional orthodoxy, or should religion be accessible, understandable and a product of individual conscience from itinerant preachers and religious newspapers. The orthodoxy reasoned by analogy that a person would wish to trust his health or property to a properly trained doctor or lawyer, so she should only trust her soul to a properly trained pastor. Logical as the argument might be, simultaneous to the Second Great Awakening, movements democratizing law and medicine were gaining popularity as well. This overall movement toward &quot;democracy,&quot; reinforced by the non-establishment clause of the First Amendment, is to Hatch the origin of contemporary differences between the U.S. and other industrialized nations, namely that we have a strongly embedded religious heritage of Christianity in all levels of society, from the richest to the poorest. Removing the exclusive right to interpret the Bible from the hands of Harvard and Yale divinity school graduates and giving it to everyman, limited only to the constraints of his own conscience, was a second American revolution; it could not have happened without the first.Hatch traces the religious revolution as a personality driven cult, the message occasionally lost to the drama of the speaker. The purpose of the insurgent sects was similar to that of the new political party system emerging at the same time. The preachers wanted to fill camp meetings, converting new souls. The politicians wanted to fill offices with candidates loyal to the party.Though the book is important and takes us a step closer to understanding the depth of democratization on American social history (as opposed to political history), there is much to criticize. First, &quot;democracy&quot; is not an easy or clear-cut term. Hatch uses it alternately to mean individualism, anti-intellectualism, popular culture, popular sovereignty, leveling, anti-aristocracy and ignorance; his grails of democratic religious culture are individual conscience, interpretation of Scripture in light of daily experience and the use of the vernacular in music, newspapers and sermons. One must be careful when using a word of art in a crossover context. Democracy is a political term; to use it as a religious term, one must do so carefully, beginning with a clear definition. Hatch does not.Second, though Hatch does stick with his thesis-the impact of democracy on Christianity-he does not develop the underlying counter-thesis, the impact of Christianity on democracy. To have done so would have logically widened the scope of the book while maintaining the integrity of the argument. And, students of American political history would have benefited as well as those of religious history.Last, his discussion of the relevance of music to his thesis is tantalizing, but ultimately inadequate. Hatch introduces the relation of music to the democratization of religion and gives a brief discussion of how popular music was born. However, he glosses over, in one sentence, the mutual influence of blacks and whites on religious music in the 18th century Methodist churches, before the birth of A.M.E.At times, he tests the waters of popular culture, but when he jumps in, he is immerses himself in only white culture of the time. He neglects, like many historians, the primary place of African-American culture in all American popular culture. If Hatch is truly interested in the effect of 19th century democratization on the modern world, he should explore a little farther into the history of African-American spirituals.In a PC world, African-American is the only true mixed ethnic designation. Africans, because of their forced segregation from whites, retained much culture, musical and otherwise, from before the middle passage. This retained ethnicity merged with American culture, first in the white churches and in the plantation fields, then in freedom, to form a call-and-response relationship in music. Call and response was super-imposed on the traditional African drumming, and a form of music (removed from its sectarian origins) evolved in the secular world, a form called the Blues. Over time and geography, the Blues evolved into jazz and rock-and-roll as alternate branches of the same family tree. Though not the topic of the book, this evolution warrants at least a footnote."},{"Title":"The democratization of American Christianity","review":"Good book, very fact filled and well researched.

Hatch looks at five Protestant religious traditions that became \\"mass movements\\" between 1780 and 1830: Baptists, Methodists, Mormons, the black churches, and the \\"Christians.\\" Hatch analyzes these five groups and finds that they broke free of the restraints imposed by the more established churches and, as a result, had a democratic influence on their followers. Hatch argues that \\"the theme of democratization is central to understanding the development of American Christianity\\" (p. 3). Hatch believes that the leaders of these movements were \\"outsiders, interlopers, and marginal men who created the turmoil, defined the issues, formed the organizations, and preached the gospel that captured the hearts and minds of so many citizens\\" (p. 46).Hatch shows how the diversity of the five groups created an atmosphere of freedom of choice in the early Republic. Hatch celebrates this diversity because it resulted in the Christianization of America. Hatch sees the religious diversity as a democratizing process and contributing to the Christianizing of America. Therefore, Hatch tends to see the movements as inclusive. Hatch also views the movements as helping to spread democracy and democratic ideas. The religious leaders of the five groups spoke the language of the people, they defended the rights of people to make their own religious choices according to their own individual thoughts, and they exhibited a religious conviction that contributed to the rise of a \\"populist impulse.\\" These movements empowered ordinary people because they took their beliefs at face value and they did not have to follow orthodox doctrines or respected clergy. Hatch also believes this was a democratic movement because theses religious outsiders had little sense of their limitations. They were breaking the chains of authoritarian control. People were given a chance to think and act for themselves rather than depending on an educated elite. These leaders used democratic persuasions to reconstruct the foundations of religious authority. Hatch sees the changes in politics shaping religion, as the early republic became more democratic, so did religion. Hatch sees America shaping religion.Hatch makes an interesting argument in his book. He attacks elitists who have refused to credit the contributions of \\"lesser\\" religions. Hatch tends to subordinate religion to politics; that political influences are the prime movers of the society that enable the variety of religions to take off. Hatch deemphasizes the importance of religious beliefs and tends to ignore many of the traditions that laid the groundwork for their development in the early republic. However, Hatch has written a work that helps to place religion within the framework of changes taking place within American society as a whole."},{"Title":"The democratization of American Christianity","review":"Hatch pits John Leland up against Isaac Backus in regards to Calvinism. I did some checking and though Leland was a strict Jeffersonian he was still an orthodox Calvinist. Leland and Backus had more in common theologically than not.That said, this is a masterful book on how the Revolutionary war completely turned American Christianity on its head and the populist movements began. The educated clergy was looked down upon as grassroots, rough-and-tumble preachers popped up from all over the American landscape. This had a great impact on theology as well as Calvinism was seen as elitist and tyrannical.Hatch traces the growth of the Baptists, Methodists, Mormons, Disciples of Christ and Black Churches respectively.Hatch has a smooth writing style that is never dry or choppy. This is a book that every theologian, student of Church History and American History needs in their library. Hatch does a good job and showing how the Revolution and the birth of America led eventually to the birth of modern American Christianity."},{"Title":"The democratization of American Christianity","review":"Nathan O. Hatch uses the second sentence of The Democratization of American Christianity to inform the reader that the book argues \\"both that the theme of democratization is central to understanding the development of American Christianity, and that the years of the early republic are the most crucial in revealing that process\\" (3). To this end, Hatch focuses on the diffusion of the Methodists, Baptists, Mormons, Disciples of Christ, and African-American Christians across post-revolutionary America as a challenge to more established denominations, like the New England Congregationalists and Virginia Anglicans, and political elites.The brilliance of Hatch's argument lies in its illustration of a confluence of Protestant growth with the expansion of democratic thought and application in the country. The book's most central contribution to the study of American Christianity is the concept of \\"religious populism\\" in the early republic, which at once speaks to the American Christianity's innovative ability to reach out to various populations, and to the loyalty to American religion that such outreach efforts endeared among its adherents. In some sense, a demand for less-elitist, more-egalitarian forms of worship and congregational life existed, and the predominantly unlettered, zealous, \\"bold intruders\\" (aka ministers) of faith adapted preach styles and techniques to meet that demand.The book begins to fill a gap in our understanding of religious life in 1780s and 1790s America. In the historiographical section--a must-read for any scholar--\\"Redefining the Second Great Awakening: A Note on the Study of Christianity in the Early Republic,\\" Hatch confronts the question of difficulties surrounding the religious history of the early national period. \\"There are more generalizations and less solid data on the dynamics of American religion in this period than in any other in our history\\" (p. 220). Though he cannot single-handedly erase this deficiency, Hatch, for his part, has crafted a needed work that illumines the power of popular religious movements through the actions and travels of their dynamic leaders.The stars of The Democratization of American Christianity are Lorenzo Dow, Alexander Campbell, Richard Allen, Francis Asbury, Joseph Smith, John Leland, and other religious leaders. Hatch builds his case for a popularizing religion on the backs of deft religious leadership and their success at movement-building. Although these Christian \\"insurgents\\" held differing beliefs and employed various techniques, these men excelled at popular written and verbal communication, triggered a revolt against Christian tradition, and inaugurated a new era of religious life in America. Hatch's portrayal of early America's religious leaders presents them as revolutionaries, not wholly unlike the colonials in Philadelphia who laid an ideological foundation for the Revolution.Christian adherents and secular historians alike will benefit from this excellent account of Christianity's democratic and westward shift in the early republic. The Democratization of American Christianity is neither dogmatic nor apologetic. Well-researched and brilliantly-conceived, the book locates the spread of American Christianity within a post-Revolutionary context marked by less paternalistic and more populist ideas. To that end, \\"the most striking evidence of the democratization of Christianity in the early republic was that black preachers successfully laid claim to 'the sacred desk'\\" (p. 112). Hatch's book and Gordon Woods' Pulitzer-Prize winningThe Radicalism of the American Revolutiondemonstrate the fertility within the first generations of American nationals for popular democracy and religious zeal.Hatch's emphasis on movement-making and the management of revivals distorts his analysis of Christianity's spread across America by limiting or excluding any discussion of spiritual renewal. The fault, however, is now entirely his. The historical profession remains largely incapable of documenting and validating the role of spiritual activity within the human condition. Historians are much more comfortable attributing mass religious conversions and life-changing ideals to marketing techniques and popular political environments. Yet, when the eighteenth-century camp meetings and preachers awakened \\"spiritual convulsions\\" in revival participants, it seems incumbent upon scholars to more fully examine and evaluate peoples' interaction with God in religion. That said, Nathan O. Hatch's The Democratization of American Christianity is a bold step in a constructive direction; a step that the current and future field of historian would do well to follow."},{"Title":"The democratization of American Christianity","review":"This book traces the rise of independent churches and church groups/denominations early in the 19th Century.

The Piper was in the LAX controlled airspace (TCA, now class B airspace) without clearance and without attempting to contact Air Traffic Control (ATC).This report is very interesting in its conclusions, but much of the technical portion of the report details the inner workings of the LAX ATC radar system. This is good information for ATC specialists and supervisors, but largely can be safely skimmed by pilots. The hazards of midair collision have been reduced by a collision avoidance system known as TCAS since this accident, but at the time of the accident no TCAS units were flying in commercial operation (Piedmont would become the first airline to fly with TCAS the following year). There is no question that TCAS would have helped alert the crew in this accident, but would have needed the Piper to have an altitude encoding transponder to actually give a resolution advisory to avoid the small plane.The NTSB concludes that the probable cause of the accident was \\"the limitations of the air traffic control system to provide collision protection, through both air traffic control procedures and automated redundancy.\\" It then goes on to list contributing factors as \\"(1) the inadvertent and unauthorized entry of the PA-28 into the Los Angeles Terminal Control Area and (2) the limitation of the 'see and avoid' concept to ensure traffic separation under the conditions of the conflict.\\" While there is no doubt that all of these statements are true, it seems to me that the proximate cause was, without doubt, the PA-28 being where it was not supposed to be. If it hadn't been in the TCA, the accident could not have happened. It's rarely that I substantially disagree with the NTSB, but I do in this case. The limitations of \\"See and avoid\\" are manifest and despite the extensive binocular and monocular vision studies conducted, I believe (after several thousand hours flying DC-9 series aircraft) it is unreasonable to have expected the Aeromexico crew to have seen the Piper without, at a minimum, a traffic advisory from ATC: visually, the Piper subtended less than 0.2 degrees of arc, the approximate minimum theoretical possible to be seen, one mile from the DC-9: this translates to approximately 15 seconds of flying time from collision. USAF studies (corroborated elsewhere) have shown that the approximate minimum amount of time required to recognize a target, process the information, and maneuver the aircraft to successfully avoid a target is 12.5 seconds. This also presupposes the Aeromexico crew had no other duties to perform at the time.The NTSB makes the assumption that the DC-9 crew would be exclusively focused on looking outside the aircraft for traffic when none had been brought to their attention, ignoring the complexity of the cockpit duties to be accomplished during this very busy arrival. The report has several appendices. Appendix H recaps recommendations made from previous midair collision reports. Page 105 contains recommendations (written in response to a June 29, 1972 accident involving a North Central Airlines Convair 340 and an Air Wisconsin DHC-6 over Lake Winnebago, Wisconsin) A-73-27 through A-73-29, which calls for crews \\"to be trained in techniques of time sharing between visual scanning for airborne targets and cockpit duties\\" and related recommendations. Despite their own recommendations printed as supporting evidence for their positions, the NTSB here does not recognize the need to accomplish tasks within the cockpit (which include flying the plane) as a time-shared priority along with scanning for traffic.Thankfully the civilian airliner fleet now has TCAS, which would have greatly helped in this incident. TCAS combined with increased use of altitude encoding transponders has reduced this type of accident dramatically. I find no fault with the crew of the DC-9, nor did the NTSB explicitly, but, unlike the NTSB, I believe that the cause of the accident is more borne by the pilot of the PA-28 than by the ATC system shortcomings in this case.This is an interesting report for pilots and ATC personnel. Certainly some of the information is now out of date, but the problems and limitations of \\"see and avoid\\" are still with us in less controlled areas. I recommend it for technically oriented pilots and aviation safety professionals."},{"Title":"Cousin Henry;: A novel","review":"Browsing in a bookstore, I read a blurb of this book that told every secret twist of its plot. I was enraged, but read 'Cousin Henry' anyway. It was superb, and illustrates perfectly Trollope's own philosophy, given in 'Barchester Towers,' that a good book will not suffer even from the reader knowing what happens. 'Cousin Henry' has other, and considerable, merits, than suspensefulness--although it is suspenseful. It has been called the most psychologically probing of Trollope's works; indeed, Trollope himself thought it to be so, and was very proud of it. The plot, in brief, and without giving anything away, is this: Cousin Henry is the heir of the Squire of Llanfeare--according to the will everyone knows about. But Henry knows of another, later, will, that disinherits him. Most of the book concerns Henry's agonizing over whether or not to make this will public. There is also another plot thread, concerning the Squire's daughter, Isabel, who can only marry if her husband is willing to take her last name (shades of 'Cecilia').

Jack had to find away to escape from Miss Prism because she disapproved of him so he created a brother named Earnest. While Jack was in London he feel in love with another women named Cecily Carden. Over time his fianc&eacute;e's mother started to see that there was more to Jack than what he was letting on to. The only reason that Cecily wants the marry Jack is because she thinks that his name is really Earnest. Jack/ Earnest has a fianc&eacute;e but is in love with another women at the same time.This is a very short book but at the same time it is very easy to get in to because of the conflicts that occur. This book is very funny especially the conversations between Jack and Algernon. The story is a political and social satire and a look at the upper British society.

Has a made-up friend, Bunbury, and sometimes tours the country in the guise of this Mr. Bunbury.

Excised scene from The Importance of Being Earnest [pp. 359-363].First published thus, 2000.ContentsIntroductionA Note on the TextsSelect BibliographyLady Windermere's FanSalomeA Woman of No ImportanceAn Ideal HusbandA Florentine TragedyThe Importance of Being EarnestAppendix: The excised sceneNotes===========================================Now this is what I call a classic: so far as I, personally, am concerned this a book that I pick up with very high expectations, yet they are far surpassed by what I find between the pages. I did expect a lot from Wilde's plays, but I certainly wasn't prepared for so enthralling a read. I cannot but be amused at those people who continue to rant that Oscar Wilde was a perfect example of style over substance, that he never wrote anything serious, or if he did it will be forgotten at expense of his social comedies, and that he was nothing but tons of epigrams. First of all, it doesn't require a brilliant intelligence to realise that most of Wilde's epigrams are dead serious - indeed, that's where their enduring value lies; on the surface it's all fun of course, but just a little below there is a fierce social satire and just about unparalleled insight into human nature. As Bernard Shaw wisely observed once, ''nothing is more serious than great humour.'' He might well have spoken about Oscar. Unfortunately, there are two major disappointments that detract from the value of the book as a whole. But everything in time.The Penguin Classics edition is an almost complete one. It contains six plays written between 1891 and 1895, at the time when Wilde was growing more and more famous as a dramatist, and it omits only his two early attempts from the 1880s, Vera; or, The Nihilists (1880) and The Duchess of Padua (1883). The six plays in this volume fall into two strikingly different categories: four of them are the classical social comedies Oscar Wilde is most famous for, namely Lady Windermere's Fan, A Woman of No Importance, An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest, whereas Salome and A Florentine Tragedy can be broadly and ineptly described as historical and rather tragic plays. Before going into some detail about the plays themselves, few words about the editorial work.The introduction of Richard Allen Cave is dull and tedious stuff one may skip without fear of missing anything of any importance. It starts promisingly, with the famous dichotomy between Wilde the brilliant wordsmith and Wilde the subversive homosexual, but than Mr Cave unfortunately switched to, and continued to be concerned with until the end, abominably mundane matters like Wilde's stage directions and the spatial relationships between his characters. The best I can say about this introduction is that Mr Cave is certainly very capable of extracting a good deal of tenuous and ultimately unimportant, not to say preposterous, relationships between the visual side of Wilde's plays and their force as social satire. I confess the first time I read this introduction I skipped half of it. But then I was ashamed and read it again, this time completely and conscientiously. I wish I hadn't. Perfect waste of time.Be warned also that the introduction is rife with spoilers and should be read - if at all - only after the plays.A word about the editor's meticulous notes must be made too. It is of course extremely annoying to constantly consult them when they are in the end of the book, but I daresay the notes could not have been printed otherwise: they are much too copious for that. Well, one doesn't really need to consult them; indeed, one must not do this. The notes are sometimes insightful, but more often than not they are concerned with largely irrelevant matters like publication history, revisions of certain passages or long-winded and pompous speculations about Wilde's apparent allusions. Worst of all, the notes often make explicit crucial details of the plots long before Wilde intended to reveal them. To say that such cases spoil the pleasure of Wilde's meticulous craftsmanship is a spectacular understatement. I imagine the best way is to read the plays once without referring to the notes at all and only then, on second reading when one is already reasonably familiar with the plots, one should peruse the plays more carefully together with constant excursions to the end of the book. For all verbose junk they contain, the notes are occasionally highly revealing in terms of specific meaning of some words in the vastly different social context of those times, or elucidating Wilde's elaborate, yet subtle and subversive, network of hints, allusions and metaphors.Salome was my first major disappointment in the volume. Written originally in French in 1891 and later translated into English by Lord Alfred Douglas himself if the dedication is to be believed (actually, scholars now believe, Wilde himself did the job), the play was for many years banned and attacked as immoral, indecent and other such adjectives that are more likely to stimulate audience's interest more than anything else. With its extravagant metaphors, fantastic imagery and verbose repetitions, Salome is more akin to Wilde's second volume of fairy tales, but the play has neither their power nor their affecting quality. The story is the well-known and perfectly gruesome one from the Bible about Salome, the stepdaughter of Herod Antipas, and John the Baptist (here named in Hebrew fashion, Jokanaan). The play has some nice satirical touches, mostly in the character of the very practical Herodias, with her memorable line ''I do not believe in miracles. I have seen too many.'', and there are some hints of serious discussions about religion and God, but on the whole it is a lame sruff and makes a tedious read; fortunately it's one-act affair, and rather short at that. Perhaps I have read it in the wrong mood.A Florentine Tragedy is a very singular piece. It is written in blank verse and apparently set in Renaissance Italy; ''apparently'' because nothing is mentioned in the stage directions and one must rely on subtle hints in the text. Scholars have argued that the play is just a fragment from an unfinished work, but it's perfectly sufficient as it is. I can't say that I find reading blank verse easy, but the play is very short (less than 20 pages) and it makes a very absorbing read indeed. There are but three characters - the merchant Simone, his wife Bianca and the Florentine prince Guido - who form a chilling love triangle that leads, predictably considering the title, to a tragic conclusion. The amazing thing is that Wilde has managed to achieve a very neat twist in the end. In combination with the swift exchange of blunt remarks, the play makes a very enjoyable read.The rest four plays in this book are (mostly) Oscar Wilde at his absolute best as a playwright; I call these superb pieces of drama ''social comedies'' only with trepidation, for they are as much concerned with the individual as with society, and they are far more serious than they are comic. The only exception, regrettably, is the most famous of them. Although each of the plays has a special character, all of them share several remarkable similarities.They are all set in the present, 1890s that is, and the action is limited in time to no more than 24 hours during which dark passions and shady secrets from many past years relentlessly surface. They all contain tons of amusing epigrams as only Oscar Wilde, the scintillating wordsmith, can forge but none of them is on the whole a flippant or superficial affair; as for Wilde's pace of action and sense for dramatic climax, they are invariably well-nigh perfect. Perhaps what impresses me most strongly in these plays is the large diversity of characters that each one of them contains. Virtuous and vicious form a sublime counterpoint here, if I am allowed a musical analogy. Both among the male and the female characters the variety is impressive, if repetitive. Usually there are those who talk almost entirely in epigrams and take a decidedly flippant attitude towards life but in fact turn out to have a more secure grip of it than all other characters; and of course there are also prigs and prudes, moralists and cynics, social climbers and social outcasts, people in love and people in lust: you name it, separately or in various combinations. The verbal skirmish is guaranteed and so is the engrossing entertainment. When it comes to hypocrisy, conceit, shallowness, snobbishness, prejudice or stupidity - social or individual - Oscar Wilde is charmingly witty and devastatingly merciless. In both directions.For the most part Wilde's stage directions are very sparse and consist almost entirely of characters' movements and brief descriptions of the surroundings; usually he also gives the reactions of all participants in the most dramatic scenes, but otherwise there is next to nothing about appearance, clothing or the manner in which certain lines are spoken. Yet the characters come to life with astonishing vividness and verisimilitude, entirely through dialogue. Another amazing thing about these plays: no character speaks out of character, ever. Now that is quite an achievement. Considering the severe stringency of drama, Wilde's character are remarkably complex and alive. Last but not least, actually most important of all, there are always several points of view, often conveyed by different characters but sometimes adroitly combined in one. The awesome collision of values, morals, fears and feelings is absolutely never one-sided, no matter whether one agrees with Wilde's conclusions or not. Unfortunately, I repeat, The Importance of Being Earnest is rather an exception from most of the above.Perhaps the most striking, and surprising, overall conclusion to draw about all four of Wilde's ''social comedies'' is that Oscar is unabashed sentimentalist. Now such an attitude is not exactly my cup of tea, but in this particular case it seems that it doesn't matter a bit. I certainly haven't used it to degrade Wilde's plays and have nothing but contempt for those who do. In conclusion of the general part, it might be worth noting that the plays are printed in the order of their writing but in no way need they be read so; from the very beginning of his four years of theatrical success, Oscar Wilde was a supreme master of his craft. Now let's look more carefully into each of these gems.Lady Windermere's Fan is my greatest favourite. It is superb on all fronts. For once, the blend of wit and wisdom, flippancy and profoundness, is brought to utmost perfection. The play is extremely clever in its construction, with all improbabilities masterfully handled and with simply mind-blowing dramatic climaxes. Oscar certainly knew very well how to pace and construct drama in a most gripping manner. In this play he has also surpassed himself as regards to variety of characters. None of the next three works, fine as they are, may offer so vast a range of completely different personalties, all of them brilliantly conveyed by sparkling dialogue. Nor has Wilde ever again succeeded in creating so convincing a bundle of contradictions as Mrs Erlynne. I can certainly say that she is one of the most charming and lovable characters ever put down on paper in drama, fiction or non-fiction; considerable achievement since in the beginning of the play she is definitely despicable. Her transformation in the course of these four acts is unbelievable - from a heartless creature to one with a golden heart - yet absolutely convincing and deeply affecting. Last but not least, the play has an astounding finale which is in itself a masterpiece: it is neither happy nor unhappy, everybody is sincere and at the same time hiding something behind his or her guilty conscience.A Woman of No Importance has a fabulously disappointing conclusion, appallingly melodramatic and sentimental. Sometimes I do hanker for a more seriously cynical attitude in Wilde's plays; it would have made them so much more real and relevant. But no matter how much I may baulk at Oscar's attitude, I can't find any fault with his integrity even here. His characters act thoroughly in character, bizarre whims and all, and he gives - as usual - a great deal of thought-provoking stuff on both sides of a conundrum. On the one side of the baricade are Mrs. Arbuthnot, her son Gerald and above all the american girl Hester Worsley; they are obviously the virtuous characters with high moral principles, and though they may look somewhat one-dimensional, or even ridiculous, they are as alive as it is possible for any character in drama to be. On the other side are the somewhat cynical, but full of common sense, Mrs. Allonby and above all Lord Illingworth, one of those pleasure-seeking whose only aim in life is to get as much fun of it as possible. The clash is tremendously effective and beautifully executed. One of the greatests assets of the play are the remarkably vivid minor characters such the brutally foolish Lady Stutfield, the kindly class-conscious Lady Hunstanton and mercileslly irreverent Lady Caroline are quite a treat to enjoy; Oscar has done a wonderful job with all of them. Despite the nauseating affectation and rhetoric of the finale, the play is stimulating enough to guarantee unforgettable experience. It will be re-read in future with great pleasure.An Ideal Husband constitutes an interesting exception among Wilde's plays, for it has unusually detailed stage directions ranging from the manner of speaking to complete descriptions of the appearance and the character of the characters. As it might be expected these are stupendous fun to read; imagine a woman looking like ''a work of art, on the whole, but showing the influence of too many schools''. Downright brilliant! The only slightly annoying detail in these descriptions is that Wilde cannot resist the temptation to like any of his characters to those of one painter or another; it looks like cheap show-off of ''culture''. Nevertheless, the plays is a very powerful one, perhaps the darkest and most intense of all. It is a little unusual because it is a variation of ''a man with a past'' theme, rather than the more traditional variant where it is woman who has to hide some ignominious secret from her wild youth. At any rate the play raises a number of profoundly important questions. Is blameless life blemished by a single dishonesty? Should one be judged so harshly because of one's wild youth? Should one love to the point of idealisation? Should one be blind for the faults of the the loved ones? What is the nature of true love? Does it make any sense in this world? Is it powerful enough to overcome pity or moral horror? There are many more such questions in this play - and quite a few answers too.By the way, I take issue with reviewers who label this play as ''sexist''. It is nothing of the kind. Lord Goring does have one or two rather sexist lines but neither his character nor the play on the whole have anything to do with sexism. Indeed, since the last word and the noblest act are saved for one of the main heroines, the play is more like a feminist one actually, or a sexist one reversed if you like. Certainly there are in these four acts a great deal more important things than that.The Importance of Being Earnest is generally considered Wilde's best play. I really don't know why. It is significantly inferior to the three previous ones in a number of aspects. To begin with, it is no comedy but pure farce, which is already a severe limitation. It is by far the most flippant, artificial and improbable of them all, and far less convincing too. Nor does it match any of the other three masterpieces in terms of wit and wisdom. The range of characters and the depth of characterisation cannot hold a candle to any other member of the quartet either. The dialogue is vastly amusing, of course, but the pointless banter often continues for a little too long and it gets tedious; and fun for fun's sake hardly makes any more sense than art for art's sake. The play has a pleasant twist in the end which, however, sounds unpleasantly contrived and unnatural, not to say inane and ridiculous. It is hardly a coincidence that it is the only one in three acts for it is certainly the least substantial of all. I daresay it is a riveting spectacle on the stage but a truly great play surely must be great on paper as well. In short, The Importance of Being Earnest, even if it may pass for a comedy, does lack precisely what makes a great comedy: seriousness. It is a very good play but it is very far from a great one. Alone, it might earn five stars for the deliberately light, though wonderful, entertainment which in fact it is; but compared to the three social comedies, pointless yet inevitable as such comparisons are, it deserves no more than three stars. I understand it is supposed to be the zenith of Oscar's masterpieces for the stage. So far as I am concerned, it is definitely the nadir.That said, The Importance of Being Earnest is a riot to read, if one can somehow detach it from Oscar's great plays of course. It has a lot of swift action and, as might be expected, the embarrassing situations of double-identity mischief are brilliantly handled. I suppose the play looks way better on the stage than on paper, which is, perhaps, how it should be for plays are written to be staged, not read. But I remain convinced, perhaps irrationally, that a truly great play must be great on paper as well. Though in that particular case this is certainly not the case, Oscar's sharp wit shines through and makes it a worthwhile read; alas, it is only occasionally allied to anything like wisdom. Wilde's superb characterisation still reigns supreme, even in his slightest efforts. The young ladies are somewhat colourless, but Lady Bracknell is all but unforgettable. The contrast between the two young man - the bohemian Algie and the priggish Jack - is conveyed as only Oscar Wilde could.When all is said and done, taken as a whole body of work, Wilde's plays only convince me once more in his extraordinary genius, literary and not only. Despite two major flaws, one of them appallingly unexpected, this volume of Wilde's plays is a book to be treasured."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"Still very vibrant and still amazingly witty for today.

It was a peak that was to be cut short by the sensational trial that sent him to jail for two years because of homosexual actions. While one does not need to know Wilde's background to enjoy the play, some insight into what certain words might have meant in Victorian slang certainly put a different twist on the play. In the \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" Wilde uses humor to turn conventional relationships and staid Victorian morality on its head.The play centers around two men, Jack and Algernon. Jack wants to propose to Algernon's cousin Gwendolen, but her mother does not think him an eligible bachelor. Not to mention the fact that Gwendolen believes Jack to be named Ernest and that there is a whole slew of things he has keep hidden from her. Algernon tells Jack that he is a Bunburyist, for he pretends to have a brother so he can come up to the city (that would be Ernest) while Algernon pretends to have an invalid friend named Bunbury so that he can escape to the country. When Gwendolen asks Jack for his country address, Algernon overhears and heads out to Jack's house, pretending to be his brother Ernest, so that he can meet Jack's ward, Cecily. The two fall in love, for Cecily always wanted to marry someone named Ernest. This is all to Jack's chagrin when he arrives on the scene and finds he must confess the truth to Gwendolen. Yet the convoluted plot has a way of working out for the best of everyone involved.\\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" is an extremely thin plotted play, which allows Wilde's witticisms and humor to shine through. Throughout there is a strand of anti-marriage jokes and unexpected reversals of the expected sayings. There are so many one-liners from this play that have been quoted through the ages which testifies to what a wonderful way Wilde had with words. It is a play that stands the test of time with its laugh-out-loud moments and witty zingers."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"This is possibly the most amazing work to come out of English literature and the English language.

This is Wilde at his irreverent best as he repeatedly skewers as many aspects of late 19th Century English society as he can manage.I've occasionally heard the term \\"joke density\\" applied to comedy writing, and The Importance of Being Ernest certainly has that. Every character in the play is witty, and the jabs, barbs, and puns come fast and furious.The story centers on two somewhat roguish young bachelors who have both created elaborate lies to help them to cover for their mischief. At different points in the play, both gentlemen have assumed the false name of Ernest, which becomes a problem once two women become involved. Two women who are both particularly enamored with the idea of marrying someone named Ernest.The tightly plotted play has enough twists and turns to keep things interesting, and the witty dialogue never lets up.The Avon (a HarperCollins imprint) paperback edition that I read contained a short collection of critical essays, the most interesting being a (mostly negative) review by George Bernard Shaw of the original production of the play, which raises some interesting points about the nature of comedy. I found some good insights into the career of Oscar Wilde in the introduction and the other critical pieces, but those familiar with his life and work would not be missing much by skipping these \\"bonus features\\".The play itself was a really enjoyable work to read, and I'll keep an eye out for a chance to catch a performance of it sometime."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"There is just no reason to not like this play!

Every situation, every word, every piece of this dialogue is full of smartness and intelligence. The only aim of the play is to show us how absurd strict social canons are. Life is extremely more fun than the respect of such rules that destroy any kind of pleasure or happy turns of events. Good society is thus turned upside down and the best instance of such humorous antics is the fact that the son of a general was officially born in a handbag deposited in the cloakroom of Victoria Station, the Brighton Line. How ridiculous ! How funny, ah ah and funny, strange ! Oscar Wilde shows how vain all appearances are because appearances may hide deeper things that are of far more important value than these appearances. This play is thus a constant and perfect example of comedy. But in spite of this light appearance of the play, we can feel the deeper suffering of Oscar Wilde who is very serious about the absurdity of keeping up appearances instead of taking only character into account. In other words, this comedy is a sign of the total decay of such higher society that is nothing but a pretty face with nothing behind, nothing in the head or the brain. It is a call for a real society based on human values like love, truthfulness, faithfulness. All twists in the social fabric create unconceivable embroglios that lead to entanglements and other difficulties. Things would be so simple if men and women could just follow their inclinations and their deep sentiments. We also find in this comedy a deep marivaux-ian influence : Marivaux loved in his play to alter identities, but among girls, to test the love of men. Here it is the men who have altered identities and it leads to testing their ability at sacrificing such entangled situations for the love of a girl. There is also a strong recollection of Shakespeare who enjoyed turning his girls into boys in his comedies, but once again to test the love of men, to see without being seen, for women. Oscar Wilde, in the social setting of a Victorian society, is just as witty and funny as Shakespeare in say As you Like It, or say again A Midsummer Night's Dream. And life turns Aunt Augusta, alias Lady Bracknell into the ass of the fable.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan"},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"One thing happens when you read Oscar Wilde's \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\"; you are amazed to remember that this play was authored over 100 years ago. For most plays of that era, the average reader tends to lose references and it tends to be stodgy and irrelevant. Not so Earnest, due to the brilliance and imagination of it's playwright.The Importance of Being Earnest is a tour de force of comedy, misidentifications, and farce. Algernon and Jack are friends, and each has invented an imaginary person as an excuse of getting out of engagements. Jack's person is Ernest, a brother with a wild past. The two conspire to woo the ladies that they love, and through a series of happenstances, must gently deceive to get want they want. The end result is a play of uncomperable quality, chock full of witticisms that are highly quotable out of context. In fact, I dare suggest the entire play is quotable, such its brilliance.Wilde pulled no punches when writing Earnest. Often, when a play is filled with memorable quotes, it takes away from the realism of the scenes because the characters then become merely conduits for the writer's intellect. Not so in Earnest. Wilde manages to make the characters say exactly what they would say in each situation, true to their persona. That alone is quite an accomplishment, one not often seen.Misidentities, witty banter, love, all conspire to one of English's most brilliant comedies ever to have seen the stage. We should be so lucky the world had Oscar Wilde in it, and even more so, that he wrote at all."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"&quot;The Importance of Being Earnest: A Trivial Comedy for Serious People&quot; is one of the first plays written in English since the works of Shakespeare that celebrates the language itself. Oscar Wilde's comedy has one advantage over the classic comedies of the Bard in that &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; is as funny today as it was when it was first performed at the St. Jame's Theater in London on February 14, 1895. After all, enjoying Shakespeare requires checking the bottom for footnotes explaining the meaning of those dozens of words that Shakespeare makes up in any one of his plays. But Wilde's brilliant wit, his humor and social satire, remain intact even though he was a writer of the Victorian era.Wilde believed in art for art's own sake, which explains why he emphasized beauty while his contemporaries were dealing with the problems of industrial England. &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; is set among the upper class, making fun of their excesses and absurdities while imbuing them with witty banter providing a constant stream of epigrams. The play's situation is simple in its unraveling complexity. Algernon Moncrieff is an upper-class English bachelor who is visited by his friend Jack Worthing, who is known as &quot;Ernest.&quot; Jack has come to town to propose to Gwendolen Fairfax, the daugher of the imposing Lady Bracknell and Algy's first cousin. Jack has a ward named Cecily who lives in the country while Algernon has an imaginary friend named &quot;Bunbury&quot; whom he uses as an excuse to get out of social engagements.Jack proposes to Gwendolen but has two problems. First, Gwendolen is wiling to agree because his name is Ernest, a name that &quot;seems to inspire absolute confidence,&quot; but which, of course, is not his true Christian name. Second, Lady Bracknell objects to Jack as a suitor when she learns he was abandoned by his parents and found in a handbag in Victoria Station by Mr. Thomas Cardew. Meanwhile, Algernon heads off to the country to check out Cecily, to whom he introduces himself as being her guardian Jack's brother Ernest. This meets with Ceclily's approval because in her diary she has been writing about her engagement to a man named Ernest. Then things get really interesting.Wilde proves once and for all time that the pun can indeed be elevated to a high art form. Throughout the entire play we have the double meaning of the word &quot;earnest,&quot; almost to the level of a conceit, since many of the play's twists and turns deal with the efforts of Jack and Algernon to be &quot;Ernest,&quot; by lying, only to discover that circumstances makes honest men of them in the end (and of the women for that matter as well). There is every reason to believe that Wilde was making a point about earnestness being a key ideal of Victorian culture and one worthy of being thoroughly and completely mocked. Granted, some of the puns are really bad, and the discussion of &quot;Bunburying&quot; is so bad it is stands alone in that regard, but there is a sense in which the bad ones only make the good ones so glorious and emphasize that Wilde is at his best while playing games with the English language.But if Wilde's puns are the low road then his epigrams represent the heights of his genius, especially when they are used by the characters in an ironic vein (e.g., &quot;It is very romantic to be in love. But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal&quot; and &quot;I do not approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance&quot;). Jack is the male lead, but it is Algernon who represents the ideal Wilde character, who insists he is a rebel speaking out against the institutions of society, such as marriage, but with attacks that are so flamboyant and humorous that the cleverness of the humor ends up standing apart from the inherent point.In the end, &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; is the wittiest play every written, in English or any other language, and I doubt that anything written in the future will come close. Wilde was essentially a stand-up comedian who managed to create a narrative in which he could get off dozens of classic one-liners given a high-class sheen by being labeled epigrams. Like a comedian he touches on several topics, from the aristocracy, marriage, and the literary world to English manners, women, love, religion, and anything else that came to his fertile mind. But because it is done with such a lighthearted tone that the barbs remain as timely today as they were at the end of the 19th-century and &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; will always be at the forefront of the plays of that time which will continue to be produced."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"The Importance of Being Earnest is a fantastic play. It is an easy read, and is not only well thought out, but hilarious.I liked this book of the play especially, because it includes helpful notes in the beginning, but more because it has a glossary of difficult terms in the back. Every time I came to a word that I did not know, it was sure to be defined in the back.If you love theatre, this is a great play to read. I would highly suggest this book."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"Wilde's play has taken a turn for the worse in the last 20 years. It appears that people have forgotten how to act comedy. The Importance of Being Earnest has admittedly been cast in the shadow of the famous 1952 movie for all eternity. Edith Evans's lady Bracknell in that movie is a hard act to follow but the eccentric British actress Miriam Margoyles is the only one of the cast in this sorry new recording to understand and be able to play a part in a famous play that is performed in words only.The male characters both whine their words with little understanding of how to make them fall into place and become part of the larger whole in fact it sounds like a recording of a first run through with the scripts.What really kills this recording is the director's decision to have a narrator read the stage directions. As if we are half wits who can't work out what's going on without being told that \\"an electric bell rings\\" when immediately after a character will respond and explain what the noise is and what is signifying - Duh!!!This is not the way to make an audio recording of a play and even though it is the only recording of Earnest on CD this is not the one to have. John Gielgud directed himself and Edith Evans in a classic (but cut) version for EMI in the 1950's which has been occasionally available on cassette and Harper Collins have re-issued the 1960's Caedmon recording on cassette which is also an excellent production. It was a sad event in Caedmon's history when Harper Collins acquired them, the incredible collection of spoken word recordings all but disappeared from sight but now a few have been released on cassette and even a few have seen new life on compact disc. Better wait for the EMI set or look out for the Caedmon, either are better than this pathetic attempt."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"I just got finished reading this for class, and it's simply one of the best works I have read in the past year. It was such a joy to read, no dread factor at all (and there was no trouble keeping up with the characters). It is so witty and so well-written, it's just great. I recommend this to anyone who wants a good laugh. I can't see how anyone would not love it. This was the first time I was introduced to Wilde, and I look forward to reading more."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"All you Wildeans take note: this is the only edition of the plays wherein the lines are properly numbered for specific citation and easy reference: very, very important!!"},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"An extraordinary play; witty, profound and beautiful. And even better if you read all of it. Which you won't if you buy the Penguin copy with Edith Evans on the front, since this version is heavily abridged. Which is fine except the publishers make no mention of this at all in the volume. And cultural vandalism of this kind should, I feel at least be acknowledged."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"This is Wilde's best play, it is fast moving, has wonderful characters (especially the women), and funnily enough is still a pretty accurate observation of society. Perhaps nothing ever really changes! At the core of the play is the name Earnest, and all that it means to the various characters, and how their white lies and complicated lives catch up with them. And the lines - wonderful ones like &quot;I always carry my diary - a lady should always have something scandalous to read on the train&quot;, and &quot;if you are not too long, I shall wait for you forever!&quot;. Be assured, all works out well in the end, and all shall be revealed as to how important it is to be Earnest."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"I had no knowledge of Oscar Wilde and had only seen ten minutes of the movie, The Importance of Being Earnest, as I flipped through the cable channels on my television. However, due to a class that I am enrolled in, not only do I now know who he is but I am blessed to have been introduced to his work.The Importance of Being Earnest, makes a very humorous yet profound commentary on money, marriage, status and image as it pertains to the aristocracy of that time. It seems that Oscar Wilde utilized this medium of artistic expression to cleverly expose the twisted way that those with wealth perceived themselves and the lengths they would go to the preserve that perception. It has been referred to as a \\"comedy of manners\\" because so much of what defined or distinguished the aristocracy from the common man was not necessarily the wealth that they actually had but what men and women did to appear like they had it.Ernest, who is the main character in the play, has done all of what is necessary to appear as though he comes from wealth. He wears the clothing, keeps the company and talks the talk of the aristocrat. However what he soon finds out is that all of those whom he is trying to impress and fit in with, have more unresolved issues in their closet than he does. I believe Wilde addresses this social paradox with impeccable wit and an amazing sense of human psychology. He not only challenged those who belonged to the aristocracy to examine what they placed value in, but continues to challenge each reader today, that these superficial values might not stand as valuable at all."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"In Oscar Wilde's \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\", he answers this question in the form of brilliant comedy. The play, full of witty dialogue such as Lady Bracknell's answer to her daughter's suitor saying he does smoke; \\"I am glad to hear it. A man should always have an occupation of some kind.\\"; says, yes, it is important to be Earnest.One of the more remarkable details of this play is in the title itself. While attending or reading the play, you learn, that the two heroine's of the piece, Gwendolyn and Cecily, are determined to marry men named Earnest; unfortunately, Jack wants to marry Gwendolyn, and Algernon would like to settle down with Cecily. What is the reasonable solution? To tell them that their name's are Earnest. However, Earnest is not only a name, but also a word meaning: an intensely serious state of mind. Why would Oscar Wilde choose the name Earnest for this seemingly ridiculous play anyway?Why ridiculous you may ask. The answer comes in not only the ingenious dialogue, but in the plot itself. Without giving away the entire story, one can say that the two main characters live, however innocent, deceptive lives and still end up with the fair maiden's in the end. One of them even ends up really being Earnest, to which he answers, \\"... it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that all his life he has been speaking nothing but truth...\\"Wilde called his piece, \\"A trivial comedy for serious people.\\" If the word earnest means serious and the play itself is joyfully absurd, this writer imagines that the characters in the play although exceptionally serious about themselves and their lives, they are trivial or ridiculous. In conclusion, I would say that this play is not only suited for the serious mind, this play is uproariously fun for all of us who appreciate good humor."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"A highly entertaining comedy even over a hundred years later.

Jack lives in the country but is always going to London to deal with his good-for-nothing brother, Ernest. However, his London friends know him as Ernest, and this \\"brother\\" doesn't actually exist. Algernon, meanwhile, is a London dandy who periodically takes off for the country to visit his dying friend, Bunbury (who also does not exist). When Algernon discoveres Jack's secret, he is anxious to visit Jack at home and meet his young ward, Cecily. He arrives at the estate, claiming to be the scandalous Ernest.Naturally, hijinks ensue. Jack is in love with Algernon's cousin Gwendolyn, who insists she could only ever love a man named Ernest. Cecily is also enamoured with a man of that name. Of course, both men cannot be Ernest. And this is where the comedy lies.The play is very short (my copy clocks in at 90 pages) but it is extremely funny. I'd seen the Colin Firth film version a few years ago and was happy to see that it was fairly faithful to the original text. Gwendolyn's mother, Lady Bracknell, is equally as witty in the book as she is in the film, and Oscar Wilde demonstrates his sharp wit at every turn."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"This book was quite a surprise (and a riot).

The Importance of Being Earnest, Wilde's most well-known work, is dripping with sharp humor and clever epigrams. But let's face it, it's fluff. The \\"social satire\\" that most reviewers cite to hold this book up as High Art is as pointed as a teaspoon and as sincere as a used-car salesman. Wilde was a libertine dandy who admired the snobbery and elitism of blue-blooded Britons. The Importance of Being Earnest is, in many ways, like MTV--stylish and entertaining, with some pretensions, but ultimately just a vacuous time-killer.

I suggest that no one else ever ever read this play."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"A quick and entertaining read, Oscar Wilde's comic portrayal of 19th century upper-class intrigue is filled with witty, bantering dialogue.

Of course, this can only backfire and lead to confusion, particularly as Jack's fictitious brother Ernest shows up unexpectedly at the home of Cecily, Jack's ward and the woman Algernon hopes to marry.

Upon reading the work, I find that it doesn't suffer in the reading as well. Wilde is likely the most witty person to have ever lived. He claimed he was at least. His works, of course, reflect that genius. In particular, \\"The Importance of Being Ernest\\" does. If you're going to experience only one of Wilde's plays, this is the one.

First, Gwendolen is wiling to agree because his name is Ernest, a name that \\"seems to inspire absolute confidence,\\" but which, of course, is not his true Christian name. Second, Lady Bracknell objects to Jack as a suitor when she learns he was abandoned by his parents and found in a handbag in Victoria Station by Mr. Thomas Cardew. Meanwhile, Algernon heads off to the country to check out Cecily, to whom he introduces himself as being her guardian Jack's brother Ernest. This meets with Ceclily's approval because in her diary she has been writing about her engagement to a man named Ernest. Then things get really interesting.Wilde proves once and for all time that the pun can indeed be elevated to a high art form. Throughout the entire play we have the double meaning of the word \\"earnest,\\" almost to the level of a conceit, since many of the play's twists and turns deal with the efforts of Jack and Algernon to be \\"Ernest,\\" by lying, only to discover that circumstances makes honest men of them in the end (and of the women for that matter as well). There is every reason to believe that Wilde was making a point about earnestness being a key ideal of Victorian culture and one worthy of being thoroughly and completely mocked. Granted, some of the puns are really bad, and the discussion of \\"Bunburying\\" is so bad it is stands alone in that regard, but there is a sense in which the bad ones only make the good ones so glorious and emphasize that Wilde is at his best while playing games with the English language.But if Wilde's puns are the low road then his epigrams represent the heights of his genius, especially when they are used by the characters in an ironic vein (e.g., \\"It is very romantic to be in love. But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal\\" and \\"I do not approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance\\"). Jack is the male lead, but it is Algernon who represents the ideal Wilde character, who insists he is a rebel speaking out against the institutions of society, such as marriage, but with attacks that are so flamboyant and humorous that the cleverness of the humor ends up standing apart from the inherent point.In the end, \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" is the wittiest play every written, in English or any other language, and I doubt that anything written in the future will come close. Wilde was essentially a stand-up comedian who managed to create a narrative in which he could get off dozens of classic one-liners given a high-class sheen by being labeled epigrams. Like a comedian he touches on several topics, from the aristocracy, marriage, and the literary world to English manners, women, love, religion, and anything else that came to his fertile mind. But because it is done with such a lighthearted tone that the barbs remain as timely today as they were at the end of the 19th-century and \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" will always be at the forefront of the plays of that time which will continue to be produced."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"Witty, sarcastic, laugh out loud in your chair reading. I loved it!!!!"},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"Oscar Wilde once said that all forms of art are useless. Bearing this in mind, his play \`The Importance of Being Earnest' is one of the most useless pieces ever written. Writing a simple and funny play, the play writer managed to criticize the hypocrisy of the Victorian society in this comedy of manners.The whole story is around the words \`earnest' and \`Ernest'. More than toying with the words and their sound and meaning, Wilde is talking about the \`masks' that people put in their faces by that time. Nobody is really what he/she seems to be. The two main characters Algernon Moncrieff and Algernon Moncrieff create another ego that they pretend to be their brothers-- to such device they call Bunburying hence the name of Algernon's brother.What is very clear with this plot is that Wilde shows how one has to lie in order to succeed. However, in another level, Bunburying is way of describing homosexual liaisons or is a way of escaping from the chains of the marriage. By the way, marriage itself is strongly criticized by the author in this play. The two marriageable girls are interested in men whose names are Ernest, no matter how they look or what they do.All the undertones of the play aside, \`The Importance of Being Ernest' is a quick and funny play, full of great lines that could only come from Oscar Wilde's mind. Just like Lady Braknell says to hurry a marriage: \`I am not in favour of long engagements. They give people the opportunity of finding out each other's character before marriage, which I think is never advisable.' Simply funny, acid and true!"},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"The Importance of Being Earnest is probably one of the funniest works I have ever been witness to; it definitely takes the cake when it comes to plays. The witty English humor is practically side splitting when read, so i can imagine how well it works when actually preformed on stage or film. The characters are so perfectly created within their aristocratic society. Lady Bracknell is the epitome of a lady and her humor, though she is not trying to be funny, is classic. The words do all the work. The characters just speak and as long as the lines are taken/given as canversationalthe entire play is nonstop laughs. The satire dealing with issues of class, love, money, and character has probably never been written as subtle or as well as Wilde has done with this play. The plot is humorous in its self. The whole concept of &quot;Burnburying&quot; to get around your obligations as a Gentleman and the problems it causes for Algernon and Jack. The shifty love story that carries the play is at times unbelievable but if you consider the farcicalnature of the play it is easily overlooked. The ending, although I won't give it away, is another classic example of a well written play. The twists and turns along the way that end up confronting the truth make the finish well worth your time. That's not to say that the rest of the play isn't great. If you're a fan of this type of comedy I would highly recommend not only buying this book but seeing it preformed as well."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"I loved this! Generally I detest reading plays for some reason, but I enjoyed every minute of this one. The characters were excellent, and the plotline creative. Actually, the plot alone is amusing. The dialogue (ooooh, the dialogue!) is absolutely hilarious. I laughed out loud many, many times while reading this. I found Lady Bracknell to be one of the more entertaining characters, with her stereotypically lopsided priorities. Algernon and Jack's many angry (well, on Jack's part, at least) exchanges were marvelous (the bit with the muffins is an absolute classic, in my opinion). The satirical side of this was well-done and rather interesting for those interested in such things, but \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" is, overall, a superb read just for the entertainment value of it."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"This is a serious commedy and classic that nobody should miss.Please read it you will have a serious good time laughing and having so much fun you will not be able to put the book down.Wilde is amazing"},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"This is a serious commedy and classic that nobody should miss.Please red it you will have a serious good time laughing and having so much fun you will not be able to put the book down.Wilde is amazing"},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"The ultimate showcase of Wilde's talents,his plays,presents the timeless wit of this fascinating &amp; endearing personality,whose life if only he was able to create a work that equalled it,would raise his critical position in literature astoundingly.The last two plays are not only a delightful read,but also historically significant in giving a taste of Victorian manners &amp; morals of the time.Lighthearted in scope,sufficient in content,Wilde's plays are something to go back to when one feels the need for a less burdensome diversion."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"LA Theatre Works very wisely chose to present this play the way Wilde intended -- straight, no campiness, no condescension to the audience. I saw the play being recorded at LATW and have purchased the CD to be able to continue to enjoy it. I grew up on the 1950s Edith Evans/John Gielgud/Joan Greenwood version, generally regarded as the gold standard, and I will say that LATW's is the first I have seen or heard to come anywhere near that classic.

It is produced thousands of times each year all around the world from school productions to professional acting companies. The play premiered at the St. James Theatre in London on Valentine's Day 1895.The three act comedy stars Jack Worthing and (later to be revealed-his younger brother Algernon Moncrieff). Jack is courting Gwendolyn Fairfax. Algernon is in love with the beautiful young Cecily Cardew. Both of these young dandies have invented doubles. Jack acts like his name is Ernest. Algy has invented Bunbury whose ill health always requires a visit when Algy's pestiferious aunt Augustus Bracknell is in London.After countless bon motes and Wildean witticisims it is learned that Jack is really named Ernest. It is revealed that Cecily's governess Miss Prism had lost Jack when he was a baby by leaving him in a handbag at Victoria Station. Jack is, therefore, really named Ernest. Gwendolyn asserts she could never love any man unless he was named Ernest! She and Jack plan on wedding as does Algernon to the fetching Cecily.This play provides Wilde the opportunity to show off his ability to entertain while at the same time poking fun at the class conscious British aristocracy where what your name and genealogy are counts for a lot in high society.Some of this reviewer's favorite quotes from this eminently quotable play are the following:The truth is rarely pure and never simple\\"Only relatives or creditors ring in that Wagnerian mannerAll women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does. That's his.Memory... is the diary that we all carry about with usI never travel without my diary.

All are social satires in which Wilde the ultimate Irish, gay outsider slams hard at English social pretensions in late Victorian fin de siecle England.Discover the wonderful world of Oscar Wilde in his plays, short stories, only novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" and his essays and poems."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"Dr. Gladden provides tremendous insight not only into Oscar Wilde's life as the ultimate dandiacal Victorian writer but also into the Victorians as a people, culture, and era in British history.

This book represents the manifestation of true scholarship at its finest."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"\\"Truth is beautiful, without doubt; but so are lies.\\" ~Ralph Waldo EmersonI didn't know anything about this play going in to it. After reading the first few pages it became evident pretty quickly that this was a comedy, and a pretty good one at that. There is a lot of witty banter and snide remarks throughout that make you laugh out loud. I imagine this is even funnier on the stage with the actors' body language, etc.The play demonstrates how a couple of lies can culminate into a huge quandary. You can see the train wreck coming and the anticipation builds until the train finally comes off it's tracks at the satisfying collision ... I mean culmination.The version of the book I read is full of footnotes that includes changes that have occured in the play over the years and other pertinent information to the play. There is one footnote that I found particularly interesting; it says, Franklin Dyall, who played Merriman (in the play) recalled the effect of one of his lines on the first night, \\"This [announcement] was received with the loudest and most sustained laugh that I have ever experienced, culminating in a round of applause; and as I came off Wilde said to me: 'I'm so glad you got that laugh. It shows they have followed the plot.'\\" Imagine watching your play being acted out for the first time. It must be nerve-wracking to sit there hoping that people will like it and appreciate it. It must also be extremely satisfying to see and hear the positive reactions.My wife noticed what I was reading and told me she had seen the movie and that it starred Rupert Everett as Algernon. I can't think of a more apt actor for that role. I will have to check it out."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"While Oscar Wilde is not Shakespeare unarguably the best playwright, he is incredibly good and all three plays show it. Salome is a short 'biblical' play, Lady Windermere's Fan is a bit longer and with the exception of the naivete suffered by the Lady of the title incredibly well written as well. However, The Importance of Being Earnest is by far the best play in this collection. Two men whom are trying to get away with pulling a fast one on their girlfriends and two women who think they know whats going on. Throw in a misplaced bag with a baby inside, an overbearing British matriarch, and a Governess with a past and you have a laugh out loud comedy. Who knew the British could be so funny...when written about anyway."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"I have recieved the &quot;honor&quot; of portraying Gwendolyn in our High School's production of The Importance of Being Earnest.

Basically, a Read-A-Long is a way of conducting an online book club. I wasn't sure if I would like it, and I have been talking to a few friends about starting a digital book club myself, so I thought that I would participate and see how it went.The procedure was to read to a certain point by a specific date, and then comment in response to the person in charge, to post your own opinions, and have a conversation with other people who are also reading the book.I did enjoy the experience, aside from the fact that I had to post by Friday, when I think I'd prefer each post to be &#34;due&#34; on Sundays instead. I also think I'd enjoy commenting and communicating with people I know even more than with random strangers who are reading the book at the same time.

If you are looking for a short read (free digitally on Kindle, iPad, Nook, etc.) that is humorous, this is the book for you.The book is about two friends, Algernon and Jack, who have alter egos that love to party and get into trouble. Both friends fall head-over-heels in love with women who demand that their mates have the name of Ernest. As impractical and strange as this sounds, the book is funny and filled with ridiculous quotes such as these:Algernon: &#34;The only way to behave to a woman is to make love to her, if she is pretty, and to someone else, if she is plain.&#34; (p. 17)Jack: &#34;Cecily and Gwendolen are perfectly certain to be extremely good friends. I'll bet anything you like that half an hour after they have met, they will be calling each other sister.&#34; Algernon: &#34;Women only do that when they have called each other a lot of other things first.&#34; (p. 17)Miss Prism: &#34;No married man is ever attractive except to his wife.&#34; Chasuble: &#34;And often, I've been told, not even to her.&#34; (p. 26)and the last one I will quote so as not to spoil all of them for you. . .Lady Bracknell's opinion of marriage and engagements, which is hilarious: &#34;To speak frankly, I am not in the favour of long engagements. They give people the opportunity of finding out each other's character before marriage, which I think is never advisable.&#34; (p. 51).*The page numbers are based on my free Kindle edition.It might be silly to say, but I honestly always forget that classic books can be funny, as &#34;The Importance of Being Earnest&#34; so classically is. It's the same with black and white movies. I always seem to think that old, classic movies or books are going to be dull and boring. Then when I read one (or see one) I am surprised at how much I enjoy it and how easy it is to relate to some of the things going on in the books.

The characters are likable, the plot never takes itself too seriously, and the ending is happy. It seems that Wilde knew exactly what he wanted: to write a light-hearted, amusing play without serious overtones, and he succeeded wildly. This isn't to say that he sacrificed any literary qualities, as the play is recognized for the marvelous writing, but it is considerably more fun and entertaining than many other literary works.In sum, Oscar Wilde's &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; is a classic in every sense of the word, and it's tremendously fun to read.

Overflowing with wit and genius, it'll make you laugh and cry out for more. I must have read it more than ten times already and yet it gets better with each reading. There is no doubt, Wilde epitomises wit.

Little wonder why The Importance of Being Earnest is still a hit in theatres and cinemas to this day.Any theatre lover or anyone who enjoys a good comedy should read this play. There is a lot of reference to the lifestyle at the time of this plays performance (around the 1800s) and a lot of political and social talk. Throughout the three act play, it shows how funny fooling everyone, then getting caught can be, as well as finding love, and how friends can either help, or hinder your fooling of everyone. I thoroughly recommend this play to anyone who needs a good read and a good laugh.Highly contrasts Oscar Wilde's best work: the novel 'The Portrait of Dorian Gray', but still a very enjoyable script to read"},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"You'll be laughing out loud throughout the entire play whether you wish too or not. I say Genius!"},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"Perhaps it is my unique sense of humor, but I found this book incredibly funny. I wasn't rolling on the floor or anything, but it is funny in an Oscar Wilde way. My personal favorite is The Importance of Being Earnest, although all the others are very good also. Get this book. There are great quotes and good characters."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"Oscar Wilde's &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest,&quot; is a superb comedy that will keep you wondering what could possibly happen next. Wilde manages to keep the readers entertained while at the same time keeping their feet on the ground. The use of the &quot;old&quot; language helps the readers identify with the characters. The characters themselves constantly have you laughing at their absurd antics. You never know what lie is going to pop up next and you are continually wondering how the characters are going to get out of the pickle they've gotten themselves into. The constant twisting of the plot keeps the reader happy, excited, and surprised. The different settings keep it interesting and the steady flow of new characters keep a person guessing who really is being &quot;earnest.&quot; The dialogue is truly inspired and the choice to have the words &quot;play&quot; on each other manage to keep the play flowing. Oscar Wilde's play is truly brilliant and I would recommend this play to anyone who enjoys a good laugh."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"'The Importance of Being Earnest' is the greatest piece of literature I have ever read. We were forced to read many books in school, but why this play was never mentioned is something I don't understand. Simply, this play is the most clever, witty, and entertaining thing I have ever read in my life, period. You definitely won't find any great meaning or significance in this work, but so what. You'll simply laugh your butt off for most of the 70 to 75 pages."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"Oscar Wilde's terrific comedy, The Importance of Being Earnest, jokes on serious human themes, such as love, religion, and truthfulness. This play uses comedy to joke about real life situations; that realistically would be wrong. In the end, a comedy's main purpose is to take a real life concept that ordinarily can not be made fun of, and make it fiction. The reader will be delighted by the comedy's similarity to today's T.V. sitcoms, which, like The Importance of Being Ernest, make fun of serious, real life problems. Nick at Night's new motto is \\"100% sitcoms, 100% unreality T.V.\\" So is The Importance of Being Ernest.The Importance of Being Ernest shows how reality can be made fun of in context of a comedy. Watch as Algernon and Jack create fictional brothers, so they can enjoy the best out of both worlds, and how the woman they fall in love with view their lies. The two woman's ideas on love will astonish the reader. Jack and Algernon mock religion when they use it as a way to impress women. The best part of this book occurs in the end, when Jack finds out who he really is, and how marriage is used as bribery. Even with all the lies and deceptions, the characters never take a thing seriously, and as a result the end of the book has a happy tone.In the end, I strongly recommend this book to anyone with a sense of humor, which is basically everybody. It is well written, and there are small parts within the language itself that will make you laugh. It is only 54 pages, so if you're having a rough day, and need a good laugh, pick up a copy of The Importance of Being Ernest, and laugh your head off."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"The Importance of Being Ernest is Oscar's finest work that I have ever read. After sitting through a seemingly unbearable adaptation of The Ideal Husband, it was refreshing to once again discover the wit of Oscar Wilde. All of the social criticism and delightful cynicism that is always prevelant in Wilde's work is masterly employeed in this play. The play was compelling in that it always keeps the reader interested. There is never a dull moment in the story of Algernon Moncrief and John Worthing, two members of the English upper class who get entangled in their own lies. Each man assumes the Identity of Ernest Worthing, a fictional creation used to escape the dreariness of everyday life, an act which catches up to them eventually. These two men are then forced to explain their deceptions to their fiances who know them only as Ernest. The story is filled with clever plot twists that make it a real enjoyment to read. The Importance of Being Ernest is a masterpiece of intelligent comedies. To compare it to anything else would be to do it an injustice. This classic is timeless and I would recommend it to anyone. It makes reading pleasurable and leaves you wanting more which is the importance of great literature."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"I really enjoyed reading it, because I think it contents a good portion of humour, and also irony. At first I did not know what to expect from the novel, I did not even understand the title at all. One man\`s name is called \\"Ernest\\" and so I got confused by the name and the adjective \\"to be earnest\\". I must also say, that the beginning is difficult to understand because at first you don\`t really know what the idea of \\"bunburry\\" is. And then the different relationships between the persons are not easey to understand. After I have read the novel, I had the chance to watch also the film. Afterwards I have liked the novel more, the film was too old and you could only guess what the actors were saying, they had a very strong English accent."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"A wonderful collection! One could sit down and read this book from start to finish in one sitting and remain enthralled. You will find yourself quoting Wilde for weeks. By the end, I had a firm grasp of what &quot;the season&quot; was and how polite society functioned from Wilde's point of view. A must-read if you've read the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: you will finally understand why Fenchurch is always asked if she was found in a handbasket! Wilde's writing is, as always, witty and beautiful. &quot;You will call me sister, won't you?&quot;"},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"This is absolutely the greatest comedy I have ever read! Its humor appeals more to the mind than the slapstick humor of American comedies. It's set in England, in and outside of London, and is a perfect example of a Comedy of Manners play, though written in the mid-1800s. It involves two men who make up a friend or relative that just &quot;happens&quot; to get into a bad situation whenever they want to go to town (or out in the country). Through extenuating circumstances, one comes to be known as Ernest in the town, and the other becomes the very same person out in the country.This is the greatest comedy play ever written, and I would recommend it to anyone who finds Shakespeare too bland at parts, and the farce of the Three Stooges unbearable. It is probably one of the most well-written plays I have read or seen in my life, rising above most Shakespeare plays and such modern plays as &quot;Inherit the Wind.&quot;&quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; holds a message behind the satire of the 19th century that crosses all time; it is better to be honest than to be caught as Ernest."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"This play is the second I read in my life, but I am sure it is one of the best ever written!It is witty and funny, a social satire everybody should read.Wilde played with words and stereotypes in a wonderful manner.Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"One of Oscar Wilde's most famous works, this play is a must read for anyone that is even remotely interested in English theater at any level.&quot;Comedy of Manners,&quot; Wilde's play is on the very shallow surface, a funny play that is full of some of his greatest epigrams.At a deeper level, this play is full of political commentary, social satire and a look at the upper class British of a hundred years ago.Using his world renound style and wit, Wilde, wrote a play that brought to light the majors flaws of the idle rich and the hypocracy that lived right on the surface of their every day lives.Often immitated but never surpassed, Wilde had a way with words and an ability to get to the heart of matters while protecting himself; by making the people he was pointing his finger at, laugh at themselves.This play should be bought, even if one has seen one of the many film versions, or a live revival of the show. The jokes are piled so thickly on top of each other, that in real time, it is imposible to catch everything, or to digest all of the deeper meanings that this play attempts to expose."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"The Importance of Being Earnest has always been one of my favorite books ever! I read it out in no time again after downloading the Kindle edition which I found well presented. I thoroughly advise anyone to get it."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"\\"We live, I regret to say, in an age of surfaces,\\" Lady Bracknell remarks in Oscar Wilde's \\"The Importance Of Being Earnest.\\" In this delicious, divine comedy of good (and some very bad) manners , Wilde punctured the surface pretentions of upper-class 1895 England with his trademark wit and astringent dialogue. This L.A. Theatre Works production is superb. Director Michael Hackett also offers a gender-bending twist by casting Charles Busch as Lady Augusta Bracknell, with hilarious results. Busch is outstanding in the celebrated role.The topsy-turvy plot springs from a case of deliberate, mistaken identity. Leading a \\"double-life,\\" Jack (James Marsters) finds it useful to be \\"Earnest\\" in town and \\"Jack\\" in the country. Whenever he needs to escape country obligations, he is conveniently called away by his \\"brother Earnest.\\" Jack wishes to wed Gwendolyn (Sarah Zimmerman), but first he must pass inspection by her formidable mother, Lady Bracknell, who is described as \\"a monster without being a myth.\\" When Jack tells Lady Bracknell he knows absolutely nothing, she delightedly replies, \\"I do not approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance. Ignorance is like a delicate, exotic fruit. Touch it, and the bloom is gone.\\" When he mentions he has \\"lost\\" both parents, she reproaches, \\"To lose one parent may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.\\"Complications ensue as the action moves from the town to the country. Jack's flighty friend Algernon (Matthew Wolf) decides to pose as \\"brother Earnest\\" and promptly falls in love with Jack's ward Cecily (Emily Bergl). Soon, Gwendolyn and Cecily believe they are both engaged to \\"Earnest.\\" Their tea and cake scene is a comedy classic. Similarly, Jack and Algernon often quibble over such things as muffins and bread and butter. The conclusion, involving Cecily's governess Miss Prism (Jill Gascoine), a handbag, and a three-volume romance novel, is simultaneously absurd and dramatically sound. Laughter is abundant throughout and Wilde's wit reigns supreme. The L.A. Theatre works production also includes a rather academic interview with director Michael Hackett and producer Susan Loewenberg."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"Oscar Wilde made his initial reputation as the master of the epigram: the trenchant and mordant, roughly haiku length flashes of insight into the comic absurdity of the world. No one in English Literature before or since has ever displayed such an effortless mastery of wit. \\"All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does. That's his.\\"The Importance of Being Earnest not only flaunts Wilde's most inconsequential plot, it is also crammed with his funniest epigrams and wittiest bon mots. This 1895 three-act comedic tour-de-force was an immediate hit in London. The comic word-play was a sensation amongst audiences who flocked to see this brilliant manifestation of Wilde's epicene witticisms. Here was a glittering example of London's avant-garde in the 1890's. Much like the play Hair in the 1960's, it was a signature of the times that no self-respecting sophisticate could miss. Wilde enjoyed himself immensely during this apex of his fame. Unfortunately, his reputation was quickly eclipsed by the scandal that engulfed him and his work. It took several decades for that reputation to be rehabilitated. The Importance of Being Earnest seemed to float above the scandals, never losing its popularity and acquiring a theatrical life of its own as an absolutely iconic work.This Norton Critical Edition contains an annotated version of the play as well as several brilliantly incisive articles. A few of the analysts engage in some scholarly hand-waving, trying to attribute a social commentary and literary symbolism to the play that may not exist. Some of it is quite funny, in fact. I can't help but think that Wilde would appreciate the irony of one critic portraying his comic depiction of the frequently agitated butler Lane as an assault on the English class system. Other articles are quite helpful, however. The essay by Camille Paglia is especially insightful with her brilliant analysis of Wilde's dramatic projection of an ambiguous sexual persona. It is a rare comic play that merits its own Norton Critical Edition. This is one of the few. If you love this play (and the hilarious 1951 Anthony Asquith film) as much as I do, this is the edition to have. Most strongly recommended.Mike Birman"},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"This is the Theater Guild on the Air condensed version with this great cast, but there is a double LP box set on Angel in America that is perhaps the greatest audio recording of an English comedy, and it should be issued at once.

This set does include some poetry recordings by Gielgud and Evans, which is a wonderful bonus, but why the perfect sound and complete version wasn't issued is no doubt a legal issue.

I was laughing practically non-stop from Jack's originating from a handbag, to the scene where all is discovered about their names. It's witty, charming, and absolutely brilliant.

It is a great companion in times of trouble -- boredom, sadness, Weltschmerz. I saw it first at summer camp in 1968, where we -- a bunch of 15- and 16-year olds -- put it on. I was 13. I fell in love. It was the wittiest thing I had ever seen. More recently (2001) I saw it at the Fleetwood Stage in New Rochelle, New York. Again, it knocked the audience flat, we were laughing so hard. Wilde's silliness, combined with his brilliance and social insight, makes for a kind of humor that is practically inimitable. That he should have suffered in a hard-labor prison is an outrage."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"\\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" seems to start as a play about truth, but quickly becomes a play about the false through the classical \`simple misunderstanding.' The two male leads, Jack Worthing and Algernon Moncrieff, use imaginary friends they both invent to avoid the boring and weekly family engagements. These imaginary friends lead to eventual confusion between them and the women they love. This Shakespearean misunderstanding is only half the fun though. Wilde, always witty, mocks the ill portrayed English Aristocracy of the late 19th century - poking constant fun at not only their etiquette, but also their stubborn and unpractical tendencies, their immoral behavior, and their exploitation of the lower classes. Very rarely do comedies strike to the heart of the matter and say something meaningful as Oscar Wilde did with this last great play of his."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"I loved this book!!

Very funny and enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"The play &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; by Oscar Wilde is a very funny play on British society in the late 1800?s and early 1900?s. The verbal barbs and jabs thrown by friends Jack and Algernon are quite amusing and quick-witted throughout the play. The idea that two women would be shallow enough to only want to marry a man named Earnest is just mind boggling, since the word earnest is almost 180 opposite the shallowness of the ladies. The mother is an interesting character in that she will not let her daughter marry the son of a &quot;hand bag&quot;, this adds a little break from the gentlemen?s verbal assault on one another and allows the reader to catch their breath. The ending is quite funny but I will not give it away, you must do yourself a favor and read the play."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"Oscar Wilde's \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" is one of the funniest plays that I have ever read. It explores the British upper society at the beginning of the 20th Century. It concerns two best friends and their attempt to marry two women. The only reason that the women want to marry these men is if their first name is Earnest. The main character of the play is Jack. He goes under the assumed name of Earnest because he really does not know who his parents are. The situations and banter between Jack and his friend Algernon is the funniest since Shakespeare. This is interesting in the fact that it is very anti tragic play. It is anti tragic in the fact that by the end of the play, Jack finds out that his name is really Earnest and his is upset about it. Extremely funny play for anyone who knows anything about the British sense of royalty and nobility."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"Oscar Wilde is a wonderful playwright--truly a literary genius. Earnest is probably his best play because he has developed past the Problem Play genre and focuses all his talent on pure wit and the criticism of the frivolity of Victorian England.

In all honesty this is a phenomenal piece of literature. Wilde offers comedy of several sorts. The bickering between Jack and Algernon and the bickering between Gwendolen and Cecily is well drawn. Lady Bracknell is a dominating figure in herself. Miss Prism and the Priest are also memorable supporting characters. Wilde also offers a funny repetition of events when first Jack tries to woo Gwendolen under an alias identity and then Algernon tries to woo Cecily under the same alias identity. This makes the scene where they all meet together hilarious! But Wilde DOES NOT stop here! After the 2 men and 2 women bickered with each other, Jack and Algernon team up to win the love of their lives, and Gwendolen and Cecily team up to determine the integrity of Jack and Algernon. The end of this defines dramatic irony! (I don't want to spoil it.) Perhaps the greatest thing about this book is that Wilde skillfully balances subtle humour and major dramatic irony. If you like this book, you MUST see the Paramount Production. Most video stores should have it."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"Okay, so Oscar Wilde is never placed in context with the &quot;world view&quot; so many of us have of the Victorian era. This play, probably his finest, is a laugh out loud riot about two young men with a combined four identities, both searching for an honest, compassionate relationship with two equally shallow women.

It is funny-- genuinely funny, without being naughty or &quot;sophisticated&quot; or cynical, without being overly goofy, without being sad at the same time, or profound, or stupid. It is light without making you wish it was deeper or think maybe it is and you missed it somehow.I was forced to read a fair number of comedies throughout English lit classes, and my clearest memory was that most jokes, though alive on stage, are dead on the page. Even in Shakespeare, often. Here, though, I really was laughing, enjoying the wordiness and wit. Makes me really wish and hope to see it performed someday.The word that comes to mind is pure. Like if there really are Platonic forms, essences of things, this is the platonic form of comedy. Or at least approaches it more closely than anything else I've ever read.It's simple. It's short.

A man should always have an occupation of some kind. There are far too many idle men in London as it is. How old are you?JACK Twenty-nine.LADY BRACKNELL A very good age to be married at.

Which do you know?JACK [After some hesitation.] I know nothing, Lady Bracknell.LADY BRACKNELL I am pleased to hear it. I do not approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance. Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and the bloom is gone. The whole theory of modern education is radically unsound. Fortunately in England, at any rate, education produces no effect whatsoever. If it did, it would prove a serious danger to the upper classes, and probably lead to acts of violence in Grosvenor Square. What is your income?or maybe this one:JACK I have lost both my parents.LADY BRACKNELL To lose one parent, Mr. Worthing, may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.or try this:)JACK Well, will you go if I change my clothes?ALGERNON Yes, if you are not too long.

According to the introductory note in the Dover edition, the play was first performed in London in 1895. More than a century later, &quot;Importance&quot; is still a sparkling delight. Although I suppose the play is best experienced as a theatrical performance, it also makes a wonderful read.In &quot;Importance&quot; Wilde has fun with the customs and attitudes of well-to-do 19th century English people. As the plot of mistaken identity and romance unfolds, Wilde's characters let loose a string of memorable witticisms and sarcastic comments. One of my favorites: &quot;Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and the bloom is gone.&quot; Another one: &quot;My duty as a gentleman has never interfered with my pleasures in the smallest degree.&quot;Along the way, Wilde's characters reveal the benefits and drawbacks of being a &quot;Bunburyist&quot; (don't bother looking it up in a dictionary; you have to read the play!).

Although the story takes place in 19th century England, the humor transcends time. It starts off when one gentleman meets up with another. Questions arise to the identity of the visiting man, named Ernest, which leads to a mini-mystery. The two men banter humorously throughout the book accompanied by the leading ladies and a very accomodating butler. The reason for the title becomes apparent when the name Ernest is the central cause for the hilarity. I absolutely loved this book! It was a quick read and made me laugh out loud.

I fell in love. It was the wittiest thing I had ever seen. More recently (2001) I saw it at the Fleetwood Stage in New Rochelle, New York. Again, it knocked the audience flat, we were laughing so hard. Wilde's silliness, combined with his brilliance and social insight, makes for a kind of humor that is practically inimitable. That he should have suffered in a hard-labor prison is an outrage."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"\\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" seems to start as a play about truth, but quickly becomes a play about the false through the classical \`simple misunderstanding.' The two male leads, Jack Worthing and Algernon Moncrieff, use imaginary friends they both invent to avoid the boring and weekly family engagements. These imaginary friends lead to eventual confusion between them and the women they love. This Shakespearean misunderstanding is only half the fun though. Wilde, always witty, mocks the ill portrayed English Aristocracy of the late 19th century - poking constant fun at not only their etiquette, but also their stubborn and unpractical tendencies, their immoral behavior, and their exploitation of the lower classes. Very rarely do comedies strike to the heart of the matter and say something meaningful as Oscar Wilde did with this last great play of his."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"This sparkles with wit that belongs only to Oscar Wilde. The sarcasm is delicious and the twists very intriguing. At first I was highly confused by it but midway, I found my bearings. Great read."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"\\"All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does. That's his.Is that clever?It's perfectly phrased! and quite as true as any observation in civilized life should be.\\"This is just one of the many jocular exchanges and epigrams in this short but brilliant social satire. Wilde wryly and cleverly gets his claws into the upper caste and its twisted moral etqieuette, romantic relationships, and self-critically the propensity for sententious moral (and aesthetic) self-guidance.Dispensing with politeness and social convention through his farcical dialogue, Wilde unleashes his comic criticism on all types of hypocrisies and spurious norms. The Importance of Being Ernest is always subversive and funny, but never crude or sophomoric."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"I love this play; I cannot imagine not having read it, not being able to revel in its insane logic of plot and a script that consists almost entirely of epigrams. Even though the play is given over to a frenzy of wit, the characters are likable and well-drawn, not mere vehicles for gag lines. The only problem with this play is that it is too short."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"I was never a fan of Oscar Wilde's until I read The Importance of Being Earnest. His words crackle and fly off of the page, full of humor and fluency. I was never bored with this text, from its very start to the crazy, chaotic end. Wilde made me writhe in my seat with anticipation, wondering what loony character I'd be introduced to next, and with what sub-plot they'd fit in. The dialogue of The Importance of Being Earnest snaps, addressing social ideas and mores that, in its time, weren't exactly spoken aloud. What a clever and creative man Wilde truly was."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"As a high school student reading this play for educational purposes, my first impression was that it would be long and boring. I was, however, corrected within the first few pages as I encountered the hilarious discussions between Jack and Algernon. The language and wit is so dry its hard not to find something amusing. This line said by Algernon is one worth saving, &quot;The truth is rarely pure and never simple. Modern life would be very tedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete impossibility!&quot; Contrary to popular belief, this play is not one thats difficult to get into. Right from the start there is a conflict that grabs the readers attention and carries them through the mix up of fiances with Cecily and Gwendolen, also a scene that is sure to amuse even the most serious of readers. Lady Bracknell could seemingly be a thorn in the readers side in the beginning, but not to worry, the old woman set in her ways becomes if nothing else a source of comic relief. This play is not only a quick read but also has the perfect combination of characters that makes it delightfully funny."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"It is a brilliant play with joke and charm. From the beginning it is very complex and the relations are mixed up. You never know who is related to whom and figures are very characteristic. You never what will happen next. The play is written for his time very progressive and modern. The women are worried about the name of their engaged men and forget the real worth of human nature. Lady Bracknell wants her children only to marry with persons of higher society and doesn't carry about real love. I can recommend this funny play."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"The story is about the two dandies Algernon and Jack who invented an imaginary person to have an excuse to go to country or to town. Both of them fall in love, but because of the double personality of Algernon and Jack there is a lot of confusion. At the everything clears up and there is a happy ending. We liked to read the book and can recommend it to everyone. It is really very funny. The characters talk a lot of paradoxical things. Oscar Wilde plays with the adjective earnest and the name Ernest. The motto of the play is: &quot;In matters of great importance, style, not sincerity is the vital thing.&quot; Oscar Wilde said once: &quot; We should treat all the trivial things of life very seriously, and all the serious things of life with sincere and studied triviality.&quot; At the beginning everything they talk about seems to be nonsense, but if you think about it you see that some things they say are quite rig"},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"Amazing how reading the books of great authors can rekindle old times as a student.

The wit of the dialogues is something that I rarely find in books or movies. The humor has originality, the irony is catching. It makes me laugh when the characters' remarks, upside down from what one would call desirable or normal, are yet so fitting to how a large part of the society thinks. It could be that Wilde intended to severely criticize society, but I remained with an impression of how funny the world is with its inconsistencies, little vices and flaws. Funny in a lovable way. What trouble would we be in if there were nothing to ironise? Perfect reason, perfect honesty, perfect altruism and other such perfections are deeply flawed, firstly for not having anything amusing about them :)."},{"Title":"Importance of Being Earnest Sig","review":"Wilde's plays hold up incredibly well and provide some of the most quotable one-liners in literature. A master of satire, in these selections the upper classes and the social conventions they adhered to are skewered through the ingenious use of word play ,mistaken identity and farce.

The text reads with the rapidity of Voltaire's Candide, so the comedy's pace must be absolutely white hot in performance. The actors would have to wait for the laughter to die down, a real challenge with this farce. One should, of course, see it on the stage, and I must admit that I've never had that pleasure.

Although Bukowski had published before--including some beautiful small editions by Jon and Louise Webb of LouJon Press--it was publisher John Martin who propelled Bukowski into wide readership. And it was the strength of Bukowski's writing which gave Black Sparrow, Martin's small publishing house, its wings.Martin liberated Bukowski from his job at the post office by offering him a $100/month stipend for life (a liveable wage at that time) so that Bukowski could write full time. The almost immediate result was Bukowski's first novel, Post Office, which was completed six weeks after he left his job.For decades to come, Bukowski would send typed pages of poetry to Martin who would assemble them into books, the covers of which were designed by Martin's wife Barbara. A great part of the appeal of Black Sparrow editions is that they were about nothing but themselves--there were no blurbs, no extraneous hyping text, and even the barcodes were stickers which could be peeled off, leaving the uniformly sized covers immaculate.Although Bukowski died in 1994, he left an immense backlog of poetry with Martin for posthumous publication. In that sense, their relationship stays the same. Sadly, Martin sold Black Sparrow in 2002.He is still editing the collections of \\"new\\" Bukowski poetry, but the books themselves, now published by Harper Collins (under their Ecco Press imprint), lack the grace and stylistic unity of the Black Sparrow editions. The new editions are released as tacky hardbacks (to maximize profits) with textbook binding, complete with barcode printed right on the cover. Too bad.But that's a minor concern. What matters most are the words, which come to us fresh even 12 years after Bukowski's death. The usual themes are here: guarding privacy, celebrating animals, lambasting poet wannabes, and awaiting death with dignity. Plus a few narrative poems which read like distilled short stories.If you like Buk, you'll like this book. Always a good read."},{"Title":"Come On In!: New Poems","review":"I've become a real fan of Bukowski's work over the past four years, and read everything I can get my hands on. So far my favorite of all has been \\"Betting On The Muse\\", but this one is a very close second. Sure he's vulgar and rough, and it's poetry with images and language not for the weakhearted. But he still manages to deliver these lines within his world that just stun you. A definite must-read if you're a fan."},{"Title":"Come On In!: New Poems","review":"In the latest from the archive of his poetry comes a luminous(he would have hated the word but understood its truth) book, written near the end of his life. The old themes are there: finding out that tragedy is getting what you want, as he observes in \\"the waitress at the yogurt shop\\", the boys drooling around her, fixated on her body and oblivious to the harsh and hissing voice and pities the future husband listening to its \\"horrible reality.\\" Yet there is more of the domestic, an old mans' happiness on learning to type poems---more and more---on a computer,\\"going,going,gone\\") and a bravdo, both real,\\"the last good night/is not yet here\\" from \\"taking the 8 count\\", and false ,as in \\"hello there\\", \\"when death comes with its last cold kiss/ i'll be ready;just another whore come to shake me down.\\" And the final poem,\\"mind and heart\\" a graceful good bye to life.It is Bukowski at his best---knowing that for every hard truth there is a saving grace."},{"Title":"Come On In!: New Poems","review":"Charles Bukowski, Come on In!: New Poems (Ecco, 2006)The more of Buk's posthumous poetry I read, the more I wonder why anyone buys it. I've long held the hypothesis that he published the best bits while he was still alive (and really, let's face it, Bukowski's pinnacle as a poet came during the sixties and early seventies, after which he spent more time working on, and improving, his prose style), and what was left over was meant solely as a moneymaking scheme; he did, after all, realize that he'd reached that critical mass where the fans would buy anything. He could write something about watching the cat walk across the room, chop it up into one or two-word lines, and people would buy it. Or, for that matter, he could write about writing.\\"almost ever since I began writingdecades agoI have been dogged bywhisperers and gossipswho have proclaimeddailyweeklyyearlythatI can't write anymorethat nowI slipandfall.\\"(\\"I have continued regardless\\")Every artist runs the risk of becoming a self-parody; it seems that the more influential the artist, the greater the risk, or maybe that's just because we have so many examples of bad imitation of that artist. This is a perfect example of a bad Bukowski imitator...except that it's the man himself.That said, there are still flashes of brilliance every once in a while, and no matter what else you can say about the guy, one thing Bukowski's poems have always had is the kind of readability that few other poets possess; yeah, readability is nothing in and of itself most of the time (I'm resisting the urge here to call Buk the Dan Brown of poetry), but in a genre as legendarily obtuse as poetry, however undeserved the tag may be, one has to grudgingly admit that readability for its own sake must carry at least some cache. If it gets more people reading poetry, it's got to be worthwhile on some level. ***"},{"Title":"Come On In!: New Poems","review":"\\"Welcome to my wormy hell,\\" Charles Bukowski (1920 --1994) invites the reader at the outset of this collection of posthumously published poetry. Bukowski, a writer who became famous for his novels, stories, and poems depicting the raw, down-and-out life left a great deal of unpublished work at his death, and it has continued to appear in several volumes.\\"Come on In!\\" is a mixed collection which includes some good poems. Bukowski explores themes that will be familiar to readers: life at the track, boxing, drinking,his experiences with women, loneliness and the desire to be alone, life on the edge, the love of animals, particularly cats, and the writing of poetry. The collection shows Bukowski's sardonic, wry and laconic humor.The theme of death pervades this collection as Bukowski, old and ill, shows a full awareness of his own mortality. In addition, Bukowski reflects upon his own success as a writer. In his young days, the subject of most of Bukowski's writing, he lived the life of a drunk in the underclass. Beginning in 1971 when he received a stipend from John Martin of Black Sparrow press to devote himself to writing, Bukowski gradually became commercially successful and wealthy. In the poem \\"you can't tell a turkey by its feathers\\", which recounts how Bukowski's father thought he wouldn't amount to anything, Bukowski boasts that \\"Last year I paid/ $59,000 income/tax.\\" Many of the poems involve Bukowski's sucess and recognition, as he compares his late life with his earlier days.The poems are unrhymed and unmetered and generally written in short stanzas. Most of them are short, but in some instances Bukowski tells stories in his poems, frequently set out as dialogues or conversations. In this book, the poems are arranged in four broad divisions: \\"I live near the/slaughterhouse/and am ill/ with thriving\\"; \\"she looked at me and asked/did you?/did you/did you?\\"; \\"it's a lonely world/of frightened people\\"; \\"I will never have' a house in the valley/ with little stone men/ on the lawn\\".The poems I enjoyed in the collection include Bukowski's reflections on his past relationship with women. In \\"red hot mail\\" Bukowski contrasts his state as a successful poet with his younger years when women would not look at him. He writes:\\"I only wish now some lass hadchanced upon me thenwhen I so needed her hair blowing in myfaceand her eyes smiling into mine,when I so neededthat wild musicand that wild female willingnessto beundone.\\"Among the many other poems which show Bukowski in a meditative, thoughtful mood are \\"alone again\\", \\"to the ladies no longer here\\" and \\"here we go again.\\" Bukowski's poem \\"a close call\\" shows all too clearly the fine line that separated sanity and madness in his life. The poem \\"the nude dancer\\" consists of an elderly Bukowski's portrayal of an exotic dancer which complements nicely an earlier poem on this theme describing an encounter in Bukowski's youth, \\"Love poem to a stripper\\". One of the acclaimed poems in this collection is \\"the 'Beats'\\" in which Bukowski contrasts his own writing to that of the beat writers and concludes:\\"my opinion remains thesame: writing is doneone personat a timeone placeat a timeand all the gatheringsoftheflockhave very littleto dowithanything.\\"But I think the best writing in \\"Come on In!\\" is in the final section of the book. Bukowski offers meditiations on his own terminal illness and on the meaning of his life which are moving indeed. The poems I enjoyed in this part include \\"my cats\\", \\"two nights before my 72nd birthday\\", and \\"closing time\\" in which Bukowski discusses his love for Beethoven, \\"this composer/now dead for over 100/years,/ who's younger and wilder/than you are/than I am.\\" Bukowski observes that \\"the centuries are sprinkled/with rare magic/with divine creatures/who help us get past the common/ and/extraordinary ills/ that beset us.\\"The final poem in the book \\"mind and heart\\" is a valedictory poem as Bukowski faces death. \\"Unaccountably we are alone/forever alone/ and it was meant to be/that way\\", he begins. He reflects upon his life and finds that he has developed some had-won serenity of \\"peace of mind and heart.\\" He advises his readers to \\"read/what I've written/then/forget it/all.\\" And again:\\"drink from the wellof your selfand beginagain.\\"Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Come On In!: New Poems","review":"I read a few short stories when I was a younger woman and never considered picking up Bukowski again.

I like the idea that the puzzles are challenging even to an adult and cannot be solved in mere seconds. They take a certain amount of concentration of the part of the child but not so much that puzzle becomes so difficult that they want to quit."},{"Title":"I Spy Ultimate Challenger: A Book of Picture Riddles","review":"Love seeking games for my girls, but I sure wish there was more pages and more to be found in these books..."},{"Title":"I Spy Ultimate Challenger: A Book of Picture Riddles","review":"While there's nothing particularly wrong with this book, there's nothing groundbreaking, either. The pictures are taken from other books in the series, and while the riddles are new, they aren't any more difficult or involved than usual. Think of this as \\"ultimate\\" in the sense of \\"last in a series\\" (until the next one comes out), not \\"highest in degree or order, utmost or extreme\\" (definitions via WordNet).In addition to this book, I also have the Spooky Night, Christmas, and Mystery I Spy books. Of the 12 pictures in this collection five come from those books (two each from Spooky Night and Christmas, one from Mystery). Also with only 12 pictures, \\"Ultimate Challenger\\" has one fewer picture than the Christmas and Mystery books. And because the pictures come from a variety of sources, there isn't even a \\"find the common element\\" usually present at the end of an I Spy book.To be sure the pictures are creatively staged and the riddles occasionally make good use of word play (trunk: is that elephant, tree or luggage?), and there are the usual bonus riddles at the end of the book. Make sure you have a very good light source over your shoulder or head because the finish on the pages and lighting of some of the pictures can make the objects even harder to find.If you're new to I Spy or don't have any of the books recycled here (check the Amazon Search Table of Contents for a list of the pictures, the Back Cover has, I believe, a list of the books involved), the \\"Ultimate Challenger\\" isn't bad - and it's more disappointing than terrible if you do have some of the books already.

It is a multi-authored text which allows people to write on what they know best, rather than making authors stretch well beyond their fields of expertise. This unfortunately means there's a lot of repetition between chapters, and some flat-out contradictions. It does a fairly good of reviewing the literature in a number of sub-fields of herpetology, and so provides more up-to-date reviews than you're likely to find in &quot;Biology of the Reptilia&quot;. It is a good choice for a herpetology course for undergraduates--in fact I plan to use it for such a course in summer 1999. Amazing omissions: dinosaurs!! birds!! biogeography!! Notable inclusions: good chapters on foraging ecology, classification (too short), &amp; thermoregulation."},{"Title":"Herpetology","review":"I have just finished an undergradute course which used this book as the main text. I agree with the previous reviewer that there is considerable overlap and occasional contradiction. The early chapters tend to use a lot of technical jargon, and seem to be written for people who already understand the material. I was not so impressed with phylogenic descriptions which frequently failed to discuss unifying characteristics within families. Later sections, including locomotion, water balance, and mate selection are well written. This book would benefit from a glossary, more relevant tables and figures, and a more inclusive index.

However, his will to live to recuperate is not diminished even if he has become a recluse. Fate will bring Hannah Price across his path once again and this time with a different result.Hannah is a divorcee with two boys and feels wholly guilty for what she caused to happen to Gabe. She is a strong woman and a very likeable character. She proposes to cook for him in exchange for one of his handmade chairs. This constant interaction develops into something more. They both discover that there is more to life than living with the gross mistakes of the past. Gabe is willing to move beyond his limitations to embrace a relationship with Hannah."},{"Title":"Stranger in Town (Harlequin Superromance No. 1278)","review":"Another great Novel.

I was so enthralled by the events that took place, I could even put the book down long enough to even eat dinner. I can't even start to image what kind of guilt ran threw Hannah, knowing she took away a man's ability to live the life he once cherished so much. She knew Gabe was going through a hard time,but she also knew that there was nothing she could do to turn back the events that took place 3 years ago. Lord only knows that if she could, she surely would.Gabe was a famous quarterback in the NFL, he was also rich, good looking, and very popular with both the women and men alike. He had it all going his way, until that fateful night 3 years ago. He was on his way home for the Christmas holidays, when a car hit him head on. The crash left him paralyzed from the waist down. He holds no grudge against Hannah, he knew it was just one of those unfortunate accidents that happen every now and then. But after he realized his injuries might be permanent, he hid himself away in the mountains and lived like a hermit. It wasn't so much that he'd felt ashamed of being in the wheel chair, it was because he was tired of seeing the pity on the faces on every citizen in town, including his own family members.Hannah has been struggling to recover from that fateful night too, the guilt had all but eaten through her whole being. Things start to go into another direction though, when Gabe becomes her son's new high school football coach. The more interaction she has with Gabe, the more in love she is with him. But can they find happiness, or will that terrible accident keep them apart?I rated this book a 4.5 actually, but only because of the short ending. I know authors tend to do that when writing series books. They usually make up for it in the next book, but even so, I wished it would have ended a bit differently.Would I recommend this book? Yes, most definitely."},{"Title":"Stranger in Town (Harlequin Superromance No. 1278)","review":"I loved this book!

He never gives up on the chance that he'll one day walk again, and keeps to himself in his remote cabin. When his high school football coach dies suddenly, the school needs a replacement, and his friend Mike asks him to take over.Hannah's son Kevin is nervous about the new coach - will he have residual anger towards Kevin because of his mother? Hannah tries to run interference and gets the brush off from Gabe. When she spots a beautiful chair that Gabe made, she asks if she can exchange home cooked meals for the chair.Hannah's looking for forgiveness, and finds love, never believing that he'd return her feelings. Making matters difficult is her former in-laws that would like nothing more than reconciliation for the good of the children.\\"Stranger in Town\\" is just a standard melodramatic Harlequin romance; nothing to write home about and certainly not up to par with Novak's other novels like the superb \\"Every Waking Moment.\\""},{"Title":"Stranger in Town (Harlequin Superromance No. 1278)","review":"I'm a fan of Judith Duncan's books set in the Canadian prarie ranching towns and like books with intimate domestic settings in these tiny communities where lives are intermingled and everyone knows everyone else. I can't now recall how I wound up in Dundee, Idaho with Brenda Novak but somehow I did. I liked this book with a couple of reservations.The descriptions of town life with nosy neighbours and good and bad people were good. The nasty ex-husband of the heroine was especially well done - what an awful man. What I did NOT like, however, was the fact that she did not take real, positive action when he nearly decked her in a fit of jealous, juvenile anger. She had no reason not to pursue him and regain full custody of her children over his behaviour.I liked the hero who reminded me of Mitch in Her Secret, His Child by Paula Detmer Riggs. He had a far harder journey than any of the others although we only meet him at the end of his period of acceptance of what has happened to him.When a H/H grow, evolve and mature in a story, I appreciate watching this happen. However, we had two 37 year olds in this book who seemed a little behind in the process. OK, Gabe has been disabled and Hannah had the marriage from hell but I think both of them were a little slow in growing up. Gabe's attitude towards his parents and one of his sisters was less than grown up and Hannah's refusal to deal rationally and decisively with an ex-husband who was abusive of her and in many ways of her children did not strike me as how a mature couple would behave.I liked the children in this story because the elder, in particular, had a journey of his own. However, the ex-husband situation should have been better resolved for all concerned, particularly the two boys.All in all a good story but not a keeper. The author writes well enough but something was lacking here for me and I think it was that lack of maturity in the H/H that stopped this being a 5 star book."},{"Title":"Stranger in Town (Harlequin Superromance No. 1278)","review":"it was very good story and very fast reading great for plane reading and waiting for plane connecetion when transfering"},{"Title":"Stranger in Town (Harlequin Superromance No. 1278)","review":"A demonstration of personal growth, strength and forgiveness.

Her ex-husband has taken her children and he is only a few minutes ahead of her. Perhaps she could catch up to him - if only she wasn't behind this person driving on this treacherous road so slowly. As she starts passing this person on a blind curve in a blinding snowstorm, quarterback Gabe Hollbrook is driving in the other direction, about to round that blind curve.How Ms Novak managed to pull wonderful love story out of this plot line is beyond me, but she did. I think it was her best book I have read yet. The characters are rich in depth. The story is interesting and the fact that our hero is in a wheelchair made this book such a challenge to read without continual sobbing on my part.The idea of Gabe becoming her son's football coach was ironic at times but to me was a wonderful plot device.

Many consider him the father of firewalls. He invented one of the first intrusion detection systems. He always put forward his honest pragmatic approach to information security.The problem with information security is that it has become so hyped that most people can't tell the difference between something that works and something that doesn't. Marcus can, and you should take what he says seriously."},{"Title":"The Myth of Homeland Security","review":"I've known Marcus for several years. One of the things that has always impressed me was his ability to make you think, to demonstrate ideas you never heard of before. His book does just that, it makes you think, which is critical for security. While I may not agree with the some of the points he raises, its important to question and understand the issues involved."},{"Title":"The Myth of Homeland Security","review":"Every decade or so, a book comes out that fundamentally changes the way we look at an issue. Examples include Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, and Ralph Nader's Unsafe at Any Speed; these books are timeless in their influence. The Myth of Homeland Security by noted information security consultant Marcus Ranum (also known as the father of the firewall) has an equally ominous message and deserves equal attention. Like Unsafe at Any Speed, Ranum's book should serve as a fulcrum for change.Essentially, Ranum makes the point that buying duct tape by the mile and having elderly women remove their shoes at airports does absolutely nothing to increase homeland security. Ranum details other flaws in the government's approach to counter terrorism, including the huge bureaucracies that exist primarily for the purpose of prolonging their existence. He notes that the very structure of bureaucracies rewards inefficiencies and encourages territorialism and turf warfare. Want proof? More than two years after 9-11, the CIA and FBI still do not have a streamlined method for interdepartmental communications.Throwing money (to the tune of tens of billions of dollars) at the problem without first identifying the solutions certainly are not the way to go. So what should we do?First, as Ranum notes, we must get practical. From a physical security perspective, it is hard enough to secure a mega-mall with a few hundred stores and tens of thousands of customers. The task is exponentially more difficult, if not impossible, when extended to an entire country spanning millions of square miles of land, including long, unsecured borders, and inhabited by hundreds of millions of both permanent and transient, legal and illegal persons, with more entering daily.Compounding the challenge of this complex and multifaceted task is the government's penchant for creating and sustaining bureaucracies without regard for whether they make getting the job done easier. For example, the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (BCIS), formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), admits that it can't account for nearly a half-million visitors to this country.Given the agency's poor performance historically, it should have been completely dismantled and rebuilt from the ground up. Instead, it was given a new name. If BCIS were a public company, its top management would have been fired long ago. Thus, the second step toward better homeland security would be more accountability for officials spearheading government programs.Another issue that complicates the challenge of homeland security is that the average citizen simply does not understand risk, notes Ranum. As a result, most people will overreact to isolated incidents, such as occurred with the Washington, D.C., area sniper, while ignoring threats with a much higher probability of affecting them, such as cancer from smoking or a serious car accident from drunk driving.Media coverage that reduces complex issues to sound bites certainly does not help. But even the authorities, who surely do not get their information from media sound bites, seem not to take a big-picture, long-term view. For example, when a shoe-bomber attempted to take down an airliner with a shoe-based bomb attack, security services started making all passengers take off their shoes before embarking.Is this an effective way to deal with the overall risk? No. As Ranum notes, just imagine if this terrorist had stored his bomb in his underwear.To address this problem, the third step toward better homeland security would be for officials to take a more professional approach to risk assessment and for security professionals in government and in private industry to work together to educate the public about proper risk assessment and risk management.A fourth issue that must be addressed is the government's inability to solve problems expeditiously once they have been identified. One has to wonder, says Ranum, why Amazon.com can grow from a garage to an e-commerce powerhouse in a matter of months, yet CIA and FBI databases still can't effectively share information with each other more than two years after 9-11. A laundry list of other security problems at government agencies has been repeatedly cited by General Accounting Office reports without the problems being addressed.Moreover, for homeland security to work, agencies such as INS/BCIS, FBI, CIA, and even the NSA all have to work together. News reports suggest that the FBI and CIA are still not cooperating to the degree they should.Then, of course, there is the issue of the insider threat. Even if we permanently sealed our borders, there would be serious risks to homeland security, notes Ranum. Nefarious individuals such as Timothy McVeigh, Aldrich Ames, and Robert Hanssen were all Americans, in some cases with security clearances. In a democracy, there is no easy solution to this problem.Homeland security is so big that it may be inherently unsolvable. Yet it is a risk that must be managed. That means government needs to find a reasonable level of countermeasures to establish a reasonable level of security. Instead, it continues to suggest to the American people that a few billion dollars and a reshuffling of the bureaucracy can solve the problem.Overall, Ranum does an excellent job of showing what is right and wrong about homeland security issues. The only time the author blunders, is when he takes a somewhat overly simplistic view of the Middle East crisis, and makes some unreasonable comparisons.The 9-11 attacks started a giant wheel moving, and that wheel's name is the Department of Homeland Security. The Jungle ushered in a new era within the meatpacking industry, while Unsafe at Any Speed fundamentally changed Detroit, and saved tens of thousands of lives in the process. If The Myth of Homeland Security has but a hundredth of the impact, and if it does nothing more than get the FBI and CIA to work better together, then maybe homeland security won't be a myth after all."},{"Title":"The Myth of Homeland Security","review":"Mr. Ranum is widely known in my field, computer security. He has clearly been thinking about these broader issues, of national and individual security, for many years. This book contains his personal closely reasoned analysis of some of the most important issues facing us today. This book is not only informative, smart, and darkly humorous, it is wise.A must-read for anyone with any interest in these issues, which arguably should include every voting citizen."},{"Title":"The Myth of Homeland Security","review":"Homeland Security is a hot topic. Even if it wasn't, the \\"wag the dog\\" mentality of the United States government would make it so. The terrorist attacks of 9/11 have defined and driven almost all aspects public policy and government spending since then. In a knee-jerk reaction to the events, many laws and initiatives were passed ostensibly to protect our country from any similar attacks in the future.Marcus Ranum's book- The Myth of Homeland Security- illustrates how these knee-jerk reactions fall short of the goal. The Homeland Security Act and the PATRIOT Act in particular seem to do as much or more to limit and strip the individual freedoms of law abiding U.S. citizens as they do to protect the country or deter terrorism.Much of the book is almost more of a rant about the current state of government in the United States, but even the ranting is engaging to read and Ranum backs his opinions up with intelligent, well-written and sometimes humorous points.Ranum does offer some solutions, while also stressing that not everything is even fixable. Much of security is illusion. It is smoke and mirrors to give the sense of security when in reality a determined attacker could easily bypass the security measures and attack successfully.I recommend this book for everyone if for no other reason than to ensure that the American public continue to think critically and question our elected officials and not simply fall for the illusion of security.(...)"},{"Title":"The Myth of Homeland Security","review":"Ranum admits that he's no expert on homeland security. And proceeds to prove it. (He has a solid background in computer security but spent only several months researching homeland security). He says that he read the Homeland Security Act and that both the ACLU and the Justice Dept are wrong about it's contents, but does a poor job of detailing what it is all about.He quotes lots of hearsay and old data. He grabs snippets of information to make his point, not realizing that they could sometimes equally well prove the opposite point. He spends many pages telling us, both how hard the job of security is, how important it is and how badly it is being done, but his solutions, when offered, however, aren't terribly practical or aren't much better than what is in place.Like the other reviewers, I agree with most of what he says, but I already knew most of it too. Gov't is bloated. Politicians are more concerned with gain for themselves and their districts than with effective legislation. Security is at least 50% illusion. It is impossible to stop a truely determined terrorist. And the Homeland Security Act is a double-edged sword that is as likely to hamper our freedoms as citizens as it is to slow down terrorism. Yep. It's all true, Marcus.Overall, I give the author gets points for being concerned. He gets points for pointing out legitimate problems and for caring enough to research the situation. And he does know his computer security. But I wish he had more solutions and less frustration. I found myself saying &quot;Yep, I agree&quot; far more than &quot;Wow! This guy is sharp or well-informed or insightful&quot;. I've read better editorials about the Homeland Security Act than this book (and worse ones too). It ain't bad, it just ain't all that good neither."},{"Title":"The Myth of Homeland Security","review":"If you're a little uneasy these days with teenagers testing our homeland security by planting boxcutters and getting away with it, this book is a must read! Ranum takes what a lot of us have been thinking for the past couple of years and puts it into perspective. It's refreshing to see something other than rants. This guy actually brings common sense into the picture with his In a Perfect World at the end of each chapter. By the time you finish checking out his &quot;you should know&quot; factoids, you know you're a much better informed citizen. It's the perfect &quot;plane read&quot; (especially that chapter on Airline Insecurity)."},{"Title":"The Myth of Homeland Security","review":"It is the kind of book you read slowly because you don't want Ranum's points to end.Ranum takes command of the reader from beginning to end just as forcefully as the PATRIOT act was literally rammed through by lawmakers.Each chapter captivates the reader by the very clever points and poignant facts. Ranum succeeds in presenting each point with a gripping sardonic crisp view.Ranum yet again lives up to his reputation as an outspoken security expert with prolific, inventive points presenting a platform for a cataclysmic change of the public's opinion of Homeland Security and the various other security agencies that supposedly protects the United States."},{"Title":"The Myth of Homeland Security","review":"Maybe I didn't like this book because it pushed too many of my buttons (and that's my problem) but after reading it, I don't feel that I've learned anything new or particularly useful.First, Ranum commits the unforgivable sin of not citing sources. I think I'm going to make a point of NEVER reading another non-fiction book that does this. It's annoying, dishonest, lazy and it makes Ranum look like an intellectual lightweight at best and an outright fraud at worst. At one point Ranum decries people who believe anything they read on the Internet. Mr. Ranum, why shold we believe YOU if we can't see your sources?Secondly, this book reads and looks like a compilation of editorials Mr. Ranum might have written for \\"USA Today\\". Ranum writes in a plain-spoken and basic style, which struck me as a little patronizing at times. This could be because I understand most of the technical concepts that Ranum explains, in which case I'm probably not in the target group of Ranum's readers.But it gets worse. The text is interrupted with highlights of requoted text, sidebars and sentences set off with the headline \\"You should know.\\" It looks as if Ranum set out to write \\"Homeland Security for Dummies\\" but couldn't sell the concept to the \\"...for Dummies\\" people. This is not to say that the sidebars are not interesting, but if they were worth printing at all, they should have been integrated into the overall text._______\\"YOU SHOULD KNOW\\"People who read books tend to have significant attention spans (they also aren't averse to looking up a word or two in the dictionary. Many dictionaries are now on-line).Of course, I made that up, but that's what it's like! Annoying, don't you think? Any high school teacher in the world would have accused a student who used these techniques of stretching his material to meet the minimum number of pages.A lot of reviewers have accused Mr. Ranum of being a polemicist. I don't. I don't disagree with what he says -- that would have been challenging. He makes good points but stating that federal bureaucracies are wasteful, that the private sector is more efficient and that the media deals in sensationalism shouldn't take 231 pages."},{"Title":"The Myth of Homeland Security","review":"It was reassuring to see Ranum discussing the areas he's known for: downplaying the over-hyped risks cyber-terrorism (and he has thoughtful comments on a cyber &quot;pre-&quot;Pearl Harbor).But the rest of the book is a lot more about Ranum's opinions and speculations, and rather light on reliable facts. Where you already agree, you might cheer Ranum on. But if he introduces material that surprises or challenges, he cites no sources, so who know's if he's talking fact or blather?In numerous places, he's vague or superficial or appears to contradict points he made a chapter or two back. It's as though the book was written in a number of brief bursts, the author forgetting between times what he'd said before.One strange example: on p174, Ranum claims that the Code Red virus might have been caught even by outdated virus software, hence Code Red's spread is indicative of mass lack of any kind virus protection, not simply virus writer being a small step ahead. Interesting enough to deserve a bit more of an explanation.The book review by Rob Slade (Google newsgroups) takes Ranum to task for this comment. Then an &quot;annoyed&quot; Ranum, replying in Risk Digest 23.14, claims he never wrote this!I'm pretty sure this was just an example of vagueness... but it's emblematic of what's wrong with this book, and it's exponentially moreso in the squishier political and governmental areas."},{"Title":"The Myth of Homeland Security","review":"The Myth of Homeland Security is an excellent debunking of the counter-terrorism security nonsense that we're all being forced to put up with. Marcus has written an honest, straightforward, sensible book. I don't agree with every point he makes, but it's refreshing to read someone who actually takes a stand on the issues and supports his stance with intelligent arguments and not rhetoric. The fact that this book is enjoyable to read is a bonus."},{"Title":"The Myth of Homeland Security","review":"As the range of opinions in this space suggest, Marcus is the sort of person who inspires a range of intense reactions in people. His book on homeland security will have the same effect -- whether his presentation of the situation offends or amuses, it's sure to make you think.We've all been impacted by the post-9/11 security strategies implemented by the federal Homeland Security initiatives, and we've probably all wondered what good those changes have made. Marcus has gone the extra step here, trying to collect &quot;the real dope&quot; about new laws and requirements and to discuss them in a relatively objective way. He didn't get very far, in most cases, and not for lack of effort. It's an eerie portent of the problems that Americans face in trying to balance the need for protection with the requirement for liberty and privacy.In collecting these questions and answers, Marcus has given us all an outline of how to evaluate the situation individually. He hasn't given us one single simple answer -- there isn't one -- but he's shown readers of all backgrounds a way to think critically about homeland security issues."},{"Title":"The Myth of Homeland Security","review":"I purchased and read this entertaining romp despite having skimmed it at the bookstore and reading this poor ad hominem argument:&quot;After watching the way the worldwide media and the international community reacted to the question of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, I don't think they'd see a smoking gun if you stuck it right against their foreheads.&quot; (p. 220)I purchased it anyway, because although I think that's an incredible feeble aside (Mr. Ranum doesn't bother to say what smoking guns he thinks have been established, and it seems clear as of this writing that there are no WMDs in Iraq, and no good evidence that there were any post-1994), elsewhere in my initial skimming I saw what looked to be very interesting information about the Homeland Security Act and the USA PATRIOT Act. Largely because of this material, I did find the book to be worth my time (if not quite worth the dollars I spent on it--I should have waited for a paperback edition).The book is definitely a polemic, not a researched and referenced scholarly tome--there are no references or footnotes, beyond the suggested further reading material on pp. xvi-xvii. There is much to disagree with besides the above example, as other reviewers here have noted. It's short on conclusions and suggested remedies, though there are a few radical (i.e., politically impossible) suggestions, such as abolishing the INS and starting over from scratch (probably not a bad idea at all).I recommend it for those interested in a lightweight, quick read to get a quick overview of the problems of securing an entire nation and the means that are being adopted with that alleged goal, but if you are looking for depth and detail, with solidly argued conclusions and recommendations, you'll need to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Myth of Homeland Security","review":"Let's set the record straight. This book is a 231 page political rant, regardless of the author's claim on p. 31 to be &quot;nonideological.&quot; I have the slightly odd benefit of reading this book with a master's degree in public policy on the wall, but I work as a hands-on, FreeBSD-running computer security consultant. I imagine many readers are also members of the technical community, yet are unaware of books addressing similar topics. &quot;The Myth of Homeland Security&quot; cannot compare to a serious book like James Q. Wilson's &quot;Bureaucracy: What Government Agencies Do and Why They Do It.&quot; I'll tell you why and conclude with my rationale for 4 stars, nonetheless.On p. xvi Ranum accurately reports &quot;I'm making some inflammatory observations.&quot; True enough. He repeatedly insults the media (p. 13), the FBI (pp. 22-23, 26, elsewhere), contractors, bureaucrats, pen testers -- you name it. He continues: &quot;I don't want you, the reader, to ignore the substance of what I have to say by getting bogged down in the details of my research. So I didn't quote sources.&quot; Political Science 101: quote your sources. Wilson gives 30 pages of endnotes to back up his arguments; Ranum gives zero.Some of his arguments are completely illogical. Ranum says on p. 3: &quot;conceiving a defense against a possible threat will automatically encourage someone to make that threat a reality.&quot; Hmm, so if someone bullet-proofs his car window, an enemy is going to buy a gun which can't possibly damage the car? You may disagree with me, but the following sentence (p. 4) shows Ranum doesn't know what he's talking about: &quot;The information warfare scare-hype gave birth to any number of organizations that build defensive information warfare capabilities -- as well as stimulating shadowy efforts to build offensive information weapons.&quot;This shows Ranum has no insight regarding national info ops capabilities. I served four years in info ops units in the Air Force. I can't reveal what I know (Ranum's laughing, I'm sure), but I can say the author is clueless on this topic. We get a confirming admission of this on p. 27: &quot;I don't know about the last few years, but as recently as 1996 I know the Pentagon's backbone network was un-firewalled.&quot; 1996? Hint: my last unit was officially created in 1999-2000. The world changes fast.So why do I give &quot;The Myth&quot; 4 stars? At least somebody is raising important issues. Ranum may be the crazy guy yelling crude remarks at a quiet moment during a political rally, but thank goodness he's there. It's great to see someone realize what a mess our appropriations process has become, and decide to join the fray. Political scientists spend their entire lives chipping away at the same problems. Welcome to the party, Mr. Ranum, and thanks for your work."},{"Title":"The Myth of Homeland Security","review":"Ranum's book is engaging, unsettling, entertaining, and disturbing. Yet, I think it is an accurate assessment of the morass that is \\"homeland security.\\" MJR may not make any friends in the FBI, INS, or DHS, but as he turns his keen analytical mind towards security issues broader than an area for which he is world-renowned -- computer and network security -- he brings clarity to this seemingly unfathomable topic.Many security practitioners have recognized the \\"when you don't know what to do, do something\\" aspect of some homeland security initiatives. Ranum identifies the agencies and actions that shape homeland security, and makes suggestions for change. Warning: Not everything is fixable, and he makes that clear also. But the beginning of any solution is to first recognize the real problems -- the real risks. The next step is to assess what you are already doing. The third is to toss out what is not working, reform what is marginal, and implement what is missing. In this book, Ranum suggests solutions.The security of the US homeland, and all that it entails, affects Americans, certainly, as well as the whole world. Mr. Ranum is a skilled writer and instructor. Never satisfied to merely lecture, he endeavors to \\"cause one to learn.\\" Though he is famous in a highly technical field, the \\"techie\\" as well as the \\"artsy\\" will be able to read this book, as Ranum makes the subject matter accessible and -- although the subject matter is \\"life and death\\" -- enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Myth of Homeland Security","review":"In this beautifully written book Ranum presents some very good points about the way we as a country are approaching homeland security. His experience in the information security field combined with his analytical and systematic approach to solving problems leads to some remarkable findings. The frightening terrorist experiences Americans have been through over the past few years have resulted in a distorted view of the organizations protecting our country - they've become our mental &quot;feel safe&quot; crutch. Ranum looks at the security problems our country faces and the current solutions with refreshingly new eyes - avoiding the distortion - and presents some very powerful insight. I wish I learned half this much from every book I read!This book is highly recommended for everyone, but it's a MUST read for one group of people: Americans. Get it, read it. It's one of the most interesting books I've read in a long time. This is definately one you'll be passing on to your friends."},{"Title":"The Myth of Homeland Security","review":"What a compelling book! Marcus Ranum takes the overwhelming topic of Homeland Security and addresses it in a format that is easy to read and understand. He uses stories, examples and humor to give the reader a snapshot of what Homeland Security is, and what it isn't. Admittedly, not all the issues Ranum discusses are &quot;fixable&quot;, but he offers many realistic solutions for improvement. He covers such subjects as daily life under Code Orange, immigration, airline security, intelligence, the media, and computer security.Ranum's expertise comes across with honesty, integrity and wit.

Overall, an instant classis.Everyone is infosec should read this."},{"Title":"The Myth of Homeland Security","review":"I'm sure Jefferson and the other Founders believed that intelligent and well-informed citizens would step forward to help the Republic in times of crisis. Such people would strip bare (some) of the hidden agendas. They would clarify complicated issues so that their fellow-citizens would be able to ask their vendors and politicians some hard questions. The electorate would be equipped to discount sensationalist news &quot;reports&quot;, and worry intelligently about real problems rather than illusions.Marcus Ranum has paid us the compliment of writing just such a work.I disagree with some of his points -- for example, I am unbothered by the feedback loop that reveals ever-more Microsoft security bugs -- but I think he's asking a lot of the right questions, and I think he does real public service when he asks, over and over again, why the government, a huge Inforation Technology consumer, doesn't have a more unified approach to buying and deploying IT products -- the sort of question everyone in Congress should be echoing.Marcus points out at least one real outrage in the PATRIOT Act that I'd never seen discussed elsewhere: a tax break called the &quot;Johnny Spann Patriot Trust&quot; seemingly aimed at the well-to-do in government -- it's just the sort of thing you might want to bring up the next time you encounter some government type saying that the PATRIOT Act is just fine as-is.The book is pitched for the non-technical citizen, and Marcus is at his best when he exposes some of the Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt tactics used by various players in the Information Security business to fatten their wallets.

They were great spectacles that were even looked forward to by the heathens back then. He would even organize sections of the hecklers in great, resounding, choruses of \\"for-ni-cation\\" and \\"lake-of-fire!\\" I believe he was even mentioned in an old edition of Rolling Stone for his notorious campus romps. I remember one wag who ranked evangelists on the length of their sylabification of the word \\"yeeeesssss\\" who considered brother Jed the tops. And then there was sister Cindy, too!I first saw a Jed Smock experience well over 20+ years ago. I have noticed that the quality and numbers of the hecklers has decreased over the years. Once the hecklers would get into the act with some novel retort or another, but the last time I saw him about 5 years ago, the hecklers were far more obnoxious and lame brained than in the grand old days. Perhaps one could say they were even more abrasive than Mr. Smock himself. This style of evangelical oratory, whether you like it or not, is a vanishing art form of Americana in this slick television age. Jed Smock's operation hearkens back to the old days of Holy Hubert. I was just amazed to find out in a google search that the ol' Smock was still kicking after all these years.Ah, free speach.

If you're going to argue with Jed in person, or if you're just interested in what he's all about, this is a neat book to have.Incidentally, if you don't know who Jed Smock is, the name of 'Brother Jed' is known on college campuses across the country. He's a 'born-again' fundimentalist christian who, along with others in his group, continually tour the grounds of several campuses in the northeast United States.

The book is interesting and a page turner.I give it 5 stars but, like one reviewer, I admit that is hard to decide whether it is a 1 or 5 star book. Depends on how you look at it. If Jed is your role model then the book is a 5. If you find Jed to be a hysterical religious bufoon and you are interested in learning more about him, this is a 5. If you don't agree with Jed's views or methods and don't find him to be entertaining, then this book is a 1.Jed brought me much amusement as a graduate student at OSU in the 1990s and I thank him for that. I believe he actually gave me a copy of this book (although it is possible that I paid him for it). I know he gifted me a couple of his theology books.

I started asking him questions and I made him feel stupid so he started walking away. I followed him all the way to his car, correcting his inaccurate statements about the Bible all the way.

He assumes every college professor is a socialist, and that they somehow all preach &quot;anti-american socialism propaganda&quot; to their classes.

This is certainly a unique portrait of St Francis, and it is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"St. Francis of Assisi","review":"G.K. Chesterton ranks high among the most entertaining and insightful Christian writers in history. His singular wit infuses his work bringing mirth to what might otherwise be solemnity. His style is playful, yet earnest and, though his era has passed, he remains as readable now as ever. Indeed, Chesterton resides not far behind the venerable CS Lewis as an icon of Christian literature. His St. Francis of Assisi proves no exception.Chesterton's intent is cleary not a comprehensive biography, but an introduction to the remarkable career of Francis Bernardone. The author hits only the highlights expecting these examples to accurately portray the whole. He easily succeeds. St. Francis of Assisi is a concise, enjoyable look at a saint who brought the principles of Christ back to a Catholicism which had long before started to wander. Read this and other works of Chesterton. You may find they all bear a 5-star ranking."},{"Title":"St. Francis of Assisi","review":"G.K. Chesterton is one of the best Christian writers of the twentieth century. Prolific and artistic, he had the knack for combining a classic British commentary sense to any historical Christian subject, making it both the object of cultural interest and often historic reverence. As St. Francis of Assisi was one of the primary influences on Chesterton's decision to convert to Roman Catholicism (Chesterton once described his conversion as being largely due to wanting to belong to the same institution that had produced St. Francis), it makes sense that Chesterton would devote considerable energies toward this biography.Chesterton said that there are essentially three ways to approach a biography of a figure such as St. Francis - one can be dispassionately objective (or at least as much as can pass for such a stance), looking at things from a 'purely' historical standpoint; one can go to the opposite extreme and treat the figure as an object of devotion and worship; or one can take a third path (and you've guessed correctly if you assumed this was Chesterton's route) of looking at the character as an interested outsider, someone in the modern world but still one involved in the same kinds of structures and virtues as the one being studied.Chesterton's prose is snappy and lively, witty and bit sardonic at times. Chesterton is not afraid to digress to make his own points, and like the intellectual critic who cannot contain the myriad of responses to particular points, Chesterton treats us to a generous collection of tangential observations. One discovers, for instance, Chesterton's opinion of modern British history (that it reads more like journalism than like a developed narrative) - he makes the observation that journalists rarely think to publish a 'life' until the death of the subject; this of course cannot be helped in the case of Francis of Assisi, but the method of the media serves to highlight the difference in world-view between then and now.This is a spiritual biography - it does not simply go from event to event in Francis' life, but rather looks as the development of his spirituality, his calling, his order and his influence in later church (and more general) history. In his discussion, he looks at miracles and poetic production, political realities and logical fallacies, ancient sentiments and present-day practices. Francis is seen in many ways as the Mirror of Christ (not quite the same thing as the WWJD fad of the current day, but approximating the sense in some regards), but this sets up an interesting logical situation - if Francis is like Christ, then Christ is in some ways like Francis. Chesterton points out the importance of the difference, likening it to the difference between creator and creature, but there is still the interesting development in history where some tried to make Francis a second Christ (something Francis himself would have opposed bitterly).Fun, fascinating, spiritual without succumbing to kitsch, intellectual without being overblown, this book is a classic on Francis, and a classic by Chesterton, a small miracle of Francis (in the many sense of the term)."},{"Title":"St. Francis of Assisi","review":"This book is written and crafted by a genius. What came in the mail was much more than merely a biography, this is a work of precision cultural criticism and wit which can be both pointed and beautiful at the same time.I love how Chesterton picks out his contemporaries or past thinkers and then tells us why they are wrong for thinking x. There is so much truth in this book-- I could go on and on about how relevant this work is to us in the 21st Century. When talking about Ancient Rome: \\"Thus the effect of treating sex as only one innocent natural thing was that every other innocent natural thing became soaked and sodden with sex\\" (21).What makes Chesterton so good, though, is that he is not parading merely his own opinion throughout the book-- he is speaking with the fullness of truth backing him up. The reader will experience what happens when Jn 8:32 is applied to literature: \\"the truth will set you free\\" and you will then be free to take down that which is not true-- and do it with style."},{"Title":"St. Francis of Assisi","review":"A friend of mine who is a devotee of Chesterton suggested reading this biography of St. Francis as a good way to acquaint myself with his writings. She is correct. This small book is packed full of interesting thoughts about the times and circumstances in which St. Francis lived and how he helped shape the late Middle Ages with his, for the time, novel and often shocking approach to Christian living. Chesterton's insights into the person of St. Francis are excellent. I highly recommend this to anyone who wishes to become comfortable with this fine author's writings."},{"Title":"St. Francis of Assisi","review":"Chesterton's book offers significant insights into St. Francis that make this book worth reading and owning. Chesterton eloquently identifies and expounds some of the paradoxes from Francis' life. He also highlights the truths of Francis' ministry and radical faith. There are many lines in this book that readers will want to review and appreciate.However, this is not as Chesterton claims an introductory book to the saint. I think that for this book to be read without frustration readers should have at least a cursory knowledge of the timeline of events in St. Francis' life and why he is considered the most perfect image of Christ that ever lived. If you approach this book expecting, as I initially was, an easy to grasp overview of Francis' life you will probably be left wondering what Chesterton is writing about and when he is going to tell you about Francis.Chesterton approaches Francis from dozens of different perspectives and eventually zeros in on the heart of Francis and the supernatural events that guided his life. Chesterton hits the highlights but does not go through Francis life in a simple manner.Before reading this book, I would suggest reading a simpler biography on Francis. Many of his biographers cull from St. Bonaventures \\"Major Life of Francis\\" or Thomas Celano's biography of Francis. These are ealy traditional biographies of Francis and would prepare readers for Chesterton's discussion that does offer value to any picture of Francis.Shakespeare On Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays"},{"Title":"St. Francis of Assisi","review":"This was a request for Christmas so I can only say that it was nice, new and made the recipient very happy to get it."},{"Title":"St. Francis of Assisi","review":"Chesterton captures how St. Francis fits into his own medieval time and how he follows the asceticism of the first 1100 or so years prior to his birth.

Chesterton's circuitous style of writing while passable in longer works gets annoying here particularly at moments when he goes off on long tangents. These tangents add something to the narrative, but by the time you arrive at their end you've already forgotten where you began from. The big chunks on the life of St. Francis are well done, quite honest and quite approachable, but the fact that they're interspersed with so much wandering text makes this a difficult book to read. There are better books on the life of St. Francis out there. For instance, although I've never read the English translation, the best Life of St. Francis that I have thus far read is El Hermano de As&iacute;s by Ignacio Larra&ntilde;aga."},{"Title":"St. Francis of Assisi","review":"For a book that's about 130 pages long, chesterton goes into excruciating detail. He makes references that most people could not understand including myself. This is a book written at a time for a time that never really existed. In other words, there are parts Chesterton says 'modern men cannot understand' not even himself... Why write the book if people will not be able to understand it. I recommend this book to those who have a read other books from similar authors with similar styles. I suggest downloading thesample first."},{"Title":"St. Francis of Assisi","review":"Great! This book begins with a description of St. Francis that is a bit difficult to understand but as you continue reading, the book is very insightful and inspiring."},{"Title":"St. Francis of Assisi","review":"Chesterton's purpose here is clearly to reclaim Francis for Orthodoxy, to keep him out of the clutches of the romantics, nature worshipers and new age disciples. As a result, he tends to minimize Francis's strangenes and radicalism. He seems determined to present him as a non-intellectual version of Thomas Aquinas; in other words, as a man who, in an intuitive way, personified and revitalized mainstream Catholicism. Chesterton's arguments are, as always, persuasive but only intermittently convincing. Ultimately, I think Francis had more in common with medieval &quot;heretics&quot; than with the mainstream church, and that the church decided to tolerate and coopt him because they knew that his popularity made persecuting him too dangerous. Chesterton does his best to defeat this argument, but ultimately he doesn't succeed.Having said this, I think the book is well worth reading. Francis is a fascinating subject no matter how he is approached, and Chesterton is always interesting. It would be nice, however, if he were just a little less clever. There are a few too many epigrams per page, to the point where you sometimes want to tell him to just shut up and get on with his story."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},q={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],E={key:0},W={key:1};function x(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),o("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",q,[(t(!0),o(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),o("span",W,"Loading...")):(t(),o("span",E,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const O=u(B,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-3d82003b"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/27.md","filePath":"glossary/27.md"}'),R={name:"glossary/27.md"},D=Object.assign(R,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(O)]))}});export{j as __pageData,D as default};
