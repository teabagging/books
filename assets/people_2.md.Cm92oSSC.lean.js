Hannibal is so poorly written that, for the first few chapters, I thought I'd been sent the unedited galleys of the novel by mistake. Harris moves back and forth through tenses more fluidly than Dr. Lecter's knife through one of his victim's gut. It's like the author couldn't decide if he was writing a schlocky screenplay or a novel. What's missing here is a serial killer, and the thrill of the chase - the most interesting thing in &quot;Dragon&quot; and &quot;Lambs&quot; was the suspense, the not-knowing what the hell was going to happen next. Even if you can overlook Harris's amateur prose, the plot is nearly non-existent. I'm going to have to reevaluate my respect for Stephen King (accident notwithstanding) after his praise for this novel in the NYTimes. By the time this book was over, I felt I'd been worked over by Mason Verger's swine. This book sucks."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It starts off somewhat slowly; Lecter doesn't even appear in the beginning. The pace picks up when Pazzi tries to catch Lecter, and from then on in I couldn't put the book down. And the ending ... all I can say is Wow. Got to the back cover, placed the book on my couch and literally said, &quot;Holy s***&quot;. That's how amazing it was"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I saw Silence of the Lambs, but I haven't read the previous two Hannibal Lechter novels. Hopefully, the old books were better than this one. Hannibal was a shaky rollercoaster of inconsistent plots, unnecessary graphical content (not the cannibalism - other events) and an ending not worthy of a second-rate comic book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is the 615th review so I doubt it'll get much exposure, but I felt the need to defend Harris a little here. OK, I'll have to agree that there's a plausibility problem with the final outcome; Starling's character did seem to become a little cartoonish. I did get the feeling that Harris decided to finalize the draft with some haste. He probably had a great deal of pressure on him to finish. Maybe he's playing with us a little because of the incredible hype and anticipation over the release of this novel. Still, I thought the imagery was up to Harris standards, the pacing was great, and I generally had a good time reading it. It wasn't as enjoyable as the first two novels in the trilogy, the characterization not being as strong or as dimensional, but I got over the small disappointment of the not-so-likely ending pretty quickly."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What I found most interesting in this book was its scrambling of our expectations for heros. The italian investigator Pazzi and the Justice department hack Kremmler are the truly evil ones, as justified by their simple self aggrandizing schemes. Lecter, in contrast, ever the individualist, merely seeks self fulfillment through his &quot;taste&quot; for the finer things in life, among which are included Clarice Starling. His never ending quest is simple enjoyment of his private pleasures, which are compatible with, and often require him to rid the world of the rude and the boorish. Privacy and individualism are threatened by government (a corrupt FBI and political system), and big business as given a figurehead with Mason.That said, Starling seemed to me to be the central character of the novel, whose theme is her awakening to and acceptance of the vision of reality as provided by Lecter. Very bizarre, but more funny than sick.&quot;Hannibal&quot; was more interesting than &quot;Silence&quot;, but not as thrilling (and both were far better than &quot;Red Dragon&quot;). The disjoint first part in Italy could have been a separate novel. A good read, I'm really curious how they'll do the movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A poorly written story with an unbelivable ending that betrays the integrity of the characters and insults the intellegence of the reader. I now CAN wait for the film to come out. Biggest letdown of the year."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"One of the best novels I've read in many a moon, and I've read them all. Florence and Mason Verger were evoked so vividly in the book that while I was reading, a movie was playing in my head. The readers who gave this book 1 star reviews must be nuts -- RED DRAGON was oatmeal compared to HANNIBAL's rich polenta."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Take the worst books of Anne Rice, Mary Higgins Clark, and Stephen King (that's a lot of books!).

Blend for ten years. Serve chilled, in an expensive decanter.And now the remedy: Stephen Dobyns' &quot;The Church of Dead Girls&quot;, Ian McEwan's &quot;The Comfort of Strangers&quot;, Patrick McGrath's &quot;Asylum&quot;, or Iris Johansen's &quot;Long After Midnight.Mr."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I could have lived with the ending to Hannibal, had the rest of the book EARNED something so weird. As it is, it's an &quot;American Psycho&quot; ending, ridiculious, stupid and caculated to cause a &quot;buzz&quot; among readers."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Definately not as good as Silence Of The Lambs or Red Dragon. It started slow and the ending was pathetic, but the middle made up for those shortcomings. I think Mr. Harris could have done better on the ending, and stayed whithin the realm of possibility for both the sociopathic and the &quot;normal&quot; personalities, instead of having the two meet halfway. All in all, though, it was a decent book, and a decent finish to the Hannibal Lecter saga."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I found _Hannibal_ gripping, finishing it in two days and ruining at least one good night's sleep. The plot was well paced, the graceful descriptions wasted not a detail. The writing engaged every sense (sometimes against my will), planting images, smells, sounds, and tastes in my mind that will linger.I liked the fact that there were others in the book possibly more evil, certainly more hypocritical, than Lecter. Harris persuades us to meditate on the nature of evil and its origins. Unlike others, I don't find the revelation of Lester's childhood trauma a disappointment, since I don't think it's meant to explain his adult behavior completely - Lecter is far more complex than that.Many have compared this novel unfavorably with Harris' earlier works. Since this is the only Harris I've ever read, I can only say that I thought the characters were pithily described, and (with the possible exception of Starling) they behaved as consistently as real-life people ever do. The Svengali touch at the end was hard to believe over the long term, though there's a certain poetry to it.Having seen the Lambs movie, I liked the reappearances of certain characters, particularly the way Barney was fleshed out. However, I was hoping for more from Sammie.I found it somewhat jarring that Harris kept switching back and forth between the present and past tense - jarring, but intriguing. It made me think of a certain verb construction used in the original language of the Gospels (so I rememember from the comments in my NAS Bible), used to highlight significant incidents by describing them in the present tense. With all Harris' Biblical references, this parallel may have been intentional. At the least Harris' style does the have the effect of keeping the reader in the moment.One minor beef: like so much in print these days, this book suffered from a handful of typos. I find this hard to excuse in something that surely was read several times during the publishing process.A disturbing, unforgettable read, leaving no justifiable room for a sequel - I hope Harris will close the curtain here."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"HAnnibal is a great book period. The only thing it lacks is a relavent, realistic ending. I enjoyed the book emensly, yet I was not pleased by the pitiful ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Clearly the worst of the Lechter trilogy. Poorly paced and plotted, crummy finale."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book is fast paced, the first chapter jumps in to the story without delay. Harris practically takes your hand and leads you through the lives of Hannibal, Agent Starling and others. The only problem I found wrong with the book was that Hannibal's character was superficial. Although he was not meant to show his feelings, I still thought he needed to show some kind care for something in his little world. Although shocked I was glad with the ending of the story, it was different yet sweet and fulfilling taking in Harris' words."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This was a twisted book. There are no bad guys/good guys in the traditional sense. The characters were not clearly defined. If you liked &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, skip this one."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Poor Thomas Harris. Silence of the Lambs was a great book and a hard act to follow. But still, we all hoped.....and he failed us miserably. His embarrassment must be overwhelming. Besides poor writing and a most convoluted story line, Mr. Harris has assailed our intelligence with a most ridiculuous ending -completely unbelievable. I can't remember being so disappointed in a novel. I hope the author takes up a new profession."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I believe there are one hundred chapters in this book (give or take a few). My advice is to read the first 99 chapters and write your own ending. You would undoubtedly come up with a more plausible and satisfying chapter. I was intrigued with the majority of the book and interested in the progression of the story. I must agree with other reviewers, however, regarding the disappointment I felt when Harris attempted to put meaning and victimization behind Lecter's evil. Lecter was infinitely more monstrous when his motives were shrouded in mystery. Simply said, I wish I had closed the book before the final chapter. If I had, I would have left it without such a bitter taste in my mouth."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read both Dragon and Lambs and was terrified. I didn't find Hannibal scary in the least. The descriptions sounded like a 12 year old boy trying to &quot;gross people out&quot; by talking about bodily functions at the dinner table. I thought the ending was improbable and silly."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"EVERY ONE HAS A RIGHT TO HIS/HER OPINION. BUT CONTRARY TO SOME OF THE EARLY REVIEWS, I ENJOYED THIS NOVEL. I'VE READ &quot;RED DRAGON&quot; AND &quot;SILENCE OF THE LAMBS&quot;. (I OWN BOTH FILMS). HARRIS TO ME DID NOT ROMANTICIZE LECTER. WHO SAID SERIAL KILLERS HAD TO BE CLASS-LESS BEINGS,WHO LOOK LIKE LON CHANEY'S &quot;PHANTOM OF THE OPERA&quot;? HANNIBAL'S CHARACTER WAS UNDER DEVELOPMENT IN &quot;LAMBS&quot;. NOW WE KNOW HOW THAT EVIL CAME TO BE. KRENDLER AND PAZZI SURE COULDN'T THROW ANY STONES! CAN'T WAIT FOR THE FILM!!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was quite surprised by the mixed reviews on this book. However, I did not let that stop me from buying it. I finished this book in one day and I was not disappointed. As the title of the book denotes, it is about Hannibal Lector the free man. This is the main difference between the new novel and it's predecessors. The prior novels only give glimpses of what Hannibal was like in normal life. The new novel allows us to look inside the killer as he exists in society. He turns out to be an amazingly suave, cultured and likeable character. Which allows Mr. Harris to lead his readers into a moral quagmire. Why do we find it satisfying when Hannibal attacks his enemies and escapes? If we don't mind Lector's previous crimes then we shouldn't protest the novel's climax. Clarice Starling has also returned in this novel. Unlike Lector, life has not been successful for her. This is one of the main complaints about the novel. A lot of readers are upset that she is somewhat of a failure. I found this justifiable since it was Lector who gave her her initial success. Which as it turns out was all in his plan. Perhaps Hannibal set her up for failure. Such heroic success for a rookie was bound to create enemies. One of whom has made it his life's pursuit to keep Clarice from promotion. Another point, Clarice gave part of herself to Hannibal for her success. In essence she allowed the serial killer to know her fatal flaw. This allows Dr. Lector to finally collect his prize. The novel's other characters complement the two leads nicely. The writing structure is elegant and romantically gothic. If you are a fan of the previous novels then I would urge you to read this book. Keep an open mind while reading and you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The writing is disjointed and at times difficult to follow. The ending was very predictable and stupid. The last chapter would have been sufficient. The rest was nonsense. Many characters, such as the Margot character, were unnecessary and cluttered up a dumb storyline."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I devoured Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, but Mr. Harris went with Hollywood on Hannibal. Instead of the rich characters found in his 2 latter books - we have the wooden character of Jodie Foster's Clarice in Hannibal and a lackluster story.I normally cannot put Mr. Harris' books down. I had to push myself to read this one. I was disappointed from chapter one on.I missed the rich earthy descriptions of the characters, the hypnotic story line that usually comes with Mr. Harris' books - you know the kind - where you start with page 1 and can't put it down till you finish. This book was lackluster,farfetched and totally Hollywood. I felt as if it was written in 3000 hours not 3000 days as he says on his website."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This was a truly unbelievable! How could an author that has written two such compelling books drop this quickly. This book did not live up to the wait. I was truly impressed with both Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. Silence of the Lambs is one of the best books that I have read and Red Dragon is better. I could not imagine that Harris would/could go this flat.Hannibal is a two part book: 350 pages of introduction that is boring, uninteresting and unimaginative and then a 100 page ending that begins to approach the first two books if not for the completely unrealistic and completely innane ending.Right up to the point that Lecter and Starling &quot;share&quot; a meal with Krendler, I was holding out hope that Harris would salvage the book. Other than the somewhat comical relationship between Barney and Margot, there was no content of note.Both Dragon and Lambs were believable. Both of them were riveting as you contemplated the depth of depravacy and horror that Harris worte of. I could see Hannibal Lecter...and I could believe in his existence. In this book, he is superhuman and ridiculous.Save your money."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The erratic narrative style of HANNIBAL is much more jarring than the (deliberately) preposterous ending. Harris shifts willy-nilly from the conventional third-person, omniscient narrator to a present tense that doesn't necessarily rely on complete sentences (a la James Ellroy and all too many imitators), and then this weird first-person-plural stuff. Traditionally, this is where an editor would step in and say &quot;Thomas, the voice of this book jumps around a little too much, why don't you take it back for a couple of months and smooth it out?&quot; Needless to say, there was no financial incentive to do so. The violence in HANNIBAL sets no records -- it's no more offensive than the splatterpunk that has been floating around elsewhere for 10 or 15 years -- but when you find yourself wondering &quot;Is Jodie Foster going to agree to do this?&quot; then it's pretty clear this book is as much a script treatment as a horror novel. There's a problem with the idea of Clarice Starling getting reprimanded for the opening shootout of the book, too -- Starling took down a heavily armed, known felon who ignored repeated instructions to freeze. Her actions would be considered justifiable by any law-enforcement agency in the nation."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"2-1/2 stars. If you're into getting a cheap thrill from reading about the gruesome acts committed by Lecter, then this book will probably be fine for you. But if you love the character of Starling and her unusual relationship with Lecter, this book is going to let you down. Starling is little more than a plot device here: she has almost no control over her fate, and what little control she exerts is eventually taken away from her. We find out some background about Lecter's childhood, but knowing this doesn't enrich his character; on the contrary, it diminishes it. The first half of the book shows promise and is quite entertaining. In one scene, Lecter reacts to being pickpocketed with lightning speed and deadly ruthlessness, making him ever more frightening. But you can basically take the middle third of the book and throw it away. It comes from nowhere, and it goes nowhere. Up to now, Lecter has been one of the best fictional characters of the last 10-20 years in my opinion, but his actions at the end of the book (no, I won't give away the ending) are just silly. What happens to Starling's arch nemesis is also silly. Disgusting and silly. And predictable. All the loose ends are tied up much too neatly. And finally, I just don't buy the very end of the book. I can't see any way that would have happened. What a letdown when two characters act completely, well, out of character."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was all that I had hoped it would be. The fear factor and plot progression build at an alarming pace several times through the book. The third party descriptions in the narative of the good Doctors antics give an interesting diversion from the rest of the writing and give yo a feeling that you are looking down on the action. This book will disturb, it disturbed me, but the over the top writing made it all worth while."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Maybe he should have given it another 11 years to work out the atrocious writing. This book is boring and poorly written, and what's up with the ending?! &quot;RD&quot; and &quot;SotL&quot; were both great, finely-drawn examples of psychological thrillers. &quot;Hannibal&quot; is pointless."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I cannot believe this book was even written by the same author. This book was only gruesome (as opposed to the chilling and intriguing psychological drama of his former book) and gratuitous. The author attempts to make Hannibal more sympathtic by introducing a character even MORE creepy and reprehensible than Lector. The character of Clarice is a disappointment and a joke; there is NO WAY this will be made into a movie as Jodie Foster would REFUSE to reprise her role given the absolutely awful and totally laughable ending. A waste of time and money... don't bother. I am sorry I did."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"An average story with an absurd ending. Silence of the Lambs was great but it's hard to believe he waited so long to write a sequel like this. The previous reviewer said it best, I felt cheated. The story of Hannibal and Starling deserved better."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I don't read thriller novels on the average. I do like pageturners as I call them, but not on a regular basis. However, I read &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; and I was extremely surprised by it and Harris. It made me want to read &quot;Hannibal&quot; as soon as I could. Harris is such a writer if ignored you would miss quite a lot. Hannibal Lector has to be one of the most complicated characters ever created. Is he evil? Is he sort of good? Is he in the middle? His attitude and interest in Starling seem to suggest that he can't be labeled in black and white terms. He does have a vigilate like presence in fighting the truly bad and corrupt characters that &quot;hannibal&quot; further explores. Besides Mason as the clear bad guy in the novel, other character's like the greedy Italian Police chief that tries to arrest Hannibal for the reward, justice seems to be served in the end. Usually, the title character of a novel is the character the novel revolves around. It was confusing, yet suspenseful as you expected him to appear at any moment. I like all the &quot;extras&quot; as some other reviewers mention. Hannibal is certainly a very well educated character, going against the typical (whatever that is) serial killer or however you want to label him. He speaks Italian fluently. He is a good cook. (just don't ask what (or who) you're eating) Flat characters are few in this novel. For readers wanting a novel like &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, read &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. For another well written and interesting novel read &quot;hannibal&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'd say not to waste your time, however, the ending is soooo bizarre, you should read it to know what I mean. Harris did an incredible job in creating a monster so equally as terrifying as Hannibal, you honestly can't decide which villian is more deserving of death. 3/4 of the book was gripping, but, the Hannibal/Clarice Starling conclusion left me...well, feeling cheated."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book kept me on the edge . However the last chapter was a let down for the whole book. I put my copy in the trash."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was a big disappointment to me. I usually have a high tolerance for bad writing and giant plot gaps in thrillers. They're beach reads - I'm not expecting Hemmingway. However, this book really pushed the limits of my tolerance. I've enjoyed some of the author's other books, so I expected it to be a fast-paced, nice escape from the daily grind. Instead, I got a painfully slow, unbearably boring tome. Part of the problem is that these characters are familiar to you from his other book (not to mention a good movie adaptation). What they do in this story is not credible - or interesting. Don't buy it just because you liked the first one...better off finding something else."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was a big disappointment to me.

It lacks any of the intense physiological horror we had anticipated. Maybe we'd been spoiled by Silence of the Lambs, but this sequal is slow,tedious, far-fetched and seems its only connection to its predecessor is the character's names! Too bad, it had such potential.If it was just any horror book I'd give it a &quot;C&quot;, but as the sequal to a master...don't bother!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"...consider that Harris puts the eponymous Dr. Lecter into an historic perspective [that of Renaissance Firenze] which he does quite well. He also has clearly studied philosophy and psychology, which might surprise even his fans, as his deceptively simple style seems, well, unsophisticated until you try to write that way yourself and realise it's quite hard. However, I must agree in the final analysis with the majority who find the seduction of Starling to be incomprehensible. I'd have found it easier to believe if he had killed her, or vice versa. I might have ruined the ending for the reader, had other reviewers not done likewise. In any case, the portrayal of evil not merely in history but in the US government bureaucracy [which is where I daresay most of us have seen it first-hand] is an achievement that a not-quite-believable ending does not quite erase."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Then again, if you haven't read anything by Thomas Harris, don't read it either. The first 300 pages or so were delightful. You were allowed, nay, drawn into Hannibal Lectors mind. You saw how he thought, you were shown how he lived. Starling had little to do with the story in the beginning, it centered mostly on Hannibal, and I liked that. Then all of a sudden, it switched courses. And not in a good way. I'm a fan of Thomas Harris, and if you want something good of his to read, try Red Dragon, Black Sunday, and (of course) Silence of the Lambs. Thomas Harris started out with a pretty decent book, but it didn't end that way for some reason. This book tarnishes the characters, all of them. From Barney and Crawford, to Starling and Hannibal. Oh, and I can't believe what happened to John Bringham. I liked him."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"5 stars for the first 80% of the book and 1 star for the last 20% for an unweighted average of 3 stars. The end seemed illogical and contrived and probably anatomically incorrect. Some parts towards the end were totally out of character and difficult to believe. Weirdest ending since the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey (what really happened in the end of that movie anyway?) It appears that the ending was written either to 1) give an O. Henry-like totally unexpected surprise twist; or 2) prepare for the sequel to this book. They will probably have a different ending in the movie anyway - at least I hope so. Why did they change the very good ending of Red Dragon to the mediocre gratuitously violent ending in the movie Manhunter?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The ending is disturbing, but it makes sense. Clarice Starling is left vulnerbale with Hannible, not only physically, but spiritually. She's been crushed by the institution she loved. All of her notions of 'self' have been tossed up into the air, and on the way down Hannibal captures them; he pieces them together in a way that pleases 'him'. The ending isn't about love, it's about control. Why would Hannibal eat Clarice, when he could attempt the consumption of her soul?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"When I began to read &quot;Hannibal&quot;, I was skeptical. I'd read a synopsis of the plot and felt a little derisive. But this book is so well written, the threads woven so artfully, that I loved reading the story. Though the plot was a bit over-the-top, the skillfull story-telling drew me in and I didn't mind any of the unrealistic qualities.I even enjoyed the unsettled feeling the ending left me with. I've enjoyed turning that ending over and over in my mind like an object, trying to figure out all of its angles...trying to understand its nature, and isn't that exactly the draw of a sociopathic cannibal like Dr. Lector?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have to say, I did like this book, which seems a marked contrast to everyone else who read it. I agree that the ending was a bit weird (but I, unlike others, will not disclose it) and a bit out of character, especially for Starling, but it was wonderful to have more information about Dr. Lecter personally. I've seen the complaint that Harris reduced Dr. Lecter down to mere influences as explanation for his actions (the New York Times review, I think), and I've seen people say that there was no insight given at all. I think it was somewhere in between. While some information about his past was disclosed, it certainly didn't explain him, and what would that have solved if it did? I think, all in all, the only part that I didn't like was the lack of an explanation as to the change in Starling at the end. It seemed to be coming as the plot went on, and even somewhat in Silence of the Lambs, but a better explanation would have been nice."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Mixed feelings:My impression during the first 100 pages or so was that this was written like a screenplay or movie treatment. I was engaged, but bothered that the writing wasn't as taut and action as unpredictable as in previous novels.Scan through the reviews - most are 5 stars or 1 star. They either love it or hate it. Unfortunately, I feel both ways! I loved reading it for the most part: I became interested in the newer characters while hoping for more on others (Ardelia, are you up for being a title character?); I (minority member) enjoyed the vivid descriptions of Florence and food; and like everyone else I couldn't wait to see what would happen when Agent Starling caught up with the slippery doctor after all these years. That leads us to the part I hate: I will never be excited about these two people again! They changed in ways that make them boring compared to who they were at the end of SOL. Oh, the ending, yes it was hard to take and very surreal, but I choose to think that it will be like the tv show &quot;Dallas&quot;, where what's-her-name wakes up to find out that Bobby is alive and in the shower and the previous season was a dream. Mr. Harris will explain this madness in another book, just as he explained (!?!) Lecter's madness in this one.Most disturbing thing: In Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, Will Graham and Clarice Starling are guided by a strong moral center, a compulsion to do the right thing and be true to themselves regardless of danger, etc. Clarice's character, as written in SOL and in this book, didn't seem sufficiently broken by her bad experiences to undergo the drastic change that we see in the final chapters.In all it is good read with some unpleasant and unsatisfying moments, but I think these people who are hysterical and screaming for zero stars ought to remember what kind of fiction they are reading. If you get too obsessed with a character like Lecter, exquisite creation that he is, what does it say about your objectivity as a reader? This is not a sacred text. Glance back over it and you'll surely find more to like than dislike.Just one more note: Everyone is talking about the Hannibal books, but Black Sunday is a terrific read as well."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After finishing &quot;Silence&quot; and &quot;Red Dragon&quot; I felt like I should sleep with the lights on. &quot;Hannibal&quot; completely lacks that quality. There just is no tension, no palpable sense of menace in this book. That's the biggest let-down.And the ending? Clarice deserved better."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is a novel with suspense, action, and complex plot. The two previous novels centered on FBI profilers with Dr. Lector as an interesting side theme - i.e. they dealt with more or less normal human beings. The focus of this novel is the abnormal human being.For us &quot;normal&quot; beings, it requires a careful reading with an open mind. The reader is rewarded with a consistent plot that has more than its share of excitement and human depravity."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"the people who reviewed in a negative way do not know a good text when they come across it.what exactly were you looking for? It was well written, and had so much excitement.maybe you previous readers just had no clue."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The strength and fascination of the Lecter and Starling characters disappear into oblivion. The story just fades to gray and lacks all credibility. Even the humor is trite. If I'd skipped the ending I wouldn't have missed a thing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I really enjoyed this book until the last few chapters. What was that all about? I kind of liked the idea of Ledter having Krendler for dinner since I hated him from the beginning, but since when can someone talk to others while a part of their body is removed? That whole sequence at Lecter's home was really bizzarre. I actually found myself laughing out loud during the dinner with Krendler sequence. The ending was one of the worst ending I have ever read in my life, and I think that if Hannibal is made into a film, it will do a great dishonor to its predecessor &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;. Overall, I was disappointed, but mainly because of the last few chapters."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This novel was shocking, as evinced by the confused, angry reviews around this one. But it was rich, and subtle...it just doesn't lead you around like the previous books. People are complaining that Hannibal &quot;wouldn't do that!&quot; or Starling &quot;isn't like that!&quot; but dear readers, Mr. Harris knows who his characters are. He knows, and displays, what pushes them, and how they run. Please don't be so simple; these events require a bit more thought, is all."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This was a roller coaster ride through the mind of Hannibal Lector. I kept reminding myself that this was a book, and not a movie. I couldn't hide my eyes during the scarey parts! The graphic accounts of the revenge were almost too much for my mind to absorb. And the ending was, well...disturbing to say the least, but thought provoking. I doubt that the movie will do the book justice, except for Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hannibal. That is who I see when I picture Hannibal. It's a &quot;gotta read&quot; if you're a Hannibal fan. Just read the other two books first if you have not already...Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs, then Hannibal, or you'll be confused."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The first 200 pages are really great--I was on the edge of my seat. However, from that point on I just felt that the situations and reactions of the characters grew increasingly unbelievable until the ending which left me sitting with a 'yeah right' expression.I've heard Jodie Foster passed on the film. after reading the last 100 pages, I know why."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is an extraordinarily exquisite book. I found myself engrossed in it within minutes. You would never predict the ending either, which is common for Thomas Harris. I have seen the movie remake of \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" and found it intriguing. When I heard of a sequel, I bought the \\"Book-on-Tape\\" version, I really have no time. This book is riddled with suspense, action, and even drama. Along with what you would expect from a book named \\"Hannibal\\", an open window into Dr. Hannibal Lector's Mind Palace. Please e-mail me to discuss this book further."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book completely loses the flavor(excuse the pun) of &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. Be prepared to suspend all disbelief about Starlings character and get ready for her to act completely contrary to the gutsy and self-contained woman we admired in the previous novel. I think Thomas Harris wrote this book so he could have a sequel for a movie deal. I would have given it a 0 star if that option had been available."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The previous novel's ending had left us wondering what frightful havoc would be wrought by a &quot;free&quot; Hannibal Lecter. We were all expecting him to roam the world like a deadly virus, surfacing at random locations to execute spectacular acts of horror, striking at will, and then ducking back under some cleverly planned anonimous cover. We imagined he would always remain one step ahead of the frustrated authorities, mocking them with his superior intelligence and skills.Well, the novel Hannibal confounds all expectations. Author Thomas Harris shows us Lecter trying to lead a &quot;protective cover&quot; existence: a quiet, un-dynamic life, devoted to an unashamedly pedantic appreciation of literature, fine arts, and fine foods.In this instalment, the drama and the horror are instigated by Mason Verger, a disfigured multi-millionaire who has a personal vendetta agenda against Lecter. In this novel, the FBI and its agents are relegated to being Verger's pawns; they're depicted as low-brows, petty and gray and infighting gumshoes.The finale veers into improbable territory; the horror moments are few and underwhelming; much attention is given to scholarly cultural details.Clearly, the Lecter series is undergoing some sort of transition. What will happen next?The best case is that Hannibal is meant to set up the reader for a major plot &amp; character shift in the next novel. Middle case, Mr. Harris The harsher view is that the author has come under the sway of Hollywood $ and is"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Please ignore the negative reviews this book has gotten in the press from the politically correct and those who just don't get it. This is an instant classic. It's a mesmerizing meditation on corruption and what really *is* evil in an absurd world. Yes, it's very dark, but you will be stunned by the wisdom you find when you come through it. Like the best fiction, it rearranges the way you look at things."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Great book...until the end. Lame, twisted, stupid, rushed, out-of-ideas, out-of-character ending. Drugs and hypnosis? I think it would have worn off before the &quot;Buenos Aires, three years later...&quot; Jodie Foster ain't reprising her role not because the paycheck is too small, but because her character goes off the deep end. Good for Foster. I heard they're changing the ending for the movie anyway. Let's hope it's better than the ending in the book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"To echo the sentiments of many previous reviewers, Hannibal was one of the most disappointing books I have ever read, given Harris's previous masterpieces, Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon.The book fails in three unforgivable ways: (1) Harris makes Clarisse Starling (Jodie Foster for those who have seen but not read Silence of the Lambs) act totally out of character; (2) Harris inexplicably gives us the reasons why Hannibal Lechter became insane; and (3) the plot is boring.Since many other reviewers have also expressed the same disgust for Starling and since a detailed description would involve ruining the book's conclusion, I will not go into that failure further, but refer readers to previous reviews.The second failure of this book, Harris's explanation of Hannibal's insanity is terrible because it takes the scariness away from the series. The Hannibal Lechter series worked in the first few books in large part because of the incredibly frightening thought that an extraordinarily intelligent, witty, well-educated professional is also, inexplicably, a monster of unspeakable proportions. In this book, Harris is turned into a run-of-the-mill maniac whose past explains his present actions. Instead of the psychological fear we had of Lechter, the only scary things in this book is the violence wrought by Hannibal.This is even more unforgivable because Harris shows us how wonderful a writer he can be when he describes Hannibal's intelligence, as opposed to his insanity. The description of Hannibal's intelligence is beautiful, imaginative and intriguing, while the description of how Hannibal became insane is dull.Which brings us to my last criticism: the book as a whole is boring. Although the violence scenes are well-written, the main plot, having to do with the search for Hannibal by the Clarisse and the authorities and by a former victim of Hannibal bent on revenge is uninteresting and shows off none of Harris's considerable abilities as a writer. Finally, because of Harris's decision to devote so much time to the horrible ending involving Clarisse's startling metamorphosis, Harris gives short shrift to the plot, having it come to a climax before the plot even has a chance to become interesting. Therefore, I suggest you skip this book and hope that Harris's next book is better."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Excellant book! I won't give away the details, but I think the scariest part isn't about Dr. Lecter being a cannibal on the run (from monsters worse than him!), it's the fact that by the end of the book you find yourself rooting for him! I thought the ending was superb, even if it was abit unbelieveable. I can't wait for the movie next year!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book epitomizes all that is wrong in our current culture. Poor plotting, the &quot;sensation&quot; of mutilation, cannibalism. murder, and sadism all dressed up with dashes of gourmet information, psychiatric BS, and gratuitous horror. The ending is so ridiculous and so morally repugnant that it offends us in every area of our humanity: physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. The terrible pity is that this author CAN write (I enjoyed every one of his previous books) but chose to turn into a literary Maplethorpe with &quot;Hannibal.&quot; Don't waste your time or money."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I promise I will not reveal the ending but let me say.....whatever! What a let down. Although I loved that we got to know Dr. Lecter but why would Mr. Harris do what he did? I realize that &quot;yes it's only a book&quot;, but I have waited years to find out what happens to all these characters. I cannot believe that this was how he chose to leave these people!! I found the part in Italy (forgive me) but boring untill right before we leave Italy, and the ending...AAARRGG!! I hope in another decade there will be an explanation for this book as well!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The newest addition to Harris' series is well-crafted, nicely paced and a good read --especially if you know what to expect from a Hannibal the Cannibal tale. The narrative is filled with imagery of exquisite sensory experiences in art, food (no not THAT) and fine wine interspersed with cavalier descriptions of horrific brutalities. The horror is served up on a platter of cultivated sensitivity and fear. It's great stuff but the ending is truly mystifying. I'm left with more questions than answers.....do you smell a sequil in the air? MEK"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After the masterpiece that was Silence of the Lambs, I was going nuts waiting for Morbidity of the Soul/Hannibal to come out. Needless to say, I got it the day it came out and finished it within the week.The book is VERY good, but pales in comparison to SOTL and makes you wonder what took so long for this book to get written. Harris tells a very interesting story that lacks the verbal duels b/t Starling and Lechter in SOTL and the last 40 or so pages are a letdown in my opion (others I've talked with loved the ending).If you are a fan of Red Dragon and SOTL, you have to read this book and it's well worth your time. If you haven't read them....read them first then tackle this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A trip through the vast chambers of Lecters mind. You can feel his breath on your neck, his elegance and manners in every encounter. &quot;Hannibal&quot; lets us see the side to Lecter we dare to discover. Human suffering and emotions. Excellent read, intelligent writing, simply mesmerizing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading Silence of the Lambs I often thought what would happen in the next one. Rumours surrounded the book for years and finally it is out. It has outlived all expectations and the twists and turns at the end are unpredictable. It's a must read for all Horror fans."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs I was really looking forward to the sequel. This book is a waste. A plodding plot, gore galore and a finish that is &quot;bloody unlikely&quot;. Major surgery will be required to transform this sludge to the big screen. Bring back Will. (I would give this a &quot;dog&quot; if available as a voting option.)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"You have got to be kidding me. A decade of waiting for this. Hannibal being on the next MIR mission would have been a more believable ending than what we got. I wish I knew Thomas Harris's address so I could mail the book back to him for a refund."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book is brilliant and wicked. I do not understand the objections being raised. exactly what do people expect when they buy a book about a mad cannibal? The Hardy Boys? We now know that the good doctor is a modern vampire and he has made poor Claire his companion forever -- and we do not know that she is unhappy. Harris (if indeed he wrote the book) is a wicked, perhaps evil man. Remember the scene in the torture exhibit in Florence, when the good doctor enjoyed looking not at the instruments of torture but at the flushed faces of the audience? Does it occur to anyone that we, the readers, are those sick, drooling fools? I am surprised by all those who are denouncing the book. Let us recall that Thomas Harris has not been seen in some years. Is it possible that the good doctor has, shall we say, disposed of him, and written here his own autobiography? If so, I would not be criticizing the book, because the doctor is easily offended by bad taste, and he might come calling. ###"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After a fast paced, cinematic opening the book slows to a crawl and barely creeps. Harris exchanges plot for a romp through the grotesque that freezes the action rather than pushes it onward. I started the novel delighted to be meeting old friends but finished it feeling my time had been wasted, as had the characters. Enough has already been said about the ending. If this scrambled narrative moves to the movies it will need some serious rewrites with an eye to widening the lense beyond the freakish. Its now a modern Dracula story that left this reader feeling drained, not by the horror but by the effort to maintain hope that the writing would ultimately redeem the storyline. No such luck. If this was a meal I'd send it back to the kitchen."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is as bad as it gets. This follow-up to the classic, superbly written &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and the brilliant &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; falls unbelievably and painfully flat. This book is regrettably almost excrutiating to read for anyone other than the most ardent Harris fan.An extraordinarily plodding and boring narrative and one of the most implausible and lurid plots that I have ever had the misfortune of reading.I cast my copy of this God-awful book to the swines. I don't even think that swine that haven't been fed for three days would read this drivel.Do yourself a favor and save your money; don't buy this book. Re-read &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and once again remember what an extraordinarily beguiling and engrossing experience reading can be."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Perhaps potential readers who are only familiar with the characters of Lecter and Starling from the movie, should wait for the movie of &quot;Hannibal&quot;.Since Thomas Harris' defined the &quot;serial-killer&quot; thriller genre with &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, readers (and movie audiences) have been deluged with a glut of inferior rip-offs (&quot;Seven&quot;, Patricia Cornwell, Chris Carter, etc., etc.). So much so that the Creator of the trend, Harris himself, probably decided 'enough was enough'.&quot;Hannibal&quot; is first and foremost a comment by Harris on the phenomenon of &quot;serial killer as celebrity&quot;. And a very darkly comic one, it is. If you don't have a sense of humor (and irony) don't read &quot;Hannibal&quot;.If you are literal-minded, don't read &quot;Hannibal&quot;, you'll be tortured forever by the ending!If you wonder whatever happened to the great tradition of Southern Gothic storytelling where tall tales and nightmares collide to produce a combustible comic vision: welcome to the world of Thomas Harris (heir to Flannery O'Connor and Carson McCullers)."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This much anticipated sequel to Silence of the Lambs is somewhat disappointing and pales in comparison to its predecesor. It is slow to start and once it does get moving, it becomes somewhat predictable. This piece is interesting in its switch of roles and the methods used to possibly change the reader's original alliances, but takes the reader down an unlikely path which is too shallowly explored.In all, Hannibal is a good read and a fair sequel to Silence of the Lambs, but if given the opportunity to speak with the author I would ask that he truly finish this story. Maybe another sequel?...."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I kept working my way through this book, bored silly, hoping that Thomas Harris would redeem himself by coming up with a finale worthy of the excellent &quot;Silence&quot; and &quot;Red Dragon.&quot; So what happens? The worst ending to a book... ever! Consider this a warning: don't waste your money. Spend it on beer, instead. Even if you get sick, it's still be a better experience than &quot;Hannibal.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Despite a rather turgid beginning, I found this story both gripping and engrossing. However, a rather ludicrous finale meant that my enjoyment was cut in half. Harris has succeeded in delving deeper into Hannibal's psyche, a point that I find truly fascinating. The inclusion of Clarice adds the edge that always lived in the first book, and I find Harris uses her character very well, almost preparing both Starling and Hannibal for their inevitable &quot;showdown&quot;, if it can be called that. The use of breathtaking literary illustrations, sweeping between the cultural and beautiful streets of Florence, through to the horror and black humour of a man having his brain sliced and eaten, is extremely effective, and Harris wins at bring ing the reader closer into Hannibal's world. Despite the strengths of the book, the weaknesses are just as apparent. Lacklustre &quot;villains&quot; and pointless red herrings haunt the pages, and whilst it makes a darn good yarn, it never really ventures above that status; never gripping the reader, or, rather, never gripping me beyond &quot;do I really want to turn the page?&quot;. I found it a long, sometimes fantastic, sometimes tedious story. Although, throughout my reading of it, I couldn't help but read it with Anthony Hopkins' voice in my mind, and I think that's a good thing, his slithering, calculating tongue dominating what could have been a dated thriller. It's not dated, although it only just scrapes past that pitfall."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book suffers from too much hype and anticipation after a long wait. Released under different circumstances, reviews would have been kinder. I recommend it.Harris didn't need to spend so much time setting up the story. The first 100 pages could have been edited down to about 25-30. Still, it is a good, suspenseful, horrific story. You find out a lot more about Lechter and his demons, his brilliance, and his unpredictability. Returning characters--Barney, Crawford, and Starling--are further developed, although I was disappointed with the direction Harris took with Starling.Mason Verder, a former patient of Lechter's, is motivated by obsession and revenge. He is also very resourceful. So are the police in Italy and the FBI. Verder's sister, Margeux, puts her own plan in motion--patiently, carefully. Harris weaves the threads of lost loyalties, greed, and ambition throughout. It is cunning, sick, and at times, manic.The last 100 pages left me stunned. There is a climactic showdown that is complex, suspenseful, and unpredictable--but that is not where it ends. Lechter's brilliance comes to fore again, and no matter what you may think or feel about the end, I don't believe anyone can say it is predictable. It is unbelievable and absurd in the strongest sense of the words. It leaves you thinking--real hard--very much a surprise. So go back and read those last 100 pages again. I did. I can tell you I missed a lot because I was entirely unreceptive first time around. Think about it. How much more brilliant, dangerous or horrific could Lechter be?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"My word, people are going on and on about this book as if though they had been promised salvation simply by reading it. Relax, folks, it's only a book and even though some parts of it leave a great deal to be desired, it's an enjoyable read, nevertheless. And though it lacks realism at times (Mr. Harris did go overboard describing just how brilliant, cultured and sophisticated Hannibal Lecter is), both in characterization and plot line, it still contains some genuinely fun and exciting parts. Those that are interest in literature, steer clear of this or any other Harris novel, for that matter. As much as I LOVED &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; I could hardly consider it literature. It's a very good psychological thriller, and nothing more. Those interested in literature should read &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;, &quot;Les Miserables&quot; or &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. Those that are seeking mere entertainment (albeit a little more than twisted, grotesque and vacuous, at times) should have no qualms about &quot;Hannibal.&quot; Not nearly as good as &quot;Silence...&quot; but hardly as bad as some would have you believe."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Not recommended!!!I cannot begin to tell you what a dissapointment this was. First, the entire book needed at least two more editings. Even had I enjoyed the plot (which was gastly in and of itself), the writing was attrocious! (As a previous critic said, you could easily begin at the back and simply remove pages at random!)I fear that like Stephen King, Thomas Harris has also decided to forego any real attempt at writing well and to simply slap his name on trash labeled as horror (read horrible) fiction!Alas...another author stricken from my reading list!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Well I hope that Mr. Harris is writing the sequel as we speak. He leaves the door even more open than Silence of the Lambs. I made the mistake of reading parts to my husband, and now he won't touch the book. For those who have less tendency to get queasy it makes us &quot;hungry&quot; for more. I enjoied it, but I'm worried that poor Clarice and Hannibal will be too old for the next go around."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I HATED this book. But I liked Harris' two previous books so much, I kept thinking he'd turn it around. I was so disgusted with his need to present the most horrific and graphic situations possible that the rest of the story was lost on me. In fact, so lost that I could never determine the point of it. There was not a character I could even begin to sympathize with, putting me in the position of wanting all of them dead by the end of the book. At least that way, we would know Harris wouldn't try to produce another Hannibal Lecter sequel. Does anyone else think this was merely a screenplay? And could the movie possibly tell the story (weak as it was) and include the gratuitous violence without being rejected by viewers everywhere? But without the gore, this book has no content."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am an enormous fan of both &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. I consider them both among the best suspense thrillers that I have ever read in popular fiction. However, this latest effort is written so poorly, it's laughable. I would elaborate but I would be wasting your time as you should have no intention of reading this mess.In a word: abominable."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Unlike the previous books in the series, Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs, this story and characters are hateful. Mr. Harris spends more time on sadistic themes than in crafting a good story. Yes,it is well researched in terms of detail in the Arts, History, Architecture, etc., but an encyclopedia would have been a better read. Mr. Harris seems to reveal his feelings about his readers in his description of the crowds attending the Atrocious Torture Instuments exhibit: &quot;But the essence of the worst, the true asafoetida of the human spirit, is not found in the Iron Maiden or the whetted edge; Elemental Ugliness is found in the faces of the crowd.&quot; Does Mr. Harris despise the reader for his/her facination with his horror story? It would seem so as he attempts to &quot;slap the clammy flab of our submissive consciousness hard enough to get our attention&quot; by weaving a story that is rank with sadism and devoid of any redeeming goodness. Previously admirable characters such as Crawford and Mapp shrivel and disappear, seeming to have given up the good fight. Anyone can put together a horror story. Not many can put together a horror story that gives us heros. Not only are there no heros, the ending destroys the one light in this sickening morass, Starling. The ending is cheap and unbelievable."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"_Silence of the Lambs_ and _Red Dragon_ were truly terrifying books, and Dr. Hannibal Lecter was a malevolent and frightening presence at the heart of each novel. _Hannibal_, however sucks, it doesn't even come close to the quality of the earlier novels. Rather than being a shadowy figure of evil, with a taste for human flesh, as he was in the earlier novels, Lecter is now portrayed as a man of the world, a psychologist who mutilates his patients (just the really bad ones), knows a lot about higher mathematics, Florentine art and Renaissance Italy, and has a taste for the finer things in life which sometimes includes human brains served fresh at the dinner table. All of this of course is not because Dr. Lecter is evil, no it is because he had a traumatic childhood (And this week on Springer, people whose traumatic childhoods turned them into cannibalistic serial killers).As bad as the portrayal of Lecter is the portrayal of Clarice Starling is even worse; in _Silence of the Lambs_ Starling is naive yet tough, a pawn in a sick contest between FBI Agent Jack Crawford and Lecter. Despite her naivete and the fact that she is being used by both Lecter and Crawford, Starling does manage to come out on top. However, in _Hannibal_ Starling is portrayed as a burned out FBI agent whose career has gone badly at the agency. I find it hard to believe that a woman who had managed to face down a cannnibalistic serial killer and kill another serial killer would have difficulty dealing with the idiot machinations of Paul Krendler, a Justice Department bureaucrat who is Starling's chief nemesis in this book. The ending of this book also portrays Starling in a light that is totally false to the way she was portrayed in _Silence of the Lambs_. I won't spoil it, but it is difficult to choke down. If you absolutely have to read this then borrow it from a friend who has already thrown their money away, or check it out from the library or as a last resort wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris surprised me. I didn't think there was anything too shocking left, but I was wrong. In retrospect, it's hard to imagine that anyone could overshadow Hannibal in his sociopathy but this is truly a macabre Cinderella ending to a nightmare."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Editor: Uh, Tom, your agent gave me this package that supposedly contains the new book &quot;Hannibal&quot; and, for the life of me, I just don't get it.

Don't you get it? I used lots of big words, wrote elegantly about these places in Italy, and spiced it up with the hokiest gore I could think of. They'll, pardon the pun, eat it up.

The book kept you somewhat involved until the last 50 pages then it feel apart, as if the author did not know quite where to go from there. The ending was unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"very well written book about the depths of a complex man's mind. i was treated to descriptions of a lavish life filled with exquisite taste and, of course, a picture of a psychopath."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A very disappointing book! The book starts off fast-paced. Then it stops and crawls along with the most boring narrative. I felt no suspense, tingles up the spine, or chills of any kind. Unlike &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;.Thomas Harris has been away for seven years - presumably to write this book. One would have hoped that he would have taken the time to sharpen his skills and bring more of an edge to &quot;Hannibal&quot;. Maybe Harris was hoping that we would not miss the edge because of his previous works. I, for one, wished that I could start all over again with &quot;Black Sunday&quot; and come to this point. I think I will."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I considered myself a Thomas Harris fan until I finished reading Hannibal. I thoroughly enjoyed both The Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. I must have romanticized Clarice Starling's and Hannibal Lecter's characters because they were unrecognizable in this, the newest book. The plot was beyond far-fetched! Trust your judgement. When it starts to seem a little odd, please know its going to get worse! I also disliked the character Mason Verger-the veggie with attitude! Nothing in the story seemed to gel. All elements of the story seem to chafe against each other. The one good thing about the book was the pace. It is very quick reading but when you get to the end you may wish you hadn't. Harris does leave an opening for yet another episode in the Clarice Starling saga. Let's just hope that Harris' heart is into it the next time!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Who were these characters? These were not the same individuals that were in Silence of the Lambs. I was greatly disappointed that Thomas Harris felt the need to use violence for just shock value, as I thought the previous story had much expansive value. The ending of this book was unbelievable. Unbelievable, but not in a good way, a better word would be stupid. Can someone please tell me how to get my money back? This book is more than a waste of time; it actually decreased my intelligence.Did anyone notice that the picture on the back of the jacket bore a striking resemblance to the description of Dr. Lecter? Would you say over identifying with your character?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is a stunning book that will get inside your head in unexpected ways. It is also very disturbing, not least because of how it turns out. To put it in theological terms, Harris's Hannibal is a brilliant embodiment of Satan, as is pointed out on a couple of occasion by the minor Italian characters who dare to look into his eyes. But Satan has ways to capture people other than devouring them.... What I am confused by, however, is the shift in Harris's portrayal of Hannibal. In Silence of the Lambs, the doctor rejects any behavioralist understanding of himself, saying that he is an independent force of nature, unshaped by his enviornment or history, etc. That presumption is greatly weakened in the new book, and we see Hannibal as motivated by deeply rooted longings to turn back the clock. This new dimension to the account of Hannibal makes interpretation of the ending somewhat vexing...we're not sure whether Hannibal was a human all along or in fact purely satanic. Or both. In any case, it's disquieting.Don't bother to read w/o having READ Silence of the Lambs first.There are a couple of truly terrifying moments in the book, shocks that leap out even when you can guess impending disaster. I am glad I do not have to live with Hannibal Lecter in my mind as long as the author obvioulsy had to to create this incredible depiction of human evil. The concept of the &quot;memory palace&quot; used to describe Lecter's mind is also intriguing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I bought this book with the delusion that it would be as good as the other two in the series. I was greatly disappointed by it and spent two days trying to forget that I had read it. I couldn't believe what the author had done to the memoriable characters that he had created. Starling came across as just another helpless female and lacked the finesse and intellect that made her stand out in Silence of the Lambs. Lecter lacked his edge and there were too few times when you got to see the dry humor that the character exhibited in the other books. I hated that the author chose to give Lecter a nagging psycological past. I thought he was perfect the way he was...no chessey explainations for why he was a savage monster. I found the ending to be the biggest let down. I thought it really lacked imagination and was to easy of a jump for the author to make. Overall, this book was badly written and poorly executed and if this hadn't been the sequel to SOTL it wouldn't have made it to the bestsellers list. If you are looking for a good read look elsewhere, if you are looking to line the pockets of a sell out author and publishing house by all means buy the book. If you feel that you must really must read this book...check it out at the library. Save your money for a book that really is a good read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is a dark, hilarious, florid, dead-on parody of Harris' own earlier works. News flash to anyone who thinks otherwise: The joke's on you!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I ordered four books for my vacation. First, there was the good, The Silence of the Lambs. A very good book and must read. Then, there was the bad, Hannibal. Good plot, not so good ending, and the ending in my opinion should be one of the best parts if not the best part of the book. And there was great, The Red Dragon. I loved that novel, much better than the others. I also would recommend a novel called, THE FIST OF GOD, by A.T. Nicholas. It's a great supernatural thriller."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This was a disappointment. Although Hannibel Lecter is such a complex character, I didn't need to have Italian poetry included as part of the text. I thought this was pretentious. Also, the detailing of the vintages and foods was almost pornographic in its detail,as was the brutal descriptions of the dispatching of the victims. Also, Clarice's character did not seem fully developed. There were too many references back to The Silence of the Lambs. I think this would have been much better if it stood on its own. Unfortunately, I now feel exploited for having read it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris' &quot;Hannibal&quot; is not one of the worst books I have ever read - but it's close. I thought &quot;The Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; were well written and entertaining, but &quot;Hannibal&quot; was a joke. Mr. Harris used so much gore that instead of being disturbing, it was funny. And the ending was ludicrous! If Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins have signed to do the movie, they must not have read the book yet."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A wonderful book to read until the end. I enjoyed the characters and imagery, until the end. Don't read this expecting Silence of the Lambs or The Red Dragon, Hannibal falls flat and left this reader disappointed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I knew this book wasn't very good when I found myself laughing out loud at the &quot;scary&quot; parts. I will admit that I had never read a Harris books before, however, I am sure that this was not one of his best. I read quickly through the long and uneccessary descritions, hoping that eventually I would reach &quot;the good part.&quot; Unfortunately, this never happened. I give this book two stars for it's entertainment value. It is easy to read and even has some laughs in it (even if the author did not intend it that way.) As for this becoming a movie..well, lets just say that I would go to the cheap show."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Overwrought, pretentious, boring, pointless. I hope Mr. Harris gets tired of writing again and stays away for another decade. Please!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris' Hannibal provides glimpses of insight into both the psyches of Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling, but in the end, disappoints its reader. Although Harris sketches out pieces of Lecter's past, providing readers with perhaps Lecter's motivation for madness, mayhem and murder, those pieces simply do not ring true. Lecter was much better, more realistic and scary as an unexplained monster. No one has ever satisfactorily explained the motivation that drove infamous killers such as Bundy, Gacy and Daimler. It is for that very reason people remain mystified and fascinated with serial killers, including a fictional serial killer. Harris' attempts at explanation for Lecter's behavior ring more like pop-psychology. Likewise, Starling's reaching toward self-understanding and growth are in the beginning intriguing, particularly as the author seems to begin to intertwine her desires for material objects, self-improvement and a better life with Lecter's existing admiration and lust for the best in life. However the author abruptly snaps that particular story line just at its most interesting point, never to re-visit it. Starling's reversal of position at the end is never wholly satifying, leaving this reader wondering why Harris abandoned his own character. The book is abound with characters that are never drawn completely, abandoned just as they become interesting; cases in point, the characters of Barney and Margot. The true monster in this book is Mason Verger. A character so whole, so nasty and well-drawn, he makes Lecter seem like a pale ghost in his own story."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"i read the whole book it three days...disappointing, but better than what's on TV. i found the ending ridiculous, because i'd honestly expected more from starling. again, a male writer who &quot;doesn't get it&quot; when it comes to writing women."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is a sequel worthy of the original. 'Hannibal' is truly abook you cannot put down from the first page. I found myself drawninto the mind and world of Dr. Hannibal Lecter. The ending of Paul Krendler made me laugh. True poetic justice."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Wish I hadn't wasted my time getting to the end of this BORING book. The ending ruined &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; for me. I refuse to recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After the wait, this book is such a disappointment. Hannible isn't as evil as he should be. Harris has made Clarice a weak pitiful person, and he has done the same to Jack Crawford. Granted, the new evil person Mason Verger, is a good villian. But, after waiting so long for this sequel, I am so disappointed I could cry. Please don't make a movie of THIS book. I have read Silence of the Lambs twice, seen the movie three times and will watch it again. But, I will never recommend this book to anyone. I regret spending the money for a hardcover, wish I would have waited for a &quot;used book&quot; sale."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After having read the &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot; I was primed to expect the very best from Thomas Harris. I have been sincerely disappointed.Starling was the ultimate heroine in &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot; and I truly looked forward to a repeat performance here. Instead Harris has done nothing but perpetuate the myth that strong women, subjected to office politics and underhanded subterfuge, will fold up their ethics and slink away with the villain. It broke my heart that Starling was transformed from the heroine we all want to be and respect into a crass cannibal consorting with the likes of Lecter.I can only hope that the movie won't follow this plot line and can salvage what could have been the ultimate fictional work of the twentieth century. Harris did a fine job, albeit a little too academic, with the prose. He set up a number of villains in Verger, Margot, and Krendler that are all too realistic, and had some especially horrific and spine-tingling moments. Unfortunately he lost me as a fan with his annihilation of Starling and the stupidest ending imaginable."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It is definately the kind of book that you would stop doing your normal day-to-day things just to find out what the next page beholds! I found it totally engrossing and it's a great form of imagination Thomas has. The way the story progresses can be slow, but then the writer knows that to get a great story, you have to start slow and build up quickly to a great climax, just like in his other books. The ending IS reather strange, and I think there could have been a bit of realisation from Clarice's part towards Hannibal that he was there and what he was, instead it seemed she was rather natural about it, leaving the reader feeling a bit confused. But anyway, I think this book overall had the elements of a really good read, and it is one that I will remember. Recommended."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It did take me a while to get into this one, as it seemed most readers. Once into it, I thought Harris' dedication to the theme, and charecteristics of Lecter were brilliant. The portion of the book in Italy was somewhat overwhelming, involving too many details and language, which the average reader is unable to absorb. The book, did however keep me involved until the final two chapters. The ending, however, was absolutely rediculous, and made me regret reading the previous 450 pages."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Amazing what you can get away with when you become a big-name author...a first time novelist would be lucky to even collect a rejection slip for this one. With the exception of Hannibal, the characters are reduced to cliches...poor Clarice, superwoman downtrodden by the male establishment. But that's what it takes to sell books today. The ending is ludicrous, it can't be explained, so Harris doesn't bother."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I bought this book before it was released. I was as excited about this release almost as much as Episode I of Star Wars. But unlike that film, I was extremely disappointed by the results. A very gothic and boring tale about nothing. I was hoping for an exciting story of Clarice Starling and her hunt for the escaped killer Hannibal Lecter. Instead, it is a long, drawn out glimpse into Lecter's appreciation for life (ironic) and a new evil character that is trying to avenge his being condemned to a wheelchair by Lecter; I don't care about this new character. I wanted to read about the people that I have read about in the previous novels. There were some exciting scenes (the opening FBI raid and Lecter's escape from Italy) but that's it. Please do not make a movie. I don't want to relive the book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris is the master and he knows what he's talking about. His books do not fall into the trashy psycho-thrillers genre. His books have characters that are very 3D, not just paper figures acting out a story. Hannibal is a very different book than The Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon but equally good. In all of these books, I found myself cheering for Hannibal Lecter and wondering what he will do next. This book does have its gory moments but I recommend it fully."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was one I was looking foward to reading. Usually a good book I can read in two days because I don't put it down. This book though I couldn't find myself picking it up. The first half was boring. There was too many Italian refrences and words for someone who has never been to Europe to really enjoy. The other two Harris books punched you from the start where as this one I am still waiting for a smack. The ending was very false and seemed like Harris was trying to be out there . After reading the book I wish I hadn't, the hype was more enjoyable than the book itself. I'm sorry."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Yes, this book has been reviewed to death. I thihk, however, in light of the film, it deserves one more rebuttal. I loved the book, as it clarified the character and motivations of Hannibal Lecter. Not justified, but clarified. I was anticipating the movie and was horrified at the ending. The end of the book tied the main characters together and produced for me a satifying conclusion to the whole series. The movie, bless the Hollywood writers, (they cannot leave the authors material alone, can they?)destrooyed the entire effect. I am surprised Sir Anthony put his name on such a mess. I found this book the best of the three, and the perfect way to write finis to the character. Although, secretly, I hope he resurfaces."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am amazed at how many people just don't get this book.First of all, let me say, setting aside the plot for a moment, Harris' use of language is absolutely beautiful and lyrical. In this book, he uses storytelling devices which I have never seen used by another author, and they really blew my mind.Now to the plot. The end of the story is what most people have issues with, especially since Hannibal Lecter is given a very happy ending. It is not a conventional ending, especially according to Hollywood's standards (which may account for why the movie version failed so miserably), however, it is very unique, and very powerful. \\"Hannibal\\" does not, as some would suggest, look to excuse Lecter's killings. Instead, by looking into his history we see some of the explanation as to why he has become such a disturbed human being, and we see some of the Lecter's motivation for committing such horrible acts. At the end of the book, Hannibal's triumph is that he is finally able to set his madness aside. I thought it was wonderful, and very uplifting."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I cannot see how anyone would read Hannibal for the plot, and it was far from engaging and suspenseful. There are certain things you expect when starting to read a sequel to The Silence of the Lambs: Lecter and Starling will meet again; Lecter will kill again; the FBI will try to find him again. So far, Harris delivers, and he does so with a text that proceeds with a fast pace. When an author is capable of doing so with language only, then he or she really is good at writing.That is not enough, though - not for me, anyway. The plot is more important in a thriller than in other literary genres. Here I was really amazed about the drug thing going wrong at the beginning. The woman in command of the drug factory has got AIDS and so will try to get you in contact with her blood and defecates on you if you try to fight her, and she does not hesitate to use her baby, or any baby, as a shield in a shoot-out - did I get that right? I thought it unlikely, but tried to believe that such people really existed. What really brought my credulity end were Mason and Marion Verger. Mason has abused Marion sexually, the latter of which is a lesbian, and almost a clich&eacute; at that, walking around in a riding outfit when we meet her the first time, and the allusion of S/M is in the air. Another implication is that she is a lesbian because Mason has raped her. She nevertheless would like a baby and wants Mason's semen (of all people) and gets it by using a cattle prod. Can you believe that? I can't. Mason himself is beyond all description: he could easily have Lecter killed by other means than in the book - why does it have to be so elaborate? I knew that it was never going to work with those pigs from square one - but again, plot is not the main thing here.What is left, then, when the plot is more or less predictable, and the characters are nothing but multiply abused victims looking for revenge that is even more perverted than what happened to them, and when the most authentic character is a mysogynist coward whose main hobby is mobbing and deceit, but still gets his brain eaten? Psychological depth? Yes, if disgust is so deep it reaches a psychological level. The ending is such a weak and contrived trip into different spheres beyond anyone's sane understanding that it cannot be grasped or appreciated. And what about revealing Lecter's motivation? Why oh why did Harris have to lift the last curtain? Just because the trilogy has now come to its ending?And I just cannot see how Clarice Starling can be seen as a feminist icon. She gives in to Hannibal, and the other females are a stereotype lesbian and an Italian woman who is only there so her husband, the police captain, can daydream about making love to her, as Italians are likely to do - at least in novels, and so Lecter can sniff her skin and muse about killing or not killing her playfully. This moment of the book is telling: There is so much gore and abuse in the text that Hannibal reads not so much as a novel as a menu card for Dr Lecter."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"AWESOME! Behold the power of Thomas Harris\` mighty pen. This was definately worth the 10 year wait. I\`ve read it twice, and will always be my favorite in the series."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Now, I like sick stuff, and Silence of the Lambs and all that stuff he wrote just gives me the creeps. But this one sucked, 100%. For example, there is a part where Jody Foster ends up eating someone because of what happens to her. She should be in the movie, but on top of that her character would just not do it. Never. And it made me nearly vomit. Really."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is the first book that made me vomit. It is the most sickening, revolting, repugnant and NASTY story I have ever made the mistake of reading.First off, the story is implausible. You know right away &quot;Dr. Fell&quot; is really Hannibal and you know his escapes just don't add up.The entire book is sickening. The least revolting description offered was that of a young mother on a plane with Hannibal who dipped the same finger in his food that she used to check her baby's diaper. That was very mild compared to the rest of the book.Mason Varger is a revolting mockery of humanity. This twisted travesty has carried on an incestuous relationship with his gay sister. The sister is one of the few quasi-pitiful characters. There is no shortage of revolting characters here.Clarice Starling is the biggest disappointment of all. She literally lives by the motto of &quot;if you can't [b]eat 'em, join 'em,&quot; and joins Hannibal in a particularly gruesome repast. She is another disgusting creature after all. I'd give this no stars if I could.THIS BOOK SHOULD COME WITH A WARNING LABEL WARNING PEOPLE NOT TO READ IT. IT IS TRULY HEINOUS."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A few days ago I read and watched Silence of the Lambs for the first time ever and fell in love with both the book and the movie right off. So of course I just had to read the sequel to that wonderful book. It's strange; the man who wrote one of the best books I have ever read has also written one of the worst books I have ever read in my entire life. I absolutely loathed this book. The plot is ludicrous and absurd, the writing is sloppy and demented (why the heck does Harris change tenses with every freakin' paragraph?), new characters are bizarre and unpleasant, there is far too much gore, and worst of all, old characters from SOTL are transformed into flat caricatures of their previous selves.One example of this is Harris's treatment of Hannibal Lecter in this novel. What happened to the evil, mocking, sarcastic, dangerous Lecter of SOTL? What happened to the Dr.Lecter who was so evil and so dangerous that he had to be kept in tons of restraints when he wasn't caged up? The Dr.Lecter who, when security was relaxed just a tiny bit at the asylum, attacked and mauled a nurses' face? The Dr. Lecter who gleefully tormented a grieving mother? What happened to the coolest, scariest villain in all literature and filmdom? Dr. Lecter is too busy shopping in this novel to do anything scary. In this novel Harris has decided that Dr.Lecter, instead of being a villain, is actually an ANTI-HERO. He's evil because of a CHILDHOOD TRAUMA. If Harris absolutely had to give a reason for Lecter's madness then it at least should have been something more original and interesting. Oh, and in this novel Lecter only kills people who are worse than he is or who have bad taste. Dr.Lecter is a fascinating villain but why the heck does Harris think we want to sympathize with him? Fascinating or not, Lecter's still an insane monster. And the whole Mischa thing is just stupid. In SOTL Lecter would have eaten Mischa for breakfast.Not being content with only ruining Dr. Lecter's character, Harris also has to stomp Clarice Starling into the dirt. SPOILER ALERT: The coolest heroine in all of literature is turned into a passive cannibalistic consort at the end of this novel. I almost screamed when I read what Harris had done to Clarice. The Clarice in SOTL would never in a million years have done what she does in this book. Absolutely disgusting. I think Harris has been reading too many Anne Rice novels. There is not one redeeming feature in this novel. Mason Verger is a horrible villain, he's like a parody of a lame cartoon villain. His elaborate scheme with the pigs is unintentionally hilarious and absurd. Honestly I can't believe that someone who wrote such an intelligent, thrilling, haunting book like SOTL could come up with this mess. I do not recommend this book to anyone who likes SOTL. It is a very disappointing sequel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This was one wild wrap up; the ending was totally unexpected, totally creepy, and totally fitting. You have to read this, but it will haunt you."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is a follow-up sequence of the famous &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, and yet it is a book all by itself. It does not pick up the thread of the story where it stopped in the previous book. Here the author shows a real serial killer who plans, elaborate and creates links between his crimes, his cannibalistic desire and a culture that goes back to the Middle Ages, a time where what he does alone was standard forms of justice. This historical perspective gives the crime an unbearable human dimension. The monster is nothing but a survivor, and yet, is he really the only survivor of those dark and brutal ages? He also shows how some people who have a lot of money and know how to buy some support in political and judicial circles, can do even worse crimes without having any problems. Hence the vengeance scheme against Hannibal, Doctor Lecter. And this plan shows how devilish a society founded on money can become. Because if you can do such ignoble acts to avenge yourself against such a criminal, what can you do to satisfy your desires with un-important people like illegal immigrants who cannot be claimed by anyone? It reveals that Hannibal Doctor Lecter only attacks people who are somewhere criminals themselves, people who are also trying to attack him. The book also gives some vista in the past of Dr Lecter, hence a vision of some kind of line of causation of his personality, and there again we find the ugliness of our society that refuses no crime to impose a rule, a political system, a dictatorship,etc. War, totalitarianism, dictatorship are human crimes that are, unluckily, so far, accepted as normal historical events and twists by everyone. It is easier to declare Hitler crazy than to denounce the social, political and economic system that produced him and that covered his crimes for decades. It took fifty years for the Catholic Church to officially apologize for its passive support to the Shoah. All that is behind the book, and the crimes of Hannibal in Italy are systematically a rerun of justice acts of the Renaissance. Where is the devil? Where is the angel? Where is God? We do not know at all. Evil is in man, or rather is encouraged in man by society and history. Here Thomas reaches a real philosophical level and goes beyond plain voyeurism. And what's more, Doctor Lecter loves poetry (Dante) and music, classical music. While people were gutted and hanged and tortured by politicians and the Chruch in Italy, the most beautiful and sophisticated music was composed by some of the finest musicians of all times. What a soul-stirring reality. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris universities IX and II"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I just finished reading Hannibal and it it's idiotic. The book is the exact opposite of the movie. The book wants to talk about a very cultivated man and a strong woman but all it does is kitsch them!

For Dante, Betrice means divine revelation, much like \\"If you love me you'd stop\\" in the movie. if you want to understand h and c watch a hybrid hannibal starring a.h. and jodie foster.

The great story line continues from the part of the trilogy, Silence of the Lambs. Hannibal is the prelude to Red Dragon.One of the two main characters is the highly intelligent physician Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Always telling the truth and a strong interest in fine arts. Dr. Lecter has one large draw back, he's a cannibal. Cannibals are people who thrive on human tissue and organs. He prefers to consume the weak and the corrupted. By doing so he had gotten himself involved with the Federal Bureau of Investigation on a bad note.Clarice Starling is the other main character. An FBI agent with lots of ambition and a hard worker. She was assigned to interview the infamous Dr. Lecter. Over the many interviews with him during his stay at the asylum he told Clarice the deepest things about herself. For that she respected him. The respect between the two of them was mutual. Clarice lives with her African American friend Ardelia Mapp.The great novel opens to Calrice Starling arriving at the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Fire Arms to begin a SWAT raid. The purpose of the engagement was apprehending the drug and firearm smuggler Evelda Drumgo, who was connected to the Trey- Eigth Crips. The raid went sour when Starling ended up saving her own life and the squads. To do so she had to shoot the Drumgo carrying a baby in her arms. It may have seemed cruel and outrageous, but Evelda had possession of an automatic weapon.After the unsuccessful raid Starling is sent on a leave with pay from the Bureau. The copperplate written letters begin to appear more recently for Clarice. She notifies the Federal Bureau of Investigation and is reassigned to the physicians most wanted case.The soul survivor of Dr. Hannibal Lecter's cannibal phetish is a crippled inheritance of a wealthy father. Mr. Mason Verger had hired his own bounty hunters to track down his attacker. Mason's plan was to capture and film the torture and soon after death of his former physiatrist. The chase continues through Europe and the United States. Various problems occur in the Bureau and for the bounty hunters hired to capture Lecter.Thomas Harris uses a wide array of literary elements in Hannibal. He uses characterization to creat each and every one in the book. Each one is expand through the course of the novel. The figurative speech, imagery, metaphors, and similes are outstandingly ingenious. At some sections in the story the imagery was horrifying and to some extent sickening. Since Dr. Lecter is so intelligent, figurative speech, complicated similes, and metaphors are stunningly strung through the story like sprinkles on a cupcake. The sensory language much like the imagery is often stomach churning. It's like that of Marilyn Manson's controversial music videos. The whole story line with its extraordinary level of suspense. It makes the whole novel one enormous, never falling climax.I enjoyed Hannibal immensely. It appealed to all of my senses and pulled me in. I read this masterpiece in three days. I recommend this to anyone who has a lust for interesting and somewhat disturbing sense of literature. If you loved the movie then this book is for you. The details are ten times more explosive in the book. They are superior to that I have ever seen or watched. Read the book and you'll get the parts the movie didn't have."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"\\"Hannibal\\" was good with plenty of technical details, and author Harris gives us just a morsel of Dr. Lecter's background, just enough to make us want more. However, I can kinda see why Foster refused to return to the role of Clarice Starling. If you read the ending of Harris' novel, you'll know why too. Is it really plausible for such a monster as Dr. Lecter to have warm and fuzzy tender feelings for his Darling Starling? And is it plausible for a woman such as Starling to do what she did at the end of the novel? Put together a sleek, stylish cannibal with refined manners and a warm spot for another human being, and a young FBI agent with a ruined career and an Electra complex and you come up with the love story from Hell. It's actually a bit romantic in a sick, twisted kind of way. Oh well. Read the book and see for yourselves. Bon appetit!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I enjoyed reading this book and definitely thought some of the content could have been adapted to the movie better. Sometimes the author would elude to things that were totally out of place and made no sense.I would recommend this to someone."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I took this book with me on my Plane trip to Australia. I figured that I would have a good 20 hours to read it. But when I started reading the book, I realized this was not the kind of book you could read in a short amount of time. I loved the book, and I loved reading it, I enjoyed it..and I did not want to read it in 4 hours and then have nothing to savor. I really loved the ending, which when I went to the movies I saw they changed...but I see the new DVD has an alternate ending, so I am really hoping they go back to the books original end.If you liked Silence you have to read this book. It really is a great sequel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The most important part of this novel is the introduction so before it came out I knew if it had a weak intro it would be that good. The reason for that is that there is a big span of time between silence of the lambs and hannibal so he had to catch you up on what has happened. and I found out he did it well. The introduction ws complete and detailed. And he did it so well. He found a way to explain the past events by not using to many flashbacks in the first act of the novel. That is something only few people can do. There were no flaws in the introduction.Also in the novel the way he wrote it caused that he had to also have the second act where you meet dr. lector just as strong as the first because it served as an intro too. Its where you catch up with Dr. Lector and what has he been doing since the silence of the lambs. I loved the second act it was very detailed in history you can tell he did a lot of research for the novel. It is also very graphic because it shows you what put him in the cell in the first place. The second act was my favrite because of the high amounts of details he put in it. There were no flaws.The third and fourth acts are also great with the depiction of its characters I believe that they are also strong and achieved what it needed to achieve. But the only flaw was that it was coming to an end to quickly. It does not end with the fourth act but you could tell it was trying come to a conclusion. I beleive that is the only flaw that it did not need to rush but it did.The last act which is the fifth act was not the most important but it was the weakest in the novel. A little to weak. I did not mind the ending to much. You could kind of tell that it was going to happen because that seemed to be what the book was stressing on the connection between claurice starling and Hannibal Lecter. But It seemed to me that the author does not plan to write another book on the subject I hope he does because Hannibal did not close the story. I was dissapointed on the weakness of the ending because it left way too many questions. There needs to be another one.Overall it is a good novel not as good as the book silence of the lambs but it got close. It needed more of an explaination of Hannibal lector to be complete. But it diserves four stars."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A unique plot with an amazing twist.

Most people can't understand how Clarice Starling could love Hannibal Lecter, but he is, afterall, the man who risked his life to save her. Jodi Foster doesn't want to play Clarice in the movie because Clarice &quot;doesn't stay true to her character.&quot; I disagree. Clarice never fit in with the FBI. Maybe Dr. Lecter is the only man as smart as she is."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was mildly disappointed in the book, but my major criticism is against Amazon.com, for printing incoherent ravings from Sunday School teachers. I enjoy reading critiques, both pro and con, not irrelevant frothings at the mouth. I don't recall seeing one word in the book maligning Jesus or any aspect of religion. This book is supposed to be a thriller, not a treatise on theology. That critic should apply for a seat on the Kansas City Board of Education."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The third book of the &quot;Hannibal&quot; trilogy is by far the best. We learn why Hannibal Lecter is what he is and, believe it or not, he is not the &quot;villian&quot; of this book! Even though I figured out the ending about half way through, I still was enthralled and tantalized as Harris took me through Hannibal's &quot;mind palace&quot; and the fall and rise of Clarice Starling. The ending is mind blowing, literally! The psychological twists in this book are so captivating that they stay with you long after you've finished. I think the reader will benefit from reading Harris' other novels, but this one can definately stand on its own. Definately one of my favorite books of all time!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"From the beginning to the end, Hannibal was thrilling and mysterious. He did an excellent job of introducing Starling, Lecter, and all of the other characters, so if you hadn't read the Silence of The Lambs, you could pick up the story easily. I recommend it to everybody"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Wow! Can you say &quot;SELL OUT&quot;? Was this book about Hannibal or the history and tourism of Italy? Very disappointing after the genius of Manhunter and Silence of the Lambs. I loved the detailed background of Hannibal's childhood (made you BEGIN to feel sorry for him), and was even intrigued by his growing fondness for Clarice, but this book failed miserably in its story. The ending was cartoonish and disgraceful to the characters that Harris intrigued us with in his previous novels. Hannibal remained true to himself, but Clarice once a strong and complex figure, was reduced to a puppet. A disgrace to her Silence of the Lambs portrayal.I guess we are all suckers for purchasing this book, feeding the hype, and ultimately encouraging a once great author to continue to bow down to his agents and come up with a quickie Hollywood story to be made into a higher revenue generating movie.Sad,sad, sad. I hope we at least get to see a reality tv show &quot;Clarice &amp; Hannibal's Wedding&quot; - that might be worth something?!?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is truly one of the most monstrously disappointing books I've ever had the misfortune of reading. Its faults are legion, but, to save time and space, I'll just mention a few: Being a historian, I found Harris' forays into medieval and Rennaisance Italian history quite interesting, but I'm sure I'm in a minority here. Harris has given in to the temptation to endow his main character with almost god-like characteristics, resulting in a character about as realistic as something out of Pokemon: Lecter is no longer a cold, highly intelligent psychopath, but some sort of bizarre psychopath-wizard-pharmacist-scholar-surgeon hybrid with an intellect surpassing that of Einstein. The ending is highly contrived and seems to have no real connection to the preceding story; in particular, the character of Starling is given a complete overhall in the closing chapters, and goes from being a comitted (albeit a bit unstable) FBI agent to the Devil's consort in the blink of an eye. There is absolutely nothing in the story prior to this which even hints at such a possibility. Haris gives us some disturbing glimpses into Lecter's past with the tale of his unfortunate sister, but this theme is never developed, and serves instead as an excuse to indulge in some half-baked pseudo-science a-la Steven Hawkins. One last small point: Harris has taken blood and gore to a point where it no longer shocks or horrifies, but simply provokes laughter: the disembowled cop dangling out of a window, and the scene in which an FBI agent's brain serves as a main course (said agent being a guest/food-container present at the table)had me shrieking with laugher. Enough said."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This was a challenging book for me, and I read it as a school project during my freshman year. I could NOT put down the book. Once you reach the 3/4 mark, you wont want to stop. Thrilling and amazing story.."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Many sequels are not as brilliant as the book before. I believe that the author, Thomas Harris, did his best with it. Sure it may be gross or sick but that is life. People have to be exposed to these things and wake up. Some people are more than they seem and the less you may want to know about them.-If you can handle this type of serious subject go ahead and read it. If you are immature go pick up \\"Goodnight Moon\\"."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is about a woman named Clarice Starling and her life working as a FBI officer. Clarice is the best FBI officer there ever was in Washington. Here she will face the biggest challenge of her life. First she must get out of trouble she is already in after a drug bust. Now she must meet a cannibal. She met this person once before and will face him again. She met him a long time ago and put him in prison for a while. His name was Dr. Hannibal Lector.I do like this book, because it fits me, well short of. It is an action packed book with some grouse, bloody scenes. I saw the movie to this book before. This book as well as the movie contains a lot of action right from the start of the book.. The reason why I didn't like this book is because it does contain some romance and some old time stuff or past history tings as some of us will put it.This is a good book for most of you people out there."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I loved both Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs (even more than the movies). But this one...eeeeccchh! I think Thomas Harris just picked up a copy of Silence of the Lambs and wrung out what he could then filled in the rest with crap. It was slow. It was dull. It was a novel already so impressed with itself that it obviously didn't feel it had to try. Worse than anything was the ending...stupid, illogical, unbelievable and disappointing. Hannibal himself wasn't even scary, let alone horrifying. It actually made the prequel look bad in retrospect. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;Hannibal&quot; is superlative... a rare delicacy among modern popular fiction. Don't expect a copycat sequel to &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. This is an original, audacious work that is as stylish and engrossing as it is nightmarishly disturbing. The finale is OUT OF THIS WORLD!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The first 150 pages were rather slow but once you got into the book it was a fabulous and fast read. I couldn't wait to get to the next chapter to see would happen next!! The ending was a real surprise and not at all like I had imagined it would end. A great summer read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book started off brilliantly. The new characters were superb and the story line was fantastic. Harris did well to prevent Lecter becoming mundane and 'normal' by establishing his exquisite taste which he never compromised in the new book. I found the constant references to comments Lecter and Clarice made in Silence a little tedious at times. It was the weird and obscure ending which I feel really let this book down. I can't believe such a strong character as Clarice could have been so easily thrown out of the FBI without a damn good fight or choose a life with Lecter? It was very unsatisfactory the way Starlings disappearance was glossed over too. Very odd and disappointing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm sorry for all of those reviewers out there who despised the ending, were not captivated with the look into Lecter's mind, and as one review adamantly said,&quot;the poor use of commas.&quot; This is a great book!Lecter is his scariest, because at points you can relate to him, you have to call yourself back and remember that he's a serial killer and your not supposed to like him. Many have said there is not enough gore in the book either, all I have to say are the pigs and the eel, buy this book, it is worth the money."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I waited so long for the sequel. I presumed I would be disappointed. I figured we would get another serial-killer, another flirtation-pursuit between Lecter and Starling, another tidy ending where Starling becomes director of the FBI and Lecter (I was hoping) gets away at the end to wreak havoc in a future book.But Harris isn't Patricia Cornwell and he refused to fill his market niche. He may write the world's best police procedurals, but he obviously isn't content just to give the public what the public expects. Hannibal shows Harris is incapable of being a hack.I've read Hannibal three times now. Each time I have come away with a different impression of the novel - and it's a novel, not a pulp-fiction thriller at all.The first time I read it I thought it was a brilliant black-comic, Southern-Gothic extravaganza : only Harris could write that one of the leading characters, after committing murder, came to regret her actions because of all the attention the tabloids were giving her!Then I re-read the book and saw a fresco of what American society is at the end of the century : full of sound and fury, violence and madness, a tabloid culture baying for the blood of the designated Villain of the Month (Clinton, Hannibal Lecter and finally Clarice Starling..), a place where good and evil have been supplanted by political manoeuvring, corrupt bureaucracies - a world where a decent heroine can never find the honor that is her due.But on reading Hannibal a third time (while still discovering jokes I'd missed on the previous two occasions - Hannibal is also extremely funny) - I was struck by the doom-laden atmosphere of the final chapters, the almost Visconti-like feeling. Beneath all the brutality, Harris has the gentleness of heart to grant some measure of redemption to characters who have been prisoners of their pasts, incapable of shaking off the tentacles of the dead.Thomas Harris is no longer just the world's finest writer of police procedurals. With Hannibal, he has become America's foremost novelist, unwilling to bend to convention or respect any commercial agenda. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is a just plain lousy book. Thomas Harris appears to be mocking his loyal readers by giving them a poorly constructed plot and a ludicrous ending. Perhaps that is why he has not written a book in over ten years. He spends more time in telling us about Italian Renaissance History as relating to the Italian cop and what pigs can do to a poor soul than framing a concise narrative.The villains are boring and Hannibal himself appears at times to be a good guy. As for the future of Clarice Starling, the book makes me totally uninterested in her fate."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I certainly was, and thanks to Mr. Harris, received one. From the moment of Clarice and Hannibal's first touch in SILENCE, I expected the good doctor to become obsessed. And wouldn't any woman be flattered by such a man's attentions?The ending was haunting and raised all sorts of wonderful questions for the reader. Will the two begin a killing spree together? Or will Clarice be the steadying force to Dr Lector's madness? Will they expand Clarice's limited knowledge of human cuisine? Will they have a child? Can Will Graham get himself rehabilitated enough to chase after the duo?The book was not another SILENCE, nor should it have been. The book was written for Hannibal alone, as the title implies. And, for Hannibal, it was a happy ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Many readers have stated their disappointment with the ending of this book, and I am inclined to agree. The writer will carry you through several hundred pages of brilliantly sustained hyper-reality, characters that will remind you of people that you know, perhaps wished that you didn't know, scenes that will distress you with the immediate urgency of the evening news, charm you with descriptions of old world culture reminiscent of 'Interview With the Vampire', inform you in layman's terms of contemporary metaphysics regarding the nature of time, and ultimately plunge you into a milieu of stunningly implausible outcomes. Apparently this book took Mr. Harris about ten years to complete. I wonder if he himself got lost in the effort, perhaps in a sort of novelist's 'palace of dreams', and found easy closure through the anticipation of yet another installment of the Hannibal saga, an artistic retreat that has proved commercially lucrative for similar genre writers such as Anne Rice and Stephen King, notably also with considerably reduced critical integrity."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris manages to pull it off--he skillfully seduces the reader into cheering for the monstrous Hannibal Lector (and he IS monstrous). Suspenseful, gory, and moving. The trajectory is bizarre, but to my mind, it works beautifully."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I loved this book. It amazed me. I never believed that Mr. Harris could write another Lecter book without selling out to the hoards, like Crichton's &quot;Lost World&quot;. I held my breath throughout the book, blinking my eyes while turning pages. I am in awe of Thomas Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The reason I'm giving HANNIBAL 4 stars is because middling Harris is better than 95% of what the rest of us write, but that said, this book does not live up to RED DRAGON or SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. I think of this work as overripe Lecter. Less is more, but in this book we get way too much. The plotting is over the top, and villain Mason Verger is beyond belief. What made the preceding books work was that you actually believed that these fantastic events could really happen. HANNIBAL is more like a fairy tale. You go along with it but you know it could never be real, and so the story often feels more silly than scary. But if you, like me, are a Hannibal Lecter freak, don't pass this one up. If nothing else, the good doctor's recipes will give you a chortle."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hi,I don't write spoilers. Many people like the Lecter trilogy. Even people who don't care for this sort of thing know of it. As usual, the book has chapters the movie does not. Although not too much material was actually lost on this one going to film. It was reworked a bit. The last chapters are very different from the film. It's an enjoyable, fast, light read. The book is literally available for a penny, now! No excuse not to buy it. Better still, buy ten, & give them as gifts to friends & family. Let 'em know what lights your dark places ;-).Criticisms? Not many. I can't comment on all the artsy_fartsy stuff about Italy in the 1500s. I've never read about it. I can tell you the Author didn't ask enough questions, or take good enough notes, about firearms, archery, or hunting. His ignorance shows loud & clear in those areas. Fair enough, most liberal-minded writers haven't a clue about these things. For a 500+ page novel to only have one glaring blooper is very good. I've read more-acclaimed novels w/several such mistakes. It's a minor error, but would bug the tar out of me if I'd done it. It's towards the end, & readers will spot it quickly (no spoilers, remember?).I do hope the author got his monetary due from this project. For such entertainment to be had from a book costing one penny... Well, the new releases must have made them their profits. Thanks to him for a story near & dear to our nightmares."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I just finished this book and loved every page of it! I have been working my way through the \\"Hannibal\\" series and I have to say, I'm very glad I watched the movies first. All 5, even \\"Manhunter\\" (I'm partial to Hopkins as Lecter), were good and bloody fun but I'd have been very disappointed with them had I read the novels first. They don't come close, in depth and complication of the story and characters, to what Harris gives us in his novels. He uses a pen, like Lecter uses his harpy, to create a form of gory art that we can't seem to get enough of. The readers, like Starling, will know that there is unspeakable evil in Hannibal yet there is something that attracts us and almost endears us to him. I highly recommend \\"Hannibal\\" to any thriller fan with a strong stomach. By the way, if you've seen the movie, prepare to have Starling shock the hell out of you."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Clarice Starling's career is now in ruins, thanks to a botched raid in Washington DC. With her job gone, she put her effort into finding Dr. Hannibal Lechter, who eluded her years ago. But there is another one who hunts Lechter; Mason Verger, one of Lechter's few surviving victims. Years ago, Verger was convicted of raping children, but his massive wealth spared him jail. His sentence was therapy with Dr. Lechter.Now, Mason Verger lies paralyzed, faceless, and with one eye. Yet his mind still works, and too well. Verger is even more sadistic and sick than Lechter and the revenge he has in mind is as horrific as anything Lechter has ever come up with."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Brilliant, with as daring and unexpected an ending as I've ever read. Thomas Harris delves into Hannibal Lecter's mind once more, and once more manages to dissect it without taking his to pieces and reducing his mysteriousness. He writes in a scientific, almost dry tone that only serves to enhance the emotion and draw in the reader.The characters are deep, complex, and absorbing. Even characters such as Mason Verger and Paul Krendler are interesting, not just static foils to the main protagonists, although even the question of who the protagonists are is not cut and dry.One of my favorite books. Ever."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is everything I expected and more. Without giving away details, I'll just say that the ending was stunning. This book was intense, shocking and brutal. I can't believe people complain about the gore in this book. It is a book about Hannibal Lecter, what did people expect? All I can say is that anyone who has not read this book yet should. You are in for a treat as this book is more encompassing and better than the movie. I cannot wait for the next book by Thomas Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is a good book. Quite possibly my favorite of the three. It provides so much depth about Hannibal. This is a must read for Hannibal fans."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Watching \`Hannibal' self destruct before it's closing pages is a sad turn of events. Heralded as one of today's best horror writers, Thomas Harris created a character so evil, so dark and so unforgiving in Hannibal \`the cannibal' that watching this same character, the villain we all love to hate, become something we could stand to give a passing glance is a very hard thing to stomach, harder even than the gut wrenching scenes of violence that spill over these 480 pages. That's not to say that \`Hannibal' is a complete waste of the readers time, for that is not entirely true, but that is to say that \`Hannibal' will leave the reader wanting, especially if you're attached in any way shape or form to the cannibal we were introduced to in \`Red Dragon' and again in \`Silence of the Lambs'.\`Hannibal' starts off brilliantly. The opening scene of bloodshed looks to shed a light on where this novel may be headed, but in the end it fails to monopolize on what was right in front of it. With Clarice suspended due to a horrendously botched assignment we are introduced to Pazzi, a detective located in Florence. It just so happens that upon Dr. Lecter's escape he made his way to Florence to live life low-key. This saddens me, since low-key is not the way we like Lecter. Pazzi is working for Mason Verger, a one time child molester who suffered a less than desirable fate at the hands of Lecter back in the years when he was working as a psychotherapist. Now reduced to life on a respirator among other horrendous disabilities he is seeking to end the life of this monster.Luckily for Lecter he himself has been sending letters to Clarice, maybe to console, maybe to destroy...who knows. Truth be told it was when reading these letters that I found my blood the most chilled. With the letters in hand Clarice is able to find Lecter, and it's in that discovery that she may have the chance to help that man that's helped her in one way or another.One thing that Harris has going for him is his writing style. He has the ability to crawl under your skin with mere words. Sadly, he's not as effective in his third entry as he was in his first and then supremely in his second. Still, he does pretty darn good with extending shivers to the reader. Here Thomas has decided to make Hannibal more relatable, human maybe and its here that he loses me because we don't want to relate to this man...we enjoy the mystery in his eyes. The monsters here lie in Mason and to a degree even Pazzi. The problem is that Hannibal Lecter loses his edge, his fear inspiring stare and causes the reader to all but lose interest. Thomas shouldn't have strayed from a winning formula. Like I said, it's not to say it's a complete waste of time. It's not. I enjoyed the read through and I'm sure you will too, but if you loved the monster that Thomas created be prepared for a letdown when that monster becomes man."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I adore Thomas Harris for having the balls to take his characters Clarice and Hannibal and put them in settings so over the top and extreme that it makes you wonder just what TH was smoking while writing this novel. I've heard over and over that he ruined what he began with Red Dragon/Silence of the Lambs, but Hannibal seems like a perfect sequel to me. I was worried it would be another Clarice chases Dr. Lechter scenario, and it is to a degree, but there is so much more at work here. The blossoming love affair between them (so stupidly removed from the film) is a natural progression. Clarice has become the ultimate outsider, thirsty for revenge against the FBI and the people who ruined her career. Mason Verger, who drinks the tears of children in his martini's, almost tops Hannibal for bizare. Mason's lesbian sister, the flashbacks of Hannibal and his sister, the house Hannibal has created in his mind where he stores his vast knowledge, Clarice's unsettling return to the institution where she first met Lechter and the incredibly written final scene were all left on the cutting room floor for the film. Bravo to TH for not giving us more of the same."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm only 15. When Silence of the Lambs came out i was only 2. So, as you can appreciate, i have not had to wait as long as some of you waited for this novel. In fact, i read it only about 2 weeks after i read SoTL. SO, my expectations had not been heightened by the passage of time.Nonetheless, this book is a masterpiece. There is no other word to describe it.Harris is a master. This is a wonderful gesture from Harris, giving the finger to all who fans who expected something rather like a carbon copy of SoTL, or even something vaguely similar. Harris here tells us that his novels will be dictated by what he wants to write, not what the public wants him to write.Harris comes up with a wonderfully gothic plot, and the way he writes is beautiful. The prose sings with intelligence and poetical value.Harris has created some great characters here. He builds on Barney, who we met in the last book, he delves deeper into Clarice's psyche, and explores Hannibal in a way that is vivid and realistic. Not to mention Mason Verger, who does superly as the disfigured and vengeful villain. And beside him you have Margot Verger, who is the best subsidiary character Harris has ever created. At first she is meek, then strong, and at the end finally comes into her gruesome own. Then we have Rinaldo Pazzi, another great character, out to trap Hannibal, but ultimate, inevitably, falls victim to him in a particularly horrible way. Wonnderfully done.Another stunning piece of villainly is Paul Krendler, who we just cheer at when meets his fate.Hannibal Lecter is back, and he is bigger and better than ever.The ending to this book is possibly the best to any fictional piece of writing i have ever come across. The last pages shimmer with brilliance and nostalgia. The last chapter is great, the last paragraphs inspirational, the last line, simply stunning. A great, great ending.Trumps expectations."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is one of the most disappointing books that I have ever read. Hannibal Lecter is merely a shell of his former self and Clarice Starling is a lame pawn in the goings on of men. I will give Harris credit for Mason Verger. Verger was brilliantly disgusting! On the whole though, the story was quite lame as far as thrillers go. After years of waiting for the next Harris book I felt extremely flat at the end. The ending was absolutely absurd. Hopefully we've seen the last of Hannibal and Clarice."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Dull characters, obscenely unreal plot line, and, dare I say?, BORING. A huge dissapointment. Throwing in a few obscure literary and culinary references does not make for an intelligent book, when the characters are one-dimensional and the writing is stilted and dry. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this over-hyped drivel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I couldn't get over the feeling that I wasn't reading a book but reading a shooting script for a movie. Granted it wasn't laid out for a dialog reading but all the short scenes, graphic layout...it just felt wrong. I liked the book overall but just wish it was more of a novel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What a disappointment. It was difficult to read the book because of its boring, non-substantive plot. The characters never developed nor did any level of excitement. Too much time is spent on non-important events and the build up to the plot seems as though it takes an eternity.Technical textbooks are an easier read than this lemon."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was truly diappointed by Hannibal. It starts out wonderfully,with Clarice Starling right in the middle of more FBI action. Butthen, Harris takes the story to Florence. It loses steam from there and the end is completely unbelievable."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While &quot;Hannibal&quot; details some very violent acts, I do not think this offers the same sort of punch as &quot;The Red Dragon&quot; or &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. There is a hunt and he is the prey, but you feel Dr. Lector can handle it. However, there was a different kind of punch---my own reaction to the final outcome surprised me. Maybe that was the point, to seduce the reader into a more palatable view of Hannibal Lector and then have to consider why that happened.It has been awhile since I read &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, but I remember I felt tense and anxious reading the book. Even though there were qualities I liked in Dr. Lector, he really bothered me. He was evil. This time I liked him and he limited himself to only a few tastes of the &quot;free-range rude.&quot; Of course, there are the parallel threads of Clarice and the hunter of Dr. Lector. Clarice has had some tough times since her last interaction with Dr. Lector, and Dr. Lector's hunter supplies most of the violent, dismal acts in the name of revenge. Eventually, these threads come together.I have to admit I enjoyed the demise of Clarice's jerky antagonist, but I am not sure about her new journey. Just when you thought it was safe, Dr. Lector goes to work on her psyche. To me this should be more insidious than his dining habits, but I did not feel that way. Somehow it seemed to be ok and I floated along with the plot.Where will she go from here? I guess I will have to wait and see, for it cannot end like this. I believe Clarice deserves a better outcome, and I don't want to like Dr. Lector."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The novel is just a dark, satiric ride through the moral wasteland we're living in, playing against reader's expectations. I had one hell of a time with it. Clever, fast and mean. And 100% unadulterated by editors, agents or &quot;market&quot; expectations. Harris just published what he wanted, and he's one hell of a thriller writer."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"i revel at Harris' ability to make the reader feel sypathetic for Hannibal. He truly is a monster, but i was rooting for him all the way through. interesting that both mason and hannibal have younger sisters, but it is the very &quot;monster&quot;-Hannibal, who is tender and loving toward his sister even after her horrible death, whereas mason abused his sister and enjoyed watching her suffer. There are lots of interesting parallels in this book. The part with the dinner did make me slightly urpy, but made me cheer at the same time. the only dim spot is the end. It leaves the reader unsatisfied, almost like having dinner and no dessert. other than that a most addicting an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I didn't read &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, nor the first part of this trilogy. I was only familiar with it via the films, which captured a perfectly horrifying set of images. I am now fully prepared to hand over all of that credit to the filmmakers. After reading &quot;Hannibal&quot; I can only assume that Thomas Harris is happier than I am. With this book he can finally put an end to the &quot;when's the sequel&quot; question that has popped up for years. It seems as though that was the sole purpose to this book, to end a series as ridiculously as possible as to guarantee no demands for a new installment. Yes, at times you are sufficiently spooked, and yes also, you spend far too much time reading about entrails. In the last act, you can almost imagine Harris at the keyboard clickly madly as he tries to come up with the most outlandish and absurd finale. I do hope that this truly is the last we see of Hannibal."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris-please work on your endings. This book was the prime example of why you should just leave a good story alone and not bother writting a sequel. Silence of the Lambs was fabulous but Hannibal ruined everything Clarice is and made her a weakling."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The first 400 pages are well-written and captivating. The last hundred or so border on ridiculous. Still, worth a read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"From time to time, I was annoyed at the change of viewpoint, narrative, first person.. but it often gave me the feeling that Lecter himself was narrating the story. I'm not sure how I feel about the ending, but it wasn't a cop-out. Maybe he could have been a little more exploratory there.. talking us through some of the deeper wells of psychology that many of us are missing. However, this is not a book for those readers who want to be hand fed the meaning of everything. It was a deliberate ending with deep meaning, and it ties into Lecter's past. I enjoyed the book, and was not disturbed or dissapointed in the ending one bit. Thank you, Mr. Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm not sure what disappoints me more, the book, or the good reveiws, most notably Mr. King's. Erasing the line between popular fiction and literature? Give me a break. This book was horribly written. The author changed from present tense to past tense at every whim within the same paragraph. And the senator's name was spelled different in various parts of the book. Ridiculous. Did no one proofread this? As to the story, there was no suspense, just the gruesome details that a writer of Harris' obvious ability needn't have stooped to. I have my doubts that he even wrote this. Although I enjoyed the book as I would a cheap horror flick, I can scarcely recommend it. And I agree with those who didn't care for the ending. Totally absurd and random and should have stayed in the author's deleted files."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After eagerly awaiting the sequel to Silence of the Lambs, I was very disappointed with Hannibal.If you liked the author's two previous books, DON'T read Hannibal."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I found this book to be predictable and disjointed. Harris should let an editor work with him since he constantly interrupts the flow of the story with psycho-babble. The method of Mason Verger's revenge is totally unbelievable. Anyone with a brain in their head would not be surprised at the ending. Since the two main characters seem very happy at the end, I can only hope there is no possibility of another Hannibal Lecter novel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book does not have the suspenseful plotting or naratative drive of the two other books in this seris.Red Dragon was better than TSOL but, both books used Lecter as a foil to balance the disturbing natures of the two seemingly normal protagonists. Verger, used in that capacity in Hannibal was unrealistic. As a soap opera to flesh out the characters from TSOL this book is somewhat interesting. A prequel showing how Graham initially caught Lecter would have been far more entertaining.This is the first hardcover fiction book I've bought in years ,I will not make this mistake again."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I couldn't put \\"Hannibal\\" down! I know some critics had a problem with the fact that the reader's sympathy lies with Hannibal rather than Mason, but these critics don't get the morality in Hannibal's madness. He only kills under two circumstances: when he's trying to escape and when he's punishing other \\"sickos\\". The \\"Memory Palace\\" was an intriging concept. And I loved the ending, as far-fetched as it seemed. I can't image the film following it exactly, but I can't wait to see it!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If I wanted to read an Ann Rice novel, I would have a purchased an Ann Rice novel.

You'll understand why when you finish the book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I vote with the two star customer review. Starlings character not at all like her previous roll. Hollywood may be able to have a better ending; at least hope so. I felt let down by the end of the book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If you expected a happy, friendy, female-FBI-agent-takes-in-Hannibal ending, then I am sorry for you and you have my pity. Anyone who has read 'Red Dragon' knows better. Also, your so-called 'justification' of Lecter's madness is not cause for disgust. For one, we all as human beings are shaped through childhood. For another, we are not all totally inhuman, not even the worst sociopaths among us. Lastly, hypnosis, brainwashing and Stockholm Syndrome have been with us for years. Why, all of a sudden, is trained psychiatrist Lecter's brainwashing of Starling so utterly impossible? Is it because Starling is written as a real human being, or because most of you wish to believe she is inhuman? As inhuman as Lecter? Please explain."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'll keep this brief...this is a terrible book. Tedious to read as it is uninteresting at times and so far from what the &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; was all about, it's as if someone other then Thomas Harris wrote it.It probably would have been better if someone had.I couldn't put into words how unbelievable and disappointing the ending is. It definitely was not worth the time or money. Don't bother."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I just finished reading this book yesterday and felt that I had to let you all know how bad this book is. I had such high hopes for it when it came out as I loved &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot; However after reading it - I wish that I hadn't wasted my time. Most of the characters are disappointingly flat (especially Starling) and the ending is a complete joke. Harris has spent too much time describing the scenery and not enough time developing the plot. It seems like he wrote this in order to cash in from the success of the previous book. I FEEL ROBBED! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading, enjoying and evangelising Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, this is a huge disappointment. The characterisation plumbs new depths of childishness, the plot (killer pigs) is contrived and the ending just simply beggars the belief that the previous two novels instilled you with that 'this could actually be happening'. Thomas Harris should go away, take stock and reconsider his abilities. Just writing what you can does not a good novel make. It's not a thriller, it's not suspenseful, it's not worth it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Upon hearing Jodi Foster wanted nothing to do with the next Hannibal movie, I was initally disappointed. Then I read the book. Where is the Harris who thrilled me through Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs? After shooting this dog full of holes, I am afraid to re-read those classics, fearing I might find fault with them. Have I become more sophisticated, or has Harris sold out? I fear the latter. The premise was unconvincing and contrived. I specifically requested this book as a gift and would like to publicly ask her forgiveness for money wasted!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Standing alone, Hannibal is an entertaining read. However, when compared along side classics such as Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs, it leaves a little to be desired. Harris weaves an interesting, if slightly unbelievable, story, and the reader is able to easily follow along as the inner cogs of the storyline mesh seemlessly together. While Harris's storytelling ability, and astounding use of the vernacular, acts as the main strenght of this work, he limits the character development which have grown throughout the previous two novels. Ultimately, the departure from main characters' expected behavior results in a disappointing end to the trilogy. This novel will be most successful for those reading it independently of the first two works."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If you enjoyed the creeping terror and edge-of-your-seat suspense of &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, be prepared for something very different in &quot;Hannibal&quot;. Sure, it still has the requisite bits of gross horor, and Lecter still has his taste for human flesh- but what's missing is that sense of terror in the other two books, the notion that some monster could be waiting outside for you, and there was nothing you could do about it.The Hannibal Lecter in &quot;Hannibal&quot; is still a murdering sociopath, but this time aorund he seesm to have good justification for all his acts of crime. He gets a childhood. He becomes- dare I say it- a sympathetic figure. And that pretty much takes away most of the suspense.The figure of Claire Sterling isn't fleshed out at all; she's a central character, but so poorly drawn as to be almost incidental to the plot, as are a numebr of other characters who drop in for a visit.Most of the plot is telegraphed to the reader so early on that there just aren't any surpises, save one- and that one is so seemingly illogical as to appear completely unmotivated.In short, a fair piece of suspense writing, but not up to the author's previous books."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was disturbing in many ways, not one of them interesting. No one who read SOL and understood the characters could believe that they are the same people in this book. I enjoy being scared by Thomas Harris; This book was not frightening just gross. If you loved SOL &amp; TRD do not waste your time with this book. This book was not frightening just gross."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is the first novel by Thomas Harris I read, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. On the negative side -- I did see the movie, The Silence of the Lambs, and I do find it difficult to picture Jodie Foster's Starling (and most likely, as other reviewers have stated, the book's characterization of her) as Hannibal's Starling. Also I was disappointed that Mr. Harris chose to let some of his more interesting characters go, and bring to the forefront more -- yes -- TV-like -- creations. Nonetheless I truly liked this book -- I couldn't put it down. Harris writes well and includes some beautiful Italian poetry, and interesting references to Dante. I would recommend this book, except to those more easily grossed-out."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If you like really morbid, sublimely written fiction this is it. It makes Silence of the Lambs look like child's story. A unique reading experience. One of the few books that I will probably read again."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is a ride through hell! Perhaps the best way to describe this thriller is on the level of a dark and graphic horror film you wouldn't want to watch and go to bed afterward! Mr.Harris has done it again,writing in unrestrained detail which grabs you by the throat refusing to let go....Just when you thought Agent Starling was a heroine..wait until you reach the climax of this book,for the shock of your life! I absolutely love a story like this,even the cannibalism...because I've written about a cannibal character myself. -Ken Knight(author of CRYPTX)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I've never felt compelled to offer a review on Amazon, but Hannibal inspired me. There are some books I wish I could un-read. This was one of them. I threw the book away after reading it. I am no English major, yet I couldn't help notice the number of obvious grammatical errors in the book. Apart from poor technical achievement, the author also irritates by attempting to impress us with his knowledge of art and food and finer things to the point where he appears conceited. And finally, we're supposed to like Hannibal? He still eats people! That's wrong... isn't it? Don't buy this book. If you have started it, put it down. It won't get any better if you stick with it until the end."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I found Hannible to be a tale so sharp and clear, so effortlessly woven with the sights, smells and sensations of the world of it's characters, that the book connected at a far deeper level than I am accustomed to. I listened to the unabridged audio tape version of the book on my drive to and from work and found myself constantly drawn to think of the passages I'd just heard throughout the rest of the day. Although dark and disturbing, the exquisite skill which Hannibal Lechter uses in manipulating those around him is truely masterful. Upon finishing the book I went back and listened to passages again just to revel in the settings. A wonderful journey through a dark and mysterious mind, but a mind which ultimately is not so different after all."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"And it started out so interesting! But by the end, Hannibal seemed way out of character, and Clarice wasn't the same Clarice from Silence of the Lambs. I was disappointed by the ending. Not nearly as good as Harris' other works."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read Silence of the Lambs in a few days, it kept me so enthrallled. HANNIBAL took over a month to finish. I was so uninterested in it I had to force myself to finish it since I had paid for it! The last part of it was so ridiculous. If I had just waited and gotten it at the library I would have taken it back after a third of the pages."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Riveting sequence of events. It was nice to be able to picture Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster as the main characters in this book. I hope they come back for the movie version. This book was extremely well thought out but admittedly dry with all the Italian history. Maybe that's only because I am not Italian! Thank you Mr. Harris!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I adored Silence of the Lambs and was quite excited to read Hannibal... it was extremely difficult to get into. SLOW initially. Finally it started to pick up and I was going to keep on giving it a try. I believe that Harris was trying way too hard to outdo his work from Silence of the Lambs. How gross can we make this? How ludicrous can this be? He tried too hard and I feel that it unfortunately was what ruined it. Harris is a quality writer - and it seems to me that he tried too hard to create a new masterpiece rather than writing a good book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was very disappointed in this book, I hated the ending, it made Starling out to be a complete idiot. It showed Starling with zero backbone and none of her cleverness from the first book. Hannibal (character) was good and I understood the concept of the entire book, I just think it could have had a different ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Readable, but lacking any credibility and deeply disappointing when compared to Red Dragon / Silence of the Lambs."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I loved the rich characters in Silence...., but here, Harris basically abandons Clarice and instead creates an atmospheric, gruesome and gothic story around Hannibal himself. What is missing is the resolve and further development of precisely what made these two characters so intriguing in Silence -- their fierce respect for one another, and their implicit &quot;oppositeness&quot;. We never get what we want in this book, which comes from a completely different angle. For those of you who enjoyed the ending, I could not disagree more -- it has one the most disappointing finales in recent fiction, certainly that involve characters we know. I simply have decided to separate this story from the clarity and near-perfection of Silence..., which is a breed apart."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"When I heard that Thomas Harris had written a sequel to Silence of the Lambs I was truly anxious to pick up the book. Now I'm sorry I did. I have always been a fan of thriller mysteries, and had read Mr. Harris' last two books. To me, his latest was an exercize in total gratuitous violence, graphic beyond any extent of the imagination. Honestly, the only reason I finished the book, was to find out the fate of Clarice Starling and the titled character. The story started out well enough, catching up the reader on Clarice Starling's career in the FBI. Then we are introduced to Mason Verger, a victim of Dr. Lector's who survived the horrible experience of being eaten alive by dogs that he himself had starved and that Lector had conveniently released to feed on their master. You not only learn of the perverse history of this horrible man (or what's left of him) but of his gruesome plans to capture Dr. Lector and feed hime alive to a specially bred (for this purpose) herd of wild pigs. When I reached this point in the book, all I could think about was how someone could have actually come up with these horrible descriptions and actually included them in the plot. Not only did Mr. Harris describe in detail what the pigs were being trained to do, but insisted that the kidnappers listen to tapes of victims past who had succumbed to similar fates. The final pages of the story were a feeble effort to bring Clarice and Hannibal into a liaison that no Lector fans would find the least bit plausible. A redeeming aspect of the book, if I had to pick one, is that Harris did develop a history for Hannibal that might explain his cannibalistic tendencies and an interesting effort in the end to woo the reader over to accepting Dr. Lector's evil ways. This read could only be intended for those with stomachs of steel who don't mind being exposed to the truly evil criminal mind. Can you say Ewwh?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was truly intriguing from cover to cover. Harris is a MASTER writer! For those who rated this below 4 or 5 stars, just who do think can do it better???"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I must admit that when I picked up this novel, I was expecting to be scared silly. I hate to disappoint everyone, but a cross-dressing midget is a scarier image than the ones this book creates. Albeit, the writing in this novel is above average, Harris leaves the reader wanting more. I must admit, that plot line was intriguing, but suffered from the &quot;Hollywood Effect&quot;, that is, the author felt as though he was running out of room and tried to tie up everything quickly, leaving his reader out in the cold. The ending (not to give it away) is a considerable cop out, typical of this type of genre. The flushing out of Lecter's character was a welcome addition to the novel, but overall I felt as though the flushing out of his new persona was all for not. I just realized how negative this review turned out, if you are a fan of Stephen King, and the rest of &quot;those&quot; authors, feel free to pick up this one, you won't be let down. Typical of the genre, not adding anything new, Hannibal will take its place in the canon of the &quot;modern horror fiction&quot; novel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thought the book read very well, and maintained a god pace. However, it did not have the psychological impact that the other two books (Red Dragon, and Silence of the Lambs)had. It did have some enjoyable and vivid moments and I recommend this book to any suspense fans."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris is such a joy to read. This book provided me with many wonderful hours of reading. Hannible is horrible, but some of the characters Harris presents in this novel are so bad that Hannible is a (anti) hero, righting the wrongs that society cannot seem to avenge. There is also one of the funniest scenes I have ever read, as Harris describes Dr Lecter flying back from Europe in coach on a crowded aircraft. Read this book and enjoy it. Harris is far better than many of his fellow top-notch writers, including James Patterson (Cat and Mouse, etc.), John Sandford (Easy Prey, etc.) and Rory Smith (Devil In The Metal). I can't wait for the next book to find out how our lunatic (anti) hero is doing!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Of all Harris's novels, this is probably the most gripping read. I enjoyed both RED DRAGON and THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. Neither of those books are as absorbed with the Hannibal Lecter character as this one. They both dealt with the idea of a serial killer trying to transform himself. (Incidentally, there's a really fascinating analysis of these characters in a book about American horror fiction called A DARK NIGHT'S DREAMING for anyone interested in this kind of thing.)This latest novel focuses on Hannibal Lecter's relationship with Clarice Starling. Lecter is typical of great horror villains in that the reader identifies with him as a sensitive (and even romantic) genius as much as he/she is repelled by Lecter's violence and his sociopathic behavior. In some ways, Lecter is not unlike certain depictions of Dracula. This balance is fascinating, both for the readers and for Starling, but while Harris managed to walk the line in earlier novels where Lecter is in the background, he can't pull it off here where Lecter IS the story.A big issue of debate in the readers' reviews here is whether the ending works. I won't give anything away, except to say that I don't think it does. In the end, Lecter has to go one way or the other--we either end up having to sympathize and identify with him or deplore him. As I said, I won't tell you which way Harris goes, but it doesn't really matter. Neither way can work, and the second half (or at least the last third) of the book is a disappointment. It is a good read, though."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris could so easily have returned us to Clarice Starling, seven years later, to find her the successful FBI agent riding shotgun to a sage-like Jack Crawford,catching Hannibal Lecter after a crisis of conscience along the way and riding off into the sunset waving a righteous law enforcement flag,If that is what you want- read something by John Grisham.I enjoyed Hannibal without reservation,thankfully unpredictable, well read by Daniel Gerroll(I have'nt heard the abridged version read by the Author to compare-I did'nt want to miss a single word!)Enjoy this story by candlelight and a nice chianti, but don't expect to sleep......"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is a man who has NEVER written a bad or even mediocre book in his LIFE. What I can't understand is why EVERYONE who reviewed this book mentioned &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; and so few mentioned &quot;Red Dragon&quot; which is, in my own opinion, Harris' finest work. The Lecter Trilogy, as well as &quot;Black Sunday&quot; should be required reading for fans of suspense fiction."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I recently become addicted to books on tape as a result of an extended commute time. However, what I have found is that when the author reads his own work, you can usually expect to be disappointed. And I was. Thomas Harris may be a great writer of fiction for all I know, but he is absolutely terrible as a narrator. His monotone dialogue almost put me to sleep at the wheel. He did not change the inflection in his voice to reflect when the different characters were speaking, which most professionals do. As such, I only made it through the first tape and then stuck it back in my collection for a possible later listening when I am comatose or brain dead and it might sound more interesting at that time. All books on tape should be read by professional actors, not the authors. The authors usually write great (which is why they get to audio tape), but they read rotten. I truly wish Hannibal was read by Jay O. Sanders, David Ogden Stiers, John Pankow, or someone who had experience doing this sort of thing. My advice would be maybe to get the book, but ABSOLUTELY DO NOT buy the audio tape. It is truly awful. I think I'll try to sell mine at auction. Unfortunately I probably will get only about 2 cents, which is about what it is worth."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"For fans who have anxiously anticipated another lush, vivid thriller on par with Harris' previous novels, this rag is a bitter disappointment. Convoluted plot twists and unlikely characterizations stand in for Harris' former realism - you won't be terrified, or even alarmed. You'll be lucky if you're still awake after wading through the florid Tuscany passages...like the winding marble staircases of medieval towers, Harris' ornate, rambling metaphors require great effort and often lead nowhere. (You think that sentence was bad, try reading the book.) This story is a complete departure from anything even remotely possible, but is too lightweight to be called \\"fantasy\\" - \\"bogus\\" is more like it. Harris' half-baked allusions to the preternatural will send the Goth crowd back to the shelf for their Anne Rice, while FBI buffs and true-crime fans shouldn't even pick this book up. The silliest moments in this text are Harris' references to math and Stephen Hawking - Dude, write what you know. (At least the pseudo-science provides some warning for an utterly cheesy ending.) How odd that Stephen King wrote such a positive review - he must own stock in Random House. Prepare to work overtime suspending your disbelief if you read this book or see the movie - no wonder Jodie Foster turned up her nose. She has the right idea."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"When I began reading this book I had extremely high hopes: I hoped to be entertained, I hoped that I would finish the book in one sitting as I had Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon, and I hoped to learn more about the fates of Hannibal and Clarice. Having studied death scene investigation and serial killers myself, and being interested in learning more about the FBI, I have always loved his books. Unfortunately, I have to agree with many other people who have written scathing reviews of Harris' newest book. I was impressed with the European flair of this new book, but I was less than impressed with the use of Italian at key points. Unfortuantely some of us took French in college, I guess. His use of history as a backdrop for some of the story was interesting, but I don't think it's what most of us expected. I think we were expecting another &quot;true crime&quot; story, and that's why we bought the book. What we got was more of a &quot;murder mystery&quot; type of story. We also got a story that was seemingly tailored for the forthcoming movie, and an ending that will make all of the sappy movie goers happy. But I personally threw the book across the room when I finished, and vowed never to buy one of his books again (or go see the movie)."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This novel degenerates into an Austin-Powers sort of ending, so ludicrious that it was easy for me to imagine Lecter looking up from his harpsichord and saying, &quot;Good evening, Clarice. You look so..shagadelic! Rowrrr..oh, behave, you naughty thing!&quot; Thomas Harris has been a fine novelist up to now. What happened?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"How disappointing! While SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was suspenseful and thought provoking, HANNIBAL is predictable, boring and overly gruesome. The ending...well, it totally goes against what we know about Starling's character. I bought it the minute it came out. No patience! Had I waited even one day, I would have seen the awful reviews."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"An intelligent reader will recognize the ending as the best part of the book, specifically, the last twenty pages. It's not a cop out, and just because it didn't end with the violence that was expected is no reason to dismiss it. The reader who fully contemplates the characters will realize that the ending is both shocking and logical, and it paints the mood of the book in disctincly gothic hues. I defy anyone to name a sequence in a mainstream, popular novel that approaches the creativity of the dinner scene."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I loved The Silence of the Lambs, and was excited to read Hannibal. I read Lambs right before Hannibal, and I think that Thomas Harris or his editor should have refreshed themselves too! Not fifty pages into the book, he makes a reference to Lambs that is inaccurate! I was stunned, and irritated. The style of Hannibal is totally different from that of The Silence of the Lambs. I think I may have liked this book better if I had never read Lambs. The scenes seem implausable, and is written in a dreamy quality I was not looking for in this novel. Some of the references to pop culture are wrong as well, another editing problem. (It wasn't &quot;La Macarena&quot;) I don't recommend this book if you loved The Silence of the Lambs and are looking for anything similar. You will be very disappointed. If you go in with no expectations, it's an OK book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thought that Red Dragon was one of the best books of its genre that I had read, and SOTL was, arguably, even better. I can only assume that Hannibal was the author's reaction to the glorification of Hannibal Lecter that followed the movie of SOTL. If so, and Hannibal is indeed a parody of his earlier work, then Harris holds his readers in the ultimate contempt. I came away from this book feeling angry and disgusted (not to mention, cheated). This book has no redeeming qualities, and quite apart from its basic depravity, it's a big waste of time. It is sick, and my advice to the author is: &quot;seek professional help&quot;. By the way, Australian coins come in the following denominations: 5cents, 10, 20, 50, $1, and $2."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Although Hannibal is not nearly as good as Silence of the Lambs, it is at least extremely sickening. Thomas Harris knows all the soft spots that made my stomach twinge, even more so than Silence. Worth the read, if not the money, only for its semi - interesting plot and surprise ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris couldn't have had a better chance of another hit, but boy did he certainly blow it. The strong characters he built in Silence of the Lambs were changed dramatically. What scared me so in the first book was that the plot could be somewhat plausible. Again, Harris destroyed this possibility especially with his ridiculous ending. I wound up kicking myself for spending time reading the book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris revealed himself at last in this stinker of a self-parody. It shows he has nothing but contempt for his readers. Anyone can go to the library and search back issues of The Wine Spectator, Cuisine Magazine and Fodor's Italy and come up with enough obscure references to truffles and wine to sound erudite to the unwashed masses. This book was not a thriller. It contained no thrill. Harris just filled 484 pages with his self gratification fantasies dressed up like trailer trash at the opera."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Alas poor reader it is true; the author has poked you in the eye. I quote (page 128)'The exposition of Autrocious Torture Instruments could not fail to appeal to a connoisseur of the worst in mankind. But the essence of the worst ......is found in the faces of the crowd.' Hey! this is you. What a shot. Anyway, the book stinks. The ending is ludicrous. Read something else."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After SOTL and RD, to say I feel let down is a ludicrous understatement. Is the purpose of this book expressed in the first paragraph of chapter 20?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal Lecter, the evil, cunning and shadowy figure of the &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; becomes one of the greatest dark-heroes ever created. By the masterpiece of Harris, we meet him again, this time with no bars between us. Perfect gentleman, troubled scientist, uncanny genius and ravening killer. All in one, and all in harmony. Under the setting sun, he plays Bach on his harpsichord while dining on his victim, savouring the exquisite taste of selected wine and human flesh. From Gothic Floransa to United States, a relentless chase issues, but it is difficult to distinct who is the hunter, and who the prey. Great work, summing up all the beauty of &quot;The Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. Should definitely be read before the film."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I don't get out much to see movies, and heard &quot;Hannibal&quot; was pretty gory, so I got the book. I thought &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; was a good book and movie -- and expected more of the same. Well, what a TOTAL waste of time, ink, paper, money! Terrible. Vile for the sake of being vile, and the conclusion was so utterly implausible. No *wonder* Jodie Foster didn't want to do this movie! The whole thing reads like a rush-writeup of someone's bad (and weird) dream. Very very disappointing. Two thumbs down. (Why aren't NO stars available?)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I first saw the movie, &quot;Hannibal&quot; and was complety blown away. The movie was good, but the book was SOOO much better! I didn't think that was possible, but it is. This book is beautifully written, full of suspense and other little things. How Thomas Harris describes Florence, Mason Verger, and other things makes me want to melt. Everyone should read this to be graced by the same magic..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is hard to put down! Harris did a lot of research on this one. The invention of the mind of Hannibal Lector is a masterpeice of it own! A lot of twists and turns! Just when you think you know what direction Harris is taking...BAM! He gets ya!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"At the time I aquired 'Hannibal' I had never before read anything by Thomas Harris. Sure I had seen the film 'The Silence of the Lambs,' but as everyone knows the movie rarely does the book any credit. This book was so good that immediately after I finished reading it, I ran to the nearest book store and purchased both 'Red Dragon' and 'TSOTL.' The story was engrossing, fast paced, and very detailed. I could feel the frustration that Clarice must have felt and I could almost see the farm house where Dr. Lector had observed the brutal death of his sister. This quality of writing is a pleasure and an honour to read. I just can't understand why people are criticizing it. Sure, the ending was a blow to the senses, but really what did you expect. That Clarice and Lector would have a fight to the death, that she would capture him again, no! If you thought that, you obviously didn't pay any attention to the events in this novel. If you haven't already read this book, do so...right now! You won't regret it, unless of course you enjoy cliched endings. Lord knows I don't. Thank you"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I usually try not to spread bad vibes -- what's the point, really? -- but so much great stuff was written about this one on its jacket that I have to vent my disappointment somewhere.When characters are rendered vibrantly, you can &quot;hear&quot; who's talking without the author having to say it. Here, even with Harris telling you, the voices -- save Lecter -- are indistinguishable on any but the most superficial (and artificial) level.Every character is a caricature of type. It's expected to have its monsters of course, but a disfigured &quot;Christian&quot; who makes underpriveleged children cry and then swabs their tears to add to his martinis? Puh-leeez...No worse, but certainly no better, than a lot of others."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Overall, I really liked this book. I thought it had a better plot and was much better written than Harris's first, Silence of the Lambs. However, Hannibal seemed to be less suspenseful and the plot really dragged on in certain places. In Silence of the Lambs, Harris first introduced agent Clarice Starling of the FBI, and Dr. Hannibal Lecter, i.e. Hannibal the Cannibal. Hannibal delves further into the closet of Dr. Lecter and Clarice's minds, exploring the deep dark psychological disturbances that hide there, finding what makes them tick. When Mason Verger, a former patient of Dr. Lecter and a victim of his cannabalistic ways, discovers that Hannibal has escaped from the mental institution that he was once confined to, he plots revenge. With the help of Agent Starling, Mason sucessfully locates Dr. Lecter's secret hiding place, and plans to capture him and feed him alive to the hogs. But something goes wrong, and Dr. Lecter is once again on the run. Soon into the plot, Mason's plans for Hannibal are learned by the FBI, and Dr. Lecter is now running from not only Mason, but Clarice and the federal government as well. She has the upper hand in the chase, knowing Hannibal more intimately than Mason ever could've. But it is he who eventually ends up capturing Dr. Lecter. Everything seems to be going as planned for Mr. Verger, until an unexpected plot twist involving his sister, Margot, and Lecter's former caregiver, Clarence, unveils. The ending caught me completely offguard, and while the details got a little gory and nauseating at times, i thought it was definently a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I expected there to be a similar story, ending in the same situation as Silence of the lambs did -deaths,Clarice Starling does her job well, but Hannibal is still on the loose. However Harris has given a new approach ; a story more complex and very different from the last, with a very unexpected but satisfying end."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Ok... Before I let rip, I didn't read Silence of the Lambs, Or Red Dragon, I saw the Movie years back, loved it, waited for the next book, and hoped for a sequel that would be a good read that would go well on the silver screen. When I got to the end of this book this morning, I said \\"Thank God.. I made it to the end\\". Did the editor forget to leave out the drivel?The Dr. Lector character maintains his depth and passion, which is why this gets two stars and not one, but this was relied upon much to heavily. Their is an element of tension, but it staggered towards it like a whining child in a supermarket, and when it finally made it, it was a relief and no real surprise. Stephen King remains the master of suspense and horror.The final insult came with the books conclusion, I personally found it poor, an insult to Starlings character, and much too difficult to believe.I had the image of Anthony Hopkins throughout the book, and he will bring color to the part, but with a book like this to base a film upon, there will be no need to write an acceptance speech this time."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Okay, I'm not going to give an intelligent analysis of Hannibal. Instead, I will just say that I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It is engrossing! The characters are realistic and Hannibal himself is depicted as human (very different than some stories, where the character is made into a demi-god). And for those who hate predictable books, this book is for you....I would've never guessed the ending!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hollywood has gone to Harris' head. Gone are the cunningly crafted characters and hold-your-breath plot from &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;; in their place are caricatures and outlandishly predictable plot elements more at home in an Ed Wood film, if Ed were still alive to make movies in the 90's.Vicious, human-eating pigs. Death by electric eel. A romantic dinner of brain, frontal lobotomy al fresco while the drugged victim is still living. The plot? Oh, I'm sure it's in there somewhere. Wait a minute while I wade through three chapters on a Florentine police detective and a killer Il Monstro that has no connection whatsoever to the very thin thread of the rest of the story.Hannibal Lecter, whose genius fascinated us in &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, has gone down several notches in intelligence, with his malignant cunning cut down to a shadow of itself. His actions are completely predictable, as are those of his nemesis, a half-cannibalized pedophile who is out to revenge himself on the good doctor.The worst betrayal of all is what happens to the character of Clarice in the book's last chapters. The buzz is that this book has been optioned by Hollywood before it hit the shelves. Please, Jodie, Anthony----don't do it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I started this book in a haze of expectation and finished it in a fog of disappointment. Tom Harris owes me five hours of my life back. I agree with the reviewer who wrote that Harris was more interested in continuing his series than in writing an actual book. This book owes more to Hollywood slasher films and bad horror writers like Stephen King than to any interest in continuing fascinating characters. In fact, I thought that with the exception of Hannibal himself, no character in this book acted in a way consistent with their former portrayals. Clarice's seduction by the dark side of the Force is certainly a prime example. I also didn't like anyone in this book - they were all awful people and I had no-one to root for. Perhaps others can enjoy novels where everyone is a total bastard, but I can't do it. I also think that things you imagine are far scarier than things you can see, so revealing so much of Hannibal's past was a big error - it makes him more understandable, and in my experience understanding reduces fear. Overall, I would say that if you absolutely have to read this book, get it from the library. Or you could wait for the inevitable movie, though many are saying it is an unfilmable book. That didn't stop them from filming Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, did it? This piece of junk will make a terrible movie, but let's face it, it's made a terrible novel, too."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Like many of Amazon's early reviewers, I am a Thomas Harris fan. Otherwise we'd wait for the paperback, right? Most of the reviews I've read compare the book with the previous Lecter novels, 'Red Dragon' and 'Silence'. 'Hannibal' isn't more of the same. It is beyond the comfortable. If this book doesn't disturb you, you have a problem.Harris' writing has two strengths: his illuminating perceptions of the minutiae of personal interaction; and his appalling imagination for the psychotic.If you want to learn a little bit more about yourself and those about you, and stretch your reason further than is absolutely comfortable - buy this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Another &quot;didn't want to put the book down&quot; story that took me deeper in to the life, loves and humanity of Hannibal Lechter. From beginning to end, the story continues to shock and thrill its readers while leaving a lingering &quot;taste&quot; of uncertainty. You can't help but wonder, how many villians are there in this book? Or better yet, who is the real villian seeking revenge. I hope readers are not comparing the novel to the movie [Silence of..] because it would be..well very plainly..stupid. This is a stand alone thriller full of hate, love and lust of art, food, music and more importantly, life! Unless I read passed it, how many of us thought we would finally understand what happened to Dr. Chilton? Keep guessing? How difficult was it to determine who we really hated and distrusted most? Was it Mason Verger, Margot Verger, Carlo, Paul Krendler or even Barney. Or are we disgusted with agent Starling? I was expecting closure on the relationships between Hannibal and his victims, his relationship with the FBI and of course Clarice Starling. As I eagerly read the final chapters (there are over 100) I had hoped that when I turned the last pages of the book I would have a smile on. Or maybe, just left with a nice, warm feeling inside. It didn't happen. Maybe because I was uncertain of the resulting relationship between Dr. Lechter and agent Starling. Or how will things end for the both of them? How their lives would continue. Together. Separately. Overall, I was very pleased and satisfied and hope all of us who have read the book don't become vegetarians."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Waiting 11 years for a sequel to one of my favorite books was hard enough... when the sequel is poor it's like a slap in the face. HANNIBAL is a bad book. I can't think of a single complimentary thing to say about this novel... isn't Thomas Harris a thriller writer? This book is without thrills. It turns the greatest villain of the century into a hero, and then drops him into a bad James Bondish plot (cybernetic pedophile without a face conspires to use pigs to eat off Lector's feet?!?) Endless Italy travelogue, Starling wasted, no Will Graham, needless lesbian mayhem...This should have been the greatest book of the decade, instead it was a bitter pill to swallow. I wasn't asking for the world, just a good, satisfying read. I can't even believe it's the same author."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I bought Hannibal the very hour it was released. I finished it the next day. It is SUCH a letdown, but it's not a total waste.Here are some tips when reading Hannibal:1) Don't try to picture Anthony Hopkins or Jodi Foster; this book destroys the image of an evil, mysterious Lecter and a frightened but determined Starling. In fact, it is well known that Harris never saw the film. He bloody well should have! (you'd think his precious ego would love to see an Oscar-sweeping version of his own work)2) When reading about Mason Verger, try not to think of some awful X-Files episode gone bad. A child molester with no face, one lidless eye (complete with goggle), a bull-dyke weightlifting sister, and a desire for revenge in a matter inconsistent with logic. Try VERY hard not to think of a REALLY bad X-Files ep, and you might withstand it.3) Avoid thinking of the Starsky and Hutch theme during the surprisingly goofy opening chapters. By any means necessary, don't do this.4) Referring to #1...Clarice Starling exposes her chest...twice...Jodi Foster, obviously, will not accept such a preposterous change of attitude in the character she played so well.5) When you get to the part about the Italian cop, go ahead and fast forward the alarming number of pages spent on his background, mission, etc. He is killed off and has, as a character, no importance whatsoever later on.I could go on and on, but as there's already 150 reviews, I doubt this will be read. Regardless, I will say that anyone who gives this book 5 stars has to be fooling themselves. There are two major faults, and they kill the book: a) too many characters are absolute throwaways (vis Jack Crawford), and b) there is no one to root for. When Hannibal becomes a good guy, you gotta wonder.Also, the reader learns why Hannibal is who he is. I'd rather not know this pathetically bad method to his madness.And as for the movie version that everyone (including the stars) are awaiting, they are left with a dilemma: Be faithful to the book and make one of the dumbest horror movies ever, or butcher the book completely and surprise everyone with a suspenseful variation. Let's be honest, no one wants to see Lecter and Starling become lovers after eating brains, do they? I mean, honestly!That being said, the book has some positives. Harris manages to keep the book from being boring at the same time that he keeps anything from actually happening. It is an interesting read, but more of an interest in a &quot;this is bound to get better any moment&quot; feeling.This book could have really used some fava beans."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"There's plenty of entertaining head candy in this Timothy McVeigh meets E.M. Forster picaresque, but be prepared: you will be hurt by its ending. It's an irritating final volley of chapters that casts doubt on the entire novel. Thomas Harris has developed a seductive group of characters and packaged them in a lunchbox of condescension and implausibility, neatly tied off with a silken bow.The author scraped the frontal lobes of Eco, Kundera, Anne Rice and Tom Clancy and deep-fat fried 'em in a vat. Enough nancy-boy high mindedness for budding pseudointellectuals (one review here speaks glowingly of Harris' &quot;uber-intelligence&quot;) and more than enough gore for the Jerry Springer literati. Nutjobs and stock brokers alike will happily indulge in the repetitive product placement here--Spyderco and Jaguar, you owe this book big time.Frustrating. Disappointing. If nothing else, what is our society saying about itself when an author feels compelled to grant ideational, enviable status to a sadistic cannibal? Hannibal's become a lovable scamp, a James Dean serving up Jimmy Dean headcheese.Thomas Harris has finished his trilogy, and the third installment is an Ewok-filled letdown. Sir, please get to work on Episode I."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm hoping Thomas Harris' publisher accidently published the wrong draft because this HIGHLY anticipated sequel to one of the best books in recent times is one huge disappointment. The book had a nice quick flow to it, but the story line was amateurish. After getting off to a nice start, Harris lost momentum and sold out with a very disappointing ending. I particularly didn't care for the way Clarice ended up. Given the success of the film &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, Harris should have pictured Jody Foster in the film to made of this new adaptation. If he did, I find it very hard for him to have her doing what she was doing at the end. Hopefully the movie screenplay will be based EXTREMELY LOOSELY on this book.Given the type of bad guys Harris came up with, I think he has been reading too many comic books. Hey Harris I understand, why shoot a guy when you can boil him in a giant bowl of Campbell's soup? Not to give away the horrible revenge scenario, he didn't attempt to have Hannibal bowl in soup, but he could have improved the book if he had as opposed to what he schemed up."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am half way through this book, savoring every minute. I am truly going nuts to think that it will be eleven years to find out how we will be rid of our next monster! I am throughly enjoying this book, and it is done in true Harris style. I have been hooked since his first book and will wait with baited breath for his next. Definitely a must read. Just do it with your lights on."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Such a shame, after waiting for so long. Harris at his worst: no plot, ridicolous characters' personalities development and such a poor writing! Is he the same Harris who wrote Red Dragon? I doubt it!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book started out promising. The first scene is very well handled. And there are passages here and there that are memorable and metaphors that are remarkably precise. All signs of a good writer. But this good writer should be ashamed of himself for coming to the conclusion that this is the story he wanted to tell.Which is not to say this book is well written. It is not. For example, throughout the book it seems every sentence has its own paragraph. The shifting of tenses is unsupported by any inner necessity of the book's &quot;plot&quot; or &quot;structure&quot;. Tense-shifting sometimes happens within a single sentence!!! This cannot be purposeful. It's just sloppy. At the very least his editor needs to think about another line of work. The straight narrative past tense sections are workmanlike. The present tense sections are just embarassing. The plotting is plodding and tedious. But the ending is not forgiveable. The worst writers know better than to pull stunts like this, and they know it instinctively.The ending is not just ridiculous, it's a betrayal. Good stories follow common lines and dramatic situations. The reason that heroic tales always end in either victory or at least catharsis is that the structure of the heroic narrative requires it. (See Aristotl's Poetics) Silence of the Lambs was true to this. Hannibal is not. As Mary McCarthy used to say about Lillian Hellman, &quot;every word is a lie including 'a' and 'the'.&quot; Hannibal is a LIE dressed up in page after page sticky brocade. The arch-baroque prissiness of Dr. Lecter is sooooo thick it sickens. He becomes a caricature of a monster and not even that. Harris's seeming desire to have the reader understand Lecter fails so profoundly because Harris doesn't understand him. This is unforgivable in a storyteller. The other characters are either stick-figures (Mapp, Krendler) or just failures. Their inner coherence self-destructs as Harris sacrifices them to the goal of producing the all-embracing gross-out. As characters, the main players, especially Clarice Starling, finally betray themselves in the absurdity of the books amazingly lackluster finale.One could go on, but it boils down to this: Do not waste you money, or more importantly, your time on this garbage. The images will pollute your imagination and you will have gained nothing in return."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris posses great talent, but even he is not up to describing the monster that is Lecter. Harris goes so far as to suggest that Lecter is not human. If he is not human, how can Harris even adequately get into Lecter's head? I had the feeling that Lecter was an insane Frasier Crane.Harris is not as smart as Lecter and therein lies the problem. How do you describe something that is beyond your capabilities? The Dante lecture that impressed top scholars, while competent, was not amazing. There is no way Harris could have composed a lecture that Lecter would have given because Harris is not Lecter.Lecter's brilliance and evil cannot be described directly because that act would reduce it to a &quot;human&quot; level. When Harris attempts to do this, he weakens Lecter as a character and demonstrates the limits of his writing. By actually giving us the lecture, rather than describing it or simply its effects on the audience, Harris brings Lecter down to earth.This gets me to my main point. The potential evil within the fallen human spirit, that Harris seems to find interesting, slowly dissipated when viewed directly. The devil viewed directly disguises himself to appear normal, but when we catch a glimpse from the corner of our eye, we see the true horror. Direct exposure is simply shocking and soon we are desensitised. The sideways glance and the slow seductive slide into madness and evil, is what is truly frightening. In Saving Private Ryan, Captain Miller (Hanks) demonstrated his humanity by being aware that the war was changing him. The recognition of the contrast is what makes the moment so dramatic. A more frightening book, _The Heart of Darkness_, captures the dramatic change. Kurtz is supposed to be civilised, but descends into complete barbarity. Unlike Harris, Conrad does not get into Kurtz's head and tell us about his shopping or his childhood. We are haunted by Kurtz because his slide into barbarity could be ours. See Kosovo for the modern day equivalent. A human Lecter is amusing because he is a snob,and apparently a hopless romantic. In other words, Harris has described a cannibalistic Frasier Crane.As to problems within the story, is Lecter so stupid to take a direct flight into the USA after a very spectacular murder? Why not take an indirect flight and cross the border by train or bus? If Lecter is so extraordinary and radiates an amazing stillness how is able to blend in with the yokels?As to the plastic surgery, it is nearly impossible to disguise the human ear through plastic surgery. Criminals can be identified by ear patterns. As to the collagen injections, they might help, but would not change the underlying bone structure of his face. Collagen shots need to be repeated, who is administering these shots? A full face lift leaves incredible bruising and swelling and takes time to heal. Who does the work and why not turn him in for the reward?Why can't Lecter, who is so smart, understand that Clarice would be used as bait. Later he explains the political nuances from the trap. Yet, he is caught, on, of all things, a whimsy? Granted Lecter is not infallible, but then why suggest he has tremendous powers of self-control and this fails him when he thinks of Clarice?Will Graham caught Lecter the first time because Graham could get into his mind. Who knows Lecter better than Graham, but no one consults him and nor is he mentioned in this book.Why is Clarice, apparently, the only agent on this case after the very high profile Italian murder?Finally, in SOL Clarice was a great female character with some bite. Seven years later she seems to need a psychiatric sugar daddy. In seven years Starling has not grown at all? When Hannibal makes Clarice his creature through drugs and hypnosis, what is the challenge in that? All Lecter really needed was a companion? I had a feeling I was reading _The Bride of Lecter_. If all that Clarice really needed was Hannibal or vis-a-versa, then Harris is suggesting that Clarice and Hannibal share a common bond. Pray tell, what is that bond? Hunter and Hunted do not appear to need each other. In other words, Lecter appears to be slumming, playing Pygmalion, or even playing Frankenstein.If you really want to read a scary book, I suggest Mary Shelley's _Frankenstein_ because the story shadows reality. The consequences are very frightening, because like _Heart of Darkness_ they grow out of human nature. Shelley understood horror better than Harris because she understood that horror is unleashed when basic human wants get out of control. Harris attempts that in this novel and fails miserably because he wants to have it both ways. Lecter is either super-human or human with a very strange twist. He hints at the dangers of human nature, a la Shelley, when says, in the final line, &quot;We can only learn so much and live.&quot;Mr. Harris might say in his defence that our collective appetites have been stunted. He suggests it in the text when he asks, &quot;What still slaps the clammy flab of our submissive consciousness hard enough to get our attention?&quot; In other words, have we learned too much?In _Frankenstein_ the horror comes from Baron Frankstein's thirst for knowledge. The ordinary slowly develops into the extraordinary because of the uncontrollable appetite. Harris attempts a similar feat with the character of Mischa. The effect is interesting but lacks the originality. Why? Starling is not a construct, but her own person. Harris fails to develop Starling, perhaps the greatest shortcoming in this book, and thus his ending is ruined.To sum up, either you eat your problems or your problems eat you. To put it another way, &quot;Can I have my money back Mr. Harris?&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What, did Thomas Harris get sick of his own work halfway through? It seems like he gave up and just threw a bunch of crap together, bundled the manuscript up, sent it off, and called it good. What's with the garbled points of view? I found this book to be an insult direct from Harris to his fans. The plot was wooden and predictable in the beginning, moderately interesting in the Florence scenes, and then degenerated into total self-indulgent nonsense at the end. I agree: I think Harris has fixed his own wagon so he won't be expected to continue the saga of Lecter and Clarice. I see his attitude as &quot;Hey, screw you American Reading Public. You asked for a &quot;sequel&quot;, here you go, now leave me alone.&quot;I'm disappointed in this."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A significant let-down. Rather like Stanley Kubrick filming THE SHINING; except here an author has taken an intellectual wrecking-ball to his own creation. Thomas Harris seems to have decided that he's above his earlier thrillers and that this time he would do something not only Daring but Deep. The resulting mess, HANNIBAL, seems to be more of a collection of tics, mannerisms, and twitches than a novel -- the literary equivalent, perhaps, of Hannibal Lecter's &quot;collecting&quot; of church collapses and other such disasters. There are a few interesting and well-done scenes, but the author seems to have completely lost his grip on his characters. (Lecter is by this point not only a doctor and a musician, but a Dante expert, a theoretical physicist, etc. In the next book he will presumably be revealed as a ballet dancer; a brilliant programmer in UNIX, Java, and COBOL; and quite possibly the next Pope) The last third of the novel is an astonishing, utterly unbelievable, shambles. The storyline begun by breathing human beings in RED DRAGON and SILENCE is completed here by shabby, ill-conceived automatons."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"When I finished this book, I felt cheated. As if Thomas Harris held me in some sort of contempt, for buying into his world, for rooting for Clarice, for caring about this book. As if I had been tricked into spending my money and my time and my emotions on something so cruel, so callous, so sickening.I'm not a squeamish reader. I loved Red Dragon and Silence. I found Harris' writing so poetic and precise that it made the violent acts almost palatable -- which seemed to be one of his themes, that violence can be almost seductive; you could understand its pull and see why the struggle against it is so complex.But here he goes absolutely, completely, utterly over the top: not because it's gross (though it is) and not because it's violent (though it is), but because it's mean-spirited and nasty, in a very personal way.Mr. Harris, I apologize if I missed your point. Or perhaps this was your point: that the world is horrible and cruel and those who care about anything are to be condemned and held in contempt, or should simply give up. Perhaps you think this is a cool and sophisticated and modern way to approach our world. If so, shame on you."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I did a really stupid thing this weekend. I had this book on order with Amazon, but went momentarily insane and decided I didn't want to wait 2-3 days, so I cancelled my order here and went and bought it at a chain bookstore, where I had to pay 10 bucks more for it because they only had a 10% discount. I figured hey, it'll be worth it. WRONG!!! WHY, oh why didn't I wait and save over 10 bucks? Forget that, why didn't I wait for paperback? What the hell was wrong with me? I read the mostly bad reviews but every time someone said they hated the book because it was so gruesome, tasteless, and gory I thought, &quot;sold me!&quot; Also, the way people talked about the ending I was intrigued. I also figured hey, it's Thomas Harris, he's a gifted writer, how bad could it be? Well let's see. First of all, it didn't shock me. It wasn't even that gory. It wouldn't even make the list of the top 25 most disgusting books I've ever read (though I have to admit in all fairness I've read some pretty digusting, nasty books). The ending didn't shock me, I figured out what was going to happen about half way through the book. I didn't buy it, either. I think even if Hannibal looked like George Clooney that no sane, rational woman would fall for him. As for the writing, it reads more like he wrote it in 10 days (and that's being kind) not 10 years. Just sloppy, half-assed, and thrown together. The way he keeps changing persons and tenses is so pretentious and annoying, and you just get the feeling he threw it in because he was getting bored. In fact, if I read this book without knowing who wrote it and someone asked me if I thought it was written by Harris or a ghostwriter, I'd be convinced Harris didn't write this. I read it straight through in less than 12 hours, not because it was so gripping I couldn;'t put it down, but just to get it over with (I also was in denial and kept thinking it would get better soon). I have no problem with stuff that's gruesome or tasteless, don't get me wrong, but this was just boring, and it seemed like he was trying too hard to shock the reader (which didn't work). So my main complaint is that this book is just a complete insult to his reader's intelligence. Try just a TAD harder next time, Mr. Harris. My main memory of this book is a mental picture of my purse opening up and dollar bills flying out of it. I could have saved my money and just taken the 25 bucks and thrown it out in the street. Trust me, if you buy this just to see how bad it is (like I foolishly did) you will HATE yourself in the morning."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"TH has got to be kidding. Did we drop a little acid before getting in front of the word processor, Tom?? Not only is the book totally unbelievable, it's just plain gross. It reads like a book that was passed around in class, letting each new person write the next chapter. Doesn't flow, doesn't fit, doesn't make much sense at all. If the movie script actually follows the plot (which I highly doubt), they'll never get Jodie Foster. She's smarter than an ice cube, thank God. As for the folks who rave about this book, giving it 5 stars, well . . . whatever."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book, hyped though it was, has absolutely NO redeeming features. Aside from the fact that the plot is slow and plodding, Mr. Harris makes every possible error possible when writing this novel. One of the strenghs of &quot;Silence&quot; and &quot;Red Dragon&quot; is Hannibal Lector, aside from Mr. Harris' extensive knowledge of forensics. In &quot;Silence&quot; Hannibal Lecter explains to Clarise that &quot;he can't be summed up with his experiences in the past,&quot; so to speak. That's what makes him so terrible, so inconceivable. . . and yes, so compelling. So what does Mr. Harris do? He lets the reader get to know Lecter, and wouldn't you know it, but all his atrocities are the result of. . . yes, a childhood trauma. It takes Hannibal Lecter and reduces him to nothing, just another serial killer, nothing special. Okay, so that's not enough to completely ruin the novel, despite the plodding plot. I won't ruin it, but the end of the novel is absolutely the most irrational, unbelievable and unsatisfying endings in the history of literature. I've read 2000 novels -- every possible genre included, including most every classic possible -- and this is the only novel I've EVER read that I've wanted to return to the bookstore. I can handle sad endings, tragic endings, happy endings, ambiguous endings. . . as long as its believable, but HANNIBAL is none of those things. Part of me has to think that Mr. Harris HATED the fact that the movie, not his previously fantastic writing, made him a success. It seems that he wanted to make JODIE FOSTER and ANTHONY HOPKINS pay for the fact that they made him; i.e. he wanted to write a book that he'd make money for, but that neither one of them would want to make, so as to spite them. Lord knows Hollywood will toss big bucks their way -- 40 million, between the two -- but if they're anything like me, they'll decline. (Afterall, they get 20 million each for every movie they make -- Hannibal isn't the only one out there and each of them has their choice of projects).Okay, to sum up. Slow and plodding plot, gratuitous violence (by that I mean unnecessary to build toward a climax or move the plot forward) an utter disdain for his fans (as witnessed by his degradation of previously explored characters), a writer who feels &quot;smart&quot; enough to comment on the very reality of the universe without making his point. . . the list of problems could go on and even be forgiven, if not for the ending, which not only was completely unbelievable, but totally out of context when compared to what was written previously.THIS WAS A TERRIBLE BOOK. BORING, SLOW, PLODDING AND UNBELIEVABLE, DO NOT BUY IT!!!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If you want to remain a Thomas Harris fan, forget about 'Hannibal'. It's a waste of time and trees. All the reasons why 'Dragon' and 'Lambs' were great, and why we all admired Harris so much, are the same reasons for being dismayed and disappointed at this rambling mess of a book. If you adore intriguing and believable characters, you're out of luck with 'Hannibal'. If you enjoy an intricate and deliciously worked-out plot, look elsewhere. Rarely have I been so disappointed with an author's failure to deliver something worthy of his own gifts.The story in 'Hannibal' is shot through with inconsistencies and implausibilities, even allowing for some of the contrivancies and conventions of the genre. As for the characterisation, Harris has betrayed his own creations and his readership's loyalty.In the previous books, Lecter obtained his goals through intellectual brilliance and devious cunning of a kind never previously depicted in crime fiction. In 'Hannibal', this factor is entirely absent. He escapes the trap so carefully laid for him... how? We don't really know. He just guesses what's up, and struggles his way out. Harris might just as well have written 'With a leap and a bound he was free'.Lecter wants to track down Clarice. He gets her address from her University Alumni list. Yeah, right. So Clarice is an FBI special agent. She has caught serial killers, and her most deadly potential adversary (Lecter) is out on the run who-knows-where. And she regularly takes down gang-protected drug dealers. Yet she has never changed her address since graduation, never taken steps to conceal where she lives, and Lecter finds her as easily as finding the nearest McDonalds. Sorry, I don't think so. In the previous books, Lecter might have tracked down Clarice, but he would have achieved this through some breathtakingly ingenious ruse (like his discovery of Will Graham's home address in 'Dragon'). Not so here.There are many other similar plot holes. All in all, a grave disappointment with a truly illegitimate ending. Don't buy it. Or at least wait for the cheaper paperback (which will be out soon). Or have my copy... I don't want it. I can only echo many other reviewers in saying that the only reason I give this one star is because I can't give it none at all."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It is not the level of the violence that most disturbed me about this long-awaited sequel; that is, of course, only to be expected, and I have read many thrillers with much higher body counts that fail to disturb as much as this novel. Nor do I object to it purely on the grounds of its being disturbing -- anybody who reads horror likes to have the old cage rattled now and then. What I do object to is nihilism, a new element in the Thomas Harris universe. Neither RED DRAGON or THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS had conventionally happy endings, but they were both books that can be summarized as Good Fighting Evil to Protect Innocents; HANNIBAL presents a profoundly corrupt universe, where everybody but Clarice Starling has twisted motives, and where the conflict is actually Evil Vs. Evil; Good, caught in the middle, gets totally subsumed by Evil and finds itself happier for the experience. The result is a lot like a kick in the teeth. Thomas Harris is still a compelling storyteller, and Hannibal Lecter is still one of the great horrific characters of all time, and I was engrossed throughout -- even during the especially disturbing last twenty pages, when I hoped for a final reversal -- but the note on which this book ends was still enough to leave me very angry for a long, long time. Since readers have the right to reject sequels if they're unworthy, I must reject this one; as far as I'm concerned, it never happened..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris, best known for the creation of the character of Hannibal \\"The Cannibal\\" Lecter, bring his popular anti-hero back for one last crusade in the pursuit of Clarice Starling.This time, though, Lecter is on the lamb, living in Florence, Italy, where he has been in hiding for several years after escaping from his prison. Known for his cannabilistic actions against many of his clinical patients, Hannibal is hunted by the sole survivor of his exploits, a badly mutilated billionare, Mason Verger. Verger, who was attacked and maimed by Lecter many years before, employs the expertise of several bounty hunters and inside contacts within the F.B.I to locate and capture Lecter.Having been shamed for actions in a drug trafficing arrest gone wrong, Starling is suspended from the F.B.I., and her shaming is made public as a means of naming a scapegoat in the accident murder of several police and F.B.I. officers. Her shaming reaches Lecter, who has long been smitten with Starling in his own way, and he sets out to help avenge her name.This story is, if it can be believed, much darker and surreal than \\"Red Dragon and \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\" Where \\"Dragon\\" and \\"Lambs\\" shared the clinical process of an F.B.I. agent hunting a serial killer, this story is told from the multiple perspectives of a vengeful billionaire, a shamed officer and a serial killer. Its conclusion is shocking and for many fans of the series, completely dissatisfying, though I personally liked the ending, even if I am on the fence as to whether or not I completely believe it could happen the way it does. (NOTE: If you have seen the movie, the book is completely different). Still, for fans of the series, the long break between novels was definitely worth the wait.Hannibal is a good read and a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy of Lecter novels. Whether or not Lecter returns in any future novels remains to be seen, but if this is his last appearance, then it can be said that his exit from the literary world is as shocking as his entrance was twenty years before.Scott Kolecki"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was excited to finally read this book, just a week before the film came out. Being a huge fan of the film 'Silence of the Lambs', I quickly ran out and bought all 3 Lector books, and even bought the film 'Manhunter'. Boy, did I set myself up for a fall.While 'Red Dragon' and 'SOTL' were suspenseful serial-killer hunts, 'Hannibal' is nothing more than a convoluted soap opera. The story opened up with great promise. I pretty much enjoyed all until the last half of the book, especially Lector's time in Italy (I truly loved the confrontation between him and Pazzi) but the over-indulged Verger family/italian mafia story began to bog the book down for me. 'Dragon' and 'Lambs' concentrated more on the brilliantly drawn main characters, with the secondary characters adding some dimension. 'Hannibal', on the other hand, expands pointlessly on characters that I felt didn't need to be there in the first place. I mean, c'mon, orderly Barney? He hung in there till the 'fricken epilogue! And the whole Verger sister side-story left me shaking my head. Sure, I can see why she was important for the story in the end. I also can see how she was important as filler, making a more larger, attractive book for the shelves.As for the ending, many may have found it &quot;challenging&quot; or &quot;such a twist&quot;. I found it irritating and ridiculous. SPOILER, but I can't twist the character of Starling that I followed in 'Lambs' to the confusingly pathetic puppet we see in the endpages here. As a different actress replaces the original Clarice in the film, I find myself replacing the character in the book with another of the same name.All in all, great start but serious wobbling to the end."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I cannot see how anyone would read Hannibal for the plot, and it was far from engaging and suspenseful. There are certain things you expect when starting to read a sequel to The Silence of the Lambs: Lecter and Starling will meet again; Lecter will kill again; the FBI will try to find him again. So far, Harris delivers, and he does so with a text that proceeds with a fast pace. When an author is capable of doing so with language only, then he or she really is good at writing.That is not enough, though - not for me, anyway. The plot is more important in a thriller than in other literary genres. Here I was really amazed about the drug thing going wrong at the beginning. The woman in command of the drug factory has got AIDS and so will try to get you in contact with her blood and defecates on you if you try to fight her, and she does not hesitate to use her baby, or any baby, as a shield in a shoot-out - did I get that right? I thought it unlikely, but tried to believe that such people really existed. What really brought my credulity end were Mason and Marion Verger. Mason has abused Marion sexually, the latter of which is a lesbian, and almost a clich&eacute; at that, walking around in a riding outfit when we meet her the first time, and the allusion of S/M is in the air. Another implication is that she is a lesbian because Mason has raped her. She nevertheless would like a baby and wants Mason's semen (of all people) and gets it by using a cattle prod. Can you believe that? I can't. Mason himself is beyond all description: he could easily have Lecter killed by other means than in the book - why does it have to be so elaborate? I knew that it was never going to work with those pigs from square one - but again, plot is not the main thing here.What is left, then, when the plot is more or less predictable, and the characters are nothing but multiply abused victims looking for revenge that is even more perverted than what happened to them, and when the most authentic character is a mysogynist coward whose main hobby is mobbing and deceit, but still gets his brain eaten? Psychological depth? Yes, if disgust is so deep it reaches a psychological level. The ending is such a weak and contrived trip into different spheres beyond anyone's sane understanding that it cannot be grasped or appreciated. And what about revealing Lecter's motivation? Why oh why did Harris have to lift the last curtain? Just because the trilogy has now come to its ending?And I just cannot see how Clarice Starling can be seen as a feminist icon. She gives in to Hannibal, and the other females are a clich&eacute; lesbian and an Italian woman who is only there so her husband, the police captain, can daydream about making love to her, as Italians are likely to do - at least in novels, and so Lecter can sniff her skin and muse about killing or not killing her playfully. This moment of the book is telling: There is so much gore and abuse in the text that Hannibal reads not so much as a novel as a menu card for Dr Lecter."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Sometimes you read a book because you love the style of the writer and see what he/she has to offer. I really wanted to see what happened to Clarice and Hannibal. Unfortunately, I found the style of Harris' writing to be very disappointing. He has replaced an &quot;edge of the seat&quot; style with a over the top and extraordinarily unnecessarily grossness that ends up bringing attention to him, rather than his characters. On many occasions I could not help think &quot;why has Harris written this in this manner&quot;. The only reason why I finished this book is that it gave me something to read on the train on the way to work, and in the hope that Harris' style would get better. Unfortunately it didn't. I'm surprised his publishers let this through. I will be very less interested in reading anything more that Harris writes. There are much better deserving writers out there that deserve sales rather than this ... ."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I will admit that he writes extremely well. Also, I loved Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon. However, the ending was so incredibly pathetic that for the first time in my life, I actually wanted to return a book and get my money back. The ending (was so terrible), that I can't believe I wasted my time reading the book. It's no wonder that Jodie Foster refused to reprise her role as Clarice Starling. Don't buy this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If the movie script is true to the book, no wonder Jodie Foster turned it down. The edge-of-your-seat psychological suspense we've come to expect from Mr. Harris' previous works was conspicuous by its absence, the violence was gratuitous, and the ending was ludicrous. Borrow the book if you must, but don't pay money for it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal Lecter is Thomas Harris. Page after page Harris displays his vulgarity. Describing paintings,clothes,food,books and buildings - the lifestyle of the rich and famous. And to crap it all our middle aged 'hero' gets to give the lovely Clarice a good seeing to. Wishful thinking Mr. Harris ? This book should be re-titled 'My Favourite Things' and is not worth stealing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is one of the most grotesque books I've ever read. It's filled with characters and situations that are disgusting. The ending is not believable. It doesn't even deserve one star."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"because this one was VERY disappointing. While the bulk of novel was well-written and intriguing in its plot, it leads to an ending that will at first confuse you based on its style, then on how Harris thought he could get away with such a menial performance. It doesn't fit the rest of the book, series, and ESPECIALLY the characters.BOO HISS!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"There isn't much I can add to the comments that have been made in the other reviews. I enjoyed the first part of this book - though not as much as Silence of the Lambs or Red Dragon - but like both of those titles, Harris seems to have had a problem with the ending. Here, unfortunately, he seems to be writing the ending to a different book than the one the reader had been involved in. Where this strange and unsatisfying ending came from is a mystery. Nothing really prepares us for it. Neither Starling nor Lecter act as we have come to expect them to. I am not against being surprised, but with no lead in or justification for what happens it is shocking and my response was to literally throw the book across the room.Make no mistake, when the film is made of this book it will be a different story. No one in Holywood wants to spend millions of dollars just to tick the audience off at the end.Maybe this is Harris's way of putting an end to this series. I can't imagine may who would want another dose after this one."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Very disappointing. And Mr. Harris allows himself the privilege to REPEAT himself (comparing the Palazzo della Signoria to a Halloween pumpkin TWICE).And the final &quot;feast&quot; is really far-fetched: I wonder how it will look on the film-to-come. Hope Ms. Foster stays away from it. henry caraso, paris"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"First of all, I think some people do not appreciate this book because the fact that it is almost a work of literature throws off the people who are just looking for a good gore-fest. The imagery and detail Harris included with this novel was absolutely astounding; you could tell he carefully planned and sculpted each paragraph carefully. Another fully effective tactic was the third person/second person alternate narrating, which literally brought you in to the twisted yet beautiful palace of Hannibal Lecter's mind. Most people apparently expected Hannibal to go on being a monster in our minds, but I thought it was devilishy clever of Harris to get us to sympathize with, and maybe even like Hannibal Lecter, serial killer. I do have to admit the conclusion was very out of colour. If Harris was going to completely turn around the book, he should have done it a little more gradually, with more foreshadowing, instead of making the personality of Clarice become alien to the one we have become familiar with. Over all, this book is masterfully written, with a few minor disappointments. It is almost flawless right up until the final chapters. But don't read this book if you want to read a &quot;Scream&quot;-like blood bath; this book is truly a work of literature. If anyone wants to discuss my review/this book, feel free to email me at: iam_peachie@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It took seven years for Harris to follow up Red Dragon with Silence of the Lambs but that was well worth the wait. Now we've had to wait ELEVEN years for Harris to come up with the worst piece of literary tripe I have ever read! What the (heck) was he thinking? How many half-assed books have Stephen King or Dean Koontz released in eleven years? At least with those guys you know you are going to be reading crap. Harris screwed us over....I had been anticipating this book release more than any other. And even if it had not been as good as SOTL, that's understandable. But this....the literary equivalent of going from the penthouse to the outhouse, is an absolute travesty. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK! Unless you want to spend the rest of your life(yes, it seems that long) reading about Italian history and some freak pedophile....oh but wait I thought the book was supposed to be about Hannibal Lecter, huh? Well, hopefully, by the time Thomas Harris decides to write another book, I will be stone dead and buried with my Deaver books."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Well written with pacing problems but a big payoff. Worth theread although he could have trimmed fifty or a hundred pages off. Idon't think he pulls off the end, it was too ex machina. Not that it wasn't surprising, but it just popped up. He didn't set it up properly I don't think.I didn't think it was that scary or sickening, for a book named after a serial killer I mean. I liked the man-eating pigs, though. Clear prose, cool settings, great characters. I hated them all. (But -- or because? -- I believed them.) I couldn't even like Starling. So the ending seemed satisfying. Maybe harris will write another book in ten years."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I had anticipated a great escape, wonderful story, great character development. I was sorely disappointed. Although the author writes an intriguing story with bizarre and surprising twists, I can't believe that Starling could turn 180 degrees changing from a young woman of high ideals and integrity to an unprincipled person who would form a relationship with a monster. I was appalled."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I know that there was tremendous pressure on Harris after his book Silence of the Lambs hit box-office platinum. People were clamoring for the third part of the trilogy. Hannibal was lose, what now, Thomas? Hey, I was one of those people. I loved reading the first two books, they were both GREAT! Of course I wanted another one. Sadly, Harris did not have another one in him. What we get is bad a screenplay, not a novel. Suspense and creativity are abandoned for repulsion and gross outs. Simplicty rules. In fact, I would dare say that this inane book was targeted directly at the simple mind, whose love of Harris' writing centered around not written words, but Anthony Hopkins' one-liners from Silence of the Lambs. How tragic. I don't blame Jodie Foster for passing on this thing when movie casting started after the release of the book, in fact I respect her for it. Sadly, Hopkins was so typecast, that he had no other choice. Heck, Hopkins went as far as doing Red Dragon again, even though the novel had already been handled quite well by Michael Mann (Manhunter). Look, I bought all three books and read all three. Two were great and one was truly terrible, kind of like the movies. And I would dare say that the positive reviews of this book are coming from teenagers that did not read it at all, but saw the movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I came upon the impression that Thomas Harris writes for two crowds: the pop book audience and the artistic literature lovers. Warning: this review contains some SPOILERS, because I am refuting certain things thrown by other reviewers at the book.1. The first reader - the new book Clearly it is an interesting read. Gothic and gory, this book is certainly a child of the genre of shock horror that I do happen to enjoy once in a while. A reccommended read, but don't look at it for a five star treat. If you need one, go read &quot;Silence&quot;.2. The sequelI did not expect it to hold as much strength as &quot;Silence of The Lambs&quot;, and I don't want it to be SotL 2. Truly, SotL is a masterpiece in its own way, capable of dishing out excellent character chemistry, pop book entertainment, and intensive artistic imagery. Masterpieces don't come all the time. I did, however, expect something a little better than this, after eleven years of wait.It seems that it is not enough for Harris to remove the style from the predecessors, but also every other hinge with it - except perhaps a little symbolism. I don't mind making it more surreal and symbolic, but the result: the plot is laughable!On the other hand, Lecter does shine, but not in the form of plain storytelling, but through artistic imagery. We still do not answer the question: What is Hannibal Lecter? Is he a Devil, an angel, a lover or a manipulator?We have a laughable villian. I don't care if people say that Mason Verger was supposed to be a really really evil villian. The style of creating him does not scare me, as say,.....Voldemort from the Harry Potter books. He is laughable to the point of stupidity. He sounds like Darth Vader with all worthty characterisation thrown away. All other characters - Krendler, Pazzi, even Margot - are trashy. Only Barney shows any good development.Many will be shocked at the twist, with Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter ending up as hot and passionate lovers (told you thee'd be spoilers). I am among those who are not surprised. I was dissapointed with the events that led to it. The last 100 pages, I agree with a reviewer, are among the best pages I've ever read. And yes, I am among those who like, even admire, Starling for her guts. I believe that to make her a noteworthy female character, you have to show her when she's in utter degradation as well, so degraded that she'd share a cannibal meal with Lecter.And yes, I believe she was conscious, at least conscious enough to know what she was doing (some of the things she did surprised Lecter, which shows she is not completely under control), even if she was moving about stoned.But the sudden switch of Starling is horribly shaky - and that's the worst part. Readers should see her process of degradation from cool, smart, no-nonsense into a broken woman, aimless, victimized against her abilities to resist by beaurocrats, then finally what led to her decision to succumb in a sexual relationship with Lecter against all the ethics that she was brought up in. This should have been the main focus of &quot;Hannibal&quot; - the twisted and weird relationship of Clarice and Hannibal, sexual in its intensity yet more complex than that, involving body, mind and soul: a quid pro quo of sorts, a battle and understanding of one whole against another, and at least in this book, how Lecter consumes Starling's faith and goodness.However, we get treated instead to a gore fest of how Mason Verger bred his pigs. BLarh.3. The artistic view: My dissapointment in this book as a thriller and overall story led me to find some solace in searching for artistic value. My conclusions: the whole bit about Florence are not mere show-offs by Harris. They carry a strong symbolism, particularly the ones about Dante's Inferno. Certain symbolism, like that of the moth and the crow, are carried in from SotL. The book cover itself is a symbol. I do not wish to elaborate on what I see in them, because that would be too long.I must say this though: the sexual relationship of Hannibal and Clarice is not a shock nor disrespecting them. If you think so - reread the book and study it carefully. Imho, my conclusions is that Starling and Lecter are merely in a sleeping stage, a dreamworld of sorts, Lecter playing with her happily as he would play with a cub. They are in a dreamworld bliss - amoral and horrifying yet beautifully romantic as well.When Starling awakens from this stage...well, we can only guess what happens. I hope Harris makes another book, I want to see who kills who first - Starling turning into a monstrosity that will kill Lecter, or if according to Doemling's theory, Lecter kill Starling.So I say this as bottomline: it's a pretty good artistic work. But high symbolism and artistry doesn't justify a poorly written story with bad focus. It's no masterpiece, but it's better in artistic value than some stuff out there."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I pretty much enjoyed the read, anxiously awaiting the conclusion. Only to find the conclusion completely unbelievable. It's as if Harris just ran out of time (10 years not enough?) figuring out how it should end, and settled for something that fell, splat, on the floor."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Good end to a memorable series. The only problem I can see anyone having with this book is trying to decide if its a happy ending or bad ending. But after you read it and reflect back over the previous novels you will realize it really couldn't have ended any other way. Without spoiling the ending I will say it end much different and much better than the movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book really gets into the minds and mental processes of the characters, especially the final chapters which will either thrill or mortify you. In this book, nothing is surface. Every character has an agenda and wishes to bend the others to it. It is the interaction between the characters, and within the conflicting aspects of the characters, that makes me love this novel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"it may not have been as elaborately constructed as Silence of the Lambs, but the trip into Hannibal's mind is fathomless, exquisite, and beautiful. i am grateful to the author for such a mirror into the extremes of myself and of any human being."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"You have to suspend your desire for what you want to happen to appreciate what actually does happen in Hannibal, and none of the latter should be a surprise. Harris foreshadows it all--in the book and especially in the movie. It's all there: Clarice's painful longing for a/her father; Hannibal's observation of her longing for respectability and taste; the demeaning glances that her male FBI colleagues cast towards her; Jack's love of his wife and the deep loneliness and sadness that he feels both before and after her death; and, of course, Hannibal's obsessive and even passionate determination to control people completely--not just their bodies but, as in Clarice's case, their souls. This book is about so many things that the reader who is hoping for a traditional or even traditional Harris-like conclusion, in which good and justice sort of triumph over evil, are definitely not going to be happy. I wanted Clarice to triumph; to resist the temptation to be absorbed into Hannibal's delusions. I wanted her to triumph over the chauvinistic FBI system that forced her alienation from the work she loved. However, Harris ignored my wishes and apparently those of many others. He concludes the book in a way that is absolutely logical and consistent with everything that has come before."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Whether you liked, or didn't like, Silence of Lambs (I liked it alot) .... DON'T Read this book. It is disgustingly exploitive of its audience with just barely enough plot to weave together the various episodes of insanity of the type we usually only read about in courtroom accounts (unfortunately). Unless you often immerse your mind in filth, skip this one entirely. The worse part of it all is that (1) this one is obviously soon to be on the silver screen- probably a big hit and (2) there is an audience for this filth (I'll have nightmares about that aspect for awhile)."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading this book, my immediate impression was that Mr. Harris wrote what he thought people wanted. I suspect he was under intense pressure to write a sequel and finally succumbed. While not a bad read, Hannibal is so over the top that it's impossible (for me) to replay the events of the book in my mind without laughing. Hannibal Lector is no longer compellingly crazy, now he is just whacked. The ending isn't plausible, and by then you've stopped caring about Clarice and especially Dr. Lector. To me it would be VERY difficult to top Silence, this book proves it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was very disappointed in this book!! as it lacked &quot;the edge of my seat&quot; page turner, as his other books gave me."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This was my first Thomas Harris book. I found no characters empathetic, most of the story completely lacking in believability and much of the copy devoted to the author's self-congratulatory knowledge of all things pretentious. I give credit for the occasional well-written phrase, but overall I couldn't wait for it to end. With so much to work with in this story, it was a complete disappointment and the ending was beyond ludicrous."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I just read through Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs very quickly to set-up reading Hannibal. The first 2 books were incredible, I was intense in starting to read Hannibal. Unfortunately, I have hardly ever been so disappointed. The book worked for me until the final forth. From there it took on the ridiculous, and the ending was a huge, huge letdown. Absurb. I hope Tom Harris mercifully ends this story with Hannibal."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I found this novel to be a quick, engaging read despite its subject matter, and I think that Harris' technique has improved greatly. Ultimately, however, I feel profoundly disappointed by the story and its resolution. I don't understand what Harris wants his readers to feel about the characters, and I'm really puzzled about why he chose to end the book the way he did. In the earlier books featuring Hannibal Lecter, the main characters--Will Graham and Clarice Starling--had been damaged by life but remained strong, moral people with a good purpose. Starling, after a promising start to her career, has been treading water, all chances for advancement stymied by a grudge-bearing, manipulative politician with whom she refused to sleep. Starling's mentor, Jack Crawford, has also lost his bearings and his influence in the FBI. The remaining characters are generally awful people, but are we really supposed to think that Hannibal Lecter is noble by comparison? For the first time, Harris provides Lecter with a back story that is supposed to explain and perhaps excuse Lecter's cannibalism. Is physically torturing and eating people no worse than being a opportunistic, immoral politician? I don't think so. Is the only sensible way to combat the monsters in the world to become one yourself? I hope not. Because the world of Hannibal is so filled with monstrous people, horrible events and hopelessness, it's hard not to feel diminished by having read the novel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Like I said, the book gets off to a slow start, but get about100 pages in and you have met all the major characters and it is justone twist after another. My reason for giving only 4 stars was because of the ending... not quite what I expected, but interesting nonetheless."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I agree with what many of the other reviewers stated; the ending is neither believable nor logical. It is one thing for two people to have an immediate passion for each other despite other differences. But the development of anything else between Lecter and Starling is ridiculous and was never set up appropriately. I suspect in the 4th installment, which I won't bother reading, the author will explain that Starling was merely brainwashed and will find her way morally and bring down the evil doctor, thus lining Harris' pocket with another book. And are we supposed to believe that because of what happened to Meisha that Hannibal's existence is justified? He doesn't merely killer truly evil people, he kills his enemies which are not always bad people (like the guards in Silence). The story with Mason Verger is good but the Lone Ranger save by Starling is foolhardy. Thumbs Down."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Sorry folks. Just about every reviewer in the U.K hated the third in the series and for once I'm inclined to agree. 'Red Dragon' scared the pants off me, 'Silence of the Lambs' showed what a really good Author Robert Harris can be but 'Hannibal' just wasn't up to the job. I suppose the ending was the clincher. Without giving too much away it was in a word 'preposterous'. It's a word that no-one uses much these days. Maybe if Robert Harris writes some more novels it may come back into the English language."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I think those that disliked Hannibal wish to see the world in bright lines of good and evil, and to know that evil can be easily identified and that &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; are always on opposite sides of the battlefield. In Hannibal, good, evil and perverse are comingled to such an extent that the mind is baffled into simultaneously disliking and liking every character. I tire greatly of the noble and good FBI agent who is out to stop the monstrous evils of the world. Hannibal is one of the few creations of popular fiction which left me scratching my head and questioning my own concepts of good and evil."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This was a horrible , boring, unsatisfying,book. The ending was totally out of character and ridiculous. DO NOT READ THIS !!!!!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I don't understand all the aggrevation about the ending. It may not have been as good as Silence of the Lambs, but given Clarice's psychological issues and Hannibal's, I don't see how impossible it would be for her to end up under his control. In Silence of the Lambs, the author never hid the fact that she was somewhat intrigued with him. As far as how he dealt with her, with careful planning, he provided her with the psychological security that she was looking for. She was a strong woman externally, but had many unresolved issues and insecurities internally. Someone like that could do a number of surprising things with a powerful enough individual slowly weaving her in by working on her vulnerability. Even though I have had better reads, this book held my interest and I enjoyed the fact that the ending was completely unexpected. A psychopath who is very bright can be very capable of combining strange and evil with normal behavior and a strong, normal woman with deep psychological issues could just as easily fall victim to someone like Hector as not. The dinner scene was a little unbelievable, but that was just showing Hannibal's way of getting revenge for Clarice and appeasing her. This was supposed to be a creepy book! Not everything has to be scientific fact or plausible to be entertaining. That is what is great about fiction!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I had trouble getting started on this book, too broad too start. The middle was very good and had some of the old page turner aspects. The ending was very improbable and every woman I've spoken to about it agrees."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Naturally, after reading TSOTL my expectations were very high. However, despite Harris' brilliant penmanship it NEVER satisfied me. Various descriptions are world-class, but the book as a whole is very dissapointing. I do NOT understand the end, just tell me why - someone please! One of the worst endings I have ever read - I just couldn't believe it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read this from cover to cover in a day, never wanting to get too far away from it to pick it up quickly again. I agree, it's sick. I don't know how the hell Hollywood is going to get an R rating w/o cutting a few major scenes. I also think David Mamet is PERFECT for the job of screenwriter for this: he is an expert at creating aggressive, impassive women. And unfortunately, that's what Starling has become. It's more difficult to say what has become of Lecter, a monster as merciless as his victims are (??) deserving. Harris' world is a sick, bleak place, and as disturbing as the conclusion of this book is to me, in his universe, I suppose it makes sense. It will be interesting to see whether Hollywood agrees."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Too bad that others didn't enjoy this book, but I found it hard to put down. Mason Verger is truly despicable, Hannibal shows a surprisingly gentle side, and the suspense between subplots was wonderful. The ending may have been surprising, but this is fiction."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The only thing more brilliantly abhorent than Hannibal Lector.. is the mind behind him.. His Creator... Thomas Harris. He created a deviation of man..created by his enviornmental experiences... Lector is a product of his early life experiences and the inability to cope. One sees the variation.. which is almost demonic...but one is impressed with his level of intelligence, charm, and insight into Clarice. Who ever said that this was not a good book ..must not have read it.. or had specific expectations based on the movie (silence of the lambs). I give it a MORE!!!!!as in the words of Mark Twain and Clarice."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read this for the suspense/thriller aspect...This graphic,gore engorged sequel sucked me in and kept my jaw dropped at a full 2 inches right to the SHOCKING end."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Much as I loved the previous novels, particularly the intriguing relationship of twisted genius and student of crime, I was disappointed with Harris' latest venture. I simply do not follow this new twist in Hannibal and Agent Starling's relationship. Federal agent or pen pal to the psycologically disturbed? I long for the restrained respect the main characters maintained in the first novel. That Hannibal could not help but ghost in and out of his favorite pupil's life was hoped for, but I fail to see where such camraderie would develop. Or are we readers to believe that dear Clarice has suddenly developed amnesia? He dines on everyone else, surely, he would never dine on her? No, I don't agree...I much prefer the edge of the previous novel. Clarice, as well as Barney, remembered the rules of Lecter. Come close, but not too close, lest you'll be dinner. That said, I did thoroughly enjoy the revenge served sauteed. A vintage Harris moment just the way I thought I couldn't stomach, but can't wait to read. The latest twisted soul to the line-up is a good one...As intended, Mason is so revolting he makes Lecter the hero even a mother could love. But again, that's where I say enough. While Harris by no means depicts Hannibal as the latest Clark Kent, I felt he went a bit far. I fail to see the Hannibal I've come to fear from previous novels in the nurse maid / hero presented here. I fear the author is too much in love with his own characters in this latest edition, bringing a touch of Romance I can well do without."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I would not recommend this book. The way Clarice was portrayed in this book was not how, after reading Silence of the Lambs, readers would expect her to act. I don't want to ruin a bad ending for anyone so I won't get into the details. However, it's no wonder Jodi Foster refused to play Clarice in the future movie. The ending was a huge disappointment. In the past she was a strong-willed women. This ending was so unlike Clarice. Until the end, the book isn't too bad, but because of the ending, I think even one star is too much."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It's as if something happened to throw Harris from his game approximately 3/4 of the way through the book. The first half was wonderful -- drew you in, kept you wondering, made you read one more page... and another... and another... until you realized you were way overdue for whatever it is that called you.The ending is laughable, it's so contrived and rushed. With &quot;chapters&quot; containing only 4-5 paragraphs near the end, and such a lack of detail (not restraint, but HOLES), I have to say I wish I'd simply never read it, because the magic that Harris has been able to conjure before now seems utterly ruined."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I anxiously awaited Hannibal. I was completely drwn into the dynamic between Lector and Starling in Silence of the Lambs and my return to Harris' work was yearning for moreof it. What I found instead was a story that stretched one's imagination to a breaking point. I find it unsettling that the relationship between Starling and Lector turned into such a disturbing fettish. That goes upstream against anything and everything we learned about her in the Silence. Perhaps if Starling's character played more than an afterthought role in the book, it could have developed into a beleivable scenerio. As it is, the relationship is simply false. I found Hannibal a dissapointing and goulish read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I couldn't believe this book. It was so fascinating until the last few chapters. I couldn't put it down, it was so interesting and pretty quickly-paced, too. But then ending was utterly preposterous, and replete with atrocities that were neither scary nor humorous, even in the black-comedy fashion they were meant to be. It was just too twisted and sick to be frightening OR funny. The ending ruined the entire novel, which I had been really enjoying up until that point. Explaining why the character of Lecter was the way he was, interested me, but then to push it SO far over the top and change Starling's character completely, was the author's disastrous mistake, in my opinion. I would have given it five stars but the ending brings it down to 3. Kind of sad and a major disappointment."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"there's very little to say in re characterisation and plot that hasn't been said in the other 2228 reviews of this book. I loved it, read it in a day, but thought the ending was a bit of a cop-out. I have three nitpicks.#1: the two officers Starling was helping in the initial police raid were called Burke and Hare. Oh pulleeeease!#2: The quadraplegic baddie was far too batman-esque. I mean, what's with the twenty four-hour tie him up and leave him there to escape method of killing him? MASON, YOU IDIOT, LECTER'S THE GOOD GUY. EVERY VILLAIN KNOWS YOU DON'T TIE UP THE GOOD GUY AND LEAVE HIM TO DIE WHILE YOU'RE NOT LOOKING.#3. the orange motif, which recurred over and over again was just silly. Moths are creepy. Lambs screaming are creepy. ORANGES AREN'T CREEPY.There. That's my bit said."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"No matter how one disguises pulp fiction under layers of polished prose and art history, its true nature comes shining through. So it is with HANNIBAL, a TALES OF THE CRYPT story masquerading as literature. Harris delivers a movie-ready tale with an eye to the bottom line, I'm sure. In this outing, Clarice Starling is suspended from the FBI, having been made the scapecoat for a failed operation. Meanwhile Dr Lecter is living abroad in Florence and is so happy in his esthetic pursuits that he hardly bothers to kill anyone except when really necessary. Back in the States, Mason Verger, a surviving victim of the good doctor (if life in an iron lung can be called surviving), plans his revenge. Verger was a young pedophile who avoided prison by agreeing to be treated by Dr Lecter. REALLY bad choice!I did not like this book. Not only did Harris betray his finest character, Clarice Starling, he did it in the ugliest possible way. I did not like the fact that he gave Lecter a back story that trotted out the over-used &quot;abuse excuse&quot; to explain the monster he became. I liked him much better as a straight up psycho. As for Mason Verger, you can find him or his ilk in every banned comic book from the 40s and 50s. Jodie Foster passed on the upcoming movie. Class always tells."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"That's what it felt like, reading this novel - like someone had just given me (or, rather, the author) a dose of some serious illegal substances. I can't say I didn't enjoy reading it - I did, actually - but in the way one enjoys something with morbid fascination. The plot is more than once extremely contrived, and the constant references to &quot;present day&quot; technology and ideas become entirely tedious after a few chapters. Since the characters are, after all, figments of the author's creation, I won't comment on their general actions, save to say that some of them had me either clucking my tongue, or outright laughing (try watching people look at you as you laugh aloud whilst reading a book most know is intended to be gruesome and horrifying - especially during one of Krendler's final scenes). I guess you could call it a guilty pleasure - I surely read it quickly and enjoyed the process, but the book itself made me suspect it wasn't Lecter injecting anyone with drugs, but rather Hollywood producers injecting Harris with them. Or, that Misery was stading aloft holding a large axe and threatening him to bring Hannibal back.Alas, it did give me a lot to say, which is more than some books do. ;)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"When I picked this book up at an airport bookstore, I did not have the benefit of reading either Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs previously. Rather, I took at as simply a NYT Best Seller, assuming it would be a good read. Indeed it was. It was worth my time reading it, and I enjoyed doing so. I would recommend that everyone else do the same, before they come out with the movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I wish Harris never wrote this one. He ridiculed the character, Hannibal Lecter. Moreover, i think Harris isn't a good writer at all. Just by researching on Italy and Behavioural science, he has included many facts but very poor with imagination and creativity. His description of serious and important sequences is poor as well."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was so anticipated, especially with all the buzz that Anthony Hopkins &amp; Jodie Foster might reprise their roles for a movie based on it. I was very disappointed in the ending which totally changed the characters we know from &quot;Silence Of The Lambs&quot; and made them up to be part of a ludicrous finale. A shocker of a book, yes, but for all the wrong reasons. I would not recommend it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have been hooked on Hannibal Lecter since first viewing the movie &quot;Manhunter&quot;. I read &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; and anxiously waited for 'Silence' to be made into a movie. I bought &quot;Hannibal&quot; on audio cassette the very week it was released because I wanted to learn about Lecter's latest escapades. &quot;Hannibal&quot; is no comparison to &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. Starling's role in this book is disappointing. The ending of &quot;Hannibal&quot; left a lot to be desired. If the movie ever gets made, I won't be rushing out to see it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I had been dying to read this book since the first news it was coming out. Finally I got my hands on a copy and devoured it. I loved it. The suspense, the characters. I loved The Silence of the Lambs and felt this book was a good follow up, until the last few chapters anyway. I feel the ending is totally out of character for the heroine. The turn of events at the end just don't make sense for the Starling that was introduced in Silence. Now I understand why Jodi Foster isn't going to be in the movie. I won't give it away for those who haven't read the book, but be ready for a shock. I'm glad I read it, but I was dissapointed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I couldn't wait for this book to be published! I thoroughly enjoyed all of Thomas Harris's previous novels and I had high expectations for this one. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met. Harris could have done so much with the return of Hannibal - instead he chose to bore us with gruesome details of an implausible story line. And the ending! It was almost offensive - it's as if he took the quickest and shortest route to wrap up the story to meet a deadline.On a positive note, he has a way of bringing the reader into the story with his wonderful landscape descriptions and historical and cultural narratives - they are the only reasons I kept turning the page."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal by Thomas Harris is set mainly in Italy and Mason Verger's home. The book is mostly about Mason Verger, who was one of Lecter's victims. He is now paralyzed yet somewhat alive, and he wants to capture Lecter to get revenge. So he hires various people to try and catch him. At the beginning of the book, Lecter is living in Italy under the alias Dr. Fell, and he flees to Canada after Verger's first attempt fails. The book constantly switches between what is happening with Hannibal Lecter and Mason Verger, with chapters about Clarice Starling in between. I enjoyed this book, but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It's a bit slow, unlike its prequel, The Silence of The Lambs, which I read in less than a week, while this took me about a month. The main reason it took me so long is that Harris put a lot of detail in, for instance, almost a whole chapter devoted to describing Pazzi's dead body, and full-page descriptions of buildings, streets, etc, instead of getting to exciting parts faster, as he did in Silence. There should have only been a few chapters on Italy, instead there was a whole 100 page section, in which the only part that caught my attention was the plan to get Lecter, yet once Pazzi gets into the museum where Lecter works, it's obvious that he's going to die. Something else I found annoying was that characters often spoke in Italian, and that kind of lost me as to what they were planning. Yet once you actually get what is going on, the plot is actually very creative. One of the best features of this book is that you learn more about Hannibal Lecter; his childhood and what he's thinking, so you actually end up feeling bad for him during some parts. I especially liked Thomas Harris using a \\"mind palace\\" to describe Lecter's mind. However, I think that Starling should have been included more, since she could have made the plot a lot more interesting. I didn't like the very ending, yet the parts very close to it are kind of intriguing, even while they are extremely grotesque. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with an extremely weak stomach because some of Harris' descriptions are quite vivid."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The tone is different than its predecessors. I enjoyed thinking about what was going to happen next while I wasn't reading it. Very chilling!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Forget all the hype that surrounds this and its prequels and all the people who expected it to be the best book ever written. This is no masterpiece, but it's a great read, exciting and intelligent. The prose is wonderfully sparse and restrained. The imagery is disturbing. Sure, the ending's like nothing you could have imagined, but what else could Harris have done? Up against the likes of The Bone Collector and Every Dead Thing and even the brilliant Prayers For Rain, Hannibal reads like it is written by THE master of the genre. It's two protagonists are the best characters in contemporary serial killer crime fiction. It reminded me that everyone else writing this kind of stuff is just a pretender to the throne. I hope Mr Harris writes something else before 2005!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It didn't take me long to get pulled into the grasp of Hannibal. I enjoyed Silence Of The Lambs and thought the sequal was worth reading, and I was right on the money. Harris's research and descriptions of his characters is remarkable. The details brought forth scents and feelings of being right there alongside Hannibal. Every word, every sound, every smell was expertly described and worded to give you a taste for this brilliant novel. Any fan of Harris and Hannibal should invest in reading this book...it's a great deal at Amazon that's worth purchasing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In flowery prose and lilting description, Thomas Harris once again draws us into the mind of the elegant monster Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Essentially, the book is less of a sequel but more of an individual novel with harrowing plot twists that render surprising results. This book tests the bounds of the believable, rising question to Mr. Harris himself who is quoted as saying, &quot;I can't write it until I believe it.&quot; The book begins in predictable fashion, but soon picks up the pace and prepares the reader for a tour de force of astronomic proportions. For a while, at least, we get what we came for. The description in the book is beautifully representative of how Lecter sees the world, and how we see him. An interesting aspect of the book is its treatment of Lecter, which presents him as a little more human but no less terrifying. I am reminded of the Rolling Stones song, &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;: Lend Lecter a shoulder to cry on with the risk of him nibbling at your neck.The book has remarkable potential early on, taking us through the haunted halls of Lecter's mind and introducing us to his nemesis, Mason Verger. The climax of the book is a page-turning, nail-biting roller coaster. If only the end justifies the means. These climatic events lead up to an end, which is for lack of a better word, perplexing. For fans who have followed his work and have waited 10 long years for a sequel, the ending is an outrageous betrayal of the characters and a disappointment. I have always loved a surprise ending, but please...make it plausible! The strained conclusion seems silly at best, as if it were penciled in at the last minute.Only now having read the book do I understand Jodie Foster's reluctance to do the sequel. While Harris created the character of Clarice, Jodie Foster gave her life on the screen. The book essentially betrays the character of Clarice, and sallows the plucky tenacity of her personality that makes her the sympathetic heroine of &quot;The Silence of the Lambs.&quot;While I enjoy the psychological insight into the characters, I feel the original story is somewhat marred by the sequel. HANNIBAL is a thought-provoking, beautifully descriptive book, punctuated by brief moments of genius. Its eventual downfall is its less than palatable ending, leaving the reader dismayed and vaguely unfulfilled."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thought the book was great, I had a problem with the Italian, but other than that I truly enjoyed the book. He was very detailed in his writing. I truly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; is one of the most thrilling thrillers I have ever read. So naturally this made me look forward to the sequel Hannibal. Even though the style of writing is still slick, I found the descriptions of what one can do with human beings (dead or alive) way too explicit. Sometimes it is better to leave a little bit to the imagination of the reader."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Trust me on this one: This is one case where you should skip the book and see the movie instead. Grab yourself some popcorn and go for it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Silence of the Lambs is a hard act to follow...Hannibal came close, but not quite. I would actually like to give it 3 1/2 stars, but that's not an option. It was (as usual) VERY well written. The descriptive talent of Mr. Harris continues, but the story-line waned, and the ending? Well, I don't want to give anything away, but it doesn't seem to fit the characters at all. Just an average reader's opinion...might be worth reading if you're REALLY into Mr. Lechter (kind of like continuing to torcher yourself w/Anne Rice novels), but not worth it if you're just picking it up."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The best yet I could not put it down I read it in the bath at work, I dreamed of him. In the silence of the lambs you fear and loathe him but in Hannibal you find yourself strangly rooting for him, a bad guy none the less but in a unusual way you dont want to see his downfall as an evil twisted criminal we all love to hate. This book portrays a different side of Lector, an insight into his mind and the places he goes in thought. A brilliant and engrossing book, I cant wait for number three."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Mr. Harris still manages to paint wonderful word pictures and his attention to detail amazes and fascinates, but once the climax of this book's plot is reached, the fall is precipitous and treacherous. Mr. Harris betrays the readers' faith in his characters and destroys any semblance of a coherent narrative in the final chapters of this book. It would be a great psychedelic parody, if Mr. Harris didn't seem so sincere in his attempt to fit his circular story into this square ending. Stay away from this if you're fans of the first two Hannibal-related tomes!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Quite possibly the most anti-climatic disappointing ending ever published. With Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs as procuresses to this novel I was anxiously expecting a winner, but instead I read a poorly written novel that leaves the audience wanting closure and satisfaction. Harris tries to use shocking scenes instead of reality based sequences, the characters are unbelievable as is the story and the reader is never allowed to be sucked into Harris's world. The ending leads me to believe that Thomas Harris is trying to set up his next big payday. If you are curious I rated Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon as a 4 &amp; 5 respectfully."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I approached this novel with some degree of trepidation, because I had heard mixed word-of-mouth reviews, and was wondering how Harris could possibly match (let alone top) his previous Lecter novels. I must say though that as I read Hannibal, skepticism faded into surprise and surprise was eventually replaced by a sense of delight and satisfaction.What this novel made me realize is that--his ability to portray psychological horror aside--Harris is a first-class writer, with a sure and certain touch in creating sustained dialogue, and a highly evocative, almost poetic gift for creating setting and scene. The only gripe I have is with some of his characters. Unlike the previous two novels, Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, some of Hannibal's characters are overdrawn and extreme, and Harris labors too hard to illustrate how they came to be the way they are. The bureaucrat Krendler, who despises Clarice Starling and has done everything possible to ruin her career, is a case in point. It is enough to know that he's a petty, small-minded cretin, and Harris didn't need to trace all Krendler's problems to the fact he couldn't get it up on his first try back in high school. That's just overly-simplistic, and Harris sells himself short in trying to bring it off. This need to over-explain carries over into Lecter himself, because in Hannibal we are finally exposed to the traumatic &quot;event&quot; that supposedly triggered the doctor's pathological behavior. It works reasonably well, but why not just leave Lecter as a symbol of &quot;motiveless malignancy,&quot; of the inexplicable presence of evil in the world?That said, everything else is perfect. Harris's evocation of Florence is magnificent, and the Florence section as a whole is incredibly successful. It's amazing how, throughout the novel, Harris's love for and knowledge of art, music and cuisine holds so much of the description and action together.A lot of people have criticized the ending, but I think it's the most brilliant, and apt, aspect of the novel. Instead of reducing the novel to what we all expect--a final showdown between Lecter and Starling, from which only one can emerge alive--Harris presents us with a scenario that is surprising in the extreme but psychologically true to the character of both Lecter and Starling. The fact that Harris avoided the kind of ending everyone wanted/expected shows that as a writer, he is a cut above the horde of psychological horror writers out there.As with Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs, you won't be able to do much else with your time but read voraciously once you're started. It's an incredible ride, and you'll want to read it again once you're finished, just to see if Harris telegraphed the incredible ending somewhere earlier in the novel. I just hope we don't have to wait another ten years to hear from Harris again."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"On one level, both Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal can be read simply for their entertainment value. Yet there is incredible symbolic meaning to be made from both of these books. Harris exhibits again in Hannibal his thorough understanding of the human psyche (specifically, why it is we do what we do). At the same time, several if not all characters act as literary metaphors; I will not bore anyone who reads this with my interpretation, but I believe there to be subtle significance to the allusory names of the characters, their habits (for example, Margot cracks walnuts with her hands), etc. Substantial analysis undertaken by the careful, thoughtful reader reveals new layers and greater depth each time the book is read. Thomas Harris contributes once more to psychologically exploratory literature, and indeed to great literature as a whole, in Hannibal."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Pedestrian would be the best description. Nothing new here - just a rehash of Silence of the Lambs, and not in a good way. Isn't anything that hasn't been seen in works by Stephen King or John Saul, and the ending was not shocking but just plain strange."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris, Harris, what have you done to the characters from &quot;Silence of the Lamb?&quot; This book is so bad, taking more time out of my life other than telling you not to waste your time is like pooping on poop!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This was an excellent book. I was drawn in and I definitely was creeped out by it. It is by no means a classic book. The Exorcist still ranks number one on my scariest all-time books list. I am 38 and have read a lot of horror books. Hannibal easily makes the top 10! It has it flaws, as other reviewers have angrily pointed out. Why get angry? Mason Verger was a frightening and disturbing character. The reader was forced to decide who was more evil, Hannibal or Verger. That was decided early on. I wondered until the end who would survive. Would Hannibal actually get devoured by the pigs? What would become of Clarice? I liked the unpredictability of the plot. By the way, Will Graham should have had a more prominent part. I enjoy Harris's writing style and his incredible vocabulary. He is a brilliant writer. Words like peignoir, frescoes, wimple, griffon and frottage are not words you see everyday. I have an expanded vernacular now!Some of the criticism of Hannibal is silly. The ending does make sense because it seems that the people Hannibal didn't literally eat, he devoured them mentally. This was the case with Clarice. I thought the ending was shocking, and the more I thought about it...yes it was believable....remember this is fiction!!! The only problem I have with the ending is simply that it didn't make sense for Clarice to have cannibal instincts too. I wasn't angry though, maybe slightly disappointed. Overall, it was a terrific read, the flaws in editing and tense are minor in comparison to the chilling storyline and fascinating characters. I compare it to the perfect meal with a dessert that was a bit too rich. I got the book from the library, and would not have felt at all like I wasted my money had I purchased it. I will watch the movie, but the book, as always, won't be topped by Hollywood."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am unusual in that I thought the ending was the best part of this book. It was more shocking than any of the earlier, grislier chapters."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I happen to consider myself a seasoned and voracious reader of fiction. My annual outlay for paperback and hardcover novels of all sorts occupies without doubt a sizeable portion of my annual income. This is due in large part to the fact that I have an undying obsession for those books that I simply cannot put down. All this to explain that my chief complaint about Thomas Harris' novels is that they have both a front cover and a back, whereas I would prefer them to be endless. I first ran across &quot;Red Dragon&quot; about a week ago. Due to circumstances beyond my control, it took upwards of four days to complete, after which I devoured &quot;The Silence of The Lambs&quot; as quickly as I could (4 hours, 38 minutes, including a break for cocktails). No joke. When I discovered &quot;Hannibal&quot; on the shelves of some third-rate airport bookstore, I felt positively thrilled. I snatched the book up breathlessly, and ran for my flight, realizing even then that I was in a somewhat awkward position.I had been completely seduced by a fictional character.For those Gentle Readers in the same boat, &quot;Hannibal&quot; is a wonderful treat to feed the darker side of your psyche. I'm going to assume that you aren't the sort to be put off by rich, vivid descriptions of international destinations or peculiar epicurian habits, or the lengths to which certain decadent monsters will go to exact revenge. I'll also leave you to decide who's whom.Characters from &quot;The Silence of The Lambs&quot; may appear somewhat pale or cartoonish in this novel, but Lecter I believe, still is Himself. Which is what I so enjoy about him. He neither apologizes nor makes excuses for himself. He simply is what he is and with his unerring survival instinct, will continue to be, without regard to what anyone else may think or feel about the situation(I have to admire that).The novel's ending, in terms of the relationship between Starling and Lecter (and perhaps the reader who has become sympathetic with them both over the course of two books and a movie) is one of the most unsettling and compelling scenes in fiction I've run across in several years. Three days later, and it's still on my mind. I dreamed about Hannibal Lecter last night. It wasn't scary at all.And a side note....I just finished watching the film adaptation of &quot;The Silence of The Lambs&quot;. Oddly enough, I didn't find it nearly so revealing nor accessible as the novel. And I furthermore would never limit my consideration of &quot;Hannibal&quot; by mentally reducing it to a 90-minute screenplay. It should be given consideration on it's own terms.(Hint-hint)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The last several chapters of HANNIBAL makes one wonder if Mr.Harris was under pressure by his publishers to complete the novel by a deadline. I felt ripped off by this book's unrealistic, heavyhanded, ABSURD conclusion. The shame is that up until that point the book was extremely well-written, suspenseful, even terrifying. I found at times that I could not read too much in one sitting because of the disturbing psychological depths Harris explores with Lechter. The scenes in Florence were superb, particularly the Santa della Croce encounter between the young woman and Lechter. My other complaint is that Harris woefully and shamefully neglects the Jack Crawford character, though at the beginning you are led to believe he will play a heavier role in this book. Barney has a bigger role which is silly, very unbelievable and frankly unnecessary. More Crawford, less Barney would have been better. As for Clarice Starling, this is NOT the same Clarice from SILENCE. Mr. Harris, how on earth could you lose such insight on her? In conclusion, I urge all readers NOT to purchase this overhyped sequel, unless you enjoy the sensation of having been mugged when you finish it. Note to Hollywood: rewrite the ending, unless you want a bomb on your hands."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I had not read either Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs before Hannibal came out, so I chose to read the three in chronological order. After being highly impressed with the quality of the first two books, I was fairly disappointed with Hannibal. Whereas in the first two books Harris does a solid job exploring the minds of both serial killers and those who track them, he descends into mindless psycho-babble in this third installment. I found the ending and the events that led up to it so difficult to believe, that I almost read it again just to be sure I did not miss anything. As a psychology graduate student, I was almost insulted at his explanation for the climactic turn of events. I feel as if he put forth great effort to develop the characters of Hannibal Lecter, Agent Starling, and other supporting characters in the first two books, only to destroy all he accomplished in this third installment. If you enjoyed Harris' first two books, do yourself a favor and re-read them instead of buying this one."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris' Hannibal is simply his finest novel. The 11 years spent in dire anticipation for this novel was well worth the wait. In Hannibal, Harris offers us clues as to what drives the &quot;monster&quot; Hannibal Lecter and to his utter fascination and compassion for Clarice Starling but without losing the mystique, the class and brutality that defines Hannibal Lecter. The book is a fast read, a lot like a screenplay but it has exquisite literary taste, well maybe for the Marquis de Sade :). Seriously though, the book is filled with classic Harris suspense and stark realism. He even offers us delicious (no pun intended) examples of Lecter's taste. The one thing I also really enjoyed about the book is a part where Lecter is in a certain part of the world in hiding but becomes a curator of a museum. The rich cultural history that Harris describes is truly mouth watering. I have heard this mentioned as a sadistic take on Beauty and the Beast and I agree in many ways but to just reduce Hannibal to that cliche is a travesty. Hannibal stands alone and I agree with Stephen King who coined this not a sequel. Hannibal is different of the three books about Lecter. Harris even introduces us to another character, who in many ways is far more scarier than Lecter and at times I found myself in the grip of a moralistic Cartesian Dualism. To Root or Not to Root for Hannibal Lecter. However, I would caution those readers who are faint of heart and weak of stomach that Hannibal might not be the book for you, but to wait for the unfortunate watered down Hollywood version. (I say that in hopes that if Jonathan Demme does direct this to please remain faithful as you did with Lambs). Harris does leave the door slightly ajar for a sequel and one more dose of Lecter would be a just dessert. The ending threw me for a loop and was totally unexpected, which is such a relief in this homogenized, formulaic and utterly predictable entertainment world. To conclude, Hannibal is a great novel and deserves the accolades it is sure to receive. Well done Mr. Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"With &quot;Hannibal,&quot; Harris has once again exhibited how a skilfully cultivated master of storytelling can craft a truly intriguing piece of literature. I found the writing to be fantastic ...lush with detailed description -tickling each of the five senses. Despite whatever misgivings or objections I found raised throughout the plot, the writing still managed to entice me further, crippling me from stopping in five minutes or at the next chapter. Characters old and new are certainly fleshed out (pardon the pun). Overall... a fantastic piece of writing. Plotwise, well... many have found it objectionable to say the least. But it must be specified that it is only the ending (however critical) that flounders in this respect. The story is bold and clever from catching up with aging characters, through its tour of Florence, plunging through the blackness of Verger's estate, and even through a carefully crescendoing climax. But then, I must agree with the many before me that the implausible ending does fail. Harris goes through a tremendous amount of effort to sell this ending, giving us many intellectual reasons to expect the unexpected, but it just doesn't sell. For me, this was the most disappointing. Here, Harris has produced another prolific look into the darkest sides of human psychology, but here in its most essential points, it is exactly the psychology which falls apart. The insight granted into Lecter, while ringing true and enabling the ending, nevertheless detracts from the mythic greatness of this character. And alas, in poor Starling, Harris ultimately sacrifices a deep, insightful character and fundamental psychiatry for simply... and ending, ineffectually turning her against the essence of her identity. (Almost seemingly as if he didn't know how to finish it). Ultimately, I found this book like quenching a parching thirst for fresh lemonade with cold coffee, satiating but not satisfying. But its definitely worth the read and makes for great discussion."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I wanted to read the reviews before I read this book. I REALLY wanted to read the reviews. However, I had a 2 hour wait for my flight at an airport, and I succumbed to buying this book. I will spare you all my thoughts because all of the reviews listed say it all. But I do have to add this; my flight went well, but this book went down in flames."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Amazing - everyone on Amazon either loves it or hates it. Those who hated it all seem to think that Mr. Harris is under contract to us, the reading public, bound by some unwritten yet understood pledge to deliver a \`sequel', whatever that is. Does this come from watching too many episodes of Melrose Place? (As Hannibal said in SOTL in response to Starling stating that it was something Miggs would say: \\"Not any more ...\\") What Harris delivers is certainly more than a sequel - a separate and distinct work of art. Brilliant! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. And as for the ending, which seems to have put everyone's panties in a bunch - again, brilliant."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have just finished reading &quot;Hannibal&quot;, after having read many of the readers' reviews here. All I can say is, I must be one sick puppy, because I thought the ending was the most original and most memorable part of the book. It is simultaneously chilling and hilarious, heart-warming and horrifying - all in all, one of the most unique reading experiences I've ever had. Also, looking back, this ending was carefully foreshadowed throughout the book - not only through Lecter's ruminations and activities, but also in Starling's growing disillusionment and disgust with the banality and treachery all around her. The whole book, in fact, is a jaundiced meditation on the swinishness of human society in general (none-too-subtly represented by the Mason Verger sub-plot). I can easily understand the outrage the book has apparently aroused, because Harris commits what is probably the supreme sin in our pampered, decadent culture - he openly mocks our egalitarian illusions, and celebrates elitism. Not an elitism of wealth, but rather of taste - because in Harris' God-less vision, taste and intelligence are ultimately the only things we have to live by."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I loved the language used by Harris, which is rich and graphic. The story, as expected, is quite disturbing, and I expressed my horror out loud several times. I wonder how Harris thinks of such evils. I particularly loved the character of Mason Verger, he is even more evil than Lechter, if that's possible. He will make a great movie character. The ending left me disappointed, however. Harris spends most of three novels establishing Lechter's personality and his MO. The air of mystery surrounding him makes him all the more fascinating. The ending of this book is a complete 180 degree turn, and sort of ruins the image for me. It left me confused and cynical. But most of the book was terrific. Prepare to be totally grossed out!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I finished this book last night, after savoring it over the last week. Unfortunately, it was somewhat predictable and seemed more a vehicle for the gore Lector intimated in Silence. It does give a little of his history to explain his cannibalism but...it's not a satisfying explanation. The end left me disappointed and dismayed. I will say this though, Hannibal is truly &quot;Il Mostro!&quot;I'm glad I read it but wish I had borrowed it from the library rather than having bought it. That's what I would advise other readers to do - if you really like it after reading it, then buy it to keep, but borrow it first."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is very good. It is a treat for those of you who think with their frontal lobes, not their hindbrain. So, if you were expecting splattergore and shock value you might have been disappointed. However, if you were after something that would show you the true alien nature of Dr. Lecter's thought processes then this is the book for you. The memory palace is a nice touch and Dr. Lecter's raison d'etre helps to flesh out his psychosis whilst still retaining the sense of his alien mindset. The stunning conclusion is even more horrific than Pazzi's demise, or the face slicing scene, for example, in that it shows how easy it is for the beast inside us to come to the fore in our conscious minds with a little ... persuasion. Yes even you could be a psychopath! Now that really makes me shiver!The book follows on well from the first two and retains the aura of mystery and otherworldliness that Harris can evoke so well. However, this time this aura spreads to his other characters. A fitting end to the trilogy."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris seems to have been reading Anne Rice. Hannibal Lecter has been transformed into Armand, with his small size, small, even teeth, enormous strength, air of attentive stillness and unnaturally acute senses. Even his age. He acts like--and seems to be depicted as--a young man, but he was born in 1938 and this makes him just a little long in the tooth for this sort of stuff. Harris confirms this impression when he states that cannibals are nomadic but vampires are territorial. Hannibal Lecter is territorial. The book, therefore, is in part a fantasy, and presumably this was the author's intent. While entertaining, it doesn't really work. In a fantasy, magic prevails and anything can happen. Most of the other reviewers do not like the ending. I share their opinion. Clarice is (magically) mesmerized by the vampire and comes to share his world. I don't buy it. In addition, the FBI segments are ridiculous. It has become a convention that government bureaucracies are inherently stupid but these people are too stupid for belief. Everybody who is pure in soul (and some who aren't) knows that Paul Krendler is vicious, venal and stupid. It seems more than unlikely that he would have risen as high as he has in any organization resembling a meritocracy. In addition, the way that the organization was willing to throw Starling to the dogs, for reasons that make little sense, was a convenient plot device but a total cop-out. That being said, it's still one of the more entertaining books that I've recently read. Too bad it wasn't better."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Having begun with Red Dragon when it was new in paperback and following upon the brilliance of Silence of the Lambs, the latest book by Thomas Harris struck me as an utter waste of time and completely alien to the strengths exhibited in his earlier works.Yes, the draw in this latest chapter is in knowing more about Dr. Lecter, but it did not have to be done at the expense of the previous chapters in the mythology. You see, one of the largest draws of this character is the fact that he was purely, unregenerately evil. His appeal is muted with the discovery of the past that molded him, and his &quot;redemption&quot; at the end of the novel not only lacks any sort of continuity, but also weakens the impact of his personality.To compound matters, in this book, we are treated to a variety of small-time con artists who think they are in his league...absolutely wretched, and did we really *NEED* a character who makes martinis from children's tears?Clarice Starling, who had been a full-fledged character in her previous incarnation, emerges from this book as a pathetic psychotic of her own accord. All her strength, dignity, and honor get sacrificed at the altar of the bumbling crooks who are above her in the pecking order at the FBI, leaving her ripe to Hannibal's machinations......though not even in an entertaining way.My final complaint with this book is that in addition to its ludicrous plotting and lack of consistency with the previous books in this trilogy is that it is simply poorly written. Harris shifts tense and perspective within the same paragraph, but not in a manner that seems artistically consistent. This novel struck me as having been written purely for the money, and is truthfully on a par with some of the more poorly-written fan fiction.....a shame, coming from the man who wrote one of THE classic suspense novels of the twentieth centry."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A marvellous read, and re-read. The work that has gone into the book is evident on every page. Some gruesome imagery, especially of the Doctor's first (still living) victim, but otherwise the descriptions and general atmosphere conjured up by the writing give a real feeling of place and pace. The descriptions of Florence are bound to cause a boom in tourism there; and who could but sympathise with the Doctor's suffering on the flight back to the U.S.? Some of the similes are superb - for example, the description of the smell from the cheese shop in Florence is many layered and gets better the more one thinks about it. As the book progresses, one becomes aware of a strange sympathy for, almost an empathy with, the Doctor - especially when his well chosen gift for Clarice rolls under her car. What can one say about the ending except that let's all hope that there will be another Dr Lecter book. Thank you, Mr Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What I can't fathom is how a man capable of such captivating writing could produce this book, which only occasionally shows glimpses of what Harris can do. Needless vulgarity. Comma splices without end. An ending that's clearly only meant to shock. And shocking sadism that belies the author's gentle demeanor. Good grief. It's depressing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Once I started it I had to force myself to put it down each night. It gives thought provoking insight into the mind Hannibal Lecter and leads you through the progression of madness and evil through the antagonist of this novel. As far as the character development of Clarice Starling is concerned in this book; I am not surprised in the least at her actions. Harris give us indications throughout the book with the events that take place in the beginning and the parallels revealed between Clarice and Lecter that make the ending almost inevitable, and makes me wonder why the ending was such a shock to readers . I thought that the role reversal Harris used was brilliant and he created characters that made this novel superb."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have loved all of Thomas Harris' novels but I was extremely disppointed with Hannibal. The last part of the book was especially disappointing. I usually zip through books but this was a labor to finish. I think Clarice and Dr. Lector deserved a better story. I recommend all of his other books though."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"So much expectation...so little delivery. The only reason I gave it one star was because no stars was not a selection.This novel had none of the drama, intrigue, or suspense of Harris' other novels. Instead Harris opts for the most shocking characters and events imaginable, each more shocking than the previous. When Harris isn't trying to simply shock the reader it seems as if he's showing off his obviously impressive knowledge of art, culture and cusine.I read 'Slience of the Lambs' in one sitting and have looked forward to this book for years. I am so sorry I ever purchased it.If you have yet to buy this book, Don't!!Borrow it from a friend, or grab it out of the trash, which is where mine went."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I hesitated few days before i started to read. I wasn't sure if I want to have Dr. Lecter back in my life again. Book once read can't be unread.But, in the world of &quot;Hannibal&quot;, Dr. Lecter is easy. Horror and danger hides elsewhere.Just can't read this book as any book. Dr. Lecter has already his own room somewhere in our minds (and maybe it has only double blackout curtain instead of the door...). I just prefer the world of Silence of the Lambs, where Crawford\`s and Sterling's strong and pure hearts fought against the evil. Now they are both so tired.In Florence there were exposition of torture instruments. But true element of cruelty were not in these instruments but in the faces of the crowd watching. Maybe there's a message to us readers.A thing that haunted me most in this book was Dr. Lecters memory of his sister, having a bath in the kitchen garden, adoring the color of egg-plants, her star-shaped hands reaching out. That was the most touching thing I have read for a long time.Please Mr. Harris, no more Hannibal Lecter- books. Maybe you should try to write the cookbook next. In Hannibal you had some interesting recepies NOT to try !"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Sequels to excellent novels often come with high expectations. True to the custom, while I loved &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; I thought its sequel did not measure up. Although it was well written with several intriguing moments, &quot;Hannibal&quot;'s plot did not have the intensity and the &quot;can't lay it down&quot; effect I had expected. I also missed the discovery of the main characters' psyche - to be expected from a sequel. Harris gets high marks for the continental and artistic flavors. The ending has an erie resemblance to a popular musical with a twist and is somewhat difficult to swallow. &quot;Hannibal&quot; registered on the same scale as the other Harris novels but did not approach its prequel's ranking among my top ten novels."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After waiting so many years for a sequel to &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, and with Mr. Harris' glacial writing pace, we could have expected a stronger book.Mr. Harris has changed Dr. Lecter into James Bond. Everthing about him is perfect - looks, mannerisms, taste. He has almost completely masked the monster we have come to fear from previous writings. In order to completely hide Lecter's past, he makes his protagonists as hideous as possible - is this Mason Verger or Dr. No?The book builds to such fevered pace with the final confrontation, then fades to a silly few pages of brainwashing. Such a strong character as Clarice Starling doesn't deserve this.I fully expected the ending to substitute a Bondish &quot;Ohh James.....&quot; with &quot;Ohh Hannibal....&quot;."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reaching the end of this book I have decided that I don't care about the money spent on it, I JUST WANT TO GET BACK THE TIME I WASTED READING IT! Let me do something worthwhile with it instead! It's so sad because the first half was good, but as soon as Lecter escaped Florence it completely went downhill. And don't get me started on how weird that whole thing with the pigs was. The ending is so ridiculous - it's as if Thomas Harris (after seven years) suddenly lost interest in his own book and just ended it without regard to whether or not it made sense. What happens to the characters is so out of place that one seriously thinks about just how Harris himself believes it. When they make the movie version I will not see it. Never. I almost threw the book out the window when I finished it I was so disgusted. For shame!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A tale of two souls who are misunderstood and rejected by their own, who find each other and discover an outlet for their repressed sexual feelings. The only words that were left out and should have been included at the end of this book were &quot;and they lived happily ever after.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I bought Hannibal to read on the beach while on vacation. I kept reading but also kept wondering why I wasn't interested. I'd put the book down and have to force myself to pick it up again. I did not find it entertaining, thought provoking, scary, or even worthy of mindless beach trash. The only thing that surprises me is that folks out there are still buying it. I don't get it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I waited for this book for sooo longgg!!! The first couple of chapters rated 2 stars, the middle part rated 5 stars and the ending rated 1/2 a star. I found it worth reading just for the middle part."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Mr. Harris is a very good writer in creating the character of Hannibal Lecter, one of the most sinster ever, but his current work pales in comparison to his other twp Hannibal books. The first part of the book is good, but the last half borders on the strange and obsurd. The ending was very contrived and not very original and lacked the punchy ending that Silence had. Mr. Harris could have put some more creativity in the contruction of the free Lecter - who in the second half turns into a weak character and totally unitelligent - a bitting departure from Lecter's cool composure. I only hope when this book is made into a movie that the screenwriter please the second half!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Did not live up to others. Ending a stretc"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book was OK but the ending was disappointing. I agree with another reviewer who said that the Clarice that we knew in Silence of The Lambs would not have given up as easily as this Clarice. The reading by Gerriol was also disappointing. The only character that he did well was Hannibal. So many times an audio version can ruin a great read if the voice at the other end is not plaesing. I anxiously await what Hollywood can do with this story.."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I've enjoyed Harris's books and bought Hannibal as a knee-jerk reaction. Thru three-quarters of the book, I wasn't disappointed. Then, as if Harris got up from the typewriter and Felini sat down, the book simply crumbled from a full grown work into a meaningless satire of Harris' fans being willing to applaude anything with his name on it. The publisher should be ashamed in contributing to the process."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I wasn't entirely sure what to expect after Silence of the Lambs, but I'm not sure if this was it. On a superficial level, I enjoyed it, but I often got the feeling that Mr Harris was trying too hard to achieve a shock value that wasn't really necessary. More so, his own intellectually driven bitterness shone through very strongly to the point that you often felt that Hannibal - more than being just his own personal anti-hero - was actually a representation of himself.Nevertheless, it is a very well researched book and for me was a good read. The end, however, was a bitter disappointment and totally in conflict with everything that preceded it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris, in his last attempt, gave us not one, but two monsers to contend with: Hannibal Lecter and Jame Gumb. They were monsters because of their minds and their personalities, not their physical appearance. Harris, in both Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon, does not rely on the visceral, slovenly horror found in Hannibal.It feels as though Harris got lazy with his character. Dr. Hannibal Lecter has become like every generic brand bogeyman out there on the market today. Lecter was not scary in SOtL because of what he did - he was scary because of what he could do. Potential can be scarier than actualization, and in this case it holds true. Harris had the chance to deliver a bombshell of a book. Instead this book just bombs. Thankfully I had Deaver's The Bone Collector to wash the taste of Hannibal out of my literary mouth."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris tells a great story, but all the way through I could feel him rubbing his chin and musing, &quot;What other grotesque absurdity can I put in to turn my readers' stomaches without turning my readers off.&quot; He neither turned my stomach (though he came close) nor turned me off (though he turned me off of the only sympathetic character in the book) though he gravely disappointed me.My recommendation is to see Manhunter, read Red Dragon, then read Silence of the Lambs but don't bother with the movie. Forget about Hannibal the book and the character. Let him vanish into the third world, never to be heard of again, as he did at the end of Silence.... You'll be much happier."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I found this book to be fast paced yet not only enlightening but historical as well. Thomas Harris takes readers on a very bumpy ride in Hannibal. It not only makes you wonder if Dr. Lecter isn't just out to protect himself and those that he loves/cares about but that his genious is just uncontrollable. I found Clarice Starling to be strong, motivated and yet vulnerable. It brings to light many of the policital problems that effect governments of today, the one-up-manship. I found Hannibal had a very twisted ending that not only shocked but made you think, really think! Overall, I found the book fascinating and would/have recommended it to friend, fellow co-workers and even my boss! Excellent!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Readers expecting another man-hunt/mystery are in for a disappointment with this third Hannibal Lecter installment. However, I was pleasantly surprised that Harris ended the saga the way he did.Though _Hannibal_ has been greatly criticized for the characterization of Starling, I never found myself doubting the veracity of her character. Several of the last moments bordered on the surreal, but I was completely satisfied with the conclusion Harris chose. While some readers might see it as a slap-dash ending, I see it as a slap in the face of every person who pushed him to finish this book before he was ready. Hannibal, Clarice, and Thomas Harris all have the last laugh, and I loved every minute."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book (and perhaps some others) need to have two tiers of rating; one for content/story and another for style and presentation. It would be especially appropriate to this work of &quot;cuisine.&quot; Harris may have peaked with &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot; however, he did give the reader an interesting romp through the good Doctor's memory palace. Brava to Jodie Foster who has graciously declined the role of Starling in the future movie. Dr. Lecter killed her, you see. He is, after all, a sociopath of the highest order. But instead of eating her body, he ate her soul."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Well, I couldn't stop reading this book. I would get home and read until I couldn't read anymore.I must say that it was an excellent book...until the end. The end of this book couldn't have been worse if it tried. The rest of the book was wonderful. The characters were well formed and I was wondering how the movie would butcher the excellent book. Now I'm hoping the movie re-writes the end. It's totally unbelievable."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading the book, Jodie Foster said that she would in no uncertain terms imagine reprising her role of Clarice, because the character had become totally unbelievable. While she and Anthony H. await the re-write for the script, everyone else who has not been witness to this ridiculous pice of garbage should await the movie and see if the screenwriters can salvage the mess."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Because of this book I have fallen in love with Hannibal Lecter. His character is so brilliant. His strength and power makes him more than just a mindless killer. This book never left my side and is a really quick read. I recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense and a lot of creepy stuff. This book is a must read and if this book is not on your list you better put it on there."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Trying to understand what is wrong with this book doesn't seem to be the right approach, so if you are about to read 'Hannibal', don't believe everything you hear or see from the so called &quot;critics&quot;. From what I can tell, most people don't understand just what Thomas Harris was trying to get across. Without giving anything away, &quot;manipulation&quot;, is the word that comes to my mind when I think of Hannibal Lector. Clarice, and the rest of his victims are just his puppets. Just read and enjoy!!! I did.."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"People seem to expect the characters and events in Harris' books to appear real and believable. This is FICTION! They aren't real and neither are the events. Ultimately I think Harris does a good job of telling stories that have the ability to make one's skin crawl and have us looking over our shoulder for whatever spooky reason. I thought &quot;Hannibal&quot; got off to a disappointing start, but after the first few chapters I began to enjoy it for exactly the same creepy feelings I got when I read &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot; Hannibal Lecter's character fascinates me because he is so creepy! I admire Harris for conjuring up characters such as Hannibal and Mason Verger, to allow our imaginations to run wild. The ending surprised me, and in fact I had to read the last few pages twice to make sure there wasn't some sublety I might have missed the first time. It definitely leaves room for another sequel!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book has little to no suspense. The first chapter and the last chapters do a little. The rest is a long story that is very drawn out. The film better do some reworking. I usually like everything I read but this was just boring. Wait for the paperback or the movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I listened to this rag on audio. Thomas Harris completely succeeded in his effort ... make lots of money on the movie. Good for him. What really grabbed me was DANIEL GERROLL as the narrator. Now HE is worth listening to ... even if he is reading an insurance policy. His range of expression is amazing. I will definitely look for him on audio books in the future. I would never have finished this as a book ... too unreal ... badly written ... NO ONE could be as smart as Lecter (really an unbelivable character) ... pompous ... wordy. But having listened to it read by Daniel Gerroll salvaged much."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris has done it again! He's a story teller par excellence who can keep us sitting on the edge of the chair chapter after chapter. His knowledge and descriptions of Florence give even more reality to the chilling events. I always give the book I pick up after a Harris page-turner a second chance because it can NEVER match its predecessor."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I've been waiting, salivating and anticipating this book since I heard it was in the works. I rushed right out and got it and dove in and was not disappointed at all until much later in the story.It does get a bit tedious after awhile reading about all the different wines, pieces of music and other interests of Lecter's, over and over again. But, it serves its purpose in showing he's not a sick, depraved monster only. He's a highly intelligent, articulate one as well which has you pulling for him at times. Pretty decent pace throughout, some slow spots but overall a good read... until the last 40 pages or so.What a complete and utter disappointment the ending was, it really killed the whole story for me. It seemed Mr. Harris took the easy way out by giving us the conclusion he did, not only a disappointment but a completely preposterous ending. I sort of expected it the way things were going there at the end but found myself aghast when I reached the final page, aghast that he would actually try to sell this ending off.If there is a movie, they had BETTER re-write the ending. It's an ending not worthy of the excellent talents of Jodie Foster or Anthony Hopkins."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I know, I know, how could it possibly have lived up to Silence of the Lambs? But I thought there was a CHANCE. Turns out Hannibal isn't a monster at all, he's one of the good guys, and law enforcement is all on the take. And maybe I missed this, but did Harris only write in sentence fragments before, or is this a new affectation? His sentences begin in the middle, and then drift off, like you are walking into the middle of a conversation that already began. Then just for jollies, every once in a while he shifts into the second person, as though you are standing in the doorway watching all of this unfold and he is inviting you in to participate. And then he jumps back to third person narration.I had heard that Harris would not allow anyone to edit his book, and I believe it. I look forward to the edited version."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Don't get me wrong. I loved Mr. Harris's new attempt but the character of Clarice Starling isn't the same. I do realize that time has passed between her success in killing Buffalo Bill in Lambs but this Starling isn't that entertaining. Mr. Harris should of pulled Will Graham out this time. The plot would of made more sense and given back the mystery of Dr. Lecter's motives. It would of been intresting to see Dr. Lecter encounter Will Graham in the open. Perhaps this is for the future. So for now enjoy Hannibal for what its worth."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading Thomas Harris' latest forray into the world of Dr. Hannibal Lecter and Special Agent Clarice Starling, it struck me that the two previous films based on Harris' work (_Manhunter_, i.e. _The Red Dragon_, and _Silence of the Lambs_) seem to have influenced the culmination of this so-called &quot;trilogy.&quot; Reading _Hannibal_ one cannot escape the images and performances that Harris' characters carry with them from the film medium (there's an interesting thesis for all you film students out there: Evident Affects of Film on the Literary Medium in the Work of Thomas Harris). One also wonders if this follow-up to _Silence of the Lambs_ is more a continuation of the novel or the Oscar-winning film. I would lean towards the film's influence, as much of the writing is curt and precise, dealing with immediate sights and sounds, much like a film screenplay.In any event, the book is an easy read, as well as being entertaining in its own right, and perfect for a day of reading by the shore this summer."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was so disappointed and bored initially as I read 'Hannibal' that I was ready to chuck it by the end of the first section. Then I decided to check &quot;Customer Reviews&quot; on the Internet. Based on some of the positive comments, I picked up the book again. Beginning wih Section Two, I became mesmerized by the chain of events, relishing every word. It just kept getting better and better. S-o-o-o, if at first you don't like it, just keep reading. At some point, it'll cease being just words on paper. You'll get drawn into the macabre world Thomas Harris has brilliantly created. I shake my head when I think of how close I came to not reaping the rewards of this book. READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is a great read. It is a lot of fun. The story is really interesting and fast paced. And there is a happy ending for some of the characters.Clarice is treated really wierd. Her FBI people are setting her up (hint - don't annoy Hannibal), she is after him, he is after her. Hannibal is almost the good guy here."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book deserves a lot more credit than the critics have allowed. its colourful, well thought out (well harris did have all last decade to think about it didnt he). this book is aimed at the intelligent reader as complex issues and emotions are in play. there is love and hate and revenge etc, but not in the simplistic, broard sense. harris gives more depth and meaning to these words by emphasising their variety and texture.Hannibal himself is a wonderous character that brings the whole story together. he is a character that has freed himself of the restraints of society to such an extent that society perceives him as a vilian, in this book, more so than we saw in scilence of the lambs, we begin to see societys' real vilians.The only bad point to this novel is that there is excessive use of physical attacks, whereas in scilence of the lambs, the attacks were more phsychological ones. though, saying that, the last 100 pages were almost pure mind games - absolutly briliant.unfortunatly the film missed that bit out but that doesnt take away from anthony hopkins excellent (as usual) performance, the film was nothing without him.Also, if you have been as desperate as i have about finding out more about the mind of dr lecter himself, you must read this book, it reveals some of dr lecter while still keeping you in the dark enough to hope theres more to come from harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I loved Silence of the Lambs. And I loved Hannibal, but not in the same way. While Silence of the Lambs is a psycological thriller, Hannibal is more of a psycological chaser.Clarice Starling returns in Hannibal; crippled politically by a recent botched shootout, Clarice takes up a more office life. But when Mason Verger (Hannibal Lecter's only victim that survived) chases Lecter from hidding, Clarice begins to track Lecter too. What she doesn't know is that Lecter is also tracking her. Mason attempts to capture Lecter, in order to revenge himself, for what Lecter has done to him. What follows is a race for Lecter.I personally liked Lecter better behind bars, where he did his damage mentally, not physically. BE WARNED: Hannibal is more violent and gorey then Red Dragon or Silence. Though I enjoyed Hannibal, it didn't have the same fast paced suspense as Silence. Don't get me wrong, it was just as fast paced but... it was lacking something. Maybe it was that Hannibal let Lecter win totally, he never lost. What ever the case, Hannibal lacks something.Hannibal is good, it just isn't Silence of the Lambs good."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Like any piece of art that is worth discussion, Hannibal by Thomas Harris has inspired thousands of people to put forth their opinions. I believe that the purpose of art is to evoke an emotion, any emotion, from the people that experience it. That is why I love this book.I will not go into the story of the book because that seems to have been drudged through enough times by people more capable than I. I will however say that this book is definitely worth the read. For people who say that the ending is over the top and absurd I say to you that Life its self is absurd. Besides I really don't believe it to be all that unthinkable; all of Starling's protectors and friends at Quantico have gone in one way or another, she shows an indifference to victims (notice how she corrects herself when she refers to the Bimmel girl as a \\"floater\\" and also how she laughs when she sees the dead hunter, the \\"old\\" Clarice would have never done such things), the only part left of her is her anger at anything being held captive and tortured. One can assume that Clarice is being held captive in this world where she tries to do good in the face of men whom either want her to fail or want to \\"have\\" her or both. She's stuck and has nowhere else to go until someone has to save her from her own torture and pain. The reversal of roles here is slippery and quite striking. One of the trickiest ideas that Harris tinkers with is the idea that good has to have a bit of bad to it or else it would not last. Perhaps this is survival at its dirtiest or even purest form. I could go on but I feel that too much might ruin the novel for anyone who hasn't read it yet.Whether or not you liked this book does not matter, what matters is that it will always be a very memorable experience."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The level of satisfaction you gain from this book depends on how you look at it. If you look at it as a sequel, as a follow-up to &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, you might call it poor, because it just can notget out of it's mother's shadow. Looking at the book that way it is not only poor but a shame. That would be 3 stars, I guess.But if you come around to think that this is NO follow-up, but just another book featuring Hannibal Lecter, it might be the most satisfying book of that series (Red Drago - Silence - Hannibal, because it gives you unlimited inside into Hannibal Lecter, uncut and uncensored access to his mind ... and his brutality. ****I do not think that my job as a reviewer of this book is to give you an exact summary of the plot, even if you claim you have to know something about the book's storyline to decide whether it suits your expectations or it does not. I will not even give you a rough pictue of the plot, but I give one thing: this book is worth reading. If you liked SOTL, because you were fascinated by Hannibal Lecter, read this book. Even if you liked the whole character of this unique thriller more, read Hannibal, even if - for you it is a follow-up.When Harris comes to describing Lecter's mind you will come to realize that this is one of the most awkward pieces of writing you have ever experienced.There are some pretty strange scenes in this book, so be prepared. You might even call these scenes a little bit &quot;weird&quot; but who are you and me to decide? After all this was a very satisfying read, once again showing that Thomas Harris is an author worth reading!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book is much better than the movie. (but then books always are!!!)Be ready to hate Mason Verger! He is a truly despicable character! You will be touched by the way Dr.Lecter interacts with Starling. You also gain insight into Lecter's traumatic childhood, and begin to understand him. (something I wish the movie had included)It is a long book, but a page-turner. Don't plan on getting anything else done until you finish reading this one, as it's a hard book to put down. I also enjoyed Red Dragon, also by Thomas Harris"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The first time I read the book I put it away with other books that I plan to never read again. I was thoroughly put out with the ending - and couldn't conceive of Clarice's change of behavior. About six months later I took it out and read it again, more slowly this time. This time I was able to feel, from Clarice's POV how utterly wretched Krendler and the FBI had treated her and could understand why she would end up taking off with the delectable Dr. Lecter. I should admit that Dr. Lecter attracts me in a variety of ways, but I think mostly because I enjoy his wicked sense of humor. He may be partly a monster, but a monster with his own moral code. He stays true to himself. Loved the scenes where Pazzi was bungling through trying to capture Dr. Lecter and get the reward money for himself. You knew that he just was not as mentally agile as Lecter and would end up dead, one way or another. I liked the film version of Pazzi's death better than the book while I MUCH preferred the book's ending to the movie's. After the second reading, I wanted Lecter and Clarice together. While I'm not sure he is able to truly love, he comes as close as it gets with Clarice - he admires her truth, her morality (while ragging on her about it), her mind (and her feet). I think she does come to love Lecter, faults and all. His wit, his elegance, his intensity all attract her. Of course, being able to visualize Anthony Hopkins in the role of Lecter helps a lot towards me accepting Lecter. The man has charisma to spare. (A note: DON'T try and cast someone else as Lecter in &quot;Red Dragon,&quot; it just won't work.)Bravo! Now, how about a book set about 5 years after the ending of this one and letting us see where they are at and what they are up to? One note, I liked the little bon mots that AH added during the movie. The &quot;goody-goody&quot; and &quot;okey-dokey&quot; during tense scenes was just enough to keep you from jumping out of your seat. Would like to see them made part of any future book(s)."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"OK, in previous works we learned that The Cannibal was familiar with such bucolic pastimes as fishing for doodlebugs with a straw and slaughtering those eponymous spring lambs. And the good Dr. showed an uncommon affection toward Little Clare Starling, a bumpkin with a nice handbag. Implication being the big L was from down home somewheres, perhaps a native of Mississippi like the author. But now...oh, lordy. We learn Lecter's some kind of Eastern European aristo, who's got kind of a complex over how those nasty deserters dun et his lil' sister. (Maybe it was just the presentation.) No wonder Ms. Foster bailed on the sequel. Nonetheless, must confess, read every word, so I guess the author's concessions to Hollywood don't totally alienate the fava beans and big chianti crowd. Wonder what this book would have been if Gene Hackman had taken the part in *Silence*."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A good read, but it's no Silence of the Lambs. I did like it better than Red Dragon, though. Much gorier than either of those two. Ending was a little unbelievable. And Hannibal seems to have developed near superhuman powers, where in Silence of the Lambs, he was just really really smart."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book isn't really that bad. It's nicely written, but when you get down to it, the plot isn't very original (a nemises bent on revenge). I liked Hannibal Lecter better in TSOTL, because this book wasn't as &quot;creepy&quot; when Lecter is free. We do get a look at his private life, and learn that he is a fine art lover and is an accomplished piano player. This book is more of an action book then a &quot;suspenseful&quot; one. The ending, however, was quite surprising. If you liked Silence of the Lambs, it's a good bet you'll like this one."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Reading the book, the true horror unfolds when you see where Harris is actually going with the end of the book. The ending is so unbelievable that it makes you go back and recognize the flaws of the rest of the book. Harris was certainly influenced by the success of Silence, and needed to build the book around the heroes of the movie (Hannibal and Clarice). Almost every character is completely unlikeable, and we are supposed to actually root for Hannibal the Cannibal (and understand him). Harris is a gifted writer, and the pace is quick and the book keeps you interested, but ultimately leaves you extremely empty and cheated."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris shows us some of the most gruesome stuff we'll read for the rest of our lives. I see why Jodie Foster turned down the role. But I did like the book. I thought that the part with Pazzi was too long. I like the basic plot of the book even though it is twisted, vintage Harris.I have to disagree with those that are against giving Hannbal a reason for his madness. It had a big part, psychologically, with the reasons for the ending. I'm not sure I liked the ending but I did find it shocking, Which was Harris was trying to do."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was so disappointed with this book, I almost regret reading it.Now, let me step back for a moment. I am a huge Thomas Harris fan. I devoured &quot;The Red Dragon,&quot; ran willy-nilly through &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot; and waited with baited breath for &quot;Hannibal.&quot;Unfortunately, &quot;Hannibal&quot; was a bitter disappointment. The ending was wholly unbelievable and implausible, not to mention borderline gory and grotesque.It seems to me that Harris rushed through &quot;Hannibal&quot; in order to satisfy the demands of readers and fans only to produce an inferior novel which left the devoted among us sour.I would hate to think that Harris's talent has been tapped. Hopefully, this is not the beginning of a downward spiral and that Harris has other &quot;good things&quot; in store for us."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is a thrilling book and very well writen by Thomas Harris. He uses emmence creativity and detail. My imagination was kept active the whole time i was reading and I was on the edge of my seat. The book is written about Dr. Hannibal Lector well known Doctor, killer, genius and murder. He excaped from the FBI in silence of the lamb and has been at large for seven years. Millionaire Mason Verger the only survivor of Lector wants him dead and will stop at nothing to get it. He derives an amazingly elaborate scheme for the demise of Dr. Lector. He uses his all of his funds and all his connections both over seas and with the FBI to try to catch lector. In this book every one wants somthing, most want money, some want revenge, some want fame, but all the people who get too greedy will become victims. Harris gave book roller coaster twists and turns with a finish that will take your breath away. It is an amazing book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book lacks the suspense and forward thrust of &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot; By now we know all about Hannibal Lecter, so his cannibalistic ways have lost their capacity to fascinate and repulse. Moreover, we have a rather tiresome subplot involving Clarice Starling's embattled FBI career. Clarice herself seems a bit bland and uninteresting in this book, too, for all that Harris appears to be a bit in love with her. And the ending is disappointing as well. It's meant to be shocking and surreal, but it comes off as a cheat, full of dreamlike nonsense scenes.Still, the book has good qualities as well. Harris writes with confident, literary ease, which makes the language a pleasure to read. The middle portion, set in Florence, Italy, is extremely well done, and the character of Rinaldo Pazza is probably the best in the book -- subtle, sympathetic, yet a corrupt failure. And certainly the &quot;other&quot; monster in the book, Mason Verger, is suitably grotesque and disgusting.All in all an enjoyable book, but it certainly lacks the wallop delivered by &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is the sequel to Silence of the Lambs. Hannibal Lecter, the cannibalistic madman that escaped from prison in the first book now resides in Florence, Italy as a museum curator. Once in a while he tantalizingly contacts Clarice Starling and explains that he is still watching out for her.The story gets interesting when Mason Verger gets wind of Lecter's location. Verger is a multi-millionarie survivor of a Lecter attack. He has been left crippled and ruined and wants to get revenge on Lecter by feeding Lecter to a pack of hungry pigs. Mason uses Starling, local politicians, devious Sardinians, and the FBI as pawns as he attempts to lure Lecter into a trap. However, Lecter proves to be hard to catch, as well as deadly.This book took a little while to get going. While it held my interest, I was finding it hard to root for anyone. Lecter certainly isn't worth of any sympathy and neither is Verger and Starling was absent for about half the book. There is a certain amount of tension as the reader follows Lecter's efforts to thwart Verger, which often are violent and graphic. However, the ending is utterly ridiculous - probably one of the worst I've read in a long time. Up to that point, it was a spellbinding, tight read. It works great as a horror / suspense novel, but as a \\"true-crime novel\\", pathetic."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is the first book that I have read from Harris and found that I was very dissappointed. For one thing, I hate excess verbiage, which this book definitely entails. Second, if you are interested in elegance and upper-class lifestyles, which I'm not, then this book is for you since it entails very descriptive intricacies of the upper-class lifestyle. Third, the ending was terrible and completely and ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE, or even thinkable! From what I hear, from friends and other reveiwers is that Red Dragon and Silence of The Lambs are a lot better. So with that in mind I think I'll give these two books a try. As for the Hannibal, I wouldn't give this book a high recommendation to anyone. Sorry but I was definitely disappointed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As an admirer of &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; and especially &quot;Red Dragon,&quot; I looked forward to anything Harris had up his sleeve. I might've read his grocery lists. Lots of time passed. &quot;Hannibal,&quot; therefore, disappoints. It certainly has inspired moments and, as he has done before, Harris' ability to elicit sympathy for Lecter is remarkable. The bulk of the novel, however, just doesn't transport the reader (not this one anyway) the way Harris has done before with seeming ease.&quot;Hannibal&quot; is terribly overwritten at points -- almost as though Harris feels the need to demonstrate that he's as intelligent and cultured as his trademark character. Well, duh! What is, at its heart, three compelling stories which meet two-thirds of the way into the book is done in by Harris' fooling around. While his destruction of the fourth wall works wonderfully the last time he does it in &quot;Hannibal&quot;, its impact is lessened by the many times he switches narrative voices (to no gain) over the course of the novel.Lord knows it must be difficult to write under the kind of attention and pressure Harris has labored under since &quot;Lambs,&quot; but it hardly called for the kind of showboating which sinks an otherwise promising novel. A shame, because the ending is really pretty suave -- it's just not entirely earned."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Extremely graphic and hard-hitting, this is a disjointed story, that has a choppy, uneven feel to it. Harris is a brilliant writer, and his talent is evident in most chapters. Not sure if more editing could have polished it, but it didn't stack up to &quot;Lambs.&quot; Contains explicit depictions of some sickening situations."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is unlike anything anyone could have expected, and that is a wonderful thing. Instead of getting the continuing adventures of Clarice, we get a superbly written tale that exposes the horrors and demons of every main character. Plot does take a back seat to description and metaphysic discussion, but the plot is also the jumping point for all of that, so it ends up carrying the story along. I really loved the way this book was written; I could feel the things Harris was writing about, and could imagine myself in these places. This book is not for the weak at heart, or for those who like everything tied up in a neat package at the end. But, for readers willing to view popular characters in a strange new light, and willing to take a satisfying yet strange journey through Mr. Harris' world, the rewards are great, and this will stick with you long after completion."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thought this book would be okay but found that I enjoyed it much more than Silence of the Lambs. I could not put it down from the moment that I started. The ending was such a surprise that I had to read it twice. I would encourage everyone that read Silence to read this. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs I was hoping for the same type of page turner. Hannibal was a good book if you were looking for a psychological dissertation or head shrinking handbook. As a page turner, or as a follow up to Silence of the Lambs, it falls well short."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After Harris wrote Silence of the Lambs I believe his intent was to leave it at that and not write another book. Perhaps it gives everyone comfort to know the outcome of Lector, but I was certainly pleased with the legacy of Lector ending in Silence of the Lambs. This book is unimaginable and just serves as an ending which I think was poor. Otherwise, Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs were two great books and I also reccommend Harris's other book, Black Sunday."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm sure everyone knows that Thomas Harris published this book &quot;as-is&quot;: no editing, no proofing, just a &quot;Here it is. Print it.&quot; to his publisher. It works. Not perfectly at times, but \\\\/\\\\/hatever /\\\\/\\\\ary.. It's still a horrible (in the good sense) little piece from a mind not just twisted, but actually sprained. I can't see this ever being a movie, and even if it were, I doubt Jodie Foster would get involved unless the ending were changed dramatically (ie., &quot;removed&quot;) Nothing against The Goddess, I just don't see this as her cup of tea. One critic said &quot;No one is as smart as Hannibal is.&quot; I say, &quot;Honey, get out more often!&quot; Read it, enjoy it, avoid sweetmeats."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is a story relying on previously developed characters thrown into a plot that gets weaker and more disjointed as the pages turn. The entire ordeal, and that is exactly what reading this book is, was unbelievable and poorly told."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"There is a fine line between brainwashing someone into doing something and the release of that subverted desire. Set ten years after Hannibal Lechter's escape, Clarice Starling's life is nothing like she expected it to be. After her rescue of Sen. Martin's daughter from the hands of Jame Gumb (Buffalo Bill), Clarice has been shuffled off from one low-class assignment to another, her career track being manipulated from above by Paul Krendler, an extremely vindictive DOJ higher-up that can't accept her beating him to Buffalo Bill, or her refusal of his sexual advances. When things look their darkest, Hannibal comes calling on Clarice, reminding her who she is and of the strength that is in her. Meanwhile, a surviving victim of Lechter's, Mason Verger, has put a bounty on Hannibal's head, and law-enforcement types are stumbling over themselves to trap him. Continuing in the vein that made his earlier books so riveting, Thomas Harris once again pored the reader into a killer's mind, for us to find our way out."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I can't believe anyone would have a negative judgement on the ability of Harris to write. He has a wonderful gift, he is a genius, and this book left me with mouth agape for several minutes after I finished it. This book is incredible; Harris masters the art of painting indescribable pictures in your mind, often with a simplicity that many can't even imagine having. The ending was exactly what I knew should happen; I reread two sentences at the end many times a day, (if you've read it, it's after the breast feeding conversation) because I have never read something as sensual as these words, again, beautiful in their simplicity."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;Hannibal&quot; begins where &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; ended, with gross horror and a revolting villian. However, it rapidly changes to a much less intense book that entertains and explains. I believe Hopkins and Foster will refuse to do a sequel movie based on this book because of their objections to the ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is more a novel than an example of classical art. It's an amazing narrative, which brings the reader to the region of the unknown. Hannibal is a freudian model of serial killer. On the other hand, Thomas Harris is the paragon of the serial writer. I am his serial reader..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I arrived at my local bookstore on the day of Hannibal's release. I couldn't wait to bring the good Doctor into my home and get reaquainted with him. What has he been up to I wondered. Who has he been saut&eacute;ing? Has he been in touch with Clarice? All of my questions were answered and much more. Harris takes us on a journey through Dr. Lecter's deeply twisted mind. I actually found myself rooting for Hannibal as he is forced to confront vengeful enemies from his past. Harris introduces us to another dark, devious, character named Mason Verger. Wait until you get a load of this guy. I admit I am still trying to swallow the conclusion of the book; however, I will not complain about it. Hannibal is a highly descriptive, beautifully paced read that quickly takes a white knuckle grip on the reader and refuses to let go."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is a disappointment, poorly written and not well thought out. Expected better!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"James Harris hooked me when I read Red Dragon the first of five times. I've since read all his books and eagerly await any new novels. Mason Verger is the epitome of true evil - I think he certainly rivals Lechter as the true arch-villian. While not as seductively evil as Red Dragon, this new book is certainly a welcome addition for us serial-killer junkies. I only wish he would write more often than every 10 years."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"First let me say I think that Harris is great but this has problems - not least supplying a 'motivation' of any sort for Hannibal but then what do we make of Clarice - can this work, I don't think so. Still at times it is disturbing and that is what it is meant to be - but the two previous were close to genius - this cares too much"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Another Harris cliffhanger is with us. Hannibal is loose and I too found that, once I started reading, I just couldn't put it down. It's Hannibal at his gruesome worst. I was most disappointed by the ending - not at all what I would have expected having read Tom Harris' other books in the Hannibal Lecter series. All in all though, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to all readers of psychological thrillers. Definately not for the faint of heart."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A great book. This book is the kind of book that will make you have nightmares weeks after you've finished reading it. I cant wait for the movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A very different book, admittedly, from Silence of the Lambs, in it's own right Hannibal is better. Far better.Seven years after his escape, Hannibal Lecter is content to let the world move around him, provided he has what he loves most, beauty in any form. He also amuses himself by keeping up with the life of former...chat buddy?...Clarice Starling, who has learned the hard way the FBI doesn't take kindly to &quot;Wimonfolk&quot; encrouching on their territory.Hannibal's reasons for wanting to help Starling as his own, and never completely revealed. He's still obsessed with her (at one point he breaks into her car and licks her steering wheel).The biggest gripe I hear about the book is the ending. I disagree, I adored the ending. The world that Hannibal Lecter creats is enticing and intriguing. So is this book. Ignore the so-called critics. Give it a chance."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This novel is full of excitement and pulls you forward with every page. Lecter's uber-intelect is fascinating."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I admit that Mr. Harris writes with taste and style, which is well worth reading, but he should have worked longer on his ending.While I admire the majority of the novel, I must insist that the ending is not only absurd, but stupid. It is going to take more than a few hocus-pocus hypnotherapy sessions to turn a person from who they are, to someone not even remotely like who they are. The only way I coud accept that ending is if torture had been involved.Honestly, he should have just let it end with death of Mason Verger, thought about it some more, then wrote the next book. As it stands, any future book of his dealing with Dr. Lecter will go unread in my library."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Okay, I stayed up all night reading this book the day I got it. I loved it. I couldn't resist reading passages out loud to everyone around me. Of course, the entire time I'm reading it, I am wondering how Harris can possibly end the story in a way that will please everyone.Well, the ending bothers me. I think it will probably bother me for a long time. And I doubt there will be a sequel that fixes things. The brilliantly and elegantly written final act will give me the heebee geebees for years to come. It really gets into your skull.Anyway, read this book. It is not a &quot;feel-good&quot; book. If you think it is a romance, I hope you mean that sarcastically. Don't be put off by all the people whining about the ending. They're all just mad because none of them predicted what was going to happen. And, hey, it's nice to know that I'm not so jaded that I can't be disturbed by something I read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As was said of another thriller writer, Thomas Harris writes like a slumming angel, but Hannibal is a disappointment. Hannibal Lecter was the devil himself in Silence; in this he's just human after all. And what happens to Clarice Starling seems so compeltely out of character, I just didn't believe it. I don't understand why Harris chose the most incredible scenario of all for her. It squandered one of the most believable, finely-drawn characters I've seen in modern fiction and reduced her to a mere Bride of Frankenstein. A letdown for me. And dinner with Hannibal again? No thanks."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Well, as were most I was disappointed with the ending of Hannibal and found it a little ridiculous even. I tend to agree with those that mentioned it was a clever ploy to keep this story away from hollywood and regain control of his characters. Whatever Harris has decided here it's still hard swallow(bad joke) that ending. I do think some of the complexities of Lecters character were well created and explained but Starling became something she would have never in the world Harris had previously devised for her. All in all, a fun and interesting read but not a Red Dragon or Silence by any means."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Funny how all these bad reviews are so very passionate, and that's just what TH wanted. Passionate because he's failed at his task? Because he's no longer the great writer he always was? Because he wrote an ending people can't stomach? Give me a break! The book is just as fantastic as his others, just as well written, and more disturbing than his previous fare. The beauty of this novel is its wonderful unpredictability. I have never put down a book so much and exclaimed, &quot;My God!&quot; Thomas renders passion--the only true reward a true writer ever desires--and he does it expertly, with the subtle manipulations of a master storyteller. In brief, I say to all you one-star raters out there: &quot;Me thinks thou doest protest too much.&quot; And in your passionate protests, the truth of the matter is revealed..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm sorry, but this book is not that good. How it can be ranked #1 mystifies me. There are so many other great books to read, Cold Mountain, The Triumph and the Glory, The Reader, The Pilot's Wife, why should anyone try and wade through a half-hearted effort like Hannibal ?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was an excellent read, and well worth it. And, in one way, the resolution of the fates of Dr. Lecter and Clarice Starling is satisfying, as are all fairy tales. However, taken in the context of Harris's earlier books, I feel a bit let down. This ended up just fluff, not the gritty substance we expect from Harris. It almost feels to me as if Harris wrote the book to cave in to years of pressure, and then rounded it all out and presented it as neatly and prettily packaged as one of Hannibal Lector's beribboned box lunches from Fauchon. The paperback romance reader in me applauds it. However the tough FBI wannabe in me, the one who admired and applauded Starling in &quot;Lambs&quot; kind of cringes. Seems this one was written with the silver screen in mind."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Great, the Phantom Menace of the printed word. A book with some great ideas, some beautiful prose, but one that fails to satisfy and has, to use a prosaic word, a dumb conclusion. Harris needs a good editor. Harris is a very, very good writer, but he should have resisted the pressure and written something else--not bowing to the moneymen who wanted a sequel to &quot;Silence.&quot; He must have known--why else did it take him 11 years to produce a sequel?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The third in Harris' Lecter trilogy, HANNIBAL is not up to the quality of the first two novels. More &quot;yucky&quot; detail than scary suspense, it was still compelling, if only to see what happened to its two main characters, Hannibal and Clarice. I bought it the day it was published, read it that day, and donated it to my local library; I'm keeping my hardcover copies of his first two books."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Whoa! Definitely worth the wait... I was gasping in astonishment and shouting &quot;Oh no!&quot; a dozen times. Outdoes both Red Dragon and SotL many times over. Sure, the plot is pretty far-fetched (like that of its predecessors), but Harris's writing skill makes it believable."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I, like everyone else, was first in line at the bookstore this week, anxiously waiting for my copy of the continuing saga of our favorite doctor. I read it in a day (as I am sure the rest of you did) and ended the book exhausted. Complex plot, various locations, old and new characters. I greatly enjoyed the work, but question the ending - it was a bit hard for me to swallow."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I too have read and thoroughly enjoyed Harris' three previous thrillers. As for Hannibal: I can't wait for the movie! If Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are cast again in the lead roles they should be a cinch for Oscars. Not only are there opportunities for scary stuff, but they'll also get to play some dark and delicious comedy. As some readers have commented, Harris may have pushed the envelope a bit beyond credible. But I've got to believe that his tongue was buried very deep in his cheek while writing some of the more incredible scenes. Foster and Sir Anthony will be challenged when playing the near-the-end dinner scene to avoid giggling and coming across as the Adams family. And that's not a putdown, I really enjoyed the book!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"My 8 year thirst for Hannibal has been quenched this week! I read this book in two days and enjoyed every second of it! Mr. Harris brilliantly created a story that only certain kinds of readers would like. I learned a side of Hannibal that allowed me to confidently root for him, and I also realized that there are &quot;monsters&quot; worse than he is. The suspense of his abduction, and coming to understand the reason *why* Hannibal is what he is, makes this book so worthy to read.The supporting characters and the conclusion were pleasant surprises, however, I am not sure how this book will translate on the screen, unless the viewer has read this book, and anticipates serious editing and some deviation from the book. In any event, if &quot;Hannibal&quot; does become a movie... I'm so there!!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was most disappointed with this book! It reads like someone besides Thomas Harris wrote the book. Clarice seemed more like a snippy whiner than the character Harris created in &quot;Silence&quot;. I think she had more scruples than Harris gave her in &quot;Hannibal&quot;. Would not recomend!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The ending was...incredible, and certainly worth the wait. It caught me completely off guard, and provided a nice conclusion to the whole saga, while leaving the door slightly cracked open for a continuation. Read this book! You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is one of the worst I have ever read. The ending was so implausible. Mr Harris has turned what was once a facinating charactor in to a supernatural demon who cannot be killed. what crap!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is not what I, and many others expected. To those who read and enjoyed Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, this will represent a dramatic departure. Gone are tales of a brilliant and efficient FBI; we are left here with a corrupt FBI that is in bed with evil private citizens. Also gone are all of the crisp descriptions of modern forensic criminology that Harris used to love to write.The book succeeds by inverting the basic structure of RD and SOTL: In both of those, Lecter helped an FBI agent find a serial killer. Here, with Lecter on the loose and Clarice Starling on the case, a second madman must be introduced to provide the third side of the triangle. The fact that the mad Mason Verger (a lecter victim himself) is essentially a &quot;prisoner&quot; due to his injuries, furthers the inversion of the prior two books.Overall, an interesting read and a brave departure for Harris. The ending is a huge disappointment and I doubt that it could ever be done in a filmed version, at least not a rated R or even an NC-17 version."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What an excellent book! Thomas Harris does a masterful job of letting us into the complex mind of Hannibal Lecter. It seems to me that the people who have slammed this novel do so because they want something more like SOTL.However, all the background info., and the vivid descriptions of Florence are all devices to let the readers get a taste of Hannibal's tastes.Harris provides this to give us an in-depth view of the way Lecter thinks. Yes, the ending is not at all what I expected, but...what an ending. I think it was a perfect way to put an end to Starling's nemesis. Excellent!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I still think the Red Dragon is the best of the of the series. I was surprise by the ending. I guess we can look for more from Dr. Lecter and Clarice. Perhaps Mapp or Barney will track them down."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The Silence of the Lambs is one of the greatest books that I have ever read. It's on my personal top 10 list. But Hannibal, now that is another story.The story was disjointed and confusing. How many times (or pages) do we need to read about Italian history and pathetic Pazzi's ancestry? Was it really necessary? This book was almost unbearable. But I persevered to the end, hoping that the story would come together at some point. It didn't. And the ending was an utter let-down.The characters were weak (even strong, confident Clarice is pathetic), two dimensional (i.e. Inpsector Pazzi) and unbelievable. Mason Verger was too much. And Mason's henchmen and the man-eating pigs were a laughable story line at best. The only character that I enjoyed was Dr. Lector himself, but I could just be grasping for straws here.If this was Thomas Harris' first book, he'd be an unemployed writer. He was definitely banking on his earlier success with Silence of the Lambs to carry Hannibal. It seems to have worked so far. But he sold out his readers, and instead wrote us a screenplay for Hannibal, the movie.If I had it to do over, I wouldn't read Hannibal. I'd just wait for the movie... it has to better than this."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I don't understand the bad reviews. This was the best Lecter book clearly. The ending was strange... but it was a great book anyway."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was in the zone, I was sweating, pumped, jazzed, scared, etc.... But then the ending came up and without spoiling it - the ending does an injustice to the character of Clarice Starling and troubles me still a week after putting the book down. There is a movie to be had here and a good one! But for God's sake someone must pen a new conclusion. Makes 2001's ending seem tame....."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"So,Mr Harris,what happens next?The most brilliantly disturbing book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After Red Dragon, which I considered exceptionally well written, and the best of the three, (Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal) about Hannibal Lecter, I was hugely disappointed. While I'm sure that Italy is a fascinating country, I really don't need to read 250 pages of detail I can get from Fodor's...And the ending is really disappointing. I can't believe Harris let's it end that way. What a bummer."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was VERY disappointed in this book. I agree with the person who wrote that Clarice was wimpy and so is Dr. Lecter. The ending is dumb - putting it mildly! I was hoping that Mr. Harris would not stoop to writing a movie sequel and passing it off for a book - my mistake. It is definitely not a book I care to re-read! What else can I say? Don't waste your time - and don't buy it - get it at the library for free if you must! I'm sorry about the gruffness of this review but I'm just so disappointed! Oh, well...."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I feel a bit odd saying I enjoyed a book with such brutality in it, but once again Thomas Harris has written a superior thriller. Adding to the &quot;enjoyment&quot; of the book were the images of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins reprising their roles as I read each dialogue.I was not happy with the ending, which is why I rated the book four stars. I would have preferred Lecter escaping, being killed or even the demise of Starling to the ending portrayed in the book.Otherwise, it was a fabulous read..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I just finished the book and I must say the conclusion was disturbing and unexpected. Harris started out great; the action and suspense was right on target. It was interesting seeing Hannible on the loose; although some of his abilities were at times a little too extraordinary to believe.While I can't discuss the ending too much I will say that, given the past of both characters from the &quot;Silence of The Lambs&quot;, it did not make since. Part of the problem may have been that Harris put all of his effort into fleshing out the Hannibal character and not enough into Clarice, this might explain the inexplicable ending.Perhaps Harris should have re-read the &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; to stay on track.If this book were ever made into a feature film the ending will have to be rewritten."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Unlike most Harris fans, I haven't been waiting 11 years for this book. I'm only fifteen,and I read &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; last year. Still, I was looking forward to this book. I loved it until the last two chapters... I can understand the ending, but I really wish there had been more description of what Clarice was thinking. She went insane, but It was so fast, and out of character, that I had to re-read the chapter again.Except for the ending, I thought it was good. Mason seemed more evil than Lecter, and it was interesting to see some of the landmarks from earlier books so twisted, like the institution. I'm not afraid of Lecter anymore though. I appreciated learning about his history, but now he's too human to fear.Still, I wish there was more explanation for the ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris forgot how to write! Silence of the Lambs was impossible to put down! Hannibal is impossible to get through. I could do without Harris' anti-christian politics at every turn!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I loved Silence of the Lambs (the novel much more than the movie). When I saw &quot;Hannibal&quot; staring at me from a bookstore shelf this weekend I grabbed it and headed for my porch swing late Sunday afternoon. While I didn't like the characters as much as I did in SOTL, I did find it a very good book until the last 40 pages or so.I kept thinking that Thomas Harris was really going to have to put a lot in very few pages to explain the Clarice/Hannibal pairing. When he left it that way I sat dumbfounded for several minutes and then started telling a friend the entire plot to see if he was as incredulous as I was over the ending. He was. I went to work today and told everyone I knew that they would want to know how the book ended before they started reading, just in case they felt it wasn't worth the let down at the end!Unless the ending is changed, I can't imagine anyone liking the movie either!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Three different novels: one third action film, one third flat, quasi-literary travelogue, and the final third pretentious allegory. The action film is thrilling, the Florence travelogue stuffy, and the allegory insufferable."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Here is another negative review...this is not a 3 star book! I can't understand how people can claim he wrote this solely with a future film in mind....there is no audience for this version of events. Maybe some day another writer can extrapolate beyond what happened in 'Silence of the Lambs' because as far as I'm concerned, HANNIBAL didn't happen! Morbidly entertaining at times, but when compared to the first two books, it really DOES appear that someone else wrote this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What a waste: the author of two horror classics yearning to &quot;transcend the genre.&quot; Is the ending a dream sequence or hypnotic/drug induced trance, or will the next installment find Clarisse and Hannibal digging up Jean-Paul Sartre's remains and gnawing on them? Who cares! As I finished this book, I was embarrassed for Thomas Harris, to think that this sloppy denouement was the best he could produce after so many years, particularly when the first half of the book is so well done. Harris wants to have it both ways: he wants the readers that Lecter's gory exploits bring, but he also wants to be taken seriously as an artiste. He has become the literary equivalent of Quentin Tarantino, by confusing self-indulgence with creativity."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This isn't really a sequal to Silence of the Lambs, except that it has some of the same characters (besides Hannibal and Starling), it's a stand-alone book. We get some insight into how Hannibal got that way, and are introduced to a character who's even worse than Hannibal. It's a page turner that invites you to imagine the worst possible things happening to the worst possible people. Then it exceeds your imaginings. I don't know whether this is a good book. I do know that it's hard to put down. If authors do indeed write what they know, then Mr. Harris is one odd man!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I feel extreme angst that Mr. Harris would waste this much of my time anticipating that this farce would become redeemable at story's end. What surprises me even more that readers seem to be polarized in their opinions of this book. Must be like buttermilk - you either love it or hate it!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A disjointed and poorly flowing work by Thomas Harris could have been saved by a decent ending and used as a setup for the next novel. Instead Harris chooses to show his contempt for fans and characters alike by contriving an ending so unsatisfactory and unlikely that it tarnishes the works that came before. If not skipped entirely this book is best returned to the library before reading the ending. Any ending a reader can make up will be better than the one read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Creatively gory. More cartoonish than previous books in the series, but entertainingly so. This book actually has two climaxes; one is a conventional, action-oriented bloodbath (the film will probably end here), the other is far more macabre and disturbing. I can understand why many readers disliked the end, but I thought it underscored just how unrepentently diabolical Lecter really is."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As I have read Harris' previous works, I was eagerly anticipating this sequel. Suffice it to say, I was not disappointed! Moreover, I had to read the last thirty (30) pages not once, not twice but three times because of the imagery the words provided! As Harris' previous works have, also, been translated into movies, and as we, the public, tend to, at times, blur the lines of 'art imitating life', one, I think it would be difficult for someone of Jodie Foster's caliber to portray the Clarice Starling of this book and, two, I think it would be even more difficult for a director to adequately capture the last few pages on film."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"stupid plot. stupid story. just plain stupid. not to mention gross. after reading sotl i wonder if maybe thomas harris had a stroke, brain fart,or thought hollywood would buy it outright and jody foster, anthony hopkins would buy it--make him a little richer. he played us for fools-no one will pay money to see the movie-especially after money to buy the book. i have thrown the book away incase one of my children should find it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"having red the red dragon, silence of the lambs &amp; hannibal, i find hannibal the most scaring of these novels. pure evil gets fascinating when it is practiced in style - and to me the horror goes much deeper than in the previous novels because it is made so clear, how fine the line is between good &amp; evil and how hard it is not to &quot;give in&quot; - deep inside most of us have a hannibal lecter and i really felt that mine was moved."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read Silence of the Lambs right before I read Hannibal and because of that I was expecting something remarkable. However, I was thouroughly let down. The book started off with the same tone as the first, but as the book progressed the tone went off track. Another thing that I hated was the enormous change in Clarice. Her mannerisms, attitude, and even her speech changed with no basis for a change whatsoever. Lastly, one thing that made the first so incredible was the limited gore. It was only added when absolutley necessary. In Hannibal, the gore was completely unnecessary and sometimes I couldn't even begin to understand why it was in there. I don't really recommend reading this book, especially if you're a big fan of the first."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I began this book with the knowledge that many readers, including professional reviewers, had panned this book. As such, my expectations were not high. I was afraid that this would be a cheap, screenplay sellout, ala The Lost World.This did not happen, as Harris skillfully and believeably (to me, at least) created a satisfying plot and took the characters in new directions. I plowed through the last half of the book in two sittings.I find it interesting that some other readers, who have read this and other Harris novels, criticized this book for being violent, revolting, etc. Of course it is. What do they expect after Dragon and Silence of the Lambs (which made me more uncomfortable than Hannibal)."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am so glad I forced myself to check this book out of the library rather than buy it. It was beyond awful. I wonder if I can get a refund on the 50 cent holding fee I paid to the library..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"First off, I'll admit this book has some over-the-top elements which will make it hard to film without being &quot;campy&quot; - although Jame Gumb in the &quot;Silence&quot; movie was no less so. I found myself gasping/laughing out loud (in disbelief) at some of the more horrific moments. Like many readers I was a little baffled at first by &quot;Hannibal,&quot; and a little stumped/miffed by the ending (re: Clarice's motivations). I read the book in one day's sitting, and when I finally finished I was very disturbed. After dwelling on it for a few days, I re-read the book to see if I had missed something. And I had. &quot;Hannibal&quot; is much more tightly plotted than it initally seems, and there are plenty of clues pointing towards the ending. Not the least of which is the Dr. Doemling character's &quot;explanation&quot; of Lecter. On first read it seems like a joke, but turns out to be exactly what Lecter is up to. And Lecter's childhood reminiscences are not at all meant to explain why he is a murderer, just why he &quot;relates&quot; to Clarice the way he finally does. I am trying not to give away the ending which has polarized everyone, suffice to say the author Thomas Harris has intentionally slapped the faces of everyone (particularly film fans) who have turned his killers (mainly Lecter) into pop culture jokes. Lecter may seem like the hero throughout this book, but Harris pulls the rug out on us with the last chapters and makes him more Evil than we thought we knew (not just a Killer, but a Corrupter of Innocence). Most of Lecter's victims have always seemed unsympathetic (&quot;free-range rude&quot;), but what he does at the end is unforgivable, and that's what many readers can't stand: their cute and cuddly Lecter is NOT the good guy. It's a HORROR novel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris developed a complex and psychologically powerful dynamic in the previous two novels. HANNIBAL not only fails to deliver on that promise, but proves to be a crude and distasteful parody of the serial killer genre itself. The book isn't even worth reading for curiosity's sake. Save your money."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Great book. Like I said, I read it straight through using every available moment to delve back into it's twisted brilliance. Hannibal Lecter is the Sherlock Holmes of evil. The ending I never expected has left me in shock. I'm still trying to come to terms with this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"How do you follow up &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;? First, you take your time. Next, you lay the ground rules, pretty much set by that book's most ardent fans. Finally, you need another villain, and for originality's sake, you don't want another serial killer. Thomas Harris achieves most of this in &quot;Hannibal&quot; but unfortunately he pushes it too far. He does present us with a real page turner that starts out at medium speed and builds momentum rapidly. Dr. Hannibal Lecter maintains his &quot;untouchable&quot; status throughout this tale, but some of the events that make that possible as well as information revealed about his past seem to leave us less intrigued by him and therefore not as afraid of him as we were previously. Even the tough Clarice Starling we came to admire fades into oblivion by the end, leaving very little interest for another sequel. Our new villain, Mason Verger is as scary and sick as &quot;Lambs'&quot; Lecter. When you realize yourself why you condider him to be a villain, you might be afraid of your own self. The stiff, Jack Crawford and the likable Barney, fomer employ of the psychiatric hospital are here as well. The sub climax, an appetizer, is very satisfying and a prelude to the main course which is truly delectable. Unfortunately and ironically though, this is where it goes sour fast. This is where Harris breaks the rules. The fate of Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling suggested at the very end is more unimaginable than any other possible scenario. No dessert, thank you. Dr. Lecter himself would be insulted."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Dear Amazon Readers:Despite all the other reviews, which are downing this novel. I personally loved it. I think that much of the time peoeple are expecting there characters to be frozen in time and not grow in any manner. Clarice has grown! Lecter has grown! If there is only one book that you buy this year, it should be this one!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is a book with some meat in it, not just a quick summer thriller. I had been counting the days until the release, not to mention the years of hoping for some more of Hannibal. I must tell you that this is the first book that I finished reading and immediately turned to page one to read it again. I also had reread Red Dragon and Silence while waiting for June 8th. I love it!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was so turned off by the graphic violence. I have read all of Mr. Harris's previous books and eagerly anticipated this one. I only continued reading it due to some misguided sense of duty or obsessive trait to finish what I start. There was so much he could have done with Starling and Lector's charcters. What did happen was unbelievable and out of charcter for them. Any real psychopath will tell you, it would not have ended this way. Hannibal- Every thing you always wanted to know about torture in 3 easy lessons!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have a mixed reaction to the book. I admit I was &quot;riveted&quot; and read it almost straight through. I think some of the scenes are Harris at his best--most of the stuff in Italy, especially the climactic murder scene. But he really diminishes Lecter as a character of unknowable evil by providing a backstory explaining his &quot;idiosyncracy&quot; and by generally making him almost an avenging angel. All his major victims in this one have committed fairly major sins--the main victim in Italy was a 3-dimensional character, but his punishment was what God would exact, as imagined in medieval literature. And Mason Verger is a cartoon villian that we are supposed to feel is far more evil than Lecter. Lecter isn't really a sadist; he manipulates people into participating willingly in their own destruction. And he has far more integrity than any other major character (including Clarice, at the end). I guess it is understandable that Harris would come to embrace a character who has been such a golden goose for him."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Clearly, Thomas Harris understood that having created Hanibal Lecter in &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and set him free at the end of &quot;The Silence of the Lambs,&quot; something more than a simple thriller was in order for the next go-round. &quot;Hannibal&quot; assumes the stance of a linear narrative, but folds in upon itself and back again to create a heightened reality that has the deep red glow of a bloody fever dream.After a bright start, Clarice Starling's career is going south due to a drug raid gone terribly wrong. Lecter, with a new face is posing as a Renaissance scholar in Florence, enjoying his freedom and reveling in fascination and delight everyday people derive from an exhibit of horrific torture devices.Meanwhile, an early victim of Lecter's is plotting a revenge that involves feeding him to a bunch of specially bred flesh-eating swine.And a cop in Florence has recognized Hannibal Lecter. Oh, what to do?I won't say. But I will say this. Thomas Harris has taken the Hitchcokcian notion of shared guilt to a whole new level -- waaaay over the top, forcing the reader to make (or to avoid) moral choices that could put us in bed with evil.Yet he clearly implies that there is worse evil out there than mere mayhem. Harris forces us to face the corruption of the human spirit -- nay he rubs our faces in it. And I, for one, was glad of the facial. By the time we get to the languid, hallucinatory ending with the human version of a monkey brain feast and to the sure-to-be-debated coda we are out of breath and amazed.Many will protest the violence as overly graphic and unnecesary. They will have missed the point entirely. To quote another cannibal who sang (in the words of Stephen Sondheim):&quot;Oh what's the sound of the world out there?/ Those crunching noises pervading the air?/ It's man devouring man, my dear/ And who are we to deny it in here?&quot;The truths of &quot;Hannibal&quot; are also undeniable. There are other ways of devouring a person than eating him. Or her."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"People will be disturbed by the end of this book.But, maybe we are meant to think about the nature of evil. There are plenty of bad guys in this book, and many have understandable motivations. We don't see Lecter attack anyone innocent.And what does it take to catch him?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A dark, powerful elegy to the loss of innocence, this is a book that appears to have confounded the expectations of those readers that were expecting a clear cut,good vs evil, cat'n'mouse game. Harris delivers, in lets face it mouthwatering prose, a bleak gothic (flawed) masterpiece that I, for one, found unbearably moving. People are complaining that this book 'sells out' Lecter, that it reveals too much of his past, his motivations, the foundations of his, ahem, 'memory palace'. So why were people buying the book, if not for more Lecter? Of course everyone wanted more - a book about Jack Crawford wouldn't be creating such a stir now, would it? But how much more disappointing would it have been if it had been yet another novel about a serial killer, with Lecter dispensing titbits of clues. Sod that. What were people expecting at the end, what scene were they envisaging between these two characters so obviously drawn together? Starling killing Lecter? Vice versa? How much more disappointing would that have been? I found the denouement far more sinister than a gun chase in a basement or a burning house.People's problem with this book is just that it's too different from the norm. It's quite unclassifiable. Obviously there are flaws - the pigs, Clarice's visit to Lecter's cell, but there are also moments of brilliance - the scenes in Florence, in Lecter's homes. In all, it's more in the spirit of Hugo, Bram Stoker or Patrick Suskind's 'Perfume' - bleak, unsettling, baroque and a major sea change. The images of Starling offering Lecter her breast, the butter on her lips, the smashing tea cup, her father's skull are still preying on my mind....Far more so than anything in the previous two novels, which though more tightly plotted, don't carry the same weight."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Like everyone else I awaited this book (7 years!)with such exitement that anti-climax was inevitable. I enjoyed reading it, but felt it was a rather odd departure: surely the most horrifying thing about Lecter was not that he was without a conscience but that he lacked any pathology. As he says in Lambs &quot;You cant reduce me to a set of influences&quot;. This is the key to Hannibals mystique: he has somehow chosen to be inhuman. Imagine my surprise therefore, to find this Miltonic Satan weeping over his poor eaten sister Mischa in the same way as the pathetic creatures of the first 2 books in his story. Such is Harris' talent, and such is the enduring appeal of his antihero, that I didnt much mind, like everyone else my main attraction to the books has been the awe and terror invoked by a mind so cold and brilliant, an understanding so sublime and a cruelty so profound. Now look: poor poor Mischa indeed, but worst of all, poor Hannibal. The Doctor would doubtless devise some wicked and precise punishment for my terrible crime. For if Hannibal tries only to eat the &quot;free-range rude&quot;, what on earth will he do to the sympathetic?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Mr.Harris has done the impossible. Dr.Lecter has joined Michael Corleone as one the Good Guys who happens to be on the wrong side of the law.This book is intense.You are hook the minute you start reading the first paragraph.You will refuse to put it down. I kept wishing that Mr Harris would have been kind and added at least another five hundred pages. This book was well worth the wait. I just wish I had someone to talk to about this absorbing experience I had while reading this book. Visiting Dr. Lecter is a surreal experience that truly changes ones life. Seeing the world from Hannibal Lecter's view is absolutely awesome. Thanks Mr. Harris for giving me a book that I will enjoy reading over and over again."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This has to be the most amazing piece of horror fiction I have read in quite a while. Not only is the ending amazing, but it is in fact believable given the context of the characters. I believe the people who give this masterpiece one star are those who were looking for &quot;Silence of the Lambs 2.&quot; Think about it: more quid pro-quo with Clarice, maybe another killer, yada yada yada. What we get instead, however, is a completely original novel that Stephen King HIMSELF ranks as one of the top two horror novels of our time next to William Peter Blatty's The Exorcist. FORGET the one star reviews. Some people just DONT understand this novel for what it is and hate it. Listen to those who know. I even took a college course last year on Horror. Its been at least three years since anything frightened me, either literary or cinematic. Now I can't sleep. This is a book for the ages. Thomas Harris is a genius. Thank God I am not the only one intelligent enough to realize this."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have called book stores for 11 years anxiously awaiting &quot;Hannibal.&quot; What a disappointment!! After having read both RED DRAGON and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and viewed both movies, it is pretty clear where the third book in this series should have went; (1) a prequel to RED DRAGON that tells the story of how Will Graham captures Hannibal Lector, or (2) SILENCE'S Clarice Starling is assigned to find Lector and needs Will Graham's help to do it, so they become unwilling partners. So what happened to HANNIBAL? The book's plot starts off well with Clarice's job, Italy is good for a hiding place, the revenge plot good, but then falls off a cliff...what happened to this story? HANNIBAL, which could have had a good ending and saved it from being laughable, ends on the most ridiculous note. But death was the theme of this book in more ways than one. Many who give this book 4-5 stars like it because of the gore and violence. But what is truly a tragedy is the characters, all of whom are ruined and will never appear as their former selves again. This is not literary growth, but a &quot;silencing of the characters&quot; by slaughtering them (not literally) in HANNIBAL. Clarice, a strong-minded, intelligent, young woman in SOL has been turned into mush, making childish decisions and her character reduced to that of a pet for Lector. Jack Crawford's death is disrespectful to the man he is and is a joke. Lector as the protagonist is an interesting twist - but the book's most intelligent man who sees plots against him from a distance, is caught buying a bottle of wine? Please. The characters are certainly not the ones we saw in previous novels. And the ending is so unbelievable, it deserves an award for best fanatasy. I guess in the fourth novel we will find Clarice, comforted by Will Graham and Jack Crawford, having awakened from a &quot;dream&quot; like the third season of Dallas and everything will be fine. My question to Thomas Harris is-- what will you be writing now that you have destroyed all of your characters?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Overall, I really liked this book, I flew through it. It is well paced and well executed; however, I have mixed feelings about the ending..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What are all these complaints I've been reading that &quot;Hannibal&quot; is not &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; or &quot;Red Dragon?&quot; Of course it isn't! Thomas Harris already wrote those books - why does he need to write them again - especially since every so-called thriller writer in the world has been trying to do that for him. It amazed me that so many people did not like this book - all of us either love it, or hate it with very few votes in the middle. Some people finished this book in one sitting - but I waited, and finished it in two nights. I knew it would be awhile before I found anything this much fun again. (By the way - if I don't like a book I don't finish it - so it strikes me as odd that many of the people who didn't like it were disgusted with the ending.) Nothing I can write can do this book justice. In the end I can only thank Thomas Harris for giving it to us."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I enjoyed understanding some of the motives behind Lecter's behavior. I wasn't all that fond of the gory descriptions of cannabalism but hey, that's Harris. I unlike alot of people enjoyed the ending. Come on, it was going to happen somehow, why not with a little brainwashing. Hannibal is a very unconventional fairy tale with the monster as the unconventional &quot;hero&quot;. It was worth the wait hopefully it isn't the last book with our favorite doctor. Just hope we don't have to wait as long and hopefully there will be a movie. I have to say as a work of psychological horror it ranks up there with Dostoevsky. Harris marvelous job!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was blown away by it. I finished the book in two sittings. Lecter teaches this world a valuable lesson. You must read and absorb to understand. I felt content to put down the book in the end, as if I had just dined with the doctor. I feel I am a better person having read the novel. Now I can sleep, and maybe even hear the lambs screaming..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Like everyone else who has left a review of Hannibal on this site, I was eagerly awaiting the publication of a new Harris novel. I believe that Red Dragon is the epitome of Mr. Harris' novels (to date), with the Lambs not far behind. Hannibal, on the other hand, cannot so easily be defined in terms of &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad,&quot; so I'll settle on &quot;in between, depending upon the readers' interpretation&quot; of what is surely a dream-like, dopey reading experience. People complain about the ending, claiming that Starling could not have acted the way she does, et cetera... In fact, she would not, and I am convinced that Mr. Harris would not have made such a blatant mistake in character portrayal. He's usually been true to his characters' actions, and I believe this instance is no exception. The explanation for her startling actions, if I am not mistaken, lies on page 369, as Dr. Lecter rakes dozens of vials into his pockets [from the hospital pharmacy.] People: this is foreshadowing. All the medications stated--and Harris goes to great lengths to enumerate them--are barbiturates and hypnotics administered before hypnosis. The Bantam Medical Dictionary states that such drugs are highly addictive (perhaps explaining Starling's &quot;platinum&quot; hair at the end.) If, indeed, Dr. Lecter has got Starling addicted to whatever barbiturate cocktail serves his intentions (and he knows the stuff), then the FBI agent's demeanor could possibly be understandable. As for those who didn't like the book because of the sundry horrors it harbors, well, what can I say? This is a book of fiction. If you can't accept such material inside a book, then I think you ought to board a spaceship and leave humanity behind, because, in reality, human beings are capable of committing things as inhuman and as disgusting as those perpetratef by Hannibal (need I cite a few names? Think Serbia, Cambodia...)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As a huge &quot;Silence&quot; fan (movie and book), I have been waiting a long time for this novel. The majority of it has excellent descriptions, an interesting plot, and more juicy information about Lecter and Starling's respective backgrounds. These are the only good points in &quot;Hannibal.&quot;Although lesser characters from &quot;Silence&quot; appear, they are even more two-dimensional than before, and Harris relies on repeating information (that most fans know by heart from the previous story) as a substitute for actual character development.The villian is more evil than any we've seen recently, but Hannibal is more sympathetic, and Clarice is more boring. In addition, Harris fails to develop any sympathy for new characters, and we hardly care about anything that happens to them.The most disappointing thing about this novel, though, is that the ending is completely implausible, completely out of character for everyone involved, and completely unsatisfying. Throughout my reading of this book, I kept asking myself, &quot;How is he ever going to end this?&quot; Apparently, (I'm only guessing from the quality of the writing), he ran up against some sort of deadline and wrote the last 150 pages in three days. Drunk.I cannot overemphasize how disappointing the ending is. It's as if he kills off everyone you care about with a fourth of the book left. I have never felt a stronger urge to throw a book after reading it than I did with &quot;Hannibal.&quot; Don't waste your money, and your time would be better spent writing your own sequel. I guarantee you'd do a better job."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Leave your emotional baggage at the door before you read &quot;Hannibal&quot;. The reader, who chooses to bring along the hundred pound backpack filled with plot and prose from TH's previous two books, (they need not be mentioned here) will have no better chance of seeing the novel for what it is, than a camel has of passing through an eye of a needle. The book succeeds on the same level of those books, but then exceeds them by further exploring this idea. If Lecter is evil, if serial killers are evil, then we all stand accused. Especially &quot;God&quot;. We all kill and torture in our own ways. TH's talent is to make his characters a focal point for this idea. THE ONE STAR REVIEWS need to read this one again."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I looked forward to this book for the past eight years, ever since I first read the novel and saw the film version of The Silence of the Lambs. I am very disappointed in the direction Mr. Harris decided to take his two main characters. It just doesn't seem to fit them. Of course, I didn't create the characters, so what do I know? I thought the book was engrossing and very entertaining until the last 20 pages or so. This was *not* what I had in mind.... Too bad."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"There's an old saying that if you throw something in a dark alley and hear a scream, you sure as hell have hit something big. Perhaps monstrous.That's what Thomas Harris has done with &quot;Hannibal&quot;; for the most part, there are plenty of negative reviews on this board about the novel, but few tell us how or why &quot;Hannibal&quot; succeeded or failed as a novel.With its characters, the novel does succeed, but in a way most people, I'm sure, find bizarre: Starling, the agent of good, becomes Lecter's Mischa-replacement, now an agent of evil. For a novel to be a novel, characters must change, and Starling has certainly changed in this one. And yes, I did find the plot plausible, but if you'll bear with me a few moments, I'll tell you how it could have been made stronger.Probably the most confusing thing for readers who hated the book was the discovery of Lecter's sister, Mischa, who fell victim to a group of German soldiers on the &quot;lamb&quot; during World War II. In some ways, it does take away the mystery from Lecter; from being a Luciferian monster (maroon eyes, six fingers on the left -- in Latin, &quot;sinister&quot; -- hand, sharp wit, the need for civility and politeness) with a large stain of Original Sin, Lecter almost becomes human. We empathize with him at the loss of his sister; more than likely, he would have become a sociopath anyway -- in &quot;Red Dragon,&quot; Will notes that Lecter was known to torture small animals when he was a child -- but the point is, we do have motive here, and a pattern that establishes Lecter's cannibalism.Were I the editor of this book, I would have gone more into Lecter's past, perhaps describing how he was repatriated from war-torn Lithuania to Italy, where he was raised with his Medici-descended Italian relatives. There, he gets a good education, and begins practicing his &quot;skills&quot; as a future serial killer.I would also have Lecter, as Dr. Fell, discover that one of the German soldiers -- perhaps a death-bed convert to Christianity -- has confessed his sins to a reporter; the news hits the wires -- a small blurb perhaps -- or perhaps a major news story; the leader of the deserting Germans, a colonel at the time, is now a leading financier and philanthropist living in Stuttgart or wherever. Lecter begins offing people in order to get his revenge; one of them is Pazzi, but instead of having him be evil, I would have him be a good cop; this in turn would make the scene where he's hanged that much more ironic and that much more tragic in the Greek sense of tragedy (that is, no matter what you do, the gods damn you).From there, the plot could invoke Will and Clarice and have them working together as they hunt down Lecter. In the meanwhile, the prick Krendler is doing what he can to wreck Clarice's career, and does so by joining forces with the wicked German. We really don't need Mason in this one.Take it from there. There are several thousand variations; but logically, I believe, it would have made more sense to have Mischa's torturers suffer and to have Pazzi play the good guy in order to bring in a twist of irony. I do recommend this book. Perhaps it's not as &quot;good&quot; as &quot;Red Dragon&quot; or &quot;Lambs,&quot; but it is the last (?) book in this trilogy (?), and completes a cycle of sorts."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It might be unusual a person of my age reading a book of this nature. I, being only fifteen already own book and movie of Silence of the Lambs and love them. So as June the 8th approached I set aside my money and rushed to my local book store to buy it. I loved the whole idea about Mason Verger wanting revenge and the way he went about it. Which I felt was an understandable lust for revenge, however the way he wanted it done with the swine and suchlike was a wee bit over the top. But again understandable to a point. The whole part in Italy was excellent with you genuinely feeling the desperation of Verger through Pazzi. And in a funny sort of way I was routing for Dr. Lecter all the way through the book. And I urged him to be saved from the swine. So all in all, an excellent book......So Far. For 450 pages it was one of my favourite novels and was enjoying every thrill, scare and bit of tension. But what was Mr Harris thinking. The whole idea of Clarice and Dr.Lecter getting together was dispicable as well as totally unrealistic. It felt almost as if Thomas Harris wanted to finish it all too quickly without giving us a satisfactory ending. I was disgusted at the fact that Lecter put his urges of Cannibalism aside just for the sake of Clarice Starling. It is only for the last three chapters that I give it 4/5. Had the ending been a surprise with an excellent twist I would have loved the book and married Thomas Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Simple: if Clarice Starling was anything more than a plot devicce, or had any character at all, she wouldn't be so easy to turn into a monster. Compare, even with all her flaws, her strength and character in Silence with the cipher Harris turns her into here. Worse than a waste of time."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;Where have you gone, Will Graham? A nation turns its lonely eyes to you...&quot;I can't believe I spent $29 for this novel! After enthusiastically awaiting the return of dramatis personae Lecter, et al, &quot;Hannibal&quot; was a tremendous letdown. Mr. Harris has squandered the occasion to continue the masterful &quot;Silence.&quot;&quot;Silence&quot; had intelligence- the dialogues between Lecter and Starling contained a mix of innuendo, fact and tension, especially the chapter in which cellmate Sammy is introduced. The latest effort is not up to Mr. Harris' considerable skills. That Starling could go from reviling Lecter (&quot;they don't have a name for what he is&quot;) to naughty little Hannibal nibbling on her is beyond reason.Fortunately, the novel is not totally devoid of interest. The background and ambition of Pazzi (and his subsequent demise) are detailed and lend themselves to the story, and Lecter's defense of his position (the analysis of The Divine Comedy) was obviously researched.I should have heeded the reviews (most are like weather forecasters) and waited to hit up the sale bin when it bottoms out."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Continues the excitement of Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs with new horrors and thrills! As we've learned from previous works, Hannibal isn't two demensional--he is horrible, has no guilt or remorse, he's sadistic, but he's also sensitive, highly intelligent, and has a soft spot for Clarise--he also tends to punish the pure sociopaths and egocentrics! I enjoyed it from cover to cover--hated to put it down and hated for it to end!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I bought this with great anticipation, and was disappointed at times. It is certainly a very good read. The ghoulish gore is sometimes overdone. It seems like it is done in the vein of &quot;Well, how can I shock them after 'Silence'?&quot;. My least favorite thing Harris does in this book is to insert the narrator function randomly, e.g. &quot;Let us look into Hannibal's mind now&quot; sort of thing.However,.... however... it is still well-written, still moves along nicely, creating the appropriate amount of stomach-butterflies. The middle is better than the beginning and, a great finale. Not everyone will like the ending, but I certainly did."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris can't write a bad book, but this one strains my loyalty. &quot;Lambs&quot; was horrifying and credible and all of the characters worked. In this sequel, he humanizes Hannibal, writes of sadism without purpose, and fashions a totally unbelievable and hokey finale. What a waste!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was totally into this book at first. My dad gave it to me after he had read it and said, &quot;You'll love it, it's great.&quot; After finishing it and replaying it's events in my mind, I found many actions and situations presented to be unbelievable. Furthermore the characters you know become less like the characters you know as you draw toward the end. Still, as I stated, I liked most of it. I would put this in book in the &quot;fun to read&quot; catagory. I wouldn't take it as seriously as The Silence of the Lambs."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"An seething story of good vs. evil, guilt and innocence, and trust and betrayal. Hannibal has the numbing tension and stunning power of a war novel like The Triumph and the Glory or The Thin Red Line, psychological twists worthy of Edgar Allen Poe, and the stark horror that only a novelist of Harris' talent can deliver. Not for everyone, obviously, but it is onwe of those books that I just had to read to see for myself what all the fuss was about."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I decided to read this book because I loved Silence of the Lambs. Each section of the book kept my interest and I found myself reading late into the night. There were some great scenes admirable for Dr. Hannibal Lector's character... which made me squirm now and then.However, the ending sucks. I wanted more but I found myself disappointed with the conclusion. That is why I only give this book four stars."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Alright, so Hannibal is not the best of Thomas Harris. But lets face it, the least of Thomas Harris is better than the best of a whole bunch of others. Cases in point - Tom Clancy and John Grisham whose most recent efforts have produced the next thing to projectile vomiting. Toss in that utter drivel entitled &quot;I Know This Much is True&quot; that the dilettantes love so well, and the not-the-best of Harris comes across like a nightingale in flock of crows. As to those who denounce the denouement - get a life. The seeds of mutual respect between Clarice and Hannibal were sown in Silence of the Lambs. She has been pilloried by the organization she served so faithfully, and can anyone deny that many women fall in love with their physicians? More power to you, ex-Agent Starling. May you live happily ever after!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris didn't really want to write this book, and its painfully obvious after reading it. He actually wanted to write a sceenplay for the upcoming movie and that's just what he should have done instead of foisting this garbage off on his up-to-this-book fans. There must have been terrific pressure on him to produce a sequel. I'm sure large sums were offered and Harris probably buckled in and threw some words together in a short time. That's the real reason why he didn't allow any editing of the book. I wondered about that when the book came out, now its obvious why. I won't see the movie when it comes out and I'll encourage everyone in my circle to do the same. Harris should learn that you can't treat fans in such a shoddy manner and get away with it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book had alot of places to go. Some of those heights were soaring, the descriptions of Florence, the art and architecture, the cultural greatness of post Renaissance thinking. But, then, within that intellectual framework, to bring such unparalleled grossness that any pretension to culture, humanity or art is lost serves to cheapen the entire effort. Thus, we have Hannibal Lector in Florence. A genius, a very sensitive man with expanded nostrils for drinking in life's many fragrances who has opted for cannibalism, random murder and vivisection of victims to offset his more heavenly qualities. What to compliment him? Why, our little Starling or course. The unwanted bird floundering her way through the shark tank of federal bureaucrats almost ready to come to ground from exhaustion. Too many of them and not enough of her. I liked the book for the obvious research into personal behaviour and proclivities, but, why do we have to seek to bring the damned and sublime to the same, physically disgusting level of human death and cadaverous consumption? Harris throws out a large sweeping rope of psychosis which, in the end, does not overly satisfy the enquiring reader. Harris probably made alot of money for this effort, but his work bears the markings of a literary hack wandering into the realm of poetic license, plucking a few of the more perverse plums, and escaping with the reader wondering what bizarrness was this? Meanwhile, the author himself chuckles lightly at the teller window, verifying his latest advance. No wonder Jodie Foster has some problems with this ending. Anyone with half a brain ... would feel the same. Overall, a good effort, but unsatisfying in its final plot twist."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was a huge fan of Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs and waited 11 years for this sequel. I can't remember the last time I was so disappoited by a book. The story is for the most part boring and the characters dull. The plotlines (all of them) are unbelievable and just plain gross or dumb. The worst part is that Mr. Harris in unfair to both Lector and Starling. In the pervious novels I was compelled and spellbound by both characters, here they are almost lifeless. I am sure that the ending was supposed to shock me in some way..I just thought it was stupid and a waste of time. I was looking for thought provoking conversation and got mumbo jumble instead. In a word: DULL"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I found this book totally confusing. I kept reading on, waiting for the good parts that never came. The whole section in Italy was hard to follow. I can see why Jodie Foster would want no part of this. The ending made no sense at all. It has none of the suspense the first book had. I just thought this book was horrible. I was mad I wasted my time reading it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading Silence Of The Lambs, I bought this book. I read, didn't understanding one word of it. Than, I got &quot;curious&quot;. I turned to the back of the book and read the final chapter. Than I thought: What the hell is this? I immediatley stopped reading the book. Those of u who enjoyed Red Dragon and Silence are in for a very dissappointing novel. I won't mention the ending to those of u who are willing to read the book and get VERY dissappointed. This book is nothing but a big piece of trash."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris demonstrated a completely unique take on the &quot;serial killer&quot; genre, with his totally astonishing ending..Many readers and viewers of the film &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; expect the typical tale whereby the old fomulaic plot concludes with either the villian getting eradicated or at least, the hero or heroine obtaining justice.In this episode of Hannibal's story, we learn much about both his and Clarise's psyches.. There are very embedded reasons for their behaviors and compulsions and upon examination and atypical therapies, they are both liberated, though not in a way that is ordinarilly endorsed. A culmination of good/evil and perfect/horrible result in a tenable meeting of the minds. I would bet Hannibal never kills again.I rated the book highly due to its imagination and genuis of story == rather than being another tired variation on the old, hackneyed, predictable horror story. Harris's work here, does, however, rival Poe in its intricacy. And actually, in its bizarre way, the book leaves the reader with a sense of hope.Remember, after all is said and done, the story features other villians who rival Hannibal in their egregious acts or intentions; and they have absolutely no brilliance, fondness of others, &quot;taste&quot; (as Clarise calls Hannibal's proclivities) or any of the moral, in spite of himself, qualities that Lechter possesses."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"TO SAY THIS EAGERLY AWAITED SEQUEL IS DISAPPOINTING IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. I FOUND NUMEROUS INCONSISTENCIES WITH THE PLOT (E.G. DATES, SIMULTANEOUS CURRENT EVENTS, LEVEL OF TRAINING FOR STARLING, ETC.) WHICH MADE THE BOOK APPEAR SLOPPY. EVEN MORE OF A PROBLEM IS THE COMPLETELY UNCONVINCING CHANGE IN THE CHARACTERS' PERSONALITIES TO THE POINT WHERE THEY ARE HARDLY RECOGNIZABLE, E.G. STARLING, HANNIBAL, BARNEY. THE LONG DESCRIPTIONS OF FLORENCE ARE PEDANTIC AND BORING. THE ENDING IS SIMPLY RIDICULOUS; IT'S A CHEAP SHORT CUT."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Having waited seven years for the continuation of the Starling/Lecter saga, I can say it was well worth the wait. The story is tense and filled with its own brand of dark humor.Hannibal Lecter has found a new home and identity in Italy only to be drawn out by his only surviving victim, Mason Verger. Verger has found the only bait at which Hannibal &quot;The Cannibal&quot; will bite - Clarice Starling.The story satisfies as it takes you further into the minds of Lecter and Starling, uncovering many shocking surprises along the way. I never thought it possible that one could end up pulling for Lecter as he is drawn further into the trap. However, the character of Mason Verger actually accomplishes this feat. If you thought Lecter was the definition of depravity, you &quot;ain't seen nothin' yet&quot;!Some may feel that the story slows in the middle. It's best to give it time because every fact uncovered leads to the climax. And what a climax it is. I will never again think of a formal dinner in the same way. Yes, revenge is truly a dish best served cold - or in Hannibal's case, warmed in a saute pan with browned butter, sherry and caper berries."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Okay, this book wasn't like the other ones .. not so much detecting and action and thriller moments ... but it was a much more in-depth probe into the minds of the three key players ... Hannibal Lecter, Clarisse Starling, and Hannibal's first victim who survived and seeks revenge. This one gave me nightmares .. the others didn't. Lends a new credibility for 'there but for the grace of God, go I ...'"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book started out great and held its momentum all the way through. I thought the Florence scene that everyone seems to detest was, actually, quite good. I liked seeing how someone tried and failed to catch Lecter. It made you appreciate the previous two books more. As for the ending, I took it as a denounment to the entire Lecter trilogy. If it was ment to be that, Harris did an extraordinary job."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While I may not have enjoyed Hannibal as much as I have enjoyed other Harris novels, I found it to be an entertaining tale that was very well written. Unlike other amateur reviewers here at Amazon, I found the ending incredibly fresh and unpredictable. I applaud Harris' efforts for a surprise ending I never saw coming."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I enjoyed the book for the first 400 pages or so. Once the ending started, it got very strange and disappointing. It just didn't work or mesh with the rest of the book. I couldn't buy it at all. Although, in hind-sight, the book is pretty absurd in a lot of points."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Lousy read. Stupid ending. I loved Silence--it had a point, a heroine and a crime to solve, with science used to solve it. Almost everyone in this book was evil, willing to kill people without a thought. When there's that much evil, it grows boring because we, the readers, have no one to root for. There's no suspense unless the character we relate to is in danger. I wanted the pigs to eat Lecter. At least that may have made for interesting reading. I don't buy the &quot;explanation&quot; for Lecter's cannibalism being rooted in losing his little sister to cannibals. Men like Lecter are sociopaths, and if he felt any empathy for a sister, he wouldn't be Lecter! Clarice, the only real &quot;hero,&quot; was passive and boring and hardly there. And the ending--what a joke! What, is this supposed to be &quot;romantic&quot;? Right... No wonder neither actor has signed for the movie. I sure don't want to see this. Beyond these glaring problems, I was shocked by the confusing voice and bad grammar, the leaps between present and past tense--in the same paragraph! And the second-person &quot;authorial voice&quot; which intruded with silly lines like, &quot;Now we must leave them at their dinner....&quot; and sounded like an attempt at screenplay direction: &quot;Picture a quiet street in Florence...&quot; I hope Harris didn't spend 3000 days writing this, and I don't believe it (not with the &quot;impeachment proceedings against the President&quot; he refers to.) What a pretentious piece of trash."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have read Harris's RD and SOTL. I expected a good solid story. While Mason is something of a chilling character, and the story is somewhat interesting with the detour to Italy, it collapses from a poor, extremely muddled ending.First and foremost, it simply does not follow from what we know about the characters. Obsessive people do not change so easily, and the cheap psychology in the novel hardly justifies the character change at the end. The ending is not bad because it doesn't end &quot;happily&quot; or with clearcut morals, but because it simply does not follow from what we know.We learn reasons for some characters' horrific behaviors. But when one takes on similar behaviors for no compelling reason, we have writing that smacks of rush and cheap shock value.Somewhat contradictory to the above criticism, new characters are introduced, with their future easily and correctly guessed, much as we know the fate of a red shirt landing party member on Star Trek. :)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am glad I did not buy the book. I so looked forward to reading this book since I had read Harris' other novels and loved the movie. What a disappointment! I wish Mr. Harris spent more time on the psychological background of Hannibal and less time in describing Florence. I was rather surprised that I found Hannibal to be a sympathetic character and was rooting for him (no pun intended) in the end. Clarice was not the Clarice I remembered. I doubt the real Clarice would do what she did in the end. I did not mind the gruesomeness at all since it was to be expected."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"My first reaction to this book was, &quot;it's just not grabbing me.&quot; In fact, I considered the possibility of not even finishing it...what a mistake that would have been! By the time I finished reading Hannibal, I was sold... including the ending.I can see that there are many disappointed (mad!) readers out there, but I think that's because of the inevitable comparison to the film version of SOTL. If you're looking for a film sequel, you'll probably fall into the &quot;hated it&quot; camp. If you're looking for facsinating character portrayals and a plot that has the guts to go against the popular grain, then read this book. I plan to go back for &quot;second helpings&quot;!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Fascinating.The reviews of this book seem to be very binary. Either the reader found it excellent, or the reader disliked it passionately.I wonder how many criticize it from a standpoint of technical quality, and how many angrily condemn it for its betrayal of your expectations? This book is cruel and unpleasant, without regard for the reader's feelings. There is little of the earlier novels in this volume, rather it is an exploration of the essential ugliness of society and the human spirit. You may not like this sort of thing. I do.It's not a perfect novel, but it is well written with but a few flaws, and I admire Harris's audacity in turning everything on its head without regard for any feelings we may have had for his characters.Certainly, I'm not a literary authority, and there is always room for a wide spectrum of opinion - I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who genuinely thought the book was stupid or boring, and I respect that opinion. But I wonder; How many of you hated it because you went out, bought it, brought into your home with a warm place prepared for it, were kind to it, and it bit your hand off regardless?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The principal attraction of Lambs was the contrast between the thrill of relevation and the threat of violence. I kept reading in hope to discover the underlying tension from this dichtomy but alas there was no real relevation and only violence itself not the threat of it which is by far more interesting. A disppointment."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book was great...wonderful and intricate plot, terrific imagery, great characters...but the ending, while intriguing and vaguely satisfying, left a bad taste in my mouth. However, I'm eagerly anticipating the film &quot;Hannibal,&quot; now that I've read the book. It should be terrific."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have never anticipated a sequel with so much excitement. Consequently, it was with utter disappointment that I finished Hannibal. The book had so much potential. It started off with a great action sequence, developed Dr. Lecter's terrifying world well, and added a new monster-like character into the mix. It displayed Harris' phenomenal ability to narrate excruciating details of horrific events with a cold, almost casual detachment. However, I sense that Harris then either lost his way or simply chose to indulge himself. The climax of the story lost all of its momentum and was extremely sophomoric. And the absurd ending made a mockery of all of Harris' prior great work by causing Lecter and Starling to act totally out of character. As a Harris fan, I feel very let down. If Mr. Harris ever happens to read this, I urge him to rewrite the last half of the book and allow it to achieve its true potential."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I can not recommend this book. Without being too specific and so as not to ruin the book for anyone who didn't read the book but intends to, I'll just say the ending made no sense to me. When you develop a character to have a sense of him/her self and then just go 180 degrees with them. That is not a surprise ending. It is an absurd and an impossible ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Well, You have got to be kidding regarding the ending of this book. Just terrible and not believeable at all. I will bet that when this book is turned into a movie the ending will be completely different. Did Harris just run out of steam?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Tom Harris is inspired as the plot creator for Hannibal Lechter's latest adventures. However, the author lacks any writing skills and the publisher allowed this sophmoric piece of writing to be unleashed on the unsuspecting public. The writing was not horrific enough to detract from the beauty of the plot development and Hannibal is painted in a new light. Although it is definite worth reading, but it will never be studied as a literary masterpiece; just as another sequel done badly. This is one of those cases where we HOPE the movie exceeds the book. Strong cast, good director, and a miraculous screenwriter could have Hannibal attending the Oscars again."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The story moved along apace. However, Harris is in dire need of an editor. I have two suggestions: Strunk &amp; White and a damn MAP! Obviously Mr. Harris knows nothing about the Washington DC metropolitan area. And his pathetic attempts to be &quot;avant garde&quot; in his writing style (the distracting mix of present and past tense) are laughable. Bottom line: this story would have been spectacular at the keyboard of a true master. Lecter would disapprove of Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Someone wrote that Robert Harris rushed into this. He spent ten years writing this thing! It is definitly worth the wait."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"How unbelievable - I was so excited to read this book and whata let down. The story was just plain gross and the ending was soincredibly unreal. I'll just continue to re-read Red Dragon!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thought to myself when I first saw the book on the shelf finally a sequel to Silence of the Lambs. I went to the library to put it on hold and was the 75th person waiting for the book. When I did get I only had it for two weeks, well it was two weeks too long. I found it boring from the beginning, middle and to the end. Though I must admit I skipped through most of the book hoping to find it more thrilling and keep on the edge of my seat, but alas. It was like Hannibal never came into the picture until the end. Mason Verger was a pain, Krendell was a nothing and what of Starling, well just that what. She was more interesting in Silence of the Lamb. I'm glad I didn't buy this book. Thomas Harris I enjoyed your first two books, The Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, what a disappoint about the third. Can't wait for the movie, hope it will be better."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"People will be polarized by this story.

If you can read this without stubbornly clinging to your own favorite images of the characters...you're in for one hell of a ride!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I do enjoy my thrillers. Silence of the Lambs was a fantastic fast paced book with exciting action. This book pushes the sick and macabre to new levels. In an effort to be more grotesque than any other writer, Mr Harris sacrifices everything it takes to make a truly satisfying thriller."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I enjoyed the book, until the ending. So unbelieveable and out of Starling's character! Hated it! Really, I regret buying this book. Yuck."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"first, while i'm glad i only paid half price for this book, it was the worst $ i have ever spent and nothing short of perhaps burning it one page at a time could psychologically redeem my financial loss.it's truly a tragedy that harris doesn't contractually allow his manuscripts to be edited by his publisher. this one reeeeally could have used a re-write or two. my biggest complaint with the development of dr. lecter's character is that after all harris has taken his readers through with him over the years, having lead us to a place of relation/connection where we really believe that he was simply this unexplained, perfect and unflappable social miscreant by his own choosing, he now honestly wants us to be sympathetic to this monster by trying to validate his wrath via the mischa storyline. THE MAN IS A SERIAL KILLER. PERIOD. NO EXPLANATIONS NEEDED. it's far too late to try and garner sympathy for lecter. he's apathetic and far from remorseful over any of his murders. i don't need to know about his tormenting childhhod memories. nor do i want him to be a romantic. no one wants to feel those kinds of feelings for a monster like lecter. you can't make references to him being lucifer and then say well...he's human after all - it doesn't work!!the mischa thing is awful - true enough, but you can't blame it for lecter's grown up sadistic choices. it doesn't justify what he became. i understand that he's trying to communicate that no one kills without reason it's just difficult to believe that dr. lecter, a professional shrink, couldn't conquer his own demons. his composure level in every other area of his life has been too thouroughly controlled and complete.and on the starling storyline...don't get me started. it was so difficult to believe her metamorphisis. yes seven difficult years have passed but the one thing she never has been is hopeless and without any fight in her. i just can't accept her total collapse in character, ethics, rationale. it was so overwhelmingly done that it just didn't read realistically at all."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In Silence of the Lambs,Harris' presentation of the main characters was only the tip of the iceberg. Hannibal develops the title character and that of Clarice Starling beyond my greatest hopes and we are left with the question...who are the bad guys and who are the good? The richness of detail is wonderful. I was totally engrossed until the end."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A fast-paced account of the aristocratic, genius called Hannibal. Clarice Starling remained true to her courageous, analytical character from &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot; The evil fiend Mason Verger rivaled Hannibal in repulsion and sadism. It's too bad that the plot fell apart at the finale,and the web of relationships was torn apart like one of Verger's victims."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"An emotional roller coaster. I laughed, I cried and I was outraged. Rarely does one experience so many emotions in the course of one book. Add to this the beautiful writing and the depth of the characters and you have a work of art."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Although the entire book is horrific in its cold detachment, the ending was truly terrifying. Only non-fiction has ever scared me more. Although it's been several months since I've finished the book, one or two scenes are still the stuff of my nightmares. I am completely ambivalent about this book, on one hand wishing I hadn't read it, and on the other relishing it. It definitely makes the reader explore his/her own beliefs about good and evil, and the existence of absolute evil."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book was great and really gave an idea look into why Hannibal Lecter has become a serial killer. Although it fails to give an in depth look into his life and mind, it does address some aspect sof his childhood that are interesting. I wish there were more issues resolved about his life. Overall, the book was well-written and really kept me in suspense to see what would happen next. I heard the ending was a disappointment so I was prepared but nothing fully prepared me for it. At first I was a bit disturbed by the ending, but overall it was a great book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is as well written and researched as any book by Harris, which automatically makes it technically wonderful. The truly amazing thing about _Hannibal_ is the world Harris creates for it. With Hannibal Lecter loose, we can no longer pretend there are good guys and bad guys, humans and monsters. A world Lecter takes part in is a world of ambiguities, where the good guys are bad, sometimes worse than the monsters, and the bad guys are often more like us than we care to imagine. With this novel, Harris tosses us into the realm he's been slowly nudging us toward for nearly twenty years, and it has been well worth the wait."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Like most of the folks who've added their thoughts here i read and loved Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs... This book although very readable and enjoyable fails to resolve itself in a realistic manner. The last chapter reminded me of one of the later Vampire books by Anne Rice. Cute and Glossy. What made the other two novels so great was that they had their feet firmly on the ground. Here, things just got silly."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I, like many others, waited patiently for so long for this sequel. Hannibal was not worth the wait. The Mason Verger character was so disgusting and demented, that your stomach turns. Lechter and Starling were so completely different from their original characters, and most of the &quot;bite&quot; was taken out of Lechter by positioning him against the larger monster of Mason Verger. The end of the book was, to say the least, the most bizarre, idiotic, twisted way to end the book (I think only a psychiatrist would appreciate it). Silence of the Lambs was a page turner and a classic that is one of my favorite books (and movies) of all time. This was an utter disappointment and I am saddened that this is the best Thomas Harris could do after all that time working on it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Riveting. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. The new characters are just as fascinating and disturbing as Hannibal. You don't know who to hate more Hannibal or Mason. Both individuals astonishingly horrible characters.I can't wait for the next sequel. I hope it does not take another 7 years."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"First off, I did enjoy it, and hardly put it down. However, while reading HANNIBAL, I couldn't help but think that the movie version of this will no doubt be much more powerful and frightening. It was all build-up but no tension, and the action sequences are really brief. Plus, Harris' tone is just a little too stilted this time around as well...he's mimicking some baroque literary style instead of just getting on with it. The book seemed almost like the novelization of the film, rather than the other way around. Harris almost seems to be describing the stage directions and editing rather than telling the story. However, a good screenwriter, director and cast should be able to turn this into a strong sequel to the film version of &quot;Silence&quot; without letting the words get in the way...and I'd wager you'll enjoy the movie much more if you don't read the book first."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I bought copies of Red Dragon for numerous friends and was delighted to scare them senseless with such an emotionally gripping, well-written book. Hannibal seemed like a paperback piece of schlocky writing that you'd find for sale only in drugstores or airports. I'm extremely disappointed in Mr. Harris. If I worked in a bookstore, I would advise all customers to skip this piece of trash."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have to say that I was one of those people who eagerly awaited this book. I read nonstop, day &amp; night for 2 days straight and couldn't believe what I was reading. A wonderful book, until about the last 30-40 pages. The ending managed to ruin the entire thing for me. Harris could've done better!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I ORDERED THE BOOK EARLY, STARTED IT AS SOON AS IT WAS RECEIVED AND FINISHED IT IN 2 DAYS. I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. ALTHOUGH SOME OTHER REVIEWS SAY IT WASN'T BELIEVABLE, ISN'T THAT WHAT FICTION IS. I READ IT FOR ENTERTAINMENT, NOT THE BELIEF VALUE AND THOMAS HARRIS DID NOT DISAPPOINT. IT WAS,IN MY OPINION, AS GOOD AS, IF NOT SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE MOVIE TO BE MADE. I WILL BE ONE OF THE FIRST IN LINE AND ONE OF THE FIRST TO ORDER HIS NEXT BOOK."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A nonstop tale which kept me glued to the book. It had enough changes in rhythm to peak ones attention and stimulate ones mind."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If all-wise, all-powerful heroes are the dullest characters in fiction all-wise, all-powerful villains run them a close second. The parts of this book that follow Clarice Starling are interesting enough, but the parts that concentrate on Hannibal Lecter soon had me skimming forward. As a mysterious character casting a shadow of evil in The Silence of the Lambs Hannibal Lecter was quite effective, but the more he moves into the foreground in Hannibal the more two-dimensional he seems. The torture scenes were particularly unsatisfactory, as the author seemed unable to capture the horror of his previous books and ended up substituting grossness instead. This book is another good reason to own a library card."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I love Clarice. And I love Hannibal. But I didn't want them to fall in love with one another. The idea I've always had of Clarice is that she is a strong woman - surely getting screwed by the FBI and coming face-to-face with man-eating pigs would not lead her to eloping with a cannibal?! The book was enjoyable for shock-value; I did like the many Harris witticisms; and I found the references to King Henry VIII, Dante, Judas Iscariot etc interesting. It's the kind of book that knocks your socks off at the time, but is ultimately forgettable - much like the sequels to Interview with a Vampire."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"For those who gave the rock-bottom ratings, perhaps you should re-read certain portions of the book. Certain areas are truly the most 'palatable' ever since SOTL. I won't say Harris 'outdid' himself, but he did provide the most remarkable additional insight into his beloved Dr. Lecter. We see Lecter (eventually) from a variety of perspectives and angles and each one (excluding the way-too-contrived history of Lecter's sister) provides a remarkable insight into the cultivated, articulate, purposeful, and intelligent mind of Hannibal Lecter. This particular aspect of the book takes some active searching, footnoting and contemplation, but I assure future and present readers of the book that such a venture will yield satisfaction. One sidenote: The exuberantly artful and detailed writing concerning Florence (before we see Lecter) is a necessary device which provides a worthy introduction to Lecter and enables the reader the satisfaction of adjusting to Dr. Lecter's highly cultivated passions and interests. Such a switching of diction and style a third of the way through the book represents an important investment in our main character and how he is perceived by his audience. For those who enjoyed SOTL and RD, read this book just for the pleasure of sifting out information concerning Hannibal Lecter: his tastes, his passions, his cultivation, etc. Certain parts of the book could have been re-written to provide more cohesion with the trilogy (the ending for one) but overall, Cheers to Harris!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris tortures reader with endless circumlocution! Other than that, I look forward to another book or possibly a &quot;movie&quot;?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It seems that readers either loved or hated Hannibal. I , myself, thoroughly enjoyed it. I had to read it twice to catch the nuances of character and story. There were way too many unbelievable characters, but as we know, &quot;Too many is too many but way too many is just right.&quot; Hannibal's Florence was his Florence, not the everyday Florence."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Some say they were disappointed, but I was thrilled! I found this book to be very erotic and psychotically romantic, which was great. The ending completely surprised me. Loved it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;Hannibal&quot; kept me interested all the way through. The book is beautifully written. Harris is a fine writer who knows how to create suspense to keep the reader's attention. With characters like Verger and Krendler hot on his trail, I couldn't help but root for Lecter. I found the scenes in Italy a little slow. And what the heck was that ending all about. The last fifty pages ruined the book. Totally implausable and ridiculous. I think we (the readers) deserved a better ending. Still, I recommend this book. If your a Harris fan and have read his previous novels, you must read this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely and can only hope that the Lecter saga shall continue in a fourth book. Perhaps my reading was enhanced by hearing Jodie Foster's voice every time Clarice spoke with her soft southern accent and picturing Anthony Hopkins with his depth of character, style, and grace which he imparts to Lecter. In my own mind's 'palace', their characters live on and I anticipate where their saga should lead next. Well done, Mr. Harris! Please don't keep us waiting."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"darkly fascinating, I read Hannibal after reading The Triumph and the Glory--golly was THAT a change of pace--talk about opposite ends of the spectrum--but found it frustrating to read, Hannibal was very uneven in quality, poorly edited, and then would be brilliant for 40-50 pages, then wallow in nonsense for awhile, then grab me for another few dozen pages, then deteriorate into gibberish. Was Monica Lewinsky stopping by now and then while Harris was trying to write this baby ? Were there distractions that interrupted the flow of his writing. Something went haywire somewhere. This book could have been so good, with maybe one more draft and some major league editing it could have been superb."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The final (hopefully) book for the Hannibal character disgusted me, bored me, and finally angered me. The book's plot is very convulted. I nearly quit this reading this book and found myself struggling to finish it. There is plenty of gore and loads of wasted detail on Florencian history. If there is one complaint I have about Thomas Harris, it is that he kills the reader with detail that is useless.Hannibal is turned into a super-human psycho, with a nose that a hunting dog would envy, cultery skills that puts Martha Stewart to shame, and a knowledge of Florence that borders disbelief. The complex Clarice Starling of Silence is now a thug who becomes entranced by Hannibal. Mason and his sister are completely uninteresting characters.The first 100 pages gravy-trains Silence. The next 150 pages have no use at all. The real &quot;plot&quot; doesn't begin until the reader is in the 300's. The ending is so totally unbelievable, I wanted to throw the book through the window.I'm going back to non-fiction for a while."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What a waste of money and time. Couldn't even finish it...flat characters, dumb plot. Written just for &quot;jolt value&quot;."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is not nearly as good as its two predecessors, but it's really a tale of an entirely different nature -- more psychological profile than outright suspense. However, the book provides a great climax -- there are no good guys, and consequently, it is uncertain exactly what the outcome will be. For this fact alone, along with the presentation of a very creepy villain in Mason Verger (along with the interesting characters of Margot and, even, Barney), this is worth reading. The revelation of Hannibal's traumatic past undermines his creepiness but it does not excuse his crimes, and with the title that it has, it is understandable that this book would present this kind of psychological detail to a figure who had previously been only a mystery.There is the sense that Thomas Harris is to an extent writing this for the public; our fascination with the goriness of the other books is matched in this one by more disgusting horrors. I had to pause in disgust at times. However, I wonder if he wrote the end how he did to get us off his back. There surely couldn't be a sequel after this, could there? As for the ending, it certainly isn't very plausible and is a stretch for the characters, but somehow it works and leaves a very memorable impression. There is a point where the book could have ended, but I am pleased that it didn't end at that point. In this case, I prefer being surprised and challenged to being given a more predictable ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading the Red Dragon and The silence of the Lambs, I was really looking forword to this book. Like so many of the fans, I rushed out and purchased the novel on the first day it arrived in local bookstores. And than I got home and read it... What can I say... None of the characters seemed like they were from TSOTL. Hannibal was a dark and mysterious person in the other two novels. Here he is focused on too much and all of the darkness is reduced to a some what annoying character. Starling, Crawford, and Mapp are basicly just there in my opinion. i felt that Harris' needed to expand on their characters in order for readers to care for them. Overall, the plot was not too bad, but when the reader does not care for the character, it is hard for a story to work. Also, I found the ending of the novel to be very, well just bad."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Did Harris show the last 20 pages of this thing to anyone before he shipped it off to the printer? Anyone with half a brain (no spoilers, please) would have told him to trash the O Henry ending. After trying to legitimize a fairly decent horror story with page after page of psychobabble, Harris has Starling do what she is psychologically incapable of. It would have made more sense had she suddenly turned into an overweight Polynesian man. Perhaps that will be the plot of the next one."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Not even close to the high standard set in &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; or &quot;Red Dragon&quot;. The ending is so ridiculously unbelievable that it wrecks what is otherwise a good read. I expected a lot more from Thomas Harris.Very disappointing book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Just finished the book and wished I had obtained it while on vacation so I wouldn't have had to put it down so often. This book is well written and moves quickly. No problem with dull or slow places that I noticed. Dr. Lecter is his usual gruesome self and has an equally gruesome enemy. The only thing that I can say that I didn't like was the ending. But that was personal preference in how I was hoping that it would end."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I admit that I sat glued reading Hannibal hoping that Harris's treatment of the characters would revert back to what they were in SOTL. Sadly Harris failed in Hannibal what he accomplished in Red Dragon &amp; SOTL. The 3diminsional characters fleshed out in SOTL become 2 diminsional in Hannibal. Both Hannibal and Clarice deserved better character development that they got here. The &quot;humanizing&quot; of Hannibal and the &quot;dehumanizing&quot; of Starling was incredibly disappointing. The Starling character deserved so much better than what was afforded her, especially at the end. Granted a further sequel is now possible...but I have to admit...I certainly won't look forward to it as much as I looked forward to this sequel. What a pity!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;No one can run, no one can hide; / Isn't that Lecter there beside you?&quot; (To paraphrase Stephen Sondheim from his work about the man-eating Sweeney Todd.) Oh, how wonderful! There seems to be no middle ground on &quot;Hannibal&quot; -- one either loves him or hates him. Or, rather, loves or hates the book; though I certainly wouldn't mind an evening of dinner and conversation with the erudite Dr. Lecter provided someone ELSE was cooking, and that I had a couple of bodyguards along...just in case...though even that might not be enough, given Dr. Lecter's seemingly endless resources of deadly talent. What Thomas Harris has most certainly not given us is the ordinary, run-of-the-mill horror story, one in which the good guys and bad guys are easily spotted and cheered for. Mr. Harris has reached out and seized us by the jugular (or the sweetbreads, if you prefer). His is a world where good and evil have lost their mythological meanings and often the choices left are only the ones to be made from the lesser of the evils presented to us daily. In other words, his world is the real world in all its Grand Guignol excess. One no longer wonders if Mr. Harris has gone over the deep end when one sees newspaper accounts of parents horribly abusing their children; and one sees actual Grand Guignol when such incidents prompt less public outcry than the abuse of a small dog, something that occurred not long ago in my locale. If on tries to escape from the horrors of the real world in this work of fiction, one instead finds them put under a magnifying glass and brought closer than is comfortable. Perhaps Dr. Lecter is an anomaly, but in many ways Mason Verger is not, a prospect that can only terrify when we realize it. Evil is not often black and white; it is much more likely to be slippery and ambiguous. What I think has disturbed so many of the readers of &quot;Hannibal&quot; is perhaps the most horrifying idea of all -- we have met Dr. Lecter, and he is us. Though I am presently checking the top of my head once an hour to make sure it's still attached..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"My advice to anyone reading this book is to stop on page 463 and make up your own ending. It could not possibly be worse than the crappy one in the book.The rest of the book was ok, but I grew a little tired of Harris constantly using confusing metaphors over and over. Words that you have never seen together before, but he puts them together 30 times in 100 pages. Because they sound so &quot;off&quot; you notice when he keeps repeating them. Buy a thesaurus for crying out loud!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Red Dragon- excellent, SOTL - brilliant, Hannibal - waste of paper What a disappointment. The psychological picture of Lector built up in the previous books has been ruined by this sequel. If I didn't know better I'd say it was written by someone else. It started promisingly but just deteriorated into an extremely unlikely, dissatisfying conclusion."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm surprised by most of the reviews. If Harris wrote books that were what everyone expected, why would we bother? I enjoyed finding out why Hannibal is the way he is, since you sort of like him it's nice to know he did have motivation.I admit the ending was a big surprise, but isn't that what we like in a good book? I can't see it being a movie and I don't know if there will be anohter Hannibal book but I did really enjoy this one and I did have to reread the ending.I loved the detail and historical allusions. If you want a straight pulp shocker read someone else. This was evidently the book he wanted to write, Hollywood or no and I did really enjoy reading it even if it was not at all what I expected and maybe because of that."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Disappointing, beyond belief! I've liked all three of Harris' earlier books, including both with Lechter, and found them thoughtful, thrilling, and gritty. Better than &quot;genre fare.&quot; But great thrillers need great villians, and the Lechter victim seeking revenge here is lamely underwritten, and foolishly cartoonish -- a hideous, disfigured, crippled meat packing czar who agents are secretly breeding the Terror Pigs of Europe as his instrument of vengeance. This is like something out of Danger Mouse or Inspector Gadget; James Belushi, not James Ellroy. Pathetic. The ending (interesting in principle) is so poorly developed and prepared that it turns preposterous, unconvincing, and arbitrary. Stephen King's review in the New York Times is inexplicable, except as a mutual back-scratching blurb bouquet."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If you read Silence of the Lambs, then you will love this. It is so in detail, you feel like you are right behind Dr. Lecture. I can't wait for the movie to be started on. This is one of the best novels in '99."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal was fast, riveting and almost as memorable as Red Dragon. I liked what many readers here found disturbing -- it's unpredictability. I'm glad that Clarice wasn't your typical &quot;flawed but always victorious,&quot; squeek-by heroine, ala Cornwell's Scarpetta. Although I look forward to more by Harris, I hope there's not another sequel --- it seemed the perfect (again, unpredictable, not cliche) ending to the series."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"HANNIBAL does an amazing thing. It sidesteps the now recognizable and anticipated &quot;horror&quot; of Hannibal Lecter and shows a world full of characters who are more monstrous in their greedy, ambitious, petty, selfish, and hungry little ways.It was unfortunate that Jonathan Demme's version of Hannibal Lecter was so flashy and &quot;monstrous.&quot; Thomas Harris' Lecter is an intensely focused, unlimited human being. To call him a monster misses the point. What Harris says with his Lecter trilogy is that there are no monsters, only human beings who do monstrous things.HANNIBAL is an incredible sensual feast. Harris' writing is wonderful. He can go from clinical pragmatism to poignant poetry at will.The point of HANNIBAL is that a person who recognizes and acknowledges you, the complete continuum of your being, can make up for every other pain and suffering in the world. It's a sad acceptance but a better option when compared to the apathy and indifference that surrounds us.Compare the monstrosity of Hannibal Lecter's insanity to the horror of Mason Verger and his family's greed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This novel left me dumbfounded. Definitely NOT Silence of the Lambs. Put all of your assumptions of Clarice and Dr. Lector aside, and hang on for the ride."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"First things first, Red Dragon ans Silence of the Lambs are classic books that gave great insight to the psychology of profiling serial killers and of serial killers themselves. And they were good thrillers to boot. However, this book is unbelievably bad. I wish I could have gave it a negative star review. Everything is wrong with this book. Jonathan Demme was being polite when he bowed out of making a film out of this mess by saying , 'it's too violent&quot; . The whole premise of the book is ludicrous and the ending is even worse. It wouldn't shock me to find out that this book was ghost written by the same person who ghost writes those V.C. Andrews books. Turst me, save your money or give it to charity. If you don't believe me, check this book out at the library. You'll thank me and yourself......."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Okay, okay, I think I know what happened: Hannibal Lecter rose up through the pages, roasted Mr. Harris over a spit, and enjoyed him with poached asparagus and a nice Chardonnay. Then the good doctor finished the book himself. (Did he begin his meal with the editor as an appetizer?)Why is it that we can all agree about Red Dragon and Silence being so superb, but the 5-star folks rise up with righteous indignation when we 1-star folks call this silliness what it is? Mr. Harris clearly just wanted to get this thing done, at all costs. I feel like I've been mugged. I'm donating my copy, anonymously, to the local library. I don't want anyone to know I actually bought this thing.*Note to the nice Amazon people: Why can't we have the option of giving NO stars? This book didn't deserve any."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"No, it's not too dark or too over the top. It's just plain badly written. Did the publisher read this book? If you purchase Hannibal you'll feel cheated. What in the world was Steven King thinking?."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"When I heard that'Hannibal' was out at my local bookstore, I jumped in the car and bought it. What a great, great disappointment. Bottom line - the ending was completely out of character for both Clarice and Hannibal. After 10 years, you'd think Mr. Harris could come up with a better ending. The characters were reduced to rubble. Better than Hannibal's background etc. should have remained a mystery!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read your long awaited sequel with regret from the very first page. Regret because I knew I would have only a few hours to be with Hannibal's character.In reading I seek not perfection, but the ability to walk away with more than I had before I started. You have never disappointed me Mr. Harris. Hannibal certainly has never disappointed me. I experienced many moments of joy and emotional upheaval while reading your latest book. Hannibal again reminded me of how very much I have yet to learn and experience on a variety of subjects. You and Hannibal both educate and provoke. What more can one expect from a book.Thank you again."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris does great research before facing a blank monitor and keyboard. Ian Fleming of 007 fame also included much bon vivant research and shared it with the reader. Harris tops this with the ever refreshing eclecticism of Dr. Lecter. The plot is as fast moving as Fleming's adventures, but Harris' writing skills reflect those of Thomas Wolfe, i.e. great turn of phases, subtle humor and awesome descriptive ability. In addition, his character creations are identifiable and one can really get to hate/love the identities. One lament: why can't video/movie industry mirror a fraction of Harris' scripting....I actually walked out of the new &quot;Star Wars&quot; due to terminal boredom with the script. If it takes Harris 12 years for another book, I don't mind waiting for the quality he offers."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am so glad we finally get to see what made Hannibal the way he is! Yes, I respected him in Silence and I still do. Of course he is an animal and I wouldn't want to see him free in my world but I have always wanted to look inside his head and see what makes him tick. As for the ending, I believe it... We all know Clarice had some major problems with her childhood which seemed to interfere with her adult life in a huge way. Hannibal the father figure? I LOVE IT! Remember, Hannibal had the brilliance to talk people into killing themselves... I listened to the unabridged audio and it was wonderful!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Following the theme that evil corrupts innocence, and that the ultimate triumph of evil is the total corruption of good, Harris has penned a masterful work. In Hannibal, Lecter continues the subornation of Starling that he began in SOTL, with foreseeable results.Many who don't care for the ending of this book overlook both Graham's fate in RD and the weakness of character Starling occasionally showed in SOTL which Lecter takes full advantage of in this book. In choosing to make his characters three dimensional, Harris manages to avoid leaving us with yet another heroine versus villian story where the good guys win and the bad guys lose. Instead, we have a much more visceral tale, in which we, as well as Starling, have the opportunity to be seduced by the glamour of evil.The only weakness of this book was finding a psychobabble explanation of Lecter's behavior, an explanation that Lecter himself would probably deride. In the world of Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs, and Hannibal, it is much for effective for Lecter to be evil for evil's sake.Dark, dismal, and shocking, Hannibal is a fitting end to the story of Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter, and shouldn't be missed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Well.....Ok read it in 48 houers. The end..well it works(had to sleep on it)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Yes the soon to be infamous ending threw me for a loop, but I laughed and nodded. Throughout the book I had to wonder who I was rooting for, and I was satisfied to feel my empathy was justified."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"i'm torn about this book. it's definitely a fun read; however, that's all it is. much like Harris's other books, HANNIBAL maintains massive elements of suspense and highly psychotic violence. and when you add an eloquent delivery to this equation, HANNIBAL becomes a number you immerse yourself in. but this book, is by no means, Harris's finest work. HANNIBAL is inferior to RED DRAGON and, especially, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. the sad fact is this: it's too hard to say if this book is really good or bad . . . it's basically a judgement call. and a judgement call always must be made from the middle of the road."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Apparently Mr. Harris needs to reread the first two brilliant installments of his trilogy. Hannibal takes two characters previously well developed and morphs them into entirely different beings. Clarice straying from her firm belief in law and order, regardless of the political climate of the FBI? Dr.Lecter delving in the psychobabble he so detested in the prequels and showing a human compassionate side? I think not! I finished the book this morning and immediately began calling all those I knew to be fans of the trilogy to warn them to save their money on this terribly disappointing &quot;sequel&quot;."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris has created not one, but TWO villians of the most brutal and relentless sort."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I like all Harris fans could not wait for this book. I never could have imagined it like this. I am lost for words to express my feelings at how bad this was."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Having read &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, I was totally unprepared for &quot;Hannibal&quot;. The book was a definite surprise. Harris has only gotten better. I couldn't put the book down until I had read it through the first time and re-read the last 50 or so pages. There had been an attachment to Clarice Starling by Dr. Lecter since the &quot;Lambs&quot; book, and Harris played on that with a masterful touch. Even though the above-mentioned books were excellent suspense, I anticipated the endings long before the end. With Hannibal, I had no idea what to expect. I was blown away...and that isn't easy for a seasoned reader of fiction such as I. Kudos to Mr. Harris. Please say that there will be more!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was quite disappointed in the book. Like everyone else, I waited for years to read the sequel that was so obviously coming. Now that I've read it, I feel somewhat cheated. I found myself being somewhat understanding of Hannibal's nastiness... instead of being in awe of a mysterious force of nature."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Very different from silence of the lambs and red dragon. Really a pschological study of Clarice and Lector. Gripping."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I wouldn't be so angry if the book had been awful from the start. But it's not. It's wonderful--full of wit and intrigue and the wonderful prose that Harris is capable of.But in the last few chapters, he goes so terribly wrong that it just makes you want to cry. Lecter and Starling go so far out of character as to make you wonder what Harris was thinking. Did he deliberately want to disappoint and anger his fans? He certainly did a good job with this one. After waiting so long for this book to appear, and after enjoying most of it thoroughly, I can only say that the last few chapters of this book are the worst betrayal of character and reader that I have ever come across.Shame on you, Mr. Harris. I want my money back."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Although this book is critiqued by most as different and bad, it is actually some more of a huge roller coaster ride into psychiatry"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I really wanted to like this book. Hannibal was such a multi-faceted character in his other renditions. We do find out the why of the cannibalism--fine. But was it really necessary? Isn't it interesting enough to think he could be an incarnation of evil without psycho babble to excuse it? But that still wasn't the turn off.In Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal and Starling play a tension filled mind game. This is what Hannibal lives for in his denuded cell. He finds Starling a worthy opponent for the moment. He wants to extend his time with her, so he gives the tantalizing clues and she keeps coming back.Starling knows she's being manipulated, but in the world of the FBI powerful men are manipulating here just the same. No problem. Get what you need from them and go on with business.None of this in the new book. Hannibal is simply playing games--not intriguing mind games. But bloody games. And Harris foregoes his former restraint and steps over the gross quotient.The book begins reading like a bunch of twelve year olds in the clubhouse trying to outgross one another.The lapses into first and second person are self pandering and interrupt the flow. And talk down to the reader. If you can make inferences you know this stuff already.Harris needs to realize that his early success was based on clear writing suited to the genre. And he really needs to get over himself."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have waited years and years for this book and I was thrilled! I couldn't stop reading the book until I had finished. I love the little twists it takes. If you have been dying to know what has become of Hannibal and Clarice, you must read this book!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A great addition to the trilogy. Read it &amp; then had to go eat some sausages with fava bean washed down with chianti. Great work Harris!!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"And either way, it's extremely satisfying. Read it as a &quot;summer beach book&quot; or study it as the next step in the natural progression of Lecter's character.There's plenty in here to sink your teeth into (sorry) and a few laughs besides.As for gore, it's in there but it's not overdone.As for the complaints about Lecter being somehow diminished as a villain, because we're given a childhood trauma to explain his behavior -- well, it works both ways, doesn't it? A warm-blooded Lecter is just as chilling as the cold-blooded variety. Maybe more.I loved it. As someone told me when after I read some pre-publication negative reviews, read it and decide for yourself. I'm glad I did."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Perhaps this book suffered from the expectations of this reader; another problem may have been that I read the reviews prior to reading the book. All that aside I can only state that this book was a disappointment. Mr. Harris started off well, and the plot moved rapidly for the first third of the book, after that it detiorated rapidly, culminating in the finale, the inane ending. Awful! Even with a substantial discount this book is not worth buying."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The only question still unresolved about &quot;Hannibal&quot; is whether it is merely the worst book of the decade or the worst book of all time. In one stroke Harris has torpedoed his reputation, trashed his most famous fictional creations, and insulted and alienated his loyal readers. It's almost pointless to analyze the book's innumerable crippling flaws -- the Grand Guignol absurdity, the flights of literary and intellectual pretentiousness, the total absence of believability, logic, suspense, or even basic professionalism. The worst hack writer banging out a book a month for his rent money would be embarrassed to put his name on this monumental dreck. For a writer of Harris's talent to have labored eleven years, with &quot;Hannibal&quot; as the result, is simply inexplicable."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am of 2 minds about this book. On the one, it is as well crafted and suspenseful a tale as one would expect from a master like Thomas Harris. It's entertaining, it moves, the characters are well drawn and for the most part it satisfies the curiosity of those who wanted more after 'Lambs.' On the other hand, and maybe because he such a free writer, Harris is writing the book primarily FOR HIMSELF. The last 50 pages or so are incredibly alienating to an intelligent reader. It's as if (were this a film) Demme were directing the first hour and a half and Lynch steps in for the last half hour. Not that I dislike either of these filmmakers, but their individual elements, mingled together so disjointedly, do not make for the most satisfying experience. (Speaking of film, I have a strong feeling that we will never see this one made as is, extensive overhauling will need to be done.) To sum up, I think this book is great for its originality, its poetry, and its overall departure from the genre, far surpassing the average serial-killer yarn. But in being such a departure, it also contains some of the most trite elements of fan-fiction, with an ending that seems to want to satisfy the readers of the worst fantasy. I attempted to give this book 2.5 stars, but the page only allows whole stars."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"People who just saw the movie, Silence of the Lambs, and who have never read the book, will not like Hannibal. And no one should read Hannibal if they have not read - at least - Silence of the Lambs; and hopefully The Red Dragon.However, to those who read the book, they will find it a worthy continuation of the Hannibal/Starling saga.Harris's books are not pop-culture FBI drama/action stories. They are modern-day horror classics that explore humanity and all of its definitions.Hannibal explores relationships, revenge, greed, fall from grace, dreams, hopes.Hannibal is a horror story.Hannibal is an excellent story (not sequel) that explores how the lives of Dr. Lecter Hannibal and Clarice Starling are connected, and it takes one to unimagined places.I could not put the book down, but there were times when I had to stop reading - partly because of the horror of the impending scene, partly because I did not want the story to end.There is more to explore in the relationship of Starling and Hannibal, and I hope Harris does not make us wait too long to find out more. However, if he never writes of them again, I will be satisfied with the stories that I have."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is one of my favorite characters....I have missed him. All thru 'Silence..', I was alternately drawn and repulsed, but bottom line, I wished I could meet him, sit (safely) with him and converse. He's still one of the most amazing people to me. I hope this is not the end of the saga, but I don't know how much longer it can go on--tho if anyone can keep it from going schlocky, it's Harris. I was upset by Mason's antics with the children, tho."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A whole new book, a whole new direction. There is real (sick) humor in this one. Those who wanted a simple continuation of Silece are doomed to disappointment. In this who-is-going-to-eat-whom game, it's hard to know which sociopath to root for. The only sure loser is the FBI, which garnered no sympathy from me. I enjoyed seeing inside Lechter's mind, it turned a larger-than-life, mythic monster into a sick, twisted man. I was shocked and appalled by the ending, and yet absolutely intrigued by the idea."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I just don't know what to think. It's an interesting plot and it's plain that Harris is more than just a pulp thriller writer (sure do want to visit Florence now). I preferred Silence of the Lambs. I just can't imagine Starling ending up as she does. I worry that without Jonathan Demme to humanize/edit the story, this movie will fail. I don't think I'll be buying anyone this book"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The only thing good about this book, is the money it will make Harris. He didn't stay true to the characters and the ending makes John Grishams endings appear as literary mastery. Pick up a copy of Terry Kays THE KIDNAPPING OF AARON GREENE. An author you never disappoints."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I can't believe that Mr. Harris signed his name to this drivel. Did he think the readers would forget the basic elements in the characters' personalities? The ending is shocking, which would not be bad, except that it is also inadequately explained. There are so many ways this novel could have gone - I wish Mr. Harris had chosen a different option."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was really psyched up about the release of Thomas Harris's latest book. A week before it was released, I procured Harris's second book,_Red Dragon_, and read it in two days. I struggled to procure a copy of _Silence of the Lambs_, although I was unable to (don't even ask). The best I could to was watch the movie again.As you have surely heard from other reviews, _Hannibal_ has not lived up to expectations._Hannibal_ details the latest exploits of everyone's favorite cannibal, the good Dr. Lecter. Though the two previous books in which he appeared featured him as a primary character, he was hardly ever a main one--he was generally there to add insight into the protagonist and antagonist. This book features him as THE main character, with virtually everyone else playing supporting rolls.Perhaps the greatest and most blatant thing lacking from this book is that it no longer offers the insight and psychological profiling that played such a major part in the previous two books.In addition, it also lacks its precursor's sense of flow and progress. _Hannibal_ is often slow and boring; parts of it are prolonged and truly without point. The beginning was pointless, the middle had some good bits, and the end was pathetic. It seems like Harris needs a better editor.That being said, it really is not all that bad of a book--just not of the same caliber of the ones that came before it. It lacks the sense of reality and grittyness that really formed the other two. It is somewhat suspensful at some parts (although utterly belabored at others), which is more than can be said for many novels. The plot is somewhat interesting, although I do not think the characterization was well done or well sustained. Another plus is that it is a very quick read in spite of its great girth (500 pages): I completed it in about two days.Don't expect a masterpiece. Expect some passable fiction."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;What still slaps the clammy flab of our submissive consciousness hard enough to get our attention?&quot; (Hannibal, chapter 20, page 127).Mr. Harris has achieved the impossible. In today's hardbitten society, he has made us look into the eyes of Hannibal Lector and see ourselves. Just as a flashlight shines in the dark creating a pool of light to walk forward one step at a time, the mind of us all is reflected in the darkness of each character. Step slowly and cautiously as you read Hannibal. Don't look beyond the light or you might see your psyche slaughtered by the wayside."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Like quite a lot of Harris fans, I have known him for eleven years. Like not quite a lot of them, I loved Francis Dolarhyde, I smiled at Jame Gumb's antics, I loathed Starling, I laughed at the cartoony villain Lecter, I felt an affection for Will Graham... and I was truly interested in experiencing it all again. But this... I will not dwell into what other readers commented on: that is, Lecter. I never enjoyed this paper-thin comic &quot;villain&quot; (especially after seeing Hopkins overact). But of other matters - Mason Verger as the ultimate evil? Please... I wouldn't know whether to laugh in what remains of his face or extract his intestines were I to meet him. And the ending... yes, funny, and happy - from a certain point of view, obviously not the foolish majority's one - but unrealistic and NOT surrealistic - which is what it should be. Three stars for the appetizing and funny fragments, especially from the final feast - but no more."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Disappointing. I recently read the book &quot;Red Dragon&quot;. I found that to be a great page turner. So, What about Hanibal? Starts off great! Had me hooked from the first chapter, only to be let down with the remainder of the book. What was meant to be a shock for the readers turned out to be uncharacteristic of Harris and unimaginative. It seems as if the Lecter/Starling Saga ends with little creativity and a lot of screenplay."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What happened to you, Mr. Harris? Are you the same author who wrote Red Dragon &amp; Silence of the Lambs? This is execrable work from someone who trailblazed a new genre. Here's hoping you will find your path (and humanity) again."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I think Thomas Harris must have hired someone else to write this trashy, blabbermouth novel. It sometimes reads like he only wrote the first few chapters, then had some insane fan write everything else. Harris spends way too many pages describing places and things that don't hold the reader's interest, and providing gruesome imagery that is totally unnecessary. Not enough plot and too much scenery makes a pretty dull book. Harris seems to want to cast Lecter as the 007 of serial killers, and it's just rediculous! I don't like the character. We weren't supposed to like the character. Why not do the logical thing and bring Will Graham back out of retirement to re-capture Lecter? Harris has revised his own history here so that Hannibal only killed demented weirdos, and only did it because of his traumatic childhood. I'd like to hear from Mr. Harris himself on this one, because I have a sly suspicion that he only wrote this book to point out a major flaw in readers of his material: they're rooting for the bad guy, and that's not right. Want to read a good book? Try any of Harris' other novels, and avoid this one like the plague. I'd rather have been left hanging; so to speak."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Just finished this book about an hour ago. Read all 480+ in 2 days. Now, don't take that fact that I finished it so quickly to mean that it was good; I read so fast so I could hurry up and get through it. About the only good thing I can say about it is that it is set mostly in my favorite part of the world, Italy. A good time to read this book is if you stuck in a hospital bed (as I was) and have nothing else to read ... IMO."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is classic Hannibal Lecter. He is up to his usual business and Clarice Starling is hot on his trail. The presence of Mason Verger (Hannibals would be victim) was a great addition to the plot. In a nutshell this book deserves at least 4 stars if not 5."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris has outdone himself! This book kept me on the edge of the seat throughout the book with a final twist that I didn't see coming at all, but made perfect sense. I'm almost sorry I read it, because I want to read it again!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is a pathetic effort to make money after Silence of the Lambs. I must admit that I thought the whole premise was so off the wall that I was only able to get to the middle of the book.If you like stupid dialogue, plot, and poor characterization this book is the book for you.I didn't even pay full price and I still feel ripped off."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was rather disappointed with Hannibal as it is written like a novelization of a screenplay. Thomas Harris was obviously lobbying for his sequel to Silence of the Lambs to be on the silver screen before the mass market paperbacks hit the shelves. Although there were several bright moments in the story, by pandering to the filmmakers, Harris takes away the thing that makes reading so enjoyable-- the imagination."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I must agree with the review from &quot;A reader from Savannah&quot;, below. Ones appreciation of Hannibal is likely enhanced by a sense of humor, an appreciation of irony, and an understanding of the symbiotic relationship that often develops between the hunter and his/her prey. While many posted critics pan the ending, I rather enjoyed it - it &quot;made sense&quot; to me. This book is certainly the least intense of Harris' books, but, in my opinion, a pleasurable read nonetheless."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I waited to read reviews of this book until after I had read it myself, and I was glad that I wasn't the only one who was terribly disappointed. I was first introduced to Dr. Lechter in &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, and got to know him better in &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, but the Dr. Lechter in this book is not the same character. None of &quot;Hannibal's&quot; characters is well defined and mental imagery is fuzzy at best. I kept trudging through page after page of mundane text, anxiously awaiting another Thomas Harris climactic ending, only to close the book angily, and wonder &quot;How could he do this to his readers?&quot; My advice to potential readers is to just ask someone who had read the book about the ending. Once you learn what happens, you'll be glad you didn't waste your time or money."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Where to begin? No focus, far too many characters, over-indulgent, dull. Save your money.Another modern-day vampire tale that has been told by lesser authors. Hooray. This is not a worthy follow-up to the two magnificent books that have preceded 'Hannibal' in this trilogy. This was, at best, a disappointment and is far outclassed by 'Silence' and 'Red Dragon'. The completely engrossing nature of those books were the forensics within the FBI, how a madman's psychosis and minutia of evidence was revealed and left him vulnerable to be tracked, and both offered a terrifying climax and conclusion. You will find none of that here. Two-thirds of 'Hannibal' are evidently Harris' travel journal where he reveals all the delicious foods, drink, and art he discovered during his time in Florence, as well as a new-found education on Dante' Inferno. Yes, we know Dr. Lecter is a man of high taste, but after many, many labored references we get the point. Mason Verger is a bore and his plan for Dr. Lecter's undoing is entirely ridiculous. And if Clarice truly is the essential good to Dr. Lecter's evil as was proposed throughout, it is absurd for Harris to have Clarice follow a drug-induced transition to Dr. Lecter's side.Even with a film like Demme's 'Silence' which was a worthy complement to the book, I somewhat regretted seeing it after the read because it compromised the awesome and horrifying visions Harris places in one's mind. With 'Hannibal' I have to hope for a film sequel if only to make some sense visually out of the complete mess that is 'Hannibal'."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"My excitement about the release of the sequel to Silence of the Lambs was only matched by my disappointment and amazement at how bad Hannibal (the book, not the character) is! The book's plot meanders all over the globe, characters (who we thought we knew) are inexplicably out-of-character, and the gore is profoundly boring. Don't waste your money on this mess!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read the reviews before I read the book, so my expectations were low. I thought it moved along pretty well. Mason was a bit &quot;007 Bad Guy&quot; dramatic with his elaborate revenge plot. I did want another hunt-for-Hannibal story, but Harris already did that twice before. I think the book has much more depth and lesson-to-be-learned imagery. I don't think the point or the ending were meant to be taken at face value. I'm not too worried, though. Harris could write another one. I can't see how De Laurentis is going to make a movie out of it. He would have to redo the ending to make it Hollywood friendly. Mr. Harris...good book and I'll continue to look at the deeper meaning I think you intended the readers to find."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In a marathon-reading session yesterday (I got the book, newly- cataloged, at noon from the library and read until I was done), I completed _Hannibal_, the latest thriller by Thomas Harris, chronicling the continuing adventures of Hannibal Lecter.I'm not sure just what to say. I wanted very much to like this book and much of it was very good. But there is also much to despair about in the book, including the entire final portion of the book, which is so ludicrous, so ridiculously over the top, that it is hard to imagine what Harris was thinking as he wrote it. I've read reviews that call it &quot;black comedy,&quot; but if it is, I don't see it.This took eleven years?! I'd be embarrassed to have this work go out with my name on it. I'd be embarrassed to be the publisher connected with it. This is a case where raw greed got in the way of such simple things as basic proofreading and editing and should provide some proof that there is no one who is such a great writer that his/her work could not use some editing.How this could possibly be adapted into a film is beyond me."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Books read by the author can be horrible. Authors are writers, not trained audio performers. Thomas Harris, however, does a great job with a challenging role. Harris makes Mason Verger all the more disgusting. He does such a good job that the &quot;reader&quot; gets more from the audiobook than the printed version."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read &quot;Red Dragon&quot; (5 stars) for the first time and re-read &quot;Lambs&quot; (5 stars) in anticipation of reading &quot;Hannibal.&quot; I really &quot;devoured&quot; this story until the silly ending. I enjoyed Dr. Lecter much more when he was &quot;out there somewhere.&quot; An opera with Clarise? Come on, Mr. Harris. I look forward to the movie, but only if you change the ending before you waste acting talent on what could be in the league of the first two books. Keep it scary, not silly."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I could not wait to receive my copy of &quot;Hannibal&quot;. However, I expected much more of the the author, Thomas Harris, in describing Dr. Lector. I was very disappointed to see how Claice fell so short on her character and could not believe that she would fall under the 'control' of Dr. Lector. As for Mason Verger, his death was not as I expected and once again I felt cheated out of a meeting between the him and Hannibal. The ending could have been one of excitement and hair-raising, however, it let me down. Maybe Mr. Harris will write another sequel to &quot;Hannibal&quot;, one with a more believable ending and one that will leave you wanting more. I enjoyed reading this book; however, when the ending came, it was a different story. Mr. Harris, please try again."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I bought this book not knowing a word written by Harris, but I was pretty optimistic. The character created in the movie &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; had a definite magnetism-I hoped that this book would do the same, because after all;&quot;the books are (usually) much better than the movie&quot;... let us hope that a movie is made based on this novel too. Not because the novel is worthy of a multi-million dollar cinematic project, but because I know that someone else would do a much better job of interpreting this literary failure.Harris has a very poor ear for dialog-this is the first thing that repelled me. The man actually writes, &quot;don't make me put a cap in your a**.&quot; The camp is laughable. Another thing that repelled me was Harris's pseudo-poetic descriptions of EVERYTHING just to bulk up the book (a precedent created by Stephen King, who by the way also reads like a lollipop wrapper).I suggest that you all not purchase this book-reading the summary on the back flap will do just as well. We dont want to get the publishers to pressure Harris into writing another installment now do we. SAVE THE TREES! SAVE THE INKS!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If you have followed the series from Red Dragon until Hannibal, then this book shouldn't disappoint. I have heard a lot of critcism about the ending of the book, which I believe makes so much sense the more you think about it. Dragon and Silence allowed us to see the influence of Hannibal Lecter, so why is the ending so hard to swallow? Is it because it breaks all stereotypes between villan and hero? Who can honestly say that they weren't rooting for Lecter? I think if you really think about Hannibal and Starling, it fits. And none of us saw it coming. Genius."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Gotta take your skull off to Thomas Harris. Rather than play to the Lecter circut, he fashioned a truly creative work with characters already created. He unbalances and challenges readers to confront unsavory and shocking things, by shifting tenses and loyalties.I wholeheartedly recommend this book, though I feel a little gun-shy posting that I have a whole heart...someone out there might be hungry.And didn't the narrator say there were TWO surviving victims of the good doctor..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hopefully you are not reading this review to find out what happens but rather to decide if you want to buy this book. Now that it is in paperback buy it. It is graphic. Hannibal is one sick puppy. The ending is a cop out but read it to judge for yourself. Mr. Harris is a terrific writer. He is extremely graphic. If you get woozy watching those surgery and paramedic shows on tv, do not read this. If you appreciate good writing, evil, psychology and suspense, you will enjoy and appreciate this book. A great summer read (during the day, not the night)!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Or are you in love period? I find no other reason that you'd take this twist unless you were somehow engaged in sublimation. I found nothing implausible in the affection Clarice and Lecter shared, but was shocked that this is where Harris would take the characters. I have read the forward to the re-relased &quot;Red Dragon&quot; where Harris denies responsibility for character development. Stop hiding, Tommy. Lecter got the girl, did you?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Being a huge fan of his earlier work, &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, I was anxiously awaiting the release of &quot;Hannibal&quot;. What a disappointment! 400 pages of build up for one creepy scene and a COMPLETELY unbelievable ending. I still don't understand why Harris thought we would accept his ending as plausible. With all the creative outcomes he could have penned, this ending leaves me feeling totally betrayed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"From the opening page you are brought into the world of Clarice Starling and the deep awe inspiring criminal mind of Hannibal Lecter.Dr. Lecter has a love for the finer things in life. Good food, priceless art, and mind games are only a few of his favorite things. Every page allows you to see more into this criminals mind and his memory palace. You are able to understand more about why Hannibal thinks and acts in the manner that he does.This is a must read for those who are into gripping thrillers dealing with the criminal mind. It is something you do not want to put down, you will always just be wanting to read the next page."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I could not put this book down. Its characters, new and old, relinquished believability To the reader. They played on this penned stage to create a mental picture. Like memories fresh, Lector maneuvers sinisterly like fine Italian marble eased in, But only to construct at its end, some horrific palace. Starling waltz's along with confidence and Independence that is easily wiped away, with five fingers of a magicians hand. Thomas Harris Has written what is classic of the genre."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am a huge fan of Silence of the Lambs and fell in love with the book. However, I was very let down when I began Hannibal. All of the mystery and detail that made Silence of the Lambs what it is was completely abandoned when writing Hannibal. The only shock factor that this book contains is the goriness which does, I have to say, make Silence of the Lambs look like Dr. Seuss. The book was intersting and if you loved Silence of the Lambs it is a must read. However, don't set your standards too high when reading this book if you plan on enjoying it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Nevertheless, this was a very very good read. The last 100 pages will cause you to take an extended lunch period at work.I enjoyed the pace of Mr.Harris' latest day in the life of Mr.Hannibal &quot;Of course it's beef stew&quot; Lector.The ending is going to throw you for a loop. I am anxiously awaiting the movie to see how true Hollywood will remain to the book. I have a strong feeling Mr.Harris has another story to tell."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Although this book was entertaining, it wasn't half as good as Harris's other books. The interestingly evil character in this book is Mason Verger, not Lecter. Lecter is explained away as simply a man doing bad things because of the traumatic loss of his sister. This is all put right though when he settles down with a good woman. Puleeze, what a cop out. Seems like Lecter was just a lonely man looking for domestic bliss and fine food all along. What a silly ending. i can't see why Stephen King gave this book such a good review."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I started reading one night on my living room couch and was hooked. I couldn't put it down until I fell asleep reading it. It's a very good book. I read it and love to read it over when I have the time. It's a great book and you should read it. If you like action or suspense read this and even reccomend it to you if you don't. I just don't reccomend it to children because you might not like it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is an amazing story. Even months after I've finished it, I am still in awe of the way Harris makes the reader have to pick sides between an evil like Hannibal and the other \\"monster\\" in this story. As a note to readers, I got the unabridged audio tape version and found it very powerful. The orator, Daniel Gerroll, does a magnificent job of bringing you into the story."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book certainly does not deserve all of the so so reviews it is getting. This book is slighly different and perhaps dissapointing to some, but that could be because we are all not used to change."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was a very good story. Some points seemed to drag forever, such as the settings in Italy. Others seemed to go by too quick. This book is not as good as Black Sunday, Red Dragon, or The Silence of the Lambs. The characters were very well fleshed out, so you got to know them pretty well, some too well. The fate Mason Verger has for Lecter just seems too much like a Hollywood movie. It is very complicated and seems almost impossible to accomplish in the real world. I know this is a fantasy story, but the good thing about the other Thomas Harris books was that they were based in reality. The biggest thing that bothers me is the ending. I won't give it away, but the characters do not seem like the ones we have come to know in the other books."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Author Harris out Rice's Rice in this preposterous yet irresistible sequel to the book-turned-movie that made fava beans a household name worldwide. Sacrificed by her colleagues to the political ambitions of an FBI &quot;boys club&quot; elite, Starling's eventual embrace of Lecter the fallen angel seems not only plausible, but inevitable. A darkly sensuous romance in the best tradition of Hawthorne and Melville guaranteed to leave many enthralled and others disgruntled."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris has saved his time-consuming research and imagination for his worst performance to date. In order to follow up his best work in &quot;Silence...&quot; he needed to shock us, to surprise us. He failed. &quot;Hannibal&quot; is a perfect example of an author attempting to outdo himself. As sequels often go, this one belongs in your trash."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Finished the book this weekend. Absolutely enjoyed the 'Florence' section; here Harris returns to the descriptive prose that made parts of 'Silence of the Lambs' so enjoyable. The last two sections did a fair job of mixing psychological horror with action. Olfactory fixations ran throughout most characterizations. Obvious twist: all the 'humans' become monsters and Dr. Lecter (the Anti-Romish Monster) becomes the most civilized of the lot. Yawn. But this is where the story begins. Harris abandons the two conventional dimensions of female characterization in this novel (that is; 'damsel in distress' and 'independent Super Woman'), opting for twisted renderings of these forms. Margot Verger, who becomes obsessed with her brother a warped Isis to Mason's even more bizarre Osiris. Harris' Margot and Mason remind the reader to travel their own minds searching for the historical and mythical references to these timely characters, suggesting the universality of horror. The only omnipotence which actually exists and the only truth . Then there is Clarice Starling, a disintegrating woman who becomes the object of erotic fantasy for most charters. Combined with her killer nstinct/action, she becomes the realized Black Widow of Death, finding her Poe-ish role as sensual seductress through the drug and mind venom of the distinguished doctorre, consummating their union at a perverted dinner party where Clarice's nemesis becomes a 'special guest.' But this scene, where Harris combines the elements of the Last Supper with the delicious nuances of 'Babbet's Feast' suggests the total death of Ms. Starling and the resurrection of dear Mischa. The death of a female character never hurt so much, or will be denied by so many. Those poor souls who await the return of the &quot;Bride of Lector-stein' in Book Four have truly missed the point. &quot;Hannibal&quot; recounts the slow, painful death of the faux-heroine, whose bitter demise began seven years on her first meeting of the good doctor. Admittedly, many fans of 'Silence of the Lambs' probably hate the ending. But to find the conclusion of this tale ridiculous is to miss the deep horror of the moment: all of us can succumb to the living death of Clarice. We simply utilize cheap, conventional belief systems in higher powers, political forces or moral platitudes to keep the death within us at bay. And when these conventions fail, some readers will resort to the want of a predicable, happy ending. But there is no deus-en-machina to save us from the dark abyss of madness and death. No pretty ending. Just the fall. And no thump. We are left in free fall, waging a war within the darkness of our own souls. Four stars only for the poor editing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The entirety of &quot;Hannibal&quot; is not as exciting or fascinating as the entirety of his first two Lecter books. However, the ending more than makes up for it. The last fifty pages of the book are a conceptual roller-coaster: if you savored the gut-wrenching joy of having your morality turned upside down that the ending of &quot;Seven&quot; inspired, you'll love this. Lecter is not a monster, he's Neitzsche's Superman, and he uses his transcendence to coax an ordinary mortal into the ranks of Supermortality. Awesome."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Instead of adding to the chorus of those who hate what Harris has done, I have to wonder why he did it. Having read how press and fan-shy he is, I wonder if he doesn't hate the whole &quot;Hannibal the Cannibal&quot; cult of popularity that was created by &quot;Lambs&quot;, and so, decided to destroy the characters. It also seems he came to regret signing a two-book commitment after &quot;Lambs&quot;, and didn't have anywhere logical to go with the characters, so he lurched off into camp, and &quot;healed&quot; them both. I imagine him sitting in the American Hotel in Sag Harbor, laughing, thinking that since he created Lecter and Starling, he can do anything he likes, including ruin them. And ruin the characters he does, with the preposterous ending to this book. The book is a statement that the writer owes nothing to his characters, or to his fans. Loud and clear, Mr. Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"So delicious, so full of subtle flavors, so rich, so satisfying... Reading this book is like a multi-course gourmet meat.Have you ever noticed how people who are used to white bread and margarine do not like real bakery bread and real butter? I suggest that the one-star reviewers of this book are fans of the literary equivalent of airline food, and we all know Dr. Lecter's opinion of the proper fate for rude persons without taste. No wonder they find the book disturbing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Any reader who may have been concerned about Thomas Harris' ability to write a sequel to &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; can relax: &quot;Hannibal&quot; has been well worth the wait. The plot is convoluted and suspenseful, and Mason Verger is a fittingly evil opponent for Dr. Lecter and Clarice Starling. The only problem with the book is that it isn't longer. One can only hope that Jonathan Demme, Jody Foster, and Anthony Hopkins wil be reunited in the inevitable movie version."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The story was entertaining at first, not great, but just bad enough to still be entertaining. There were a few slow parts, but there were also some really good parts. Learning about Hannibal as a boy was interesting, he started to became a much more sympathetic charachter rather than the serial killer. My major gripe was with the last 100 pages. After the climax of the book, you have the biggest let down. I don't think that the ending really involved the same people that the book started off with. I think Starling must have an evil twin that replaced her in the very end, because what happened was totally out of character for her. Maybe she was bonked on the head and didn't remember anything about herself..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"With this novel Thomas Harris completes what only John LeCarre and Martin Cruz Smith had previously accomplished: a modern trilogy of novels in which the protagonists lose even as they win and fail at the moment of their greatest successes. Like LeCarre's George Smiley and Smith's Arkady Renko, Smith's Clarice Starling is a leading character whose inner flaws drive her to success, then cast her down. But unlike Smiley and Renko, who are cast down into heartbreak, HANNIBAL's Starling falls all the way to madness at the climax of this novel.It is perhaps the clearest sign of Harris' courage as an author that some of his readers will be not just disappointed, but enraged by the end of this novel. Those who fling the book away in anger will have missed several of Harris' almost unsung virtues:-No author now writing has Harris' gift for invoking all the reader's senses with the written word. It is perhaps ironic that he uses a madman like Hannibal Lecter to do this most effectively.-No one else (except possibly LeCarre) can expound on subjects ranging from combat tactics to gourmet cooking to art and history without seeming to lecture or to deviate from his story.-And no living writer can hope to equal Harris' understanding of the Appalachian mindset. His images of mountain people, from Starling's kerchief-bound hair in SILENCE to her use of a black-iron skillet as crystal ball in HANNIBAL are alone worth the price of admission.It's been reported that both Jonathan Demme and Anthony Hopkins are refusing to participate in adapting HANNIBAL to film. In a sense, they've made the correct decision; this novel may make an awful movie. It is, however, a brilliant concluding stanza to the Hannibal Lecter trilogy."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is not merely a bad book, this book is so bad that it left me angry and wanting my money back. I could almost accept a book that had a disjointed narrative that spends too much time with weird uninteresting characters, a villain that is more disgusting than disturbing, and a silly side trip to Italy which feels like it was thrown into the book to so the author could write off a trip to Italy as a business expense. Those things I could accept. But an utterly illogical ending that betrays everything the Silence of the Lambs was about -- this I can not accept. This book is puke."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If this book were sweetbreads, I would not serve it with fava beans and a nice chianti, instead, I'd serve it with malt liquor and cheeze whiz. I have read every Harris book multiple times and he is one of my favorite authors, but honest to god, this book reads like a boring travelogue for the most part, builds to a climax which never happens and instead meanders off into an utterly incomprehensible, unexplained, illogical, undeserved ending. If you must read this book, STEAL IT or go to the library. Give your money to charity or flush it down the toilet, but don't encourage this kind of self-indulgent crap. No wonder Jonathan Demme walked off of this project."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A lot has been posted by many disappointed readers regarding the book (mainly the ending). These people are way off the mark. This book does not play it safe. If you are a fan of this genre, you will absolutely enjoy this book. Chapter 9 of this novel has to be the most hoffifying thing I have ever read. The ending is definitely justified, giving us on of the darkest &quot;happy&quot; endings I think I have ever had the pleasure of reading."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As said expected more in-depth and more exciting, however it is the same thing as the past ( well what do you expect it is a sequel ) but hello ! the reader is more anxious. Till half way down the road the reader is still guessing and gives the impression as the Lecter guy never appears and just keeps on describing Clarice and her life history, and also praises Dr. Lecter as if he is Godfather or what. It is surely made good for a commercial success for the hollywood thing but as far as the book is concerned it is okay, written with the perspective of making a movie ( probably )."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It cannot be overstated what a disappointment this book is! Harris abandons the masterful, nigh-unbearable it-could-really-happen tension of his previous books and just goes off the cartoonish deep end here. The Italy section is very good, but the rest of the book is just preposterous and insulting."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm not an avid book reader, but when I saw &quot;Hannibal&quot;, the sequel to &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, I knew I had to get it. This is a great novel from beginning to end. I recommend this book to anyone. I just finished it and I want to read it again. Thomas Harris has done it again with a terrific masterpiece, I just hope his next book doesn't take so long to come out as &quot;Hannibal&quot; did!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This was a thrilling book. I found that although the end is probably not what most readers would want or expect, I was gratified by the twists and turns of the second half. I feel Red Dragon was a better book and was my favorite, but this one will remain as one of the better horror,psychological fiction of all time. Dr. Lecter would be pleased, no doubt."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Ending is just like getting the rug pulled out from under you. Why bother to build characters one can identify with if you are going to do what this book has done at the end? Starling is not Starling. Jack Crawford was utterly wasted -- why not just leave him out entirely?Harris spends a lot of effort trying to make Mason Verger an evil man and Lecter more or less a hero. I felt manipulated and did not buy it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The publication of &quot;A Man In Full,&quot; led to a rather puerile debate among some elites about whether or not the book was merely pulp fiction or literature. No doubt Harris' eagerly awaited publication of &quot;Hannibal&quot; will lead to similar discussion. The depth of this work is well hidden by the fact that it is an extraordinarily easy read, and a great thriller. Beyond the pulp is a journey into Rennaisance Italy, the theories of Stephen Hawking, the nature of good and evil, and ultimately the meaning of intimacy and love.To see this as a mere sequel to a best selling book and mivie is to miss the point entirely, although I would hardly mind Jody foster and Anthony Hopkins doing a reprise."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am a big fan of the saga of Hannibal Lector. I think Hannibal was a pretty good follow up to &quot;Silence of the lambs&quot;, although as many readers have stated, a little far fetched. (even for Harris) but i think thats what fiction is all about. I am truly dissapointed that Jodie is not going to do the sequel. The book is gory in details and entertaining in plot."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris' real strength shines through in this book, namely his believable characterization of evil (or insanity.. you decide). As with &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, he presents a very unflinching view of the twisted and warped corners of a killer's psyche. In this novel, Lecter appears more than ever as an antihero rather than as a villain, and is a good read for those interested in suspense novels with an intelligent bent. This is true horror, without the supernatural nonsense that pervades most of the genre."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Contrary to some other reviewers' reactions, I think this book is excellent and I enjoyed it very much--although &quot;enjoyed&quot; is an odd word for a book that leaves you with images you wish you could forget. Harris spares us little horror here. Many reviewers have said they were disappointed with the ending, but I thought the ending was very gratifying and made complete sense. This is not Patricia Cornwell, this is Thomas Harris. Readers who prefer surface characterizations and slick, abrupt resolutions should probably look elsewhere. If you were fascinated by Clarice and Hannibal in Silence of the Lambs, you should read this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have waited many years for another novel by Mr. Harris and was surprised to see that Hannibal arrived. I reserved a copy before its release and waited until I had a weekend to devout myself to this book. I had devoured red dragon, silence of the lambs, and thought that this would be just as delicious. Was I wrong! The book is disjointed, poorly edited and disgusting. The intelligence of Hannibal Lecter depicted in Silence of the Lambs and implied in Red Dragon, appears brilliantly in the first half of the novel but then disintegrates like the rest of the novel into trash and very poor character development. I would not be suprised if the first part had been written years before the second part. Agent Starling has changed dramaticaly, not matured but contradicts her established ethical and moral pattern. Mr. Harris owes his fans an apology."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I don't often have a lot of time to read a lot of books. When I first saw the book, I thought the book had too many pages but when I started reading it, I could not put it down. I continually looked forward to seeing what was going to happen next. What I liked about this book is that you did not have to read or see Silence of The Lambs to understand what was going on. The author did a wonderful job of going back over the important points from the first book before continuing with his story. This book used very good description and detail to give the reader the ability to visualize what was going on. It made you feel like you were part of the story, on the outside watching all that happened, afraid for the characters in the story. The description and dialogue that the author used reached out and grabbed you, taking you into the story. I would recommend this book to anyone that loves a little mystery and fright. The author throws in a suprise ending that makes you wonder what he will come up with for the third book!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What a disappointment....after reading The Silence of The Lambs I expected so much more. Hannibal hardly held my interest for longer than 30 minutes at a time. Where is the mystery? These two characters came together so wonderfully in SILENCE and created such an intriguing relationship. One could have only anticipated the same for the sequel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It was with much anticipation that I began reading the long awaited, sequel to &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;. Despite the fact that the book held my interest, I couldn't help but feel cheated. Harris created a strong heroine with the character of Clarice Starling in &quot;Silence...&quot; I was excited to read how she was going to catch Lecter the second time around. The plot was only thickened with the addition of another sinister character named &quot;Mason Verger&quot; out to exact his revenge using Starling as bait. Although the book was well written, one thing I just couldn't get past was the fact that the writer didn't remain true to the character of Clarice Starling. She is not the same character we came to know in the first book at all. It is always nice to have plot twists,and have a character react in way that you would not have anticipated, but it really felt as though Starling didn't belong in this book at all. Perhaps Harris felt pressure to bring all the same characters back for that big Hollywood sequel. I don't know. As a reader, and a fan, I felt cheated. This Clarice Starling should have been left out of the book. I just hope that when the movie sequel to &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; is made, the screenwriter does Starling justice, and doesn't betray her character the way Harris did in this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I started reading Harris' books over the summer. It took me 3 months to finish this one. Talk about a boring read! The ending was horrible! What did he do- get bored with writing and decided to come up with a quick fix to end it?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Not to bore the average readers of these reviews but I can sum up this work in a paragraph or two.Imagine this: You see a nice brochure of a vacation rental in Florida. You pick it up, and immediately are caught up in photos of white sandy beaches and beach front condos. You rush home and plan your trip and count the days until you go. Everything is wonderful, beautiful weather, on-time flights, and even the airline food tastes outstanding. Yet, upon arrival you find nothing more than tents on stilts behind a row of condos blocking your view of the beach. You then realize the picture was taken in front of the condos and you have now been taken!This book is the same as that brochure; true it has it's moments and some of the plot developement has potential, but agent Starling as a Cannibal? Come, come now my dear Mr. Harris, have you had too many juniper berries with your sweet breads?I thoughly enjoyed the first book as well as the movie. Alas, my wait for this book and possible movie has been spoiled!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"True to expectation, &quot;Hannibal,&quot; the sequel to Thomas Harris' landmark thriller &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot; doesn't fail to provoke a strong reaction from its reader. Positive or negative, the verdict (as with most sequels) often depends on the reader's opinion of the first novel and the inevitable differences between the two. With Harris' latest novel, there is good reason. Here, the streamlined nature of &quot;Silence&quot; is little more than a memory, with the all encompassing focus on Agent Clarice Starling now shifted to spotlight an entire cast of expertly fleshed-out characters. True to form, Clarice *is* looking for her old friend, Hannibal Lecter. As is Lecter's former patient, Mason Verger. As is Verger's sister, Margot. As is Clarice's Bureau superior, Paul Krendler. All with their own stake in recovering the notorious doctor who, apart from evading his merry band of pursuers, is keeping his own eyes peeled for Clarice.A thudding lack of Starling/Lecter interaction halfway through the novel is superceded by a more subtle form of communication as the two use the knowledge they have acquired in their previous encounters to track each other's movements across state and continent, with the occasional interruption in the shadowed form of Verger or Krendler. Each member of this incomparable triumvirate spends much of the novel grappling for the dominant role in the pursuit and ultimate capture of Lecter, unaware of the plans the doctor has for all three of them. Harris' fluid description of the individual motives of each character creates an intricate construction that, along with both a heightened sense of gore and a dulled amount of suspense, forms a heavier, more contemplative read that is neither superior, nor inferior to its predecessor."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. When I finished, I said to my husband, &quot;That's what happens when you write for money.&quot; I enjoyed Harris' previous novels, and even considered them well-written. This novel is not well-written, lacks character continuity, and was very much a waste of my time. I do not believe you should encourage this author to write more material, and I believe this will make one quite awful movie. You have been warned."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was expecting a good plot, characters you cared about, pulse-pounding suspense. NOT! It seems to me that Mr. Harris is simply playing on the popularity of Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter to publish another book that is egregiously gory and sickening without being shocking. You become uncomfortably immune to such vicious bloodletting and eventually feel entire sequences are there just to fill up pages. Lecter has always been scary but now he is preternaturally superhuman and pretentious. Minute details of esoteric culinary taste vie with underdetailed action scenes lacking enough lucid information to describe and create memorable pictures. Lecter's previous mind-games helped develop the horror of his character; here they seem pedantic and pompous -- and, worst sin of all, boring. The plot is simple, without suspense, because Lecter will always get away with it, big surprise. The climax to the story is next to non-existent and the denouement a definitive letdown. It's cheap. Thomas Harris has probably made a bundle of money with this best-seller -- the pity is that it came at the expense of fans of RED DRAGON and SILENCE OF THE LAMB, who expected and deserved more."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This sequel had everything a Thomas Harris reader would want. I was impressed by the depth which Harris expressed Hannibal. I couldn't believe the way the book ended. I had to reread it again. Although I really enjoyed it, I can't see it ending the same way when Hollywood makes the movie. It is worth reading for yourself."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"a page turner! excellent! as someone familiar w/psychological profiling, i find that harris's understanding of the criminal mind is exact and profound!dr. lecter's memory palace was an incredible place to visit...but i won't be eating pork - or any meat product for that matter - anytime soon.the end of the book sets the stage for yet another harris book ...something's bound to bring the real clarice back...kudos to harris - it was worth the wait!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is suspenseful, well-written and hard to put down. Hannibal is not the only &quot;monster&quot; in this book--I was more afraid of those who had it in for him. And the knowledge Harris provides of what lies in store for Hannibal made it all the more compelling to read on. I have reservations about the plausibility of the ending, but it did make for a rather &quot;tasty&quot; finale. Overall the book was heavy on the gore, but it is the first of Harris's books in which Lecter is on the prowl, and thus our first real glimpse of his predatory behavior unleashed. I read Hannibal every spare moment I could . . . just try not to do it before you go to sleep."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If you enjoyed Red Dragon or SOTL, do yourself a favor and DON'T READ THIS BOOK. I don't think I will ever be able to watch the Silence of the Lambs again. The characters are just ruined in my mind. What a waste.I was going to loan it out when I was done but now I am more inclined to burn it to keep it from ruining anybody else's memories of Starling and Lechter.This was the worst reading experience I have ever had. The ending was just flat out terrible. There is no way around it.I can see why everyone is fleeing from the possible movie.I think Hannibal must have eaten Thomas Harris' brain."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"For years many readers have awaited this book and most of us rushed out to purchase it the second it hit the bookshelves and most of those readers have been somewhat disenchanted.While the plot still holds some twists and turns it could not stand up to Harris' two previous Hannibal books. It seemed as though Harris did not really know what to do with Lecter this time around. The other two books were intricately woven stories this book seemed to be more of a psychological profile of Hannibal - Starling is not really a central character and Mason Verger who was touted to be even more frightening than Lecter was at total disappointment.Harris seems to confuse thriller with sheer violence in Hannibal. Readers do not get that intense, edge of your seat, check to make sure the doors are all locked fear - instead they find a bland story line with more grotesque than gory.While I still found this book to be enjoyable I was not quite sure if the real disappointment was from the anticipation that the long lag between books created or because the book seemed so unimaginative in comparison with Harris' other Hannibal works.Read this book but don't go in with expectations based on Harris' two previous Hannibal works - you will be disappointed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm glad I didn't buy this book, but got it from the library. If I had bought it I would have felt like I wasted a lot of money. I thought the book was okay until the ending. But the ending isn't what you would expect and really made the book a waste of time."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In the years since I have read Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon I have hoped that Harris would deliver a sequel (or call it what you will) in which we find out everything we want to know about Hannibal Lecter.. what makes him tick? Why does he do what he does, what will become of his relationship with Clarice? I am deeply satisfied with the conclusion of this book, which I found to be thought-provoking and will probably continue to be, for me, long after Hollywood turns it into a catch-the-bad-guy thriller.My only complaint with Hannibal lies in Harris's inconsistent switching from past to present tense, and back again. Also, while it is plainly evident that Harris has done his research, I find the extent of detail provided to be at times unwarranted and discursive."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Clarice Starling (aka Jodie Foster) wouldn't do it! I liked the book and feverishly &quot;ate&quot; through it, but I was extremely disappointed with the ending. I believe it is better written than the first, but that Mr. Harris was at a loss as to how to finish it, and it shows. The Silence of the Lambs was frightening, Red Dragon was absolutely terrifying, Hannibal was not. It turned into a silly, unbelievable &quot;love&quot; story that is more sickening than the gruelish crimes committed in the novel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"None of the deaths in this book come as a surprise - bad guys lose, good guys more or less win - thought the method of the killings shows a lot of thought and imagination.Even the end, which is unsatisfying and unbelieveable, was not a surprise - I began to dread it half-way through - it seemed the only way out for Starling and Hannibal. But it doesn't wash, and certainly doesn't satsify. When we read a book, we are looking for entertainment but also for something related to our lives and our world, however remotely, and Hannibal's conclusion is from some dimension so amoral that it fails to connect in any way."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was terribly disappointed in this book. I loved both Red Dragon and Silence, and this was such a let down. The entire plot was ridiculous, and the ending, well, that was beyond silly. In addition, I just didn't get into any of the characters - Starling was too much of a patsy, Lecter was boring, and Verger, although he did have the makings of a good character, was just too over the top. Either Harris felt pressured to write a sequel that he really didn't want to write, or he was just darn lucky on his first two attempts. I think that most Silence fans will be incredibly disappointed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I agree with other reviewers that this book does drag on a bit in the beginning (Italy), but once it gets going, it doesn't stop! It is an excellent book, putting aside the fact that it is far-fetched. I couldn't put it down. The ending will positively blow your mind! I can hardly wait for the movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It's not No. 1 on my all-time worst book list because I have read Anne Rivers Siddons' &quot;Peachtree Road&quot; and Alexadra Ripley's &quot;Scarlet&quot;. I was extremely disappointed in this &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; sequel. The author has turned the fabulous Clarice Starling into a buffoon, and it goes downhill from there."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I disagree about Hannibal's ending, I loved it! the first two thirds of the book were so excruiatingly boring though, that I can't recomend it to anyone. Read Silence of The Lambs and Red Dragon instead!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book starts off great. Harris does everything but the predicatble in this story. The story starts seven years after Starling's apprehension of Buffalo Bill, and you may be surprised to learn that her career in the FBI has been less than stellar.Everyone in the book is searching for Hannibal, the FBI, Starling, and a former victim of Lecture. The beginning of the book is beautifully written. Some of the description of the characters and the locations (especially Florence) are breath-taking.The ending of the story is entirely unbelievable and disappointing. I would have a better time believing in the tooth fairy."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I did not buy the reason why he was this why or the ending. dissappointing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is the first book in the trilogy that I read. It is by far my favorite. I love the Italian bits! I could not put the book down. I love the ending but then I love to cook and always wanted to visit South America. I then read the other two in sequence and though I enjoyed both, especially Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal is still tops!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Several subplots blur the true story of Hannibals continous run from the FBI and his interest in Clarice Starling. The ending did not seem to leave much room for another Hannibal novel."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The only reason I'm giving this book two stars instead of one is that I was able to finish it, which I suppose counts for something. But I'm really begrudging Harris that star, because this book was simply awful. It's difficult even to begin describing what's wrong with this book, there are so many things. First of all, the writing is clumsy and pedestrian. Second of all, the characters and dialogue are wooden and ridiculous. The &quot;explanation&quot; for why Lector is the way he is, is sentimental kitsch. Harris has turned Lector from a credible anti-hero to some sort of ridiculous combination of Superman and Thurston Howell III. I particularly like the part where the scholars are &quot;wowed&quot; by Lector's ridiculous lecture about Dante, which shows less scholarship than the introduction for a cheap paperback edition of the Inferno. Really the biggest reason to read this book is if you have a healthy taste for the absurd and you like to pick apart bad writing. My advice is to read Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs and steer clear of this stinker! It will destroy any respect you might have had for Harris! (By the way, Martin Amis wrote a wonderfully scathing review of this book in the premiere edition of Talk - I'm glad I had read Hannibal simply so I could fully savor Amis's attack.)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Indeed this book has a blazing pace and is hard to put down. I find some of the graphic detail related to the crimes a bit far-fetched, especially the very last crime, but as Harris was a crime reporter, I assume the depiction is real.On the other hand, the research related to things Italian is remarkable in its precision.The most controversial part of this book is its ending. It will certainly give you food for thought (hehe, once you read the ending you will realize that the pun was intended).The more I think about it the more I believe that the ending has a large swab of realism tinged with a bit of Ionesco's theater of the absurd. The combination is refreshing.As for Lector himself, we are reminded of his insanity by his deeds alone, and not by the inner sanctum of the mind that Harris treats us to. Eccentric yes, but not patently insane by the thoughts we are given.Anyone looking for a riveting thriller should put Hannibal on the list of good reads, especially if you are planning a long (trans-oceanic) airplane ride and have burned out on hardly audible in-flight movies."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I couldn't wait to dive into this book- the first &quot;fun&quot; novel I've read in a while. I had no fun reading it- the change in location after a decent start was disappointing (thought it had one or two good moments, and transitioned back well enough,if predictably) but the story line as it included Clarice was lame, and depicted her as a very one-dimensional character. I found Hannibal's background interesting,and I would have prefered to know a lot more about him. He doesn't have to do anything to be interesting, he just is. This book is not."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It was with great anticipation that I poured through Hannibal when it came out. Quite a page turner, the further exploits of the doctor take precedence over the secondary agent Starling for much of the novel. Mason, while repugnant does not provide a suitable foe for the good doctor. The doctor's culture and genius are given free reign and explored passably within the setting of Italy. Harris obviously was taken w/ the locale. Painted as an almost sympathetic figure, the reader is apparently encouraged to sublimate his brutality towards non-combatants in earlier novels. His insanity is also downplayed as we are given a glimpse into his inner dialogue which to him is perfectly sane and modulated. That was a bit different from the earlier novels and could throw people in that we, as readers, are brought into his world and spheres of understanding. The bizarre is mundane, the insane, sane. Agent Starling eventually re-enters the scene and, perhaps too quickly for some, in the end, is swept up in the whirlwind of Hannibal's delights. I had to digest the ending for a while after finishing the book. However in time it became clearer, that this was the ultimate bizarre ending to the journey started. More meandering and verbose than the earlier novels, I still enjoyed it and would recommend it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"God forbid that a young, struggling author should criticise someone as established and successful as Thomas Harris, but the truth is I feel obligated to do it anyhow. If the rumours of Jodie Foster's withdrawl from the third &quot;Lecter&quot; movie are true, then I can hardly blame her. Clarice Starling is not the same character as she was, she's lost a great deal of vigour and determination that helped her catch Lecter in the first place.Hannibal's plot is decent for the first three quarters, by ignoring the confusing Italian terms and language that Harris uses, the reader can make sufficient sense about what's happening. From then on though, the whole book changes into something as abstract as one of the art gallery pictures Harris tries to describe. Flashes of violence never live up to the imagination of the first two books, the characters become shadows of their former selves and I, as a reader was left with a heavy sense of disappointment for a book I'd been waiting months to read. I'm not saying it's a bad book, just a let down from &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Silence Of The Lambs&quot;. You'll have to make your own judgement but if you're expecting the power of the other two books, you'll be disapointed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was both repulsed and horrified by this book. Harris manages to completely destroy the only sympathetic character, which of course was Starling, and by the finale all we are left with is monsters. I have read it once, I am not glad to have read it, and I never intend to read it again. But despite- no, because of all that, the author did what he had intended, to examine the minds of killers and set the moralities we cherish on their ears. Hannibal is not a comfortable read, and I would not reccomend it to anyone with a weak stomach, but in its own way, it is a work of art."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"My all time favorite movie is Silence of the Lambs. Just recently I finished reading the Red Dragon his first book that introduces Dr. Lecter and the book was really good. However after buying this book I was really disappionted! I found the book to be really boring.. It had too many chapters on Italy that was really hard to follow unless you speak the language or have been there. I didn't like the fact that Clarice was hardly in the book and when she was it was a joke.(no wonder Jodie Foster doesn't want to do this movie). I'm sorry Thomas Harris but I don't reccomend this book for anyone."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Just finished reading &quot;Hannibal&quot;--Cannot believe the ending. There is only one person to play Hannibal in the movie version. I'm only hoping Mr. Hopkins decides to take the part again. Here's hoping Jodie Foster will join him. But who will play &quot;Mason Verger?&quot;! What a character."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This was a great read! I wish that Mr. Harris, in the method of Stephen King, would put out one or two novels a year. H ehas definately left the door open for another book, but maybe its time to develope something new for all the avid Harris fans."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"For someone who puts out a book every 5 years or so, you would think he'd have enough time to perfect it. However, this book was horrible. The end made me feel like licking sandpaper. Hannibal - an utterly brutal and morbid serial killer - is seen as the poor hunted and misunderstood hero in parts. Whereas Clarice - a no nonsense logical symbol of justice - is reduced to a sick and twisted lost soul. What vile perverseness!I can see Hopkins doing the movie...but they'll have to pay Foster a pile of millions (and they probably will) to portray that witch Clarice."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The novel is masterfully written and I had a tough time putting it down for the night. However, I don't know if I like what the author did with Lecter. This time, the doctor has been made almost sympathetic. It's disturbing when one is rooting for a serial killer. Also, I don't know if I liked what happened to the two protagonists. With all that said, the novel was provocative, engaging and unforgettable. I may even read it again."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I've read a number of reviewer's comments on HANNIBAL, and I noticed a good deal of outrage at the absence of Clarice Starling (in the middle of the novel), and what becomes of her at the end. In my opinion, hard-boiled fans of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS missed the whole point of this book. It's not a reprisal of the mystifying Starling/Lecter relationship from LAMBS--that's been done. This book is exactly what the title promises--a whirlwind tour following Hannibal Lecter himself through Italy and the United States. This book offers insight into the madman himself, and I couldn't get enough of it.As I read HANNIBAL, a peculiar thing happened. I've always found myself fascinated with the gentleman/genius serial killer in a horrified sort of way. Who wouldn't be? We're shocked by serial killers, but constantly drawn to the gory details of their lives and activities. We're hungry for the gruesome. (Pun sort of intended.) But with HANNIBAL, I actually found myself cheering for the quintessential &quot;bad guy,&quot; because this book makes you realize that there are worse monsters in the world. In HANNIBAL, they come in the form of Mason Verger, a wealthy livestock magnate whose sexual tastes run toward little children, and whom Lecter has left without a face, wheezing on a respirator; and a team of corrupt Italian &quot;hit men&quot; Verger has recruited to capture Lecter...with a huge bounty.From a writer's perspective, Thomas Harris handles this book with the literary precision of a master. His deft turns through various points of view--including an eerie and effective second person narrative that involves US, the readers, directly with the scene--is nothing short of genius.If you loved SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and you're looking for more of the same, you may be disappointed with HANNIBAL. The middle of the book abandons Clarice Starling and the FBI to take us to Italy, where a corrupt Italian police officer pursues Lecter like a bounty hunter. But if you begin this book without an agenda, and let Thomas Harris weave his magic inside your head, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Silence of the Lambs was about what Conrad called &quot;the fascination of the abomination.&quot; I loved it because Hannibal Lecter seemed about as close as one could get to pure evil, and as such, was ultimately one-dimensional. The conflict between Clairce and Hannibal was formula-- some of the best formula ever produced, but still just a simple battle between good and evil. Unfortunately, things aren't ever that simple in our world, as Harris demonstrates in Hannibal, moving from the realm of formula into the realm of literature. In Hannibal, Claire and Hannibal become real characters that challenge the way we look at good and evil. Among all the characters in the novel, only the one that seems most evil can give Clarice the moral absolutes she's seeking-- that's why the ending is believable, and very highly disturbing. It's scary that a man could do such evil things out of love, or that one could love a man who does such evil things. Read it, definitely, but prepare to have your view of the world challenged-- not a comfortable thing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I completely understand most people's disappointment with this book, yet do not hold sympathy for their lack of understanding. America serves as a nation of expectations; people have grown to expect Hollywood love stories that follow a certain formula. Or, if it's a horror story, or comedy, etc., there must be something tangible to grab onto. This book floats above that plane, surreal and classic in the same breath. Harris's language is exquisite, his details immaculate. It is refreshing to see a writer take his time with a novel, putting intense effort into understanding the true nature of his characters. Lecter's mind rooms were amazingly intriguing, and the conclusions reached unmatched. It is one of the few attempts in recent literature at seriously looking into the oppression of women in the twentieth century in an intelligent and artistic fashion. His dialogues between characters were both amusing and biting, and their development left you unaware of who you're really rooting for. This book will be considered a classic of American literature in another century; it's only unfortunate that so many now refuse to take the time and effort in understanding why that is."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book resembles one of those shock movies whose entertainment &quot;value&quot; lies not in its storytelling (plot, characterization, etc.) but in its capacity to elicit gasps and winces from the audience. Apparently, Harris decided that the only way to top the high expectations readers have for this book is to head the story to an ending so obscene that it leaves the reader's mouth agape. The memories of cherished characters are demolished. The fate which befalls Clarisse is execrable. True, these are only characters in a novel. But one should expect Harris to deal with them with dignity, and not as puppets manipulated with prurient interests."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"That's the only way I can describe this book. I read both this and Silence of the Lambs together (both for the first time), and the differences between the two are incredible. Lambs was a taut psychological thriller, while Hannibal was a treatment for the planned movie (gee, wouldn't that murder look good on the screen? Heck yes, so put it in!) The plot is sensational to the point of camp (Lecter in a death trap! ), coincedences abound, and some areas of the book just don't hold together.Bringing Lecter to the forefront was a mistake: characters this fascinating retain their fascination for us in small doses, but by the time we're through we've seen so much of Lecter we even know why he's insane, removing much of the mystery surrounding him. A fascinating creation becomes just another psychopathic killer, and that's a shame.Additionally, what happens to Clarice Starling by the end of the book is dishartening and inappropriate as well (I can't get into details without breaking the &quot;no spoilers&quot; rule), but the fact that she seems to be happy with what's happened to her is totally against the strong, able character Harris created. I know that evil does win in the real world, but this was over the top. I hope that, in fewer than 10 years, Harris can work to straighten out the mess he's created with this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I don't know if Thomas Harris was aiming for the funnybone or not when he wrote Hannibal but he had me rolling on the floor! It's refreshing to read an author who doesn't take himself or his characters too seriously. Hannibal &quot;The Cannibal&quot; Lecter has become such a part of our culture (is there anyone who doesn't recognize the name?) what else could Harris do with him but take him over the top? Hannibal's &quot;dinner party&quot; scene near the end is a perfect example -- could any serious-minded author have written that? Whether you were a fan of Silence of the Lambs or not you must read Hannibal if only to find out why Jodi Foster refused to play the part of Clarice in the upcoming movie (I don't think you'll blame her!). If nothing else, you'll get a good laugh."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I recently bought this book while on vacation in Thailand. Being a big fan of Silence of the Lambs (both the book and the excellent movie) I was looking forward to reading this but hadn't gotten around to it until now. In general this book is outstanding, it starts off with a bang and then doesn't let up for nearly the entire book. The character developments are outstanding and for the first time we are allowed to see a bit of Lecter's background and understand a little of what made him the monster that he is. The book itself focuses less on Starling and more on the other characters that make up this complex tale. However, the last twenty pages of the book are unacceptable. It is as if Harris suddenly woke up one day and said &quot;that's enough writing, let's finish this thing today&quot;. Starling's character changes 100% at that point in the book and these changes are so profound and unbelievable that I feel Harris has done a great misjustice to the character and the readers. I can fully understand why Jodie Foster refused to take up the role again for the upcoming movie version. Those last twenty pages are totally disjoined from the rest of the novel and it left a very bad taste in my mouth after having read such a great story up to that point with anticipation of a fantasic ending. Stunning? Yes. Fantastic? Far from it, in my humble opinion."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is not a sequel to &quot;Silence,&quot; it is a crude joke. He's taken Starling and regressed her instead of building on her character. She speaks in Catskill twang through most of the book. Lecter is now one of these bad guys who only kills really bad people, or people trying to steal his wallet. Or people trying to catch him. Whatever happened to devouring census takers? He's not truly bad, now, in fact, the reader gets a cuddly personal history of Lecter which explains why he became so bad, darnit! It wasn't his fault! Some bad guys did bad things, and made Lecter bad! Mommy! I'm bad now! A misfire on every conceivable level, staring with the first chapter. So disappointing...so sad. Lecter is almost superhuman, does this guy work out or what? The ending will leave your mouth agape. Agape at the horror of what Harris could have been possibly thinking when he scribbled this missive on paper. Abominable"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was so implausible it wasn't even witty. Auto-cannibalism, man-eating pigs...and the &quot;Nazis ate my sister&quot; bit just wasn't enough to turn Hannibal into a romantic hero. And that ending! Did Starling sustain massive head trauma at some point? I did not find it believable that Clarice, our scion of law and order, would ever run away with a mass murderer. But God forbid that a strong woman not be knocked down into her place. Still, couldn't Harris have contented himself with trivializing her character by refering to her looks every time she was mentioned? This book left me with the feeling that Tom Harris toyed with his readers as skillfully as Lecter ever did."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Tired and obvious biblical allusions (such as references to the Gadarene Swine and of Satan's progress across the earth) follow a contrived and underdeveloped plot to a conclusion of monumentally stupid proportions. With characters thin as pages torn from a placing by the Gideons, Mr Harris attempts to weave some kind of allegory or parable, detailing the genuine horror of our world (and it's history) whilst raiding the coffins of far better writers to achieve his effect.The novel concerns itself with the sadistic machinations of Mason Verger, one of Lecter's horrifically mutilated victims. Verger is a wealthy paedophile who mixes children's tears with his drinks and would like nothing better than to feed Dr Lecter to some pigs (no, I'm not joking, he actually wants to do this). Verger orchestrates an elaborate scheme to recapture the doctor, using the FBI, crooked politicians and, yes, you guessed it, Clarice Starling herself (however unwittingly). This leads to several hundred pages of correctly spelled words, a few minor atrocities, absolutely no tension whatsoever and a d&eacute;nouement that ranks amongst the most idiotic ever conceived by a writer of supposed merit. Along the way we are treated to a few minor characters from 'Silence of the Lambs' now occupying more substantial roles, while not (it seems) having undergone any form of substantial characterisation in the process. They play like puppets with no independence or purpose of their own, other than to provide Harris with convenient links for his plot.Underpinning the book are several noticeable themes, none of which, unfortunately, achieve more than the other shoddy components that go toward making it up. Here we find Harris bemoaning the superficial and unintelligent blandness of modern society (yawn), attacking the gutter press (yawn, yawn), shaking his fist at the corpse of God (somebody get me some coffee) and turning to the classics for aid and sustenance (help me, I think I've died...). It's all predictable and we've read it all before, most annoyingly in Harris' own books. He simply repeats himself and repeats himself, and it does provoke nausea. It also does nothing to aid the ridiculous and strained conclusion of the novel (no matter how clever Harris may believe himself to be, modelling it, as he does, on Beauty and the Beast as it might be retold by someone of Clive Barker's ilk).At best 'Hannibal' reads like a thinly fleshed-out screenplay, at worst like the notes and structure for a book yet to be written. This is what happens when research into the more obvious themes of Dante, basic FBI procedure and the colour of certain hospital walls attempts to pass itself off as 'depth'. Mr Harris should have stuck to what he knows best - churning out thrillers with modest literary pretensions. As it is he has tried to be far too clever and the results are a shambles, an embarrassment and a sad waste of everybody's time. Still, he got paid a lot for it, which says far more about society than his novel ever could.Avoid this book at all costs."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is very good. It is spooky and not very happy but it is a very good read . I don't think that there is ever going to be a movie made out of it. it is just to off the wass"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I picked up this book at 8 p.m. and finished it in one sitting by 2 a.m. Then I stayed up two MORE hours to cross reference foreshadowing, plotlines, and characterizations. It's tight as a drum with one very minor exception, and by the last few chapters you'll be RACING. Although there's a little too much referencing to his previous book for my taste, he reintroduces some past characters deftly and creates unforgettable and disturbing images, building to a conclusion that is chilling, yet oddly heartwarming. The development of Lecter's attitude towards Clarisse, the introduction of a new brand of evil in his already broad portfolio, the evolution of Clarisse's character and her attitude towards her career - it's all imaginatively conceived and brilliantly executed, after a start that was just a little tedious for all its action...but Harris more than makes up for it at the end, and you'll wonder - who really won, after all?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The Red Dragon surpasses Hannibal in every way possible. However I do not wish detract from Hannibal, I dont think Harris could ever out do The Red Dragon. Many times I wish an author would stop after one great book. However, Harris makes me reconsider this theory as Hannibal is a very well written work. Not quite as great as Red Dragon but it is worth a read. Just dont read it by yourself."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A quarter of this book is Thomas Harris' homage to Florence, Italy, with Hannibal Lecter moving like a prop through the sights. Also uncharacteristic of Harris is excessive backstory from &quot;Lambs.&quot; But once Starling, Lecter, and Mason Verger (thanks to the doctor, the world's uglest man) get it on, &quot;Hannibal&quot; rushes like a spinning boat in white water to the climatic chapter. And just when I thought the ride was over, Harris put in a finish that left me shaken. Keep a dictionary handy -- almost every page has an abstruse word."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Yes, I've just finished it, moments ago. I can say that I have that indescibeable feeling of dichotomy that leaves me reeling with reflection. Tempted to go back and review whole chapters and scour them for missed tidbits like an eel scouring coral for food. What I most want to do is let this simmer. Especially the ending. This I must replay and see if I can find the mind-set to decipher the intricacies unwoven in so few pages. That and to hope for a Thomas Harris cookbook and wine companion.Thomas Harris has again given us a truly thought provoking and fun adventure. He gives us what we want although we may not want to admit it. Our favorites are back in the form of Clarice and Hannibal, but also some new (and scarier?) players. The book reads without any tedious set ups and there are no &quot;empty&quot; chapters in between. While some may say that the depictions of violence are overly explicit, I say that words on a page are best interpreted by the reader.I hope we don't have to wait this long for his next novel, then again, this one was worth it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After steamrolling through this book as soon as I got it in the mail, all I can say is &quot;Why?&quot; Thomas Harris crafted some truly awesome novels in Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs. He's very cinematic in his writing...but now he's just got the meat cleaver out. Yecch. Unfortunately, the USA Toady review sounds like this, although I will say that their review was all political correctness and nonsense. Get off the soapbox - just review the book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The first 2/3rds of 'Hannibal' are a fine show of what Harris does best. Crackling set pieces and a superb chronicle of law enforcement's people and mechanisms. Harris is also cunningly adept at evoking events and places with seemingly effortless sensory details. An utter page-turner, 'Hannibal' kept me riveted for 300 pages. Then the shift turned more to Harris' new villian, and I found myself less and less able to suspend disbelief. The ending, while amazing and provocative, is pure fantasy. The previous entries in the Lechter trilogy stuck to my ribs by being both beautifully shocking and utterly believable. Sharing the same universe, 'Hannibal' eventually falls short on both counts."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The constant changes in voice and tense are jarring, and make the book read more like a screenplay than a novel, especially in the last chapter. Harris is not true to his characters as previously established in &lt;i&gt;Red Dragon&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Silence of the Lambs&lt;/i&gt;. Hannibal becomes the protagonist in this offering, and despite the author's attempts to make the character sympathetic, all he does is cheapen one of the most amoral villians in literature."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Worth a read for fans of the previous installments, but not nearly up to par. Most notable failure is lack of suspense. The plot lumbers along, through a forest of typically well observed details which can't hold interest because they're unnecessary to guess where things are headed. As for Dr. Lecter: fleshed out, he becomes more a stock super-villain, less a myth-like nightmare figure. Finally, the book is simply too thick for a relatively thin story. Mr. Harris could've used an editor on this one."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Remember when you saw 'Silence of the Lambs' and saw Hannibal Lecter for the first time as Starling came to his dungeon cell?? That look that Lecter had in his eyes? If you can't remember, then I envy you as it was all I thought about as I read - no, devoured - this chapter in the saga of one of literature's most fascinating characters. Lecter is a masterful creation and this book truly grabs you by the throat and won't let you go. I didn't mind the gruesome parts that the media is making so much of. Both of Harris' previous tales that included Lecter were equally disturbing in their realistic depictions of modern evil. You won't regret this one!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The quality of the writing is excellent but I have to agree with some of the other reviewers -- this is not a fit sequel to &quot;The Silence of The Lambs&quot;. The clumsy inclusion of a previous victim was difficult for me to swallow and the ending was almost impossible to accept. The final chapters read like one of Philip K. Dick's novels where he had run out of amphetamine and needed to finish it quickly. I wish I'd waited for the paperback."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is the perfect beach read, or read-aloud book for that long vacation drive. Thomas Harris had a mischievous delight in the interplay of these characters. The book is not &quot;brain food&quot; but an example of an expert linguist stretching his imagination in a literary playground - and it is a love story."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It would seem, from reading the reviews below, you either love this novel or hate it. Happily, I felt my money was well spent, as I loved it. The plot was dense and many-layered, adding a depth and breadth to the characters of Lecter and Starling that was only touched upon in the earlier novels. The ending was indeed a surprise, but once considered, fits in well with the series. I loved it, gross details and all. More Harris, more!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read the reviews on this site but bought the book anyway. I am glad I did. The visual images painted by Mr. Harris are wonderfully gross. I was curious about the ending after so much uproar. The ending is fine and made you go hmmmmmmm."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"For years, I've walked into bookstores inquiring anyone that would listen to me as to what Thomas Harris was doing. I was hoping, praying that he was doing something along the lines of Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs. Unfortunately, with this book, it appears as though that wasn't even close to the case.While the Red Dragon had characters and images that I'll never forget, this book is UTTERLY FORGETTABLE! All these years of waiting and we get this?!This book reminds me of how long we all waited for Boston's third album only to be disappointed and wish they had never released it, but instead had simply retired on top. Sadly, I feel the same about this book and Mr. Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While I enjoyed spending time with Hannibal Lector and Clarice Starling again, and actually felt the ending was a logical conclusion to the relationship Harris first begun in Silence of the Lambs, I was also unmoved by elements of the story , particularly the graphic scenes of violence which too often bordered on caricature. I also felt that Harris' writing style in this book created a voyeuristic sense in the reader (at least this reader) which further distanced me from the text. His humanization of Hannibal Lector was necessary given the ending, but did in the end detract from the essential mystery of the man that I found so compelling in his previous works. I will be interested in seeing how this translates to the screen, and whether Hollywood (and the audience) will let stay the final denouement of Clarice and Hannibal."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read The Silence of the Lambs in the Saudi desert before the war. I can't describe to you how scary it was to read that book in the dead of night with a flashlight. I came away thinking the writer was brilliant. I haven't changed my mind about the author after reading this book. Lecter is fascinating in his insanity. I love the ending of this one."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I guess that I am one of the few people in this world that actually enjoyed this novel. True, it was written differently which &quot;die-hard&quot; fans of SOTL and Red Dragon will not find acceptable. And yes, most of the characters seem to have changed, but it has been 7 years, hasn't it? Plus, it's just a book! Not something which has to be critiqued and scrutinized for every minor detail. In addition, they're just characters, not people to be awed at, and Harris can do whatever he wants with them (mainly Starling and Lecter.). After all, they are his! I liked how he chose to treat them in this novel, and how he structured &quot;Hannibal&quot; differently from the prior two. Thanks Mr. Harris!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is a great story. Harris is one of those guys who would rather write an interesting and compelling story than pander to the screenwriters who will inevitably butcher his work. The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five was that I wasn't crazy about the reader (unabridged audio version). He did a great voice for Hannibal Lector, but his stuffy, fake-sounding British accent did nothing for Starling's voice or anyone else's. Overall he was good, but not great."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I give it one star only because there is not a zero star.I could not believe how disappointing this book is. I feel T. Harris must have been playing a joke on his readers. I once read that he claims he doesn't like to write this kind of book, but that is what the public wants. He must have decided to give us what we want and do it to disgusting extremes. The ending, the characters, and the plot are dissapointing,to be polite. I might get my money's worth from the bokk this winter if I burn it for fuel in the fireplace."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thought it was impossible for Thomas Harris to top a book like The Silence of the Lambs, but I am glad to say, I was dead wrong. Hannibal is quite possibly the strongest, most engaging title in the Hannibal Lector series to date. In it we finally get a true glimpse into the mind of this disturbing and yet intrigueing individual. You find yourself disgusted by and yet cheering for him through much of the book, a feeling that be every bit as disturbing as his actions themselves. Clarice Starling also makes a comeback and reafirms Harris' talent for writing strong, effective female protagonists. This book is insanely engaging (I read the whole thing in just a little over a day) and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In recent years, serial killers, like vampires, have come to occupy their own sub genre. Many authors have attempted to tackle the subject, with varying degrees of success. No one, however, does serial killers better than Thomas Harris, author of RED DRAGON, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, and HANNIBAL. Taken together, these books constitute a bridge between such groundbreaking work as Robert Bloch's PSYCHO and the surfeit of serial killer novels published over the last fifteen years. These classics also introduced the public to the concept of serial killer as media star, featuring the most popular anti-hero of modern times, Dr. Hannibal Lector.Lector is enigmatic, highly intelligent and erudite. Before his capture, he killed and cannibalized at least nine people (the media later dubbed him \\"Hannibal the Cannibal\\"). As you might suspect, Lector's activities created quite a stir, eventually bringing Will Graham, an FBI investigator, to Lector's office (Lector had actually been the treating physician for one of the victims). During a conversation with the doctor, Graham has an epiphany and realizes Lector is the killer. Lector, perceiving that Graham has found him out, attempts escape. Catching Graham off guard, he guts him with a linoleum knife and flees, only to be captured later by the authorities.All this is background taken from RED DRAGON, published in 1981. As that novel begins, Lector resides in a high security mental facility, placed there by a court. Graham, recuperating from his wounds, is in semi-retirement. He is approached by Jack Crawford, his former boss at the FBI. Crawford seeks Graham's aid in the pursuit of a serial killer called the Tooth Fairy (so-named for his penchant for biting his victims), who has already slaughtered two innocent families.Graham reluctantly agrees to help. Hoping to revive his investigative instincts, he visits Lector in his lair. Lector, unhelpful, nevertheless takes an interest in the case and manages to insert himself into the action, providing the Tooth Fairy with Will's home address. This information puts Will and his family in danger, as the hunted turns on the hunter. At book's end, the Tooth Fairy is dead, and Will is disfigured for life. From his cell, Lector has managed to achieve a measure of vengeance on Graham.Lector also plays a key role in the sequel to RED DRAGON, 1988's THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee, is asked by Jack Crawford to interview the good doctor for a study on serial killers. Clarice visits Lector, but is unable to convince him to participate in the study. Lector, intrigued by young Clarice, offers her something better--his assistance on a current case involving a killer nicknamed \\"Buffalo Bill\\" (so named because he \\"skins his humps\\").Clarice becomes an active participant in the hunt for Buffalo Bill, acting as intermediary between Lector and the FBI. Lector, with previous knowledge of the killer, cunningly manipulates all involved. His orchestrations eventually provide him with an opportunity to escape, one which he eagerly seizes. Clarice, acting on hints dropped by the doctor, eventually tracks Bill down, but her victory is tempered by the knowledge that Dr. Lector is once again at large.These two novels are acknowledged classics of suspense and the aforementioned serial killer genre. Well written, they don't rely on shock value alone to jolt readers. Harris masterfully creates and sustains tension, building to tremendous crescendos in both books. Other authors have written successfully in this genre, but they tend to rely on splatter to achieve their horrific effect, each subsequent novel trying to outdo its predecessors in terms of gore and perversion. One quickly becomes inured to that type of book--instead of revulsion, you react with a yawn. If you read of such actions in the newspaper, you would be horrified; in fiction it is old hat. Harris avoids this trap, relying on good old-fashioned story telling to make his point.Harris resisted the obvious temptation to feature Lector more prominently in these novels, showing admirable restraint in reining in this strong character, using him to enhance, rather than dominate, the action. It would have been very easy for Harris to allow the good doctor to move to center stage--Lector is mesmerizing. Like Sherlock Holmes, he transcends the boundaries of literature, leaving his many \\"fans\\" clamoring for more. Anthony Hopkins' riveting portrayal of Dr. Lector on the silver screen only added to his luster, introducing him to an audience unfamiliar with Harris' novels.1999's HANNIBAL changed that forever. Featuring Lector as its chief protagonist, and Clarice Starling in a supporting role, this ambitious novel began to unravel the mystery behind the killer, providing tantalizing glimpses into his history and motivations. Many were upset by this, preferring Lector's past to remain murky. A large portion of Harris' readership was also turned off by the book's ending, feeling that Starling's fate was inappropriate. However you see it, you have to admire the risks Harris took, making Lector into an almost \\"Bondian\\" hero, having him square off against the obsessive Mason Verger, a horribly scarred, megarich supervillain he helped create.Supposedly a fourth book (listed as BEHIND THE MASK on Amazon) is forthcoming, but, until it's finally published, we all will have to be content with these three books. If you haven't read them, get busy. If you don't think rereading them will be rewarding, think again--none of the thrills or scares are diminished, despite the fact you know they're coming."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris's novel is just like his famous character Dr. Lecter: smart, refined... and damn scary. Some parts will make you want to turn away in disgust, and some characters, such as Mason Verger, are simply unforgettable. And yes, the book is much better than the film."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In a word, yuck.Kudos to Jodie Foster for turning down this movie. What a disappointment! First off, this book was so boring that it took me months to read. I kept putting it down in disgust, leaving it for weeks, then picking it up again saying \\"It's gotta get better. It's just gotta!\\" It never, never did. I enjoyed the beginning of Clarice's story. But almost everything about Hannibal's personal life was pseudo-psychological claptrap. The best villains aren't crazy, at least not in the classic sense. The beauty of Hannibal Lecter was that he was a monster despite being quite, quite sane. He made a choice to be a predator, and had his own twisted ethical code stemming from his sincere belief that he was a step above ordinary mortals. When you start trying to explain why Hannibal became a monster, he loses his sinister quality. He becomes pathetic, rather than apathetic. Red Dragon was a wounded animal, striking back at women. Jame Gumb was a twisted loser full of self-loathing. Hannibal was a stone-cold killer--brilliant, unrepentant, and supremely self-possessed. Not anymore.Oh, and did I mention that the end sucked? I loved the way the other books were almost relentlessly realistic, and how the characters remained true to themselves, flaws and all. Not anymore. Now Clarice is a dumb animal, too.I'd return this book and demand my money back, if, after all this time, I could remember where I bought it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm still hoping that someone will tell me that this book was written by someone other than Thomas Harris. This piece of tripe could not have come from the man who gave us the deliciously disturbing Hannibal Lecter of &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of The Lambs.&quot; Before, there was an inscrutable mystery of Lecter's motivations and delicious cat-and-mouse games; now, we get a freakish menagerie of characters (none of whom are detailed in the previous novels), an incredibly weak explanation of Lecter (you mean to tell me that the stoic demon of &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; cries out in his sleep? I don't think so), and destruction of the interplay between Lecter and his interviewers, as Starling falls under his spell. This last might not be as inconceivable as some reviewers would have you believe, but Harris's surrealistic attention to detail creates an ending as anti-climactic as it is absurd (Lecter's escape would have been laughed out of an ed wood movie).Lecter was so fascinating because of his mystery... an explained Lecter, particularly a poorly explained one, is an uninteresting one. If you loved the first two books, keep away from this one, and keep your enjoyment of Lecter intact."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The best sequal ever written? Yes and then some, Hannbal is the bench mark that I will hold all other suspense novels to. The transformation of the characters especially Starling is the greatest part of this novel. Hannibal Lectur as a caring domestic figure, I didn't think that it was possible but apparantly Lector is capable of absolutley anything. Lectors character is one that has to be read twice or miss the entirity of his opressive presence. With the addition of Mason Verger and that captivating side plot I became an instant Thomas Harris fan. Please if you have any form of stylistic taste buy this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Usually, I make so many words dance on the page to lure the uninitiated and show off how smart I have become after reading a certain book. Not this one. After coming through the very incandescent though, at times, unstable plot of Red Dragon, I am rather disappointed with this his latest book. Thomas Harris in his haste for a million-dollar book contract managed to prostitute his capable mind and doused our mounting excitement with dismay. Hannibal is too campy for my taste. I hope Mr. Harris recovers from this as I really believe he is a very talented writer in this genre. But everything is not total disappointment. The Harris seal is still there but not too evident as in his previous books. Three stars. No quibbling about that."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Anyone who is familiar with the works of Thomas Harris should expect out of the ordinary elements. Wasn't the point of the ending to show that two people who have suffered from a corrupt and unjust society have finally found comfort far away from it as possible? Had Clarice and Hannibal not been tortured by certain constraints? I believe Harris could not have ended this delicious novel better. Anyone who cannot see the beauty of this conclusion should go back and read the last 5 chapters again. I do not believe Clarice was necessarily brainwashed--she was just lifted from the cave to see the light (Plato)."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Having read and thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Harris's previous books I was eagerly anticipating Hannibal. What a mistake that turned out to be.This is by far the worst book I have ever read. The plot is laughable and the prose is downright pathetic. No matter what a particular chapter was about they all ended with something along the lines of 'the blood ran slowly down the wall...' or some other melodramatic drivel. Mr. Harris should have quit while he was so very far ahead with his earlier gems.I'm tempted to go see the movie version to find out if it could possibly be any worse than the book. Do yourself a favor, as Jodie Foster did, and stay as far away from Hannibal as you can."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is a horrible book. It did not live up to expectations considering how good silence of the lambs was. If you have not read this book and you enjoyed silence of the lambs then I suggest you pass on this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is a romance disguised as a fever dream. It's smart, well-paced, over-the-top, horrifying and well written.The carping from the peanut gallery about &quot;Hannibal&quot; is disappointing but shouldn't be unexpected. When you have the misfortune to create one of the best-loved novels of the last ten years, everyone suddenly knows how to do your job for you and do it better. The characters become &quot;theirs&quot; and the choices an author makes are to be forever second guessed.I believe, unlike most of the reviewers, that Mr. Harris made some interesting, valid choices and kept the integrity of the characters from the previous novel, spinning out their story in the only way it could go. (I'm trying to not give away the ending but it's darn hard.) If you'll pay attention to &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence...&quot; you''ll see that Harris constantly blurs the line between good and evil, playing with the conventions of the genre. So it's logical that Clarice and Hannibal would connect as they did in &quot;Silence&quot; and again in &quot;Hannibal&quot; because they are so very much alike--in much the same way that our manhunter from &quot;Red Dragon&quot; connected to Hannibal.Having said that, the book is always interesting, creepy as all get-out, the Florence section in particular, the evil of Verger is unmentionable and vile. And for the reader who suggested Hannibal had become Frasier Crane, I would say Hannibal's more like a flesh-eating James Bond. Finally, I loved the fact that Harris could wrankle all you devout Christians into such a froth. Absolutely loved it. And this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed RED DRAGON and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. I read Hannibal with equally high hopes. I did not hate the book. However, the ending was disturbingly horrid. ***SPOILER*** Clarice would never in a million years run off with Dr. Lector. EVER. It was completely out of character. It's like saying Hugh Hefner decided to become homosexual."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I doubt that my review will dissuade anyone from buying or reading this book. If you must buy it, though, get a used copy, as the less you spend on this, the better. Better yet, borrow from a friend or the library, for this book is inferior in all ways to the previous The Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs.The novel moves through often brief, cursory chapters that made me think, Ah, Mr. Harris is obviously on a deadline and is wasting no time on quality plotting, characterization or dialogue. Yet, the times he lingers on a scene, I wanted him to move on: each time I had to dwell on the pig-master's chewing of stag teeth, or the nasty eel swimming figure eights in a large tank I thought: he has no idea what he wants of his characters at any depth, save for gruesome sensational plans and counterplans.The background of Dr. Lecter is all too brief and sketchy to lend any further understanding into this peculiar and dangerous mind; and there is little more than superficial interaction with Clarice and Dr. Lecter, even when he is drugging her and manipulating her into becoming his love-toy. Who are these people? Where is the insightful, on-the-edge interaction that formerly held a captive audience? No wonder Ms. Foster wants no part of this; there is nothing that could draw any actor of depth and integrity.If you want a cheap thrill and don't expect too much from the book, fine, go ahead. The only reason I gave the book a star at all is because even a badly-written book takes time and effort; I give Mr. Harris credit for that. Beyond that? I do not much care for what happens next to the bleached-blond Ms. Starling, nor do I think Mr. Harris will ever adequately reveal the character of Dr. Lector as it will take more effort and subtlety than Mr. Harris seems willing to commit."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I waded through the revenge plot and was left with a handful of air at the end. What a jaw-droppingly bad ending. Mr. Harris, what were you thinking?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"First, let me just say that up until Lecter gets medieval on Pacci (literally), *Hannibal* definitely has its moments. But even those first 200 pages have many, many flaws. For one thing, the whole man-eating pig thing strains credulity. One of the wonderful things about *Silence of the Lambs* was that you could almost imagine the events happening--and it terrified you. Not so with *Hannibal*. The plot is farfetched, and ludicrous, and each chapter is bogged down by cumbersome geographical descriptions and much-abused grammar.As for character development--Harris reduces Starling to a foreword and afterthought. She isn't even a fully realized human being, so weak willed, apparently, that she easily relinquishes her deeply ingrained sense of right and wrong. One of the things I loved most about Starling of the *Lambs* was the conviction that, no matter what happened, she would do the right thing. It made for an interesting contrast with Lecter.And speaking of Lecter, Harris, not satisfied with destroying one strong character, turns Lecter from a criminal mastermind to a cheap fettishist. The Lecter of the *Lambs*, you could almost admire, despite his cruelty, because you knew that he was a being unlike any other, free of the laws and mores that bind the rest of us. And you felt that, despite his contempt for her &quot;cheap shoes,&quot; he really admired Starling. Not so here. This Lecter is trite, arbitrary, and visceral, controlled by habit and a pathetically contrived childhood trauma. And the way he treats Starling...well the less said about that the better.Unless your thing is gore for gore's sake, ignore this book, pretend it never happened. I certainly will."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As someone who *loved* Harris's books \\"Red Dragon\\" and \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" almost to the point of obsession, I cannot believe that the same person who created such complex, fascinating books as those two wrote the distasteful mess that is \\"Hannibal\\". Boo!!! Hiss!!! I felt almost as if I was reading a sequel by a different author who never had understood the characters or the appeal of the books in the first place (a la the bogus \\"Gone With the Wind\\" sequel...)To my mind, it was not the gross-out factor that made the first two books great, but the fabulous psychological interplay between the bright, honorable (and properly nervous) FBI agents and the brilliant psychopath anti-hero. Hannibal Lecter as a misunderstood hero with a back-story just did not work for me.Yuck! Yuck! Yuck! to the ending!!! My copy of this book ended up in the *garbage*. A *dismal* finale (at least I *hope* it is the finale!) to an otherwise brilliant series of books!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris consistently delivers unique, skillfully written novels, and I was not in the least bit disappointed. All of these people who had the gall to give these one and two star ratings obviously need to go back to their cheap thrillers and paperback romances. Harris is apparently too sophisticated for you all.As for the people who complain about unbelievable plot, wtf? You're reading a series about a flesh-eating, genius serial killer, and you're surprised about the more bizarre facets of this book?I really have no idea why Jodie Foster refused the role in the movie, but if it was because she found it mortifying that Clarice would run off with Lecter in the end, then she never understood Clarice's character in the first place. Clarice will always be one of my favorite characters. Lecter is attracted to her honesty and sense of duty, but he also knows that deep down, she is more like him than she will ever admit. She is a killer and a survivor.Fateful events and Lecter's influence finally brought out that darkness in her, and she found her happiness in the shadows with a man worthy of her strength and beauty.Bravo!Avid readers will appreciate this book; pluck it from the sea of published flotsam out there and keep it on a nearby shelf!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is outstanding, if you are capable of moving beyond the detective-thriller model of SOTL and into more deep and challenging waters. An approriate subtitle of this book would be \\"The Healing of Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling.\\" As was said, this is not some linear detective thriller nor is it a Harlequin Romance, both of which the critics of this book should really be spending their time with it seems, along with Paul Krendler on the other side of the flowers. Hannibal is over their head. I have worked extensively with the severely mentally ill, particularly schizophrenics and psychotics, as well as people with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. They develop coping mechanisms that we find extreme or odd, because their past experience has such a hold on them, and intrudes into their lives so radically. How would you cope if you as a child saw a sibling torn from your hands and eaten...or your father was murdered? The genius of this book is that Lecter and Starling not only complete each other, they heal each other. She, a resolute warrior who once committed will never leave or be taken without a fight to the death..she will never be a victim. He, the father figure who seeks her liberty and healing while at the same time does not seek her to be dependent upon him..in fact he loves her for what he sees as a fierce independence that has been shackled by the trauma of her father's death and her remaining within the bounds of political institutions that now seek to harm her. After having read Hannibal rising, I now see that his real love for her is because unlike Lady Murasaki, who ended up walking away from him and his pathology, Starling was not only fearless in the face of it but was willing to save his life despite his nature. Their personalities and trauma history are perfectly matched. In the end they make a great couple, healed, whole, and happy."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am readingHannibalfor the second time and find it just as thrilling as my first encounter with Hannibal Lecter. I am suprised by the negative reviews that this story has received. The plot is exciting, and I enjoyed the book's ending far more than the one the movie left us with. Is Hannibal a monster? It was easy to say yes afterRed DragonandThe Silence of the Lambs (Hannibal Lector). Now that we can step into the mind of Lecter, the question is a little harder to answer. He is a complex and brilliant character. I was on the edge of my seat, actually rooting for a serial killer!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am a new reader of Thomas Harris. I had seen the movie adaptation of 'The Silence of the Lambs' when it first came out, but had never read any of the books. I just finished Hannibal, and I thought it was excellent. At first I was amazed I was feeling sympathy for such a horrible monster, but as I read, it began to make sense. We are all capable of evil on some level, regardless of how that evil plays out; lying, stealing, murder. What makes this book so powerful is it allows you to live in the mind of each character, feeling their motivations. No one is purely evil, and even Hannibal Lecter can find redemtion of a sort. I thought it was interesting to find out about his sister, and the reasons he acted as he did. I had read Hannibal Rising before this book, which may have colored my perception, but I thought it was remarkable. The true villans of this piece are Mason and Krendler, and I was glad they got what they deserved. The greatest part of this book is the use of language. Thomas Harris writes with clarity and with spare, concise perfecton. There is not a wasted word, or an unnecessary phrase, and is a rarity in popular fiction as it could be used to teach writing. I loved this book and I was sorry when I finished it. I will read it more than once!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I couldn't put the book down. For all the negative criticism I'd read, I was expecting a far worse ending. Like a puppetmaster, Hannibal controlled everything and everyone. He destroyed the agent in &quot;Red Dragon,&quot; didn't he? Clarice, too, falls into his web. Not credible? Don't forget the drugs used and Lecter's command of psychology. I was rooting for him. Krendler was awful ( better off left lobotomized ). Mason was so sick, as to lose anyone's sympathy as a victim. Quite humorous, his demise by the very dogs he tortured. Okay, the pigs got to be a bit much, but a nice detail in that they smelled no fear on our dear Doctor. Hannibal is an awesome tale of horror, sometimes nightmarishly written, as if by stream of consciousness. Stephen King is about as frightening as R.L. Stine in comparison. As one review pointed out, I guess I AM in need of some serious therapy . . . just not with Hannibal Lecter, MD, please."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is proof that editors don't read what they publish. The result is that this rubbish has been published. Giving &quot;one star&quot; rating is far too generous. Amazon should consider increasing the number of rating categories to include some negative categories."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was so excited when I saw Hannibal on the shelf and completed it within 48 hours. I felt rather unsatisfied, though. Too many questions and not nearly enough answers.The whole novel was fragmented and loosely put together. There were flashes of potential but they ultimately fizzled out into something lame.The ending was very innovative and fun, but it made me turn back and see if I missed something in Starling's character development. No answer there, either.I don't mean to nitpick, but Lecter's choices of wine are too obvious, opting for the popular names like Petrus and the likes. I thought Lecter's taste and style would be more subtle and refined.This novel would translate so well into a movie, where you have less time to ponder the finer points of the story. May I suggest Nicholson for Lecter? Since Hannibal's Lecter is quite different from Silence's Lecter I think it would be fitting to change the actors as well.Now to its good points, at least Hannibal is a quick and exciting read, though an unfulfilling one. In its surreal settings, the far-fetched characters and circumstances somehow manage to fit together, admittedly awkwardly. If you don't think too much about it, the novel is rather okay.To those who haven't read Hannibal: If you like American Psycho (by B. Ellis), you should like this one. But if you like Thomas Harris, ironically, this novel is not for you. By the way, don't buy this book, borrow it or wait for a paperback. It's not worth spending the money on...."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I feel completely rip offed. This book was good through out the first half of the book. It was going in the right direction or so it seemed. but from the second half it just got to the point where you wanted the book to end. But then to add to my dismay, when the book did end, it ended up horrible. It was pointless to write a book like this and end it the way that Thomas Harris did. It looked as though this book had been rushed. If I could return it and get my money back, I would."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is a wretched disappointment. Thomas Harris' earlier works are densely woven, lyrical character studies. In this book, it seems the author attempts to hide weakly developed plot threads and uninteresting central characters behind incredibly gratuitous violence. The ending was unconvincing and shamelessly sickening. Hannibal was truly a waste of valuable reading time."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This so-called part three of the Hannibal Lecter trilogy (ha ha) was everything I hoped it would be and more. You want shock, you get shock. You want more of Hannibal Lecter, you get more of him (the historical details made perfect sense). And the opportunity to observe the development of Clarice and Hannibal's ongoing conversation is a curious study on the structure of human interactions.Harris was quoted as saying that he had to believe the story he wrote himself, and I believed every minute of it... even the ending. I know most people say that there was a shocking slap in the face at the end, but in all honesty, from the start, it was almost inevitable (I won't give it away the way Salon.com unmercifully did).True, the middle lacked punch, but I don't think Hannibal was meant to be punchy and action packed, but rather a subtly titilating unraveling, kind of like muffled screams in excited anticipation.I loved it. I just wish I were more literate so I could pick apart the references to the classics and analyze their relations to the story."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Along with millions of others, I loved Silence of the Lambs and I eagerly purchased Hannibal full of excitement. As I finished the last page of the novel, I truly felt that I had wasted my money. I am not normally squeamish but I felt that the story contained an abundant amount of unneeded grotesque scenes. And the ending was utterly unsatisfying and seemingly beyond the realm of remote possibility. As I trudged through the gore I was hoping that the climax would overcome the weak points of the story. It did not.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is the ultimate monster.

To my surprise the book was not filled with blood, mutilation and murder. The voilence lay more within the minds of Mason Verger and, of course, Dr. Lecter. I couldn't put the book down and found myself driven to read on not by the writing but by a morbid curiosity as to the ending. I found the novel's plot to build for a while, plateau and then fizzle into nothing. The only thing good about the ending is that is is completely unexpected... but that really is the ONLY good thing about it. I found the ending to be disappointing, confusing, unexplainable, and almost completely untied to the rest of the book. After following Lecter, Verger and Starling for almost 400 pages, I found the ending not worth the time."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After eleven years of waiting I finally got to read the next chapter in the life of Hannibal Lecter. I was not dissapointed. I extremely enjoyed the insight to lecters' mind and past. I also enjoyed the characters of Mason and Margot Verger.

Alas, the Thomas Harris-read version is, with all due respect, less than stellar and not recommended.This is a review of the item pictured -- the unabridged edition performed by an actor named Daniel Gerroll.This fellow gives an award worthy rendition of this controversial novel. People either hate it or love it, and most do not like the ending. The novel may be one of the reasons Jodie Foster turned down $20 million to reprise the role of Clarice, but the movie ending differs dramatically from the novel. Those only familiar with the movie will be shocked if they read, or listen to the novel.Gerroll, an actor with whom I am unfamiliar, gives a bravura performance that rivals Jeremy Irons' performance of Lolita on audio.This edition is apparently out of print, but available used for a nominal sum from Amazon Marketplace sellers. I bought mine for one thin dime (plus shipping).For those who love spoken word performances, this is highly recommeded."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have been eagerly awaiting the 'Hannibal' book and boy, was I disappointed! It is not the face paced novel like, 'Red Dragon' and 'Silence of the Lambs'. Instead, Mr Harris gives us a lesson in Italian history and describes with great detail the places that Hannibal has visited. Clarice Starling also is in this novel, having fallen on hard times, her rising star, now fallen. Suspended from the FBI, she is not the first on the scene when we find out who Lecter's identity is. Also, the main villian of this novel is not Lecter, but Mason Verger, a man who is permanently disfigured by Lecter. He now swears revenge on Hannibal, and means to take it by training pigs to eat him from the feet up. The ending of the book is the most unbelievable with Clarice and Hannibal teaming up. I was truly disappointed by the ending. Don't waste your time, re-read 'Lambs' or 'Red Dragon'Thanks for reading!**Pandora"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;Hannibal&quot; is the first of the Lecter trilogy that I have read. I opened the cover with a sense of trepidation and dread based on the &quot;legendary&quot; reputation of the character Hannibal Lecter. I was surprised to find that the story included a plethora of &quot;monsters&quot; who had been corrupted by their own lusts--- for revenge or sex or money, or all the above--- so that Hannibal is merely a superior monster (erudite, sophisticated, genteel...) surrounded by a world filled with lesser (short-witted and vulgar) monsters. By observing the masses of humanity through the contemptuous eyes of &quot;Hannibal Lecter&quot;, the author subtley but CLEARLY projects the notion that humanity is in fact a race of monsters who ALL hide dishonestly behind the mask of &quot;culture&quot; and a meaningless veneer of &quot;civility&quot;. Remove this veneer, Harris says (through Lecter's thoughts) and all you have left are monsters who are no better than Lecter himself, and in fact, who deserve to be ruled and tormented by Lecter's superiority.Harris even draws a distinction between common human corruption and true evil, through the scene where the common thief looks into the eyes of &quot;true&quot; evil and recoils.The final chapters alone are worth the price of the book. The author skillfully brings his premises to their logical conclusions: where virtue is folly, and hope is in vain, then evil may rule. The final chapters contain one of most gruesome yet bloodlessly tidy scenarios ever written; disturbing (because it reminds me of NAZI medical experiments), yet the image of &quot;evil feeding upon its own offspring&quot; is painful and laughably absurd at the same time.This book is a must-read for everyone but the most squeamish and the young. Lecter's erudition and sophistication lend a superficial glamor and deceptive charm to an otherwise utterly evil character. The Memory Palace was a WONDERFULLY mystical touch to Lecter's psyche. The book's theme is disturbing and appalling, BUT... it is nonetheless meaningful and relevant for this--- and future--- generations."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Why, Thomas Harris, why? Why, after seven years, did you unleash this mess on your waiting fans? I was so happy when I heard that there would be a conituation of The Silence of the Lambs, only to be horribly let down by the results. The ending is ridiculous. It doesn't make sense at all - and comes so quickly after hundreds of pages building &quot;suspense&quot; (which never really happens). And do we have to endure so many people mistaking Hannibal Lecter for Satan? We understand that he is a malevolent person, but that doesn't make him the ultimate evil. Spare yourself the money and time - please."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While most other reviewers either liked this book or totally disliked it I'd rather say it was excellent from the psycho point of view. It was absolutely believable. In particular I liked the idea of the memory palace and the change of the lovely Clarice Starling. After this book you will see Lecter and Starling with different eyes. Contra: The whole revenge plot was quite predictable. I totally hated it. It just didn't fit into the character of this book. As Dr. Lecter would say: &quot;This book lacks in taste.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The sequel to \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\", set seven years later.After a drug-raid gone bad, and with some help from a corrupt agent, once rising-star Clarice Sterling finds herself on the outs with the FBI. After escaping from prison, serial killer Hannibal \\"The Cannibal\\" Lechter has relocated to Italy under the guise of a wealthy historian. Distance cannot keep him from his fascination with Special Agent Starling. though, and he continues to follow her career.A sizable bounty has been placed on the capture of Dr. Lechter by a wealthy former patient/victim of the Cannibal named Mason Verger. The prospect of millions of dollars has awoken the greed in a disgraced Italian detective, an FBI agent with delusions of grandeur and several other inner-circle law enforcement officials who plan to collect kidnap the madman and turn him over Verger.Once Lechter's whereabouts become known, it is a scramble for Starling to not only save Lechter from those wishing to capitalize on him but to return him to prison as well.Excellent follow-up to \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" with just about every character from the previous book returning, each one changed by Dr. Lechter in some way. Those who do cannot stomach detailed descriptions of brutal acts of human atrocity may want to bypass this one. The ending will surprise and shock you.For those who have seen the movie, you don't know the real story."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"You know after reading Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon I thought I was ready for a book where Hannibal was walking the streets. It came as a dissapointment. I think all readers find Hannibal to be a great character but he is a killer and the cage that he had inhabited for those long years had become a part of his character. Without that cage we feel a sense of not being safe in the world, and it is ok for us to feel that way. Finding a killer interesting is one thing, but letting him go free is quite another. I am not even sure Harris could manage this task very well. The book is just as well written as the others and I had no problem finishing it in a hurry. The book at times appears as the other books, an FBI agent trying to catch a criminal(Hanibal in this book), but the ending is much different and I think it is a little disturbing. At times Harris tries to make us relate to Hannibal. He does this by pointing out the flaws of society and he even tries to make us detest one of Hannibal's surviving victims. Maybe I felt the wrong emotion, but I felt pity for Hannibal's victim, not hatred. I am not saying that Hannibal's victim was a good man, by any means; however, I had a hard time dealing with a world where Hannibal Lecter hands out judgment and punishment. As for the flaws of society, yes they do exist, but not all of us kill. And as for Clarice, I was disappointed with her character and believe me the end shows how much of it she lacks. I would not recommend this book to anyone who has concrete ideas of good and bad or people who like books that end on a good note."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Like the other two Lecter novels, Hannibal is an excellent suspense story. But where the other two were truly superb, this one is only fair to good. I thought there were two problems in the story.The lesser of two evils is the way Starling is treated at the end of the story. I was unhappy with the ending, although Harris leaves it unclear whether or not it's really Starling's choice.The greater problem is the pages and pages Harris spends explaining how and why Dr. Lecter got to be the suave people-eating psychotic we have come to fear and hate and love. This is a Very Bad Thing. We don't need to know anything about Lecter's motivations; he is a better villain if he doesn't have any. That's what made him such a fascinating character to begin with: he's brilliant and athletic and wealthy and charming, and he likes to eat people. We can't dismiss him as insane because he is not. There is absolutely no need for the pop-psychology theory-of-the-week Harris provides. Just as Darth Vader ceases to be evil when he takes off his mask, Lecter ceases to be such a repellent, compelling menace when he is revealed to be merely human. He is a nearly flawless Bad Guy in the first two novels, a concentration of all the evil we are capable of, condensed to solidity, dressed up like a human and walking around in broad daylight. Yet he's a totally believable character, and it terrifies us to imagine that someone like him might actually exist. We ache to look inside his head, if only to reassure ourselves that we are not like him. But actually letting us have a good look destroys all the things that make him a good character. In the first two books, the purity of Lecter's evil stands out against the emotional humanity of Starling and Graham and the conflicted, desperate madness of the serial killers they hunt. Lecter's humanity was never more than skin-deep, and Harris's clumsy attempty to pour human motivations into his skull robs us of a superbly-drawn Malevolence Personified. No more sequels, please, Mr. Harris. Doctor Lecter has left the building."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It is clear that Thomas Harris had a movie deal. And that he needed a book to fulfill the movie deal. So he slapped this unworthy work together. A very disappointing follow up to Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I eagerly awaited \\"Hannibal\\" for years, having fallen in love with \\"Red Dragon\\" and \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\" When \\"Hannibal\\" fianlly arrived I couldn't wait, and there are parts of the book that flew by for me. However, the whole Italy section drags in the book and is way to long. When Hannibal arrives in America the book takes off again, untill the ending which is severe let down. Mason Veger 1is worthy opponent to Dr. Lector and I wished for more scenes with him and Clarice or Lector... The ending has to be the most stupid ending I have ever read. There is no way the character of Clarice Starling would behave the way she does. I wanted redemption for Clarice and instead got a an FBI agent that falls in love with a serial killer??!! I was so mad at the end, I threw the book across the room...Thank God, they changed the ending for the movie, which I actually enjoyed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read &quot;silence of the lambs&quot; just after the movie opened in 1991 as I was anxious to learn more extensive details concerning the character Hannibal Lector. While I can't remember everything about that novel, I'm sure I'll remember the majority of the elaborate details found in &quot;hannibal&quot; the long awaited third installment of the series. Frankly, I thought placing Hannibal in Florence amongst the world's greatest works of art was very clever; however, I would have enjoyed the book as much if it didn't justapose Lector's life in Florence with Starling's woes at the FBI. Portraying the world's most sinister killer as the victim curiously lessened the most interesting element of these three stories: that readers sympathize (and sometimes idolize) this monstorous character due to his elegance and intelligence. Perhaps authors will note that modern audiences strongly desire these qualities and create better protaganists with this in mind."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"HANNIBAL is not a typical prequal, it is a surprising masterpiece. Thomas Harris weaves an elegant story with words, meticulous research, and shocking horror. We see exactly what happens after Dr. Lecter's escape from the mental hospital. He is being pursued relentlessly by two people. One is Clarice Starling, the other is Mason Verger. This is a fine novel, those who read it shall not be disappointed.Mason Verger was a former child molester, and patient of Dr. Lecter's. In one gruesome act, Dr. Lecter ate parts of him. Now,Mason is on life support and runs a meat packing empire. His goal before he dies: to see Hannibal Lecter suffer and die. He has a large network of people tracking Dr. Lecter for him. Mason's audacity and cruelty (which Harris puts special emphasis on) will make you loathe him and almost root for Dr. Lecter.Clarice Starling is an FBI agent, who's in trouble. There was a drug bust that went horribly wrong. Now she is under fire, and under the watch of Dr. Lecter. He boldly contacts her, and she must seek him out to bring him to justice. Her hunt for him will be a key factor in the book.If you enjoy horror that is elegant, sickening, and even shocking, then HANNIBAL is a book you should read. I guarantee you'll be scared, and not disappointed. Buy HANNIBAL and feel the silence once again."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris is a wonderful writer. Keeps you turning the pages because of the incredible characters he comes up with. They seem quite alive. However, as they seem quite alive, myself and several friends who are teachers agree that Clarice would never do what he has her doing at the end of the book. Still is an enjoyable book, but it was jarring to read what Harris had her doing with Lecter. Oh, well. Nevertheless, I will read any other books he writes. His early ones are captivating, too and I highly recommend them to you."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After eagerly awaiting this sequel to a fabulous book I was incredibly disappointed. The author was not true to his characters. Their behaviour was not remotely believable and after enjoying both Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs I was amazed to find this written by the same person. The plots were sloppy, the characters unreal and the pace boring. I would definitely NOT reccommend this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It's been seven years since Hannibal Lecter escaped from confinement. In that time Clarice Starling has seen her career go nowhere and now because of a drug-bust gone bad she's in danger of being booted from the FBI. That is, until, she gets a letter from Lecter and her bosses give her a reprieve to help catch the elusive mass-murderer. But reclusive millionare Mason Verger, who Lecter crippled and almost killed, is also searching for Lecter. And Mason Verger has serious plans for revenge and won't let Starling or anyone else stand in his way.This book was not what I expected. Not to say that it's a bad book, it's not, but somehow it doesn't fit into what you'd expect a sequel to &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; to be. The writing is good, but quite different from how Mr. Harris normally writes. By that I mean it's almost Victorian. There is great detail in the descriptions which can go on for pages. He also uses the &quot;Dear Reader&quot; voice at times in which he, as the author, talks directly to the reader which is also very Victorian. And I must admit I was disappointed in the ending. To paraphrase Stephen King's comments on this book it's almost more of a horror novel than a thriller.I've rated this book at four stars because the writing is very good. However, I think most people will buy this book expecting to get a &quot;Silence of the Lambs - Part Two&quot; and will be disappointed because it is not."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Unlike some of the more scathing reviews presented on this page, I was very happy with Hannibal. Its not a book for the weak of stomach, that much is certain!I was not too suprised in the turnaround of Clarice's character, nor with the development of Lecter. I suggest you re-read Silence before tackling this one, and pay attention to what you read: my guess is those most disappointed by it only watched the movie or skimmed through Silence.I have no need to defend this book, I think it is an excellent piece of work. Not often you find characters growing or changing, as they do with Thomas Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thorougly enjoyed &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; and &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, so I was excited to read &quot;Hannibal&quot;. What a HUGE disappointment!!! The previous novels I read until all hours of the night, and couldn't put them down. With &quot;Hannibal&quot;, it was all I could do to keep reading to see what happens to the monster. The series of events in this novel were completely predictable and Harris' emphasis seemed to be on the gore rather than the story and characters. While his previous novels had great cliffhanger endings, the ending to &quot;Hannibal&quot; left room for a next novel, at best! The difference is, I won't purchase the next novel! I was VERY generous giving the book 2 stars!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is a fast-paced crime drama with great characters to cheer for and detest. The book cover reviews classify it in the horror genre. Not true. The ending leaves you with plenty to think about with respect about why Statling makes the choices she made. This is the type of book you can read in one sitting - not wanting to put it down."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I felt that the story had a huge set-up that culminated in a fast-paced action-packed conflict, only to wrap-up many of the loose details of the story quickly and dissappointingly from a single, mysterious perspective that differed from the matter-of-fact linear style of the preceding chapters. Overall a good read. I can see Hollywood's upcoming interpretation differing in many ways."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A Baroque masterpiece by Harris, well worthy of a place beside 'Silence' and 'Red Dragon,' 'Hannibal' is a gorgeous, grotesque, horrifying -- and beautifully written book. It's dark fare served up by Thomas Harris and a Hannibal Lecter in rare form.Big, fat note of warning: It's not for everyone. The book is as shocking as it is disturbing. But it's also immensely satisfying, both as a pulse-pounder and as a book that succeeds on the literary level. I've noticed that people (reviewers included) either adore this book or absolutely hate it -- I loved it. But be warned -- it is a walk on the wild side...If 'Silence of the Lambs' was a sonata, 'Hannibal' is a symphony -- with a vengeance. Minor criticisms would include a bumpy beginning and an over-the-top gross villain who has none of the subtlety or 3-D believability of the 'Tooth Fairy' (or Lecter) from 'Red Dragon.' But the writing and plot race toward a daring, shocking can't-miss ending, with some wonderful insights into Starling and especially Lecter's 'Palace of the Mind' along the way.Lecter's powerful presence permeates the book -- fascinating as always even as it frightens. The ending left me speechless with disbelief and admiration for Harris -- and how far he is willing to go. By the end the book is a twisted and beautiful, brilliantly Baroque masterpiece.Also recommended in this genre: Red Dragon, The Silence of the Lambs, The Green Mile, Mercy"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Ok, there are more reviews for this book than I've noticed for any other before. You get the general idea.The ending was a shame, there were some implausible and silly moments that were not only out of character for the plot, but also for Thomas Harris as an author.But - you can still see the strength of the characters shine through - Hannibal Lechter is rightfully one of the most memorable antagonists in modern writing.For the benefit of many, I recently read an article stating that good portions of the book were heavily redone and rewritten for the screenplay, and it sounds like they were the portions I found most offensive (plot-wise - people who read a book involving serial killers and cannibalism who act aghast at crude descriptions need to rethink their life). Purportedly, Jodie Foster turned down the role based on the reading of the book, but the changes were enacted after her refusal -- so we can hope for the movie.Still, there were some interesting concepts -- the Memory Palace still strikes me. The touches of elegance that Harris either knows or researched heavily. It made the read bearable - but still glad I bought the softcover."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris' sequel to The Silence of the Lambs isn't too bad - until the end, which deserves all the negative reviews it has gotten. Surprise endings are fine, but they must be substantiated. The actions of Clarice Starling certainly are not consistent with her character as given in the previous book, which is why most found the end bewildering. For want of a shocking ending, the author completely sold a wonderful characterout...."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was completely disappointed with this book. Not only is it gruesome to the point of being an unbelievable tale, the author totally betrayed the character of Clarice Starling by making her weak and by having her completely abandon her beliefs and strong will!! Clarice would have NEVER done what the author had her doing at the end! Very, very disappointing!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I can offer up no plausible reason why I finished this silly, over-the-top, wretched book but I did so I'll give it a single star. Assail me with gratuitous grossness, assault me with a ludicrous plot, but woe betide the author who insults my intelligence the way Harris did with his final outlandish chapters. Puh-leeze. People, wake up! Like Harold Robbins, a bestselling author of schlocky novels a generation before him, Harris in fact despises his audience and despises himself for catering to them. Ugh."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am not squeamish or prudish, and I loved each of Harris' other books, but at the end of Hannibal, I felt violated. The reader from La Luz, NM was correct when they wrote that the book could have used a better editor and that the characters - especially Clairce - go against type. Clarice never showed any indication that she craved the lush life, yet she ends up falling for Dr. Lecter's bourgeois trappings. What would her Daddy and Mama think? Plus, with Kendler out of the picture, her career could have been salvaged. Speaking of Krendler, I understand that this is a horror novel, but some of the more graphic details were simply unnecessary."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The worse book I have ever read. The only reason I continued was that I read a review saying the last 100 pages were gripping. I regret not throwing it in the trash as soon as I realized it was written to be a grade B movie. Thank you Jodie Foster for not going forward with this obnoxious story."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book for several reasons: 1. Instead of being a riveting thriller, this book seems to be philosophical and makes too many attempts to be &quot;literary.&quot; Harris is not a suitable writer for this; his talent has always been far below that of Stephen King and other writers who are able to handle such a task with aplomb. He should have stuck with his strengths and simply wrote a thriller. 2. There is a strange undertone of classism and religious bigotry in this novel. Hannibal Lecter is presented as a &quot;hero&quot; seemingly because he has good taste in music and wine. Mason Verger - the book's &quot;villian&quot; - is seen as evil because he's a hypocritical Southern Baptist and a rude pig farmer. (Verger never manages to seem scary, however, because he's completely paralyzed.) Another character is described as a fool simply because she belongs to a conservative Methodist denomination. If Harris has a sore spot with Christians and red-necks, he should keep it to himself. To air one's prejudices makes for poor storytelling. The only two characters who come close to being remotely positive in this story, by the way, are a black man and lesbian woman. Gee, how original - just like every other movie Hollywood puts out. Sounds to me like Thomas Harris has been spending too much time on college campuses and taking praise from feminists a little too seriously. 3. This book just isn't scary. Mason Verger is pathetic instead of frightening. If Harris wanted to make another villian instead of Hannibal, he should have made the villian something Lecter would fear - a physically powerful, animalistically clever vigilante who is driven by a psychotic sense of mission. That would be the perfect contrast to Hannibal's aging, nihilistic, and effete character. Nobody is scared of a quadraplegic. He should have also given Hannibal AIDS, hepatisis, Mad Cow or some other affliction that cannibals invariably suffer from. At least that would have made the book realistic. Maybe Harris will read this and take my suggestions to heart - he'll need to do something radically different next time around if he wants to keep the Hannibal franchise appealing to its fan base."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm not going to waste a lot of time writing my review... I've already wasted enough time reading this pathetic book.As a follow-up to &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; and &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, this book arrived with so much hype that it almost was doomed to fall short of people's expectations... but who would have thought it would (or COULD) be THIS bad?Ok, here goes my review... 10 years have passed since Hannibal was last seen tracking down his next meal, and as we are re-introduced to Clarice and the other sordid cast of primary characters, it's as if their lives have been completely on hold since 1990.By the time I made it to the end of this book, I was hoping one of the hideous villains would eat ME, and put me out of my misery. Or, better yet, maybe Hannibal could have eaten Thomas Harris, and saved our future by sparing us from any further literary assaults.Summary: don't buy this book. If you feel you MUST throw your money away on something, buy a ball-peen hammer and hit yourself in the head with it. The ensuing headache will make you feel the same way I felt after reading this horrible book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"...this would easily do the job. English not being my native language, I have to point out the beautifully composed English in which Harris writes. It also helped me deal with the gory details which were depicted tastefully though. Harris really has an psychological eye which reflects in his characters. It was captivating to learn more about Starling and Lecter. Most suspense novels concentrate more on the gore and less on the characters but that never was Harris' besetting sin. Puzzling though was 'the explanation' Lecter's insanity got but acceptable still. I won't even go to the final&eacute; which was more surprising I could imagine, disturbing even. As a distiction to his three previous Hannibal-books, this lacked some sense of reality. 'Dragon' and 'Lambs' were both blood-dripping and gory but still quite 'real'. Hannibal FELT like fiction. These kind of characters just don't exist. Still, the book is enjoyable and great suspense. While reading this, I had to check every closet and peer vigilantly at all entrances. Horror has no need for reality, nor does the sub-conscious mind and it's just where this book sets its goal -and makes a hit."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading the reviews of readers who disliked this novel, I can understand why they didn't like it. If you want to read a novel with clear-cut heroes and villians, this book is not for you. If you like the classic happy ending, read elsewhere. Harris' main characters in this novel, with the possible exception of Mason, are more real than many fictitious characters. They are not all good or all bad- they can experience ambivalence and in order to enjoy this novel, the reader must be able to tolerate that. I struggled with my feelings of empathy for Hannibal throughout this novel. I was shocked to find myself actually rooting for him, and I was disdained that I was acutally pleased with ending. I like that Harris has created a portrait of reality in that nothing is ever Black and White. Besides that, I found this book to be a great read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I looked forward to Mr. Harris' new book, but was disappointed fairly early on. Did not contain the peculiar &quot;empathy&quot; I found in Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon; also seemed to depend too heavily on SOTL for support. In addition, the gruesome details and characters, I feel, overwhelmed the psychological dexterity of his previous novels."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Excellent. Thats all there is to say. This story was excellent, the characters were great, i find no fault for this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris might want to consider skipping some of his tonier reference manuals and re-reading his own work. Did anyone notice that a lot of the gore in &quot;Hannibal&quot; was recycled from &quot;Red Dragon?&quot; And after 11 years, there's really no excuse to make inaccurate reference to &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot; because Frederica Bimmel was NOT a &quot;floater,&quot; as Harris has Starling recall. She was better hidden than Buffalo Bill's other victims, a key plot point and one of the ways she tracks down Jame Gumb. In fact, Bimmel wasn't even the dead girl from the autopsy scene in &quot;Silence.&quot; That's just sloppy. The travelogue in Florence was tedious at first, but I got into it more as time went on. I don't think we should have revisited every &quot;Silence&quot; character, though. I did like the risk he took by explaining Hannibal's past -- it made him a bit less cartoonishly evil. And I did like the ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I enjoyed the style of writing in Hannibal by Thomas Harris; though it took some pages to get used to. I don't want cookie cutter novels; always the complete sentence, always in the proper tense, always in one pov. It was a delight to see Harris write in this &quot;fresh&quot; style, and I do believe he has earned the right to offer us this style.As for the story, it was well-paced and very enjoyable. I didn't think the scenes were overly described...I needed it to get a feel of the atmosphere. Nor did I think it was too gruesome, for it helped in defining the characters and the degree of their motivation...every character was fascinating.The ending...though strange to me, is one that I have accepted.p.s. Anthony Hopkins brilliant portrayal of Hannibal had me reading and re-reading all of Hannibal's diaglogue, until I could hear him as Hopkin's would have portrayed him."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"These reviews seem to be mostly split between people who liked the book up until the ending and gave it one star, and folks who loved the whole thing and gave it 5. Count me in that category. Sure the book comes to a surprise conclusion but that's the fun of it. I will say that Chapter 100, the &quot;dinner party,&quot; was the most amazing eight pages of fiction that I have ever read in my life. I can't get that scene out of my mind!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Well, my review is in..&quot;Hannibal&quot; is....* Hilariously implausible * Fatuous...in a disturbing way! * Plotted in suprisingly awkward form! * Ugly...rather than interesting! * A seeming attempt to extend an existing story line &quot;to the limits.&quot; (It overshoots the mark...wildly...like a drunken barnstormer.) * A BIG disappointment!Horror has never been so...well, just plain sophmorically inane. So much for expectations.Book buyers: save your money; don't encourage this degrading, despressing bilge.Library patrons: don't worry if your name is far down the waiting list. This one will make your sunny day at the beach seem like a year cleaning loos in an insane asylum.Yuk!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After anxiously awaiting the return of Dr. Lecter, I bought &quot;The Book&quot;, planned out a rainey Sunday and prepared to read. One third into this mess, I thought something was wrong with me that I this book was so bad.....I then realized when it took over two weeks to finish this potpouri of garbage, that it wasn't me. This is such a cheap shot at what was a super series about a well-crafted demon, that it defies description. Most reviewers didn't like the ending, and true, it was terrible. It did, however, match the nonsensical story line. I am so disappointed! I'd give it 1/2 thumb up and advise all to skip it!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If you loved the movie &quot;Highlander&quot;, and then were disgusted at how the sequel was so bad in so many ways that it almost dragged down its brilliant precursor with it, you'll know what it's like to read this book. Not worth the time nor the money."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While I found this piece had the elements to keep my attention, pulling me in and driving me to turn each page, the ending was a major disappointment. Especially in the case of Starling, the conclusion is entirely out of character. It doesn't show a different side of her character, instead the book displays an unbelievable side. However, we've been set up for one more piece in the series. Should Harris decide to write it, I hope the final conclusion is more satisfying than this one."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book is deep, dark, at times disturbing and left me with the sensation of crawling skin and the need to go for a run and take a shower.And then I loved it!The bottom line is that this book is interesting, thought provoking, beautifully written stuff. It is, however, very different form T.H.'s other works.(god forbid) This is not the third chapter in some cliff-hanger series. It is new journey with some old and familiar faces.I think the true message lies well below the surface and requires the reader to leave his or her usual comfort zone to truly appreciate it. Which, in my oppinion, is a good thing. The book is simply a bit dangerous. If that's not your thing you will probably be disappointed. But if your feeling bold give it a shot...you might enjoy the experience. Just take a gander at what it's stirred up on this review page."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Prologue: I'm rarely scared by books. I've read Dragon and Lambs.The Good: Beautiful, ornate language. Characters are weird, but verge on being possible. Got a good laugh now and then.The Bad: The Dolarhydization of Lecter. Middle portion of the book ends up being tangential, hardly relevant. Many years of wishes -- the return of Graham, an epic confrontation, etc., may go unfulfilled. Verger shows a stunning lack of knowledge about the Bible. (Translated from Hebrew to Latin, indeed!)The Ugly: Mason Verger.Conclusion: The Dolarhydization of Lecter leaves us with the same question we faced in Dragon: Will the killer's love for a woman calm his ravaged soul, or will the demons win out? I won't answer that, and I don't think Harris did, either.This isn't a crime novel like Dragon, or whatever the heck Lambs was supposed to be. Rather, it's a book about weird people doing strange things. You have to admit, there are some weird ones here: Lecter, Verger, and their father, Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Yes, Hannibal Lecter is one sick puppy. Anyone who entered this book without understanding that single fact no doubt was appalled by the mind of the protagonist. There is more to this book than gore, however. Mr. Harris's writing is so elegant and so polished that it is easy to fall in love with the words on the page. Combine this talent with the author's marvelous sense of irony and you have a book that is gratifying on many levels. The characters, from the haunted Clarice Starling to the haunting Mason Verger, are complete and all too believable; the plot, while twisted, is not convoluted, and the narrative is compelling. It is the way the words are put together, though, that made this book so satisfying. It is at once gruesome, disturbing and extremely beautiful."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Silence of the Lambs was one of the best books I'd ever read, and I was keen to see what lay in store for our leading characters. I personally think Harris took them in the best direction possible. The ending is sheer perfection because we have ended the book by joining with Lecter's mind. This is his fantasy and our reality. Why settle for the boring compromise of Starling blowing him away, becoming vindicated by the FBI and living her life out as a senior weapons expert (like Brigham)? No - this elevates everything and puts these characters on a different - and surreal - plane. Let's face it - we left the confines of Earth as soon as we reached Florence. Things got hazier from then on. At the end - we are ALL under the influence of Lecter's drugs. Our skulls have been removed in situ."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I should have put the book down and walked away while I still had the chance but I had to know how it ended. As I read the last page I was just plain angry! I hoped that Mr. Harris would continue the strength, intelligence and unwavering sense of right and wrong he had brought forth in his characters in &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. Boy, was I wrong. I have can't remember being so disappointed in a sequel to any book in a long time. It seems that all his chacters have taken a leave of their senses and turned,well, just plain stupid. Also, this book was probably one of the most graphic(violence), disgusting books I have ever set eyes on. There easily could have been less &quot;blood and guts&quot; and more imagination. For my money, I would definately skip this one!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Great book until the end. The whole book had great detail, but the ending felt like it was thrown together. Kind of like the ending of King's &quot;IT&quot;. A bunch of build up then a fizzle. I finished reading it feeling cheated."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is a bitter disappointment. The real horror in Harris' &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence..&quot; was the mundane, familiar nature of the terrible forces wandering among us undetected. This book turns Lecter into a cartoon character, whose powers are superhuman, and introduces others so other-wordly evil they begin to be funny; they certainly are completely unbelievable. Starling remains a three-dimensional character, but that's as far as it goes, folks. Harris may write beautifully, but in this book he has substituted gore for everything else--plot, depth of characterization, and talent."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is a superb book. Thomas Harris excells himself in getting into Dr Lectors mind, not only in the story, but actually taking you there. Im generally not an avid reader, however, I liked The silence of the lambs, that I went and bought the Red Dragon, and Hannibal doesnt let you down. If you have seen the film of the silence of the lambs, read the book, as the film does it no justice. Though it does help to paint a picture in your mind of what the characters look like and the way they behave. A fantastic read, which I strongly recommend."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This was a book I really wanted to read. I thought the Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs were both excellent books. Hannibal however was a major disappointment. So much so that in the future I'll have to cafefully consider investing anymore time with a book written by Harris.I think part of the problem here is that Mr. Harris has come to believe his own press. Throughout the book his own personality is clearly inserted in words given to various characters. His sermonizing against religion and belief in God gets very tiresome. The author comes across as condescending and arrogant.One thing that always bothers me in books is when an author writes about an area I am familiar with in an uneducated manner. It ruins the writer's credibility. Also, I once read a scientist who said that half-baked ideas come from people that read above their comprehension level. In physics, Mr. Harris clearly was reading above his comprehension level. His explanations and musings about the big crunch showed an utter lack of understanding. He showed a total lack of knowledge on why this theory was pursued or it's implications if it were grounded in truth. A \\"genius\\" like his character, Hannibal Lecter wouldn't have been so confused.The characters were bleak and almost universally amoral. The ending was ridiculous. The last 60 pages tedious. I started to give the book 2 stars, because he is a good technical writer. The faults are too strong for me to recommend the book to anyone."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I cant believe you people who hate the ending! For one thing Hannibal did not really EAT people literally! He simply did not like rude people which it says again and again in teh book! REMEMBER? So him and Clarice who had both been treated very rudely by practicably EVERYONE in the book went away together. Wouldnt' YOU? Lecter as a character and as a person was HOT HOT HOT! I like when he gave the pigs the evil eye. GO LECTER! And they did not literally eat brains since that is what everyone is thinking, it was a SYMBOL of what they did not like in the world of rude people. There is more to this book than people understand! Now I cant' wait to read Silence of the Lambs!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What a diabolical offering. My question is &quot;did Thomas Harris really write this?&quot; The book is riddled with spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. Where is the grace with which Silence of the Lambs was written? The characters (esp. Hannibal) are all reduced to caricatures. The crime scenes are so over-the-top that instead of being left with that feeling of abject horror, you just skim through them.In Silence of the Lambs, Harris displayed an awesome understanding of human nature and the tiny flaws in our characters which make us so intriguing. Reading Hannibal, I was left with a feeling that he was stumbling about, not really getting to grips with his characters. It reads like it was written by a committee.I hope 'they' don't make a movie out of this."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; I was anxiously awaiting &quot;Hannibal.&quot; Boy, was I disappointed in Thomas Harris' latest effort. His new book is over-the-top, pretentious dross. Mason Verger is a surviving victim of Lecter who is hideously scarred and paralyzed from the encounter. He spends his life hooked up to a respirator in the family mansion (Muskrat Farm) dreaming of extracting revenge against Lecter by having him captured then eaten alive by large, vicious, selectively-bred swine. This is just plain STUPID. Why does Harris feel the need to include a day care center for welfare kids in this mansion where Verger watches the kids play via video camera? Another ridiculous character is Rinaldo Pazzi. Pazzi is the Chief Inspector of Police in Florance, Italy on the trail of Lecter. He apparently is capable of instantaneously solving crmes by his super-human sense of hearing and smell. What? The over-the-top characterizations continue as Lecter now seems to be the smartest man alive. Lecter also becomes this sympathy-seeking victim who ends up revealing details of his past like a guest on a really bad episode of &quot;Donahue.&quot; Toward the end of the book I found myself not even caring how it was going to end. I was hoping that somehow the killer swine would consume all involved. Perhaps Mr. Harris should stay in seclusion or gone on to different subject matter."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal was great! It kept me on the edge of my seat and I never wanted to put it down. It was very suspenseful and had a very surprising ending. If you liked Silence of the Lambs you'll love Hannibal."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It totally astounds me to see the number of people giving &quot;Hannibal&quot; one star because they hated the ending. Have you forgotten Harris is a horror novelist, not a detective story writer? Don't confuse dashed expectations with bad writing. Our worst nightmares SHOULD be profoundly disturbing. I agree with the writer who perceived the ending as Harris' way of thumbing his nose at Hollywood. But don't call the book poor writing, please!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It's not easy being the 1134th reviewer of this novel, as mine will get lost in the chaff. However, I truly felt compelled to write a couple of notes about this eagerly awaited sequel by an author who rarely publishes. I absolutely loved &quot;Hannibal&quot; and was gratified that I didn't pay much attention to the &quot;mixed&quot; reviews I had read. Yes, there is a grotesque quality to Harris' writing, but it was much less offensive than I had anticipated and was a rich seasoning to the character of the antagonists. I must admit, I saved money by buying the abridged version of the book on tape and now will read the entire hardcover book to get every syllable Thomas Harris wrote. Please Mr. Harris, write another novel and don't wait another five years to publish!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I never thought I'd fall in love with a cannibal, but Dr. Lechter isn't just any cannibal, he's the cannibal with good taste. Or shall we say, exquisite taste? His behavior isn't always in the best taste but who cares, it's always surprisingly gory and fits the scene. No, it isn't &quot;literature,&quot; but Harris does have a way of tingling the palette with juicy phrases and satisfyingly detailed descriptions, especially of places, especially Florence, Italy. It's the best &quot;good read&quot; I've had for awhile and I didn't want it to end. Worst thing about it is Harris' inability to develop female character (he's a bit light on the male character as well). I have no idea why Hector Lechter would be the least bit interested in Clarice Starling who appears to be a dull, not overly bright hick. But perhaps I'm simply envious. Or perhaps Hector lacks good taste in his interpersonal as opposed to culinary relationships. Can't wait for the sequel and hope I live to see it (took 9 years for this one!)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;Hannibal&quot; is a beautifully written book about the unspeakable. Like Lecter himself, it is merciless, haunting and unforgiving. It picks you up by the scruff of the neck, shakes you up and pierces your consciousness. It will stay with you long after you put it down. If you are looking for a glib, undemanding read, this is not a book for you. If you are looking for more of Silence Of The Lambs, you'll be disappointed. If you are afraid to look beyond the obvious, you will be confused. But if you believe you are beyond harm, if your wit is quick and your eye observant...then go with Thomas Harris as he takes you down Dr Lecter's memory palace. And if you pay attention to the works of art along the way and if you know your bible well - then maybe, just maybe, you'll emerge with your world-view intact. But don't count on it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris wrote two outstanding books about the psychology and the behavior of serial killers. Both &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; were exceptional because the text managed to combine images of violence - eye popping at that - with brilliant elucidations of the mental processes at work AND birth the character of Hannibal (as well as that of Starling.)So many other writers have tried with uneven success to follow Harris' approach, and so many films have used the serial killer theme, that the whole genre was exhausted. There seemed to be nothing left to say on the topic.The mine of the serial killer themed books and films was so completely exhausted that simply knowing a work of popular art contained this topic caused me to avoid it.Which is part of the reason I found &quot;Hannibal&quot; to be such a triumph. Harris was almost certainly using either opera or symphonic arrangements when he wrote this book. He went deeply into the title character and the Starling character to create a work of fiction which is (amazingly) fresh and innovative.&quot;Hannibal&quot; will be considered the masterpiece of his few novels, and there is not the slightest doubt that both Hopkins and Foster will reprise their roles in a film version.The conclusion, which has been criticized by many readers, was completely believable. You give a psychiatrist access to as much knowledge and psychoactive drugs as Hannibal had, coupled to the level of intelligence he presented, and the result was almost inevitable... if he wanted it. And THAT kept me in suspence for even the last dozen pages."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Where oh where to begin? The supporters of this &quot;novel&quot; seem to have two points to make: this wasn't written to fit any preconceptions of a &quot;Silence of the Lambs II&quot; and that anyone expecting a sequel to the *movie* deserves to be disappointed. However, I would expect that an author having over ten years in which to craft a novel would have at least avoided the laughable stock characters and the hopelessly amateurish lapses in tense and character within paragraphs. The absolutely pathetic &quot;villian&quot; presented here would be more believable in one of the 70s-style hokey-jokey James Bond movies - eel, steroid-buffed lesbian and all. (I kept expecting a dwarf to pop out - that certainly wouldn't have been out of tune with the rest of the grotesqueries substituted in lieu of &quot;plot&quot;!) As for Lecter's great genius and &quot;taste&quot; for the finer things - what a commoner! The Great Hannibal comes across far more as an insecure bourgeois than as a sophisticated aesthete. Perhaps the most frightening part of this otherwise weak-beer book is Lecter's shopping spree - my jaw dropped, and so will yours, in his total buy-in into the consumer culture. Big-dollar &quot;big name&quot; stuffing for a picnic basket just does not impress me, and if Harris's point was to depict Lecter as one sick puppy, it was THIS part that did it for me. Through the course of the book, it becomes increasingly evident that Mr. Harris has spent far more time in cooking classes than in thinking about this book, and one more reference to the &quot;carbon steel&quot; knives would have been enough to justify a personal visit by Hannibal himself to the jumped-up gourmand that Harris seems to have become. And Bach and Dante' - really?! Our great genius doctor hasn't developed an appreciation for arts somewhat more OFF the well-trod paths? No Pettersson, or Janacek? Somehow, I'd think Lecter would have an affinity for Maturin's &quot;Melmoth&quot;, but nope - just the most very obvious will do, I suppose. And then the ending: by now, everyone must know that Clarice is (apparantly) lost to us, and dines in cannibal lust with the doctor. I'll agree with the book's supporters that there's no reason for Harris to meet his audience's expectations based only on a viewing of the &quot;Lambs&quot; film, but I read this gratuitous plot twist more as an angry slap at what Harris must see as the superficial fan than as an exercise in real horror.Many here have written how they &quot;finished it in one read&quot; - a day or so and you're done. Small wonder - at over 100 chapters in a 480 page book, with LARGE breaks, wide line-spacing, and pretty good-sized font, this just isn't THAT big of a book.Anyone looking for more &quot;horror&quot; with better research and less obvious disdain for their readers should try one of the Michael Slade novels, starting with &quot;Headhunter&quot;. For those seeking a more profound literary vision into horror, I'd recommend Arthur Machen and Algernon Blackwood. THIS literary AND culinary dog's breakfast is an embarrasment to the author and an insult to any intelligent reader."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is back! The book was fast paced..kept me on the edge of my couch and the ending is the big surprise. LOVED this book !!!!!!!!! Dining with Hannibal would be quite a 'shocking' experience."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I think a lot of people didn't like the book because it defied their perceptions. To give one star or two is clearly done out of frustration.As far as the writing is concerned, um, it's just as well written as The Silence of the Lambs (I have not read his two others - although I will read Red Dragon). I think the way Harris's flair changes according to the characters, the mood, and the action, is genius. I also love the way he involves his reader, at least on three occasions, in the story as if we were voyeurs. As an English Literature student this is some of the most unique writing I have seen.In general it was a very interesting story with a multiple of characters that you either love or truly hate (execpt for Pazzi, which you love and hate). The ending is strange (I admit), but I applaude Thomas Harris for his audacity. The final chapters are frustrating, but I always love a book that disturbs me even though it doesn't &quot;please&quot; me. The book certainly gets my respect and admiration.I wish Mr. Harris would come out and defend his book. This is not a time to be reclusive. I also hope the movie happens with EVERYONE returning to play the same characters. Maybe the movie can satisfy those who were disappointed by the book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Is it possible to count the many evils of not only Dr.Lector but also of Carlo, Mason, Pazi etc? Harris seems to try to hit every button to make you squirm. And, there in lies the problem. Too much gore and not enough score. And, come on, Mr. Harris, putting in your own political opinions regarding the Clinton saga. Cheap. The ending did seem unrealistic. Unless you believe that Lector has brainwashed Clarice. It's worth the read.....in paperback."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris's ability as a writer enabled him to explore evil as it is capable of existing within a psychoanalytical framework. If there was a flaw it was that he tried to give Hannibal's psychopathic personality a human side. I felt his evil is too satanic to deserve it. That aside, Lecter was in true form on taste and cuisine."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris's ability as a writer enabled him to explore evil as it is capable of existing within a psychoanalytical framework.

There is no way this is a three star book, much less a 5 star one. I forced myself to finish it, and then regreted turning the last page. If only I had been like Billy Crystal in &quot;Harry met Sally&quot;, and read the last page of the book before starting it...(so if I died before finishing it, I'd know how it ended), I could have saved myself an entire weekend of agony and bitter disapppointment...not to mention the money wasted on this novel. When I heard the book was coming out, I couldn't wait...and started holding my breath for the movie. Now, given the unbelievable (and unforgivable) ending Harris chose to tack onto this list of incomplete sentences...I am no longer waitng to exhale. Mr. Harris, why????"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Eagerly the most anticipated book of 1999, Thomas Harris' &quot;Hannibal&quot; is a wonderfully written book. That being said, it has the most dissapointing endings ever put to paper. Hannibal Lecter is as chariming and frightening as ever, however, even he cannot make sense of the ending. Mr. Harris took 11 years to write the third Hannibal Lecter book. Perhaps he needed 12. Memo to Dino De Laurentis &amp; Co.: PLEASE, FOR THE MOVIE, CHANGE THE ENDING!!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Since reading &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; years ago, my husband and I have been anxiously awaiting Thomas Harris' sequel. Well, it was a long wait but worth it. &quot;Hannibal&quot; is brilliant. Thomas Harris does not disappoint his readers with this long-awaited sequel. It was so well written that I went out and bought another copy of &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; specifically so that I could reread the dialogues between Dr. Lechter and Clarice. Harris continued on beautifully from the first book to the second. I could easily envision Anthony Hopkins and Jodi Foster interacting once again. Can't wait for the movie! My only hope is that Mr. Harris doesn't wait TOO long to write the next book. GREAT JOB!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Those expecting a cookie-cutter sequel to Silence of the Lambs will be disappointed, but this book has other things to offer. The language is beautiful, especially during the time spent in Florence. And we finally get a small glimpse into Dr. Lecter's own background. Call me an oddball, but I like Hannibal Lecter! He isn't your garden variety serial killer who preys on innocent people on a whim. He mostly chooses to kill rude, horrible people with whom he is well acquainted or kills for self-preservation. (I'm not defending his actions but can't lump him in with maniacs who randomly choose their victims.) The ending is not what you would expect but I thoroughly enjoyed it! Can't imagine how they would make it into a movie, but if they do they had better cast Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins--no other 2 actors would do."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Oh..what drugs can do! Clarice is altered to the point that she is no longer the Clarice we knew in Silence of the Lambs. In fact she no longer needs drugs to &quot;adjust&quot; to the life she seems destined to live. If ever a movie is made, I bet the ending is changed!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As most fans of Thomas Harris, I looked foward to his latest book, Hannibal. The story of the strange bond between Hannibal Lecter and Clarise Starling is certainly worth telling, and for three quarters of the book, Mr. Harris is successful in giving his readers a fine, if not compelling story. As he continues the tale of the two characters and manages to introduce other characters who become integral to the plot. The problem is that they sometimes become as, or more important than the two protaganists. This leads to one of the problems with this book. The dependence on these characters and their stories push Lecter and Starling to the back burner. Ultimately the readers are not given what they were expecting...the intertwining of the lives of the the two main characters. Lecter and Starling, for most of the book, travel in parallel universes and we keep waiting for them to come together. Ultimately, of couse, they do, but then Mr. Harris switches gears on his readers and gives us such a bizzare and artificial ending that we feel cheated."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am an avid Hannible fan. As I was tearing through the pages waiting for the story to get better.....it didn't. Although Harris has a wonderful imagination and he sure didn't put it to use in the books ending. It was TERRIBLE. I recomend everyone to read this book, but is sure isn't another SILENCE. Wait for the softback."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am an avid mystery and psychological suspense reader and I have previously read all of Thomas Harris' books which I thoroughly enjoyed. However, I was completely disappointed in Hannibal and found it very difficult to complete. I actually forced myself to finish the book, hoping that at sometime, the climate would change and what I had come to expect from his writing would surface. At one point, towards the end, I thought this would happen; however, I found the ending of the book to be unbelievable and unprobable. It felt like a cop-out ending to just finish the book. In fact, the book seemed as if it was just written so the movie could be made. A completely commercial endeavor rather than good reading."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Finished the book at 3:00 am and couldn't sleep for another two hours. Definitely more disturbing than &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; or &quot;The Red Dragon&quot;. The relationship development between Hannibal Lechter and Clarice Starling was startling, horrifying and compelling.A must read for anyone who wants to know how it all ends."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Once upon a time there was a Suspense Novel, youngest of 3, who learned much from its older siblings but had ambitions of being something MORE than just a suspense novel. Therefore it dabbled in diverse arcana, from the historical to the pornographic to the peerlessly vile, allthewhile wallowing giddily in the autoerotic whirlwind of what it felt to be its own transformation, or, if you will, ascension and illumination. Unfortunately, this never entirely came about. The Little Suspense Novel came to be viewed as something of a stoner, a flake, a dreamer; and if he never entirely succeeded at the perhaps-impossible task he'd set out for himself, still, you had to admit he was less predictable, infinitely more interesting company that his older brother (Red Dragon) and sister (Silence of the Lambs), with the exception of the times when he felt the need to repeat them, shamelessly verbatim, imagining we would not notice... Well, one can't have everything (after all, Gehenna and Acheron don't share the same racks, do they?) and Hannibal certainly tops anything Clancy or Grisham or their ilk could ever possibly come up with. But as a writer, I took offense to rampant overuse of the word 'plosive' and to the long passages of truly cliched dialogue, replete with the some of the silliest takes on race and culture I've heard since the last time Dan Quayle attempted a speech. Mr. Harris ought to know better."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This sequel is an insult to the prior two books. If this plot is all Harris can do with his wicked but fascinating Dr. Lechter, he should have given his creative juices another decade to distill before bringing him back. Then,again, perhaps he should have stopped with &quot;Silence&quot;. Less is more in this case."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Had me by the hairs on the back of my neck. Hannibal is every bit as unpredictable and evil as ever. Love Clarice Starling again in this book though she takes a back seat to Hannibal. But HORRIBLE HORRIBLE ENDING. UNACCEPTABLE ENDING. RUINED THE WHOLE BUILD UP. PREPOSTEROUS."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I listened to the unabridged audiobook version of HANNIBAL, read by Daniel Gerroll. I have to admit that when the first tape started, Gerroll's voice wasn't one I thought would be suitable for this book. I quickly changed my mind, though, and eagerly anticipated each time I got into the car and could listen to this book. Gerroll did an excellent job with the different voices, accents, and vocal impediments of the characters that I almost forgive how wrong the ending of this book was for the story and its characters. Yes, it was gruesome and gory, but I felt the ending was just plain wrong. I've been a big fan of Harris in the past, but he just lost me with this one.At least I can say I enjoyed Gerroll's reading and will look for more readings from him."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After rave reviews I was expecting a novel I couldn't put down...not the case. My intentions were to pull the pin at chapter 75, but I perservered and finished it. I would have liked to have taken an axe to it...dr lecter style. Overall not a bad read...but not the best."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"For all of us Thomas Harris fans, the wait for Hannibal was a long one, and maybe he has spoiled us with Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. Hannibal is a very good book, but it does leave you a bit empty in the end.I felt the premise of searching for Lecter and the fate awaiting him was quite good. I thought though the book dragged a bit as we became familiar with the history of Florence, Italy. We want action! We want suspense! Who needs culture?Overall though, the book allows us into the twisted mind of Hannibal and gives us some insight to why he does what he does. Clarice is basically a non-factor till the end of the book. The Mason Verger character is also quite interesting.The ending left me scratching my head, but also made me smile as Harris had taken me for another wild ride. I only hope the next book comes out a little quicker."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris takes us into the world and mind of Hannibal Lector. He shows us his pleasures and pains. Verger is a very interesting character so hideous that you will be amazed at what he does. Part 2 is kind of dull but the rest of the book makes up for it. Very hard to put down."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The author provided such compelling details about the characters and the plot but gave a very weak ending. Good build up but not a good close which ruined the whole experience."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"On reading this book, which I thoroughly enjoyed doing, my first and foremost opinion was that a lot of the criticism it received since its release last year was unjustified. OK, so it may not have been as compelling or emotionally disturbing as 'The Silence of the Lambs' but 'Hannibal' still represents the work of a gifted writer. As the story takes a more up front, less psychologically challenging line in its latest outing, it still manages to grip you from the first page to the last. Mr Harris once again introduces a wonderful tone and expression to his narrative, and has a most admirable skill to end each chapter leaving you wanting more. What impressed me most about 'Hannibal' was how quickly the story seems to thread itself together and the amazingly short amount of time it took me to read it. As Harris opts for a more explicit reference to violence (in the form of man-eating pigs etc.) Dr Lecter maintains his marvellous presence in the saga, and his breathtaking character remains even more witty, intelligent and fascinating than Anthony Hopkins' great performance in the movie could make it. In my view, a real treat for the true Hannibal Lecter fans, only don't expect something better than 'The Silence of the Lambs'."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Before my review, let me state that no matter how much you think you can stomach, you should probably check with your doctor or shrink. This book is just plain sick (yes, that is a pun).The story is rather simple. Clarice, after local police mess up a drug bust she was in charge of, is told to find Lecter. On her way to find him, she meets Mason Verger, Lecter's only surviving victim. Barely surviving, anyway. See, Lecter gave him a drug, and told him to cut his face off. Now, in a bubble, he helps Clarice. But then he sells her to Krendler, who despises Clarice, after he made an offer, and she refused. Where is Lecter? Read to find out.I read this book after having seen the movie. And after reading it, I would change my rating of the movie down to a three. Why? It cuts out my favorite charactor: Margot Verger, Mason's sister, who he raped many times in their childhood. I don't like her because of her looks or something, but because she is interesting.And the movie leaves out a lot of Mason's and Hannibal's past. In this book, we learn just how sick he was, and why he liked his history book (that bit was just plain sick, no pun intended). And what of Hannibal's sister, Mischa? Ah, can't win them all.The book is rather well written, and plotted. A little too much dialougue though. Luckily there is a nice amount of pieces that make you go &quot;Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!&quot;. And that is just what gives the book its charm!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Tomas Harris has given us &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot; but in my opinion this book tops both of those. From start to finish, the book is chilling, riveting and uncanny.This edge-of-your-seat masterpiece finds the infamous Hannibal Lecter posing as Dr. Fell, a curator in Florence, Italy. F.B.I. agent, Clarice Starling, is once again hot on Lecter's trail. However, she has a few problems of her own following a &quot;shoot-out gone wrong&quot; and is suspended from active duty. However, we all know something as trivial as a little suspension could not possibly prevent Clarice from continuing her pursuit of Lecter.Meanwhile on another continent, an Italian detective by the name of Pazzi is also hot on the trail of Lecter for reasons of his own - a payoff from one of Lecter's former victims, Mason Verger. Pazzi gains access to the FBI's Most Wanted List and discovers the charming Dr. Fell is none other than Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Unfortunately, Pazzi's adventurous quest for financial gain leads to his untimely demise.At first glance, Verger's deformities might elicit a degree of sympathy from the reader. When you discover he is a child molester who actually brought about his own disfigurement, with a little help from Lecter, of course, you will quickly lose any campassion for this evil man. Verger has his own self-serving justice in mind when Lecter is returned to him - a very slow and painful one. Ironically, Verger falls victim to his own heinous plan and meets the fate he had planned for Lecter.The end finds a new twist when Lecter save's Clarice Starling's life. It is clear we have not seen the end of Dr. Hannibal Lecter for, once again, he escapes. If you are looking for a great book that will keep you reading through the night, this is it!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I heard raving reviews about this book from family and friends. Having enjoyed both The Red Dragon and especially The Silence of the lambs , I was ready for a disturbing thrill ride. Instead ,I got a dose of reality in that I wasted several hours of my life reading this book. It started out promising , but quickly went down hill. The shootout in the beginning up to the time Clarice recieved Hannibal's 1st letter proved to be a nice beginning to what looked like a great story line. this is where it started falling apart. There was to many references to Lecter being something imortal instead of just being a brilliant degenerate.It would have served the story line better if there was more...or NO references to his or his sisters young life. It was touched on just enough to make you wonder why it was mentioned at all. There was no major revelation on why he became who he is.If it wasnt for the completely moronic ending I would have given this 2 stars. With the ending ,Thomas Harris cheated his readers. It seemed like the transcript must have sat on a shelf while he thought of an ending. Not able to , he just slapped together what he thought would be shocking. Instead it was just plain stupid.Do yourself a favor , read The Silence of the lambs again instead."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was surely not disappointed by this one. The descriptions of Lecter's stay in Florence was so wonderful I could almost smell the dust and parchement. I loved finding out what has driven the good Dr. all along. The method to the madness. I did think that Starling seemed a little flat this time. She rolls over too easily to the Boys' Club. I give Thomas Harris points for creativity for the ending. I really didn't see that coming. I have been posessed by this book. I am dying to see the movie!!! And for Lecter part IV!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I didn't have the problem with the ending that others have had, but I felt the book was too forced. Why were characters such as Barney and Jack Crawford brought back if they were not going to be utilized at all? (particularly Barney -- I just didn't buy him going to work for Verger. Did this intelligent, capable, courteous man from Silence of the Lambs morph into something else between books?) I think the biggest problem was that Doctor Lecter is worthy of our fascination and grudging admiration when he is the hunter, but when he becomes the hunted our sensibilities as readers must undergo a dramatic shift that most of us are uncapable of adjusting to. Also, since Paul Krendler has been such an unworthy adversary for Clarice (unlike Jame Gumb), we are left unmoved and unsatisfied by his fate at the hands of Lecter, and therefore unwilling to suspend our disbelief at Clarice's conversion. I hope she has a happy life of luxury with the good doctor. The lambs may have stopped screaming, but I'm not sure the reading public has."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'll be honest. I read this book because I knew they were making a movie out of it. After reading it though, I am glad my favorite actress Jodie Foster decided to pass on this movie.Having said that, I actually enjoyed many parts of the book. I try not to compare it with other books, but I have to say that this one is better than most other mystery novels I've read. Many of them tend to be rather cliched, dry, and written with little taste. At least this one kept me guessing.The most delicious character is Hannibal Lecter, and as the focus of this book, we explored his childhood history and tried to understand why he might have turned out the way he did. He is a sort of archetypal icon, a personification of id. He's superhuman in his character, but holds human feelings for his Mischa and Starling. Harris intended for us to root for the villain, much as we might root for the Phantom of the Opera. Too much of a cliche? Perhaps.Starling's character was a disappointment to me. I certainly pitied her and loved her, but in my opinion, the story didn't do her justice. She was a constant victim of her surroundings, a puppet with a hundred puppeteers. Each time she does something in her free-will, she promptly loses control. Not the Starling I remembered.And the ending...well, let readers judge that for themselves."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is an amazing book. Thomas Harris the author used amazing details and creativity to write this thrilling book. It kept me on the edge of my seat. The amount of care that Harris used to make this grafic novel is scarey. The book is about Dr. Hannibal Lector, an excaped killer. He is a well known doctor, genius and lunitic. He has killed many people and he is known to eat his victims. He has been atlarge for seven years. In this book Millionaire Mason Verger, the only person who has ever survived Hannibal. He will stop at nothing to get revenge on Hannibal. He uses his large funds and many connections to hunt Lector down. Everyone in this novel wants somthing and the greedier they get the more likely they are to recieve the rath of Lector. Harris puts you on a roller coaster ride in this book. That gets summed up in a twist ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I picked up this book in the middle of finals and rushed through the rest of my tests so that I could finish it. It was amazing. I was actually disappointed as I went backwards through the series because the other books were less graphic and delved less into Hannibal Lecter's character. The fast paced beginning and twisted ending kept me guessing, and there was always something different. I thought that exploring Lecter's past added a somewhat human quality to his character. His interactions with normal people were interesting because they showed that this wasn't a mindless mass murderer like Jame Gumb or Francis Dolarhyde from the first two books. He didn't kill random people, and I think the Lecter murder count in this book was actually lower than in the other two, because there were other monsters in the book, and he actually wasn't the worst of them. A fascinating story, and a great read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read Hannibal the day it first came out, so this pot's been simmering for a looong time. When I first read it, I felt the way I had when I first saw the movie &quot;Seven&quot;. Disappointed, disgusted, and slightly in shock, almost as if I'd actually experienced the events. Then I went back and read it again. I wonder if Harris wanted to just put an end to these characters and shut us up, but there are some great aspects to the book. There's a lot of whining about his tense changing device--as if he didn't use it &quot;Silence.&quot; It makes everything more immediate, and pulls the reader right into the scene. 'Clarice walked down the corridor'--yeah yeah, I can visualize that, big deal, she's already done it,but--'Dr. Lecter stands in the middle of the cell...'--and oh no!, I'm right there in the room LOOKING at him RIGHT NOW, protected only because he doesn't want to escape....yet. Very effective, at least to a reader with an overactive, and suggestible imagination. Regarding the end, you need to pay attention to Lecter's 'cocktail-hour' advice to Clarice. That's Harris, speaking to us, telling us to get a proper sense of perspective, to relax and view what's about to happen with a sense of humour. I don't know about the movie, I'd prefer the book's ending, now that I've gotten used to it. If you haven't read it yet, hope you enjoy it. If you have, and hated it, stop a minute. Think about how a truffle might taste, find out what a 'memory palace' is, gather your sense of humour (helps if you favor the macabre) and give &quot;Hannibal&quot; another go."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If you read Thomas Harris Silence of the Lambs and also watched the movie it kept you in suspense. If you read Hannibal&quot; it will keep you in suspense and off the edge of your seat. I spent a couple of sleepless nights wanting to finsh the book. It starts out slow, but if you remember, Dr Lecter was and is a very educated man with fine manners and qualities. He has exquisite tastes and knows he art very well. Mason Verger is after him - well look what happen to him earlier. Ah fate will put Clarice Starling the FBI agent and Dr. Lector together again, but with such a surprising twist. You will enjoy reading Hannibal it will keep you wondering if Mason Verder will capture Hannibal, but the surprise towards the end of the story will shock you and I promise you will enjoy reading Hannibal. Certainly hope Thomas Harris will write a sequel to Hannibal - wow. I certainly hope that when and if they make a sequel to the movie (Hannibal) that it will star Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins and that the screenplay follows the book. Superb! Forgive me for borrowing one of Bard's words to the effects of....&quot;Revenge is best served on a cold platter...&quot; Enjoy reading Hannibal!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Wow. Not exactly a formulaic sequel, is it? This is a meaty -- to say nothing of ballsy -- treasure, a cap to the Hannibal Lecter trilogy that far exceeds its predecessors. (No small triumph for author Thomas Harris, considering the quality of RED DRAGON and THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.) Dr. Lecter finally gets top billing here, and he is revealed, explained, examined in glorious detail.This is a stunning work, really, perhaps the boldest performance ever logged by a modern author who had previously met with acclaim. Here Harris breaks from the good-guys-chase-bad-guy mold to give us something new, with two immensely complex -- and ultimately entangled -- characters to feast on.Granted, the first one hundred pages drag some -- there is a ramping-up to HANNIBAL's beginning. But the next hundred pages tell a chilling, super-literate and almost fully self-contained sub-story, and from there the fun begins.And the ending? Ballsy, ballsy.I refuse to spoil any more of your fun.Now we start to hope that Hollywood will grow the guts to tell this story as it was written."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Feel let down that we must know what truly moved Lecter to his deadly deeds. Intersting tho, that it included WW2. Whatever his motivation, he did eat the face of an innocent nurse. Remember? Let that recall be a numbing moment in the read. But where else could Clarice and Hannible go but together into the night? I feel almost short-sheeted by this easy end. Hannibal is now a sex symbol, someone women should find ultimately attractive, ultimatley seductive? Pump me full of drugs before I watch my nemesis eaten. Is that the excuse for Clarice letting go of everything she felt so sure of? Was her beauty the driving force? What if Clarice was no beauty? What is she was common? Drugs or not I do not believe it and yet I do. Wonderful read. Couldn't put it down but was so regretful that I read it. That's my review."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What a dissapointment. It is not bad for a casual read but lacks the texture of Thomas Harris earlier books. The plot is inconsistent and the characters are sketchy at best. I hope the next Harris yarn is vastly more entertaining."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I though that Silence...was much better, but this book was very odd, very gory, and had a very surprising ending. If you liked Silence and Red Dragon, you will enjoy this book. It was a little slow at times but by the time I was 1/2 the way through, I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In the years between Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal, Harris has changed his writing style. Hannibal is written in an omniscient voice which can be distracting. Harris's sabbatical in Italy greatly influenced this book. Be prepared for lots of Italian! It is a good read, but I found the ending disturbing and not believable in terms of the characters' morality. I hope the movie will take a different turn."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Unlike a lot of the people reviewing this book, I have no problem with Harris' plotting or use of his characters - What I do have a problem with is the fact that he is a really bad writer. I am not sure what his editor was thinking - he or she certainly wasn't editing the book - Harris has an infuriating habit of shifting tenses from present tense, to past tense, to future tense, often in the course of one paragraph. He seems unable to decide what his role as a narrator is - sometimes he acts as an omiscient narrator with insight into the characters thoughts and what is to happen in the future, sometimes he writes as an impartial observer, sometimes he just writes whatever comes to mind. He also appears to have failed to do any research beyond what he knows already - I don't know how accurate his descriptions of Florence are, but if his two mentions of Australia are anything to go on, I fear the entire book is innaccurate. He mentions tourists dropping Australian quarters (which do not and have never existed) into the collection box, and speaks of Australia's large gypsy population. I am afraid this is wrong. If Mr Harris was using Australia as an exotic place that noone really knows much about, he should have done a little bit of fact checking. Couple all of this with some of the most annoying metaphors ever written (eg a character's head moving toward the light &quot;like a sunflower&quot;) and you have a book that needed a great deal of editing to get it into a form that should have been published. However, considering how much money &quot;Hannibal&quot; has made Mr Harris, my comments are probably unnecessary. Loved the plot, loved the ending, just hated reading the book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Pompous, pretentious, pitiful! I have read many of the reader reviews - they were a far better read. I will not see the movie, nor read a future book. Disappointing drivel.Unfaithful (to say the least) to the characters he created.Try &quot;Certain Prey&quot; (John Sandford) this is an author whose sequels stand up to the originals."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I first listened to the reading of Hannibal on audio tape and was amazed with the author's use of colorful language and eloquent expressions. In fact I was so moved from listening to the book, I felt compelled to also read it for fear I may have missed some little tidbit. It was just as wonderful the second time around. I thank Mr. Harris for having the integrity to write a book that tied all the pieces together in such a delightful and delectable way."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If you really sunk your teeth into &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; you have no choice but to read this sequel. Parts of it did have bite. However, it did drag in spots. The ending was ridiculous."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is certainly a page-turner that will keep readers moving forward. In that respect, it's a successful book. That having been said, I think that much of the content is thrown out there just to try to turn our stomachs. At least in Red Dragon there was the police procedural. Harris offered a high level of detail in describing the investigation and the eventual breakthrough that led to the discovery of the killer's identity. In Hannibal, it seems, Harris has elected to eschew the finer points of murder and murder investigations in order to offer up a stomach-churning series of references to eating flesh.One of the most suspenseful moments in the book is Clarice Starling's return to Lecter's former abode. After that it's more of a morbid adventure romp.And I really wish that Harris would learn that when one sentence stops and another begins, the correct piece of punctuation one should use is the period, not the comma.As a none-to-serious summer read, this is an enjoyable book, but I'm not going to any barbecues anytime soon."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I found this novel to to the best of the three by Mr. Harris about Hannibal Lector. I particularly enjoyed the teasing out of parallel developments between Lector and Starling, which explains why he was originally attracted to her. I will not give away the ending except to say that the villian gets his just deserts."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Once the reader can get past their pre-determined relationships with the characters that readers met in Silence of the Lambs and just let the author take us on his diabolical road trip, you will be rooting once again for the bad guys and the complete ruination of the so-called good guys. Harris gleefully leads us like a cow with a ring in our nose through twists and turns, all the while planting little seeds of what is to come. The reader will already be saying, &quot;no, that cannot be happening&quot; but with a turn of a page or to, not only are we there but we are delightfully appalled at the outcome. Read it with someone you love!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Finally the much awaited sequel to &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; was out in paperback..a year after the hardbound version made an apperance on the book shelves...somehow to a very silent audience...Silence of the Fans...me dont understand..?Picked up the paperback as soon as i set my eyes on it...and in fact to get on to it..i hurried through the last few pages (or should i say images..! ) of Micheal Ondaatje's superb &quot;Anils Ghost&quot;..... Well, before i knew it ..i was in Clarice Starling and Dr Hannibal Lecter territory..reliving the almost visual horrors of Silence....I felt at the end of it..dissappointed ..that the sequel was written for the sake for the sake of capitalizing on the huge wave of Dr Lecter Hannibal which existed after the book and the superbly adapted movie....Felt cheated by how the author resolved the larice Starling and Dr Lecter relationship...a relationship which had streaks of mentorship...buddyhood and ill-look-over-you in the earlier book ,i was positively disgusted by how they kinda ended up in the end of this &quot;episode&quot; of Harris's &quot;Hannibal&quot; series..!Though there are some very well written passages, with classic twists and turns.....which keep you at the edge of your seat and up late into the night...at the end of the 500 odd pages ..i was left bereft of 2 charcters of popular fiction ..who had intrigued me...teased me...been with me as enigma's long after thier resolutions were attempted by thier creator...but after Hannibal ..i really do not care what happens to the cannibalistic doctor and the sharp FBI agent...Alas thats how a literary bubble bursts i guess! ...."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thank you Mr. Harris for another pleasant read. Your novels, the intriguing characters, transporting locales, and utterly morbid plotlines, are resplendent in a dark fascination. Oddly, perhaps, Barney posesses me most. Sharing Lecter's dark desire, with the focus and and intesity of a Marine (do I identify?)- astounding. All of the others, yes it was wonderful seeing them outside my memory castle, to become involved with their thoughts once again, to meet the newest persons, and imagine what may be next for them. Many will besmirch Mr. Harris (and Dr. Lecter? ) for such an ending. Dismiss them. The monster will posess you entirely- rest assured that to meet &quot;Il Dotorre&quot; will result in your loss of humanhood. Don't come near the glass..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"'Hannibal' fleshes out the main characters better than any of the other novels. Clarice's true character is finally fully revealed; just like the metamorphosis of Lecter from 'Red Dragon' to 'Silence of the Lambs'. Some people may disagree with Clarice's transformation, but I couldn't image it written better. Lecter himself is also fully realized as you see into his past and possible motives.The only misses by the author would have to be the real villians of the novel, Mason Verger and his cronies. Their exploits dragged an otherwise very impressive book down."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris gives us what we want. The Good Dr. Lector in rare form. Harris clearly means to avoid the same ole hackneyed plot ploys and works overtime to do it. Hannibal is living in Florence. And FBI Agent Starling is about to get the boot, after a drug bust goes terribly wrong, when the good doctor sends her note. And the chase is on. The ending is quite frankly one of the most daring, most original ones in horror fiction I have read in years. Unfornately I can't tell you. The book also contains the answer as to why Hannibal became a Cannibal. Check it out."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal was on okay read. I was expecting a bit more. I also had some problems on how it was writen. It seems that at times there was a narraitor telling the story, then at times it was as if it was in thrid person. I also didn't like the ending, even though someone told it to me. Over all it wasn't that bad. I'd say read it if you have nothing better to do and you can get it in paperback."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"So, after all the horrors witnessed by Dr. Lecter, from his troublesome childhood, to brilliant insanity, to being locked in that windowless Baltimore dungeon for so many years, what *is* it that finally makes him scream aloud?-- Flying transatlantic coach next to a screaming baby and a fidgety preadolescent. Hey Doc, I been there too; I feel your pain.Harris is a powerful writer, and the books is fraught with images that stuck with me for a while: a flashback to Lecter's childhood. An unusual meal towards the end. I shan't spoil these scenes with details, suffice it to say that their vivid descriptions and, um, &quot;creative&quot; scenarios left me a tad green. But overall, such things are what I expected from the novel, and I wasn't disappointed. &quot;Silence&quot; is a hard act to follow... even for Mr. Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Another brilliant book by the master of suspense Thomas Harris. It is rendered in exquisite detail,and memorable for it's frightening,unflinching presentation of evil.The gore and disembowling only adds to it's peculiar charm.And Clarice Starling,cool,confident,sure-footed is back,forced to re-evaluate herself when a drug bust goes bad!Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am a teenager and a big fan of horror novels. When I picked up Hannibal (I didn't read Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs) I didn't know what to expect. My teacher recommended it. After reading over a hunderd pages in a day I was hooked. It is disgusting and gory. I recommend everyone with a strong stomach gets this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As opposed to some of the great three part books I have been reading lately, this set of stories grew progressively worse. Red Dragon absolutely blew me away. I thought that seeing the movie first would ruin this book to some degree, but it did not...Red Dragon was simply incredible. Silence of the Lambs was structured very well, but Hannibal seemed to fall short on so many levels. I enjoyed the Verger/Lecter parts, but even that building drama was anti-climactic. It's a good read compared to a lot of the other junk that's filling the shelves today, but Harris has raised his bar to high for Hannibal to stand by itself well."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thought the book was awesome. It was hard to put the book down once I started reading it - and after that I couldn't wait to pick it back up. I saw the movie during opening weekend, and it's safe to say the book put the movie to shame. There was so much left out of the movie that really made the plot such a chilling thriller.The book portrays much more insight into the characters like Hannibal, Clarice Starling, Krendler, and Mason Verger's ruthless sidekicks. If you liked the movie, you'll love the book.The only disappointment with the book is the ending. Like another reviewer said, Harris changes the morality of the character Clarice Starling by not being true to her character. She is a solid, honest, FBI Agent who stays true to that until the last 3 chapters. It made the character loose credibility for what she was throughout the whole book.The ending in the book is 100% better and different than the ending in the movie.READ THE BOOK - IT'S BETTER THAN THE MOVIE!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book took more than ten years to hit the shelves and reads like a novel that took ten weeks to write. I am a huge Harris fan, and was left wondering, 'What were you thinking?' For one, I was looking forward to seeing Hannibal as a killer, not an unbelievably boring, aloof, aristocrat with an eating disorder. And I'm sure many Harris fans were wondering why Will Graham, the FBI agent who originally caught Lector wasn't brought into it. Hannibal destroyed his life. I'm sure he would have definite feelings about hearing Lector was loose. Harris, who in my opinion, excels in this field, for some reason went for the overly gory and perverse. One could almost hear Harris saying, &quot;This would sell in a movie,&quot; or, &quot;This would work well on the big scree,&quot; as he was writing it. The ending made me cringe. I hear the ending was changed for the movie. I hope so. In all fairness, Harris is not a sequal-oriented writer and, although Lector appeared in all three of his crime novels, they could not really be considered sequals. Thomas &quot;Black Sunday, The Red Dragon, The Silence of the Lambs,&quot; Harris, is a fantastic writer. I look forward to his next work with great anticipation. He is a credit to his craft. This one just got away somehow. Mr. Harris, there is only one man who can bring down the monster known as Hannibal the Cannibal, and you know who he is. As a matter of fact, it would have only stood to reason Hannibal would have contacted him by now. It's time to go to Florida and bring him out of retirement to do what he does best. Starling is an endearing character, but only Graham could engage Hannibal Lector in a mental game of chess and win."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While Harris creates interesting characters and situations, this book is not well written. It reads like a screenplay for the movie, as it is too heavy on describing scenes and minor details. As expected, the violent details are gory beyond belief. The end of the book was an absolute shock to me, and I found it too implausible. I understand that the movie will be altered, which I look forward to seeing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book Hannibal by Thomas Harris is a terrifying horror story. It is about a cannibal named Dr. Hannibal Lecter who loved taste, like expensive wine, exotic foods and truffles. He was obsessed with it. Hannibal especially loved the taste of human flesh. Hannibal Lecter was from a bad background. His foster parents were also cannibals that had eaten his sister, Malcha. Seven years prior to the story, Hannibal had escaped from a mental hospital in the U.S. He moved to Italy and was discovered by an Italian police officer. Meanwhile in the U.S., the story tells of Clarice Starling, an officer who has tracked Hannibal her whole life, and as a result her career is going down the drain. In a shootout with a drug dealer, many police officers were killed and Clarice was shot. Clarice killed the drug dealer and saved a baby but was criticized because of the lost officers. The story mostly takes place in the US in 1998. When Hannibal was uncovered in Italy he was forced to kill to escape and moves to America. Clarice Starling does everything she can to find him. Similarly Mason Verger, a man who earlier had been crippled by Lecter, spent lots of money to find Hannibal Lecter and is ultimately successful. The book shows how there could be crazy people like this out there in the world and to be careful. I don't believe the author has a purpose in writing the book, but only wanted to show his feelings towards the world we live in. I would definitely recommend this book to people who like a good thrill. I think it is not good for the younger reader, but only for a more mature thrill seeker."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I purchased Thomas Harris' book &quot;Hannibal&quot; after reading the celebrated &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; years earlier (which I thought was good but over rated). Hannibal starts off well. The writing style at times is a little un-even but the story engages. The descriptions of Florence and other copious asides was interesting, but not relevant to the story and made for a lot of fluff. As the novel pushes onward to it's unpredictable yet predictable climax, I felt a little &quot;ripped-off.&quot; Agent Sterling's ambiguous laconic character left much to be desired. In reality, she would definitely be gay and more interesting as a person if this were so. As the ending approached, I had a strong feeling of being let down. Although my sense of what Mr. Harris was trying to communicate is that in reality people are never what they seem to be. Too bad it was done in such a round about and uneven way."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I've never been one for mysteries, but I picked up this one, because I had seen Silence of the Lambs. I loved the character's. Here we see the insight of the Doctor's mind. All I can say is Wow! This is a quick read, with scenes and action on every page. Despite the sometimes gruesome parts, it keeps the reader breathless throughout. And the ending was . . . well, I really don't want to say how it ended. It just wouldn't be fair.This book is not for everone. Some will call it gross....Even Jodi Foster refused to play Clairce in the sequel...."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In the 3rd installment of the Lecter plot, Thomas Harris gives us something to challenge us with: the dynamics are not good guy versus bad guy, more on the lines of bad guy versus bad guy who has the help of a good guy. The ending will leave you dazed, possibly. It is obvios, even from a cursory glance, that a truckload of time and effort went into the making on this thing- it shows in the developing relationship of Lecter and Starling. Some may be horrified at just how much that relationship blossoms; as for myself, I was in love too. Approach it with dread, sieze it with awe- it is a rewarding reading expierience that will leave you thinking and mesmerized. Have a good day, if after reading this that is possible."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Great book until the last 50 pages -- then I regretted starting it at all!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is, by far, the worst book I have ever wasted my time on. I couldn't wait for this book to come out so that I could continue to read the wonderful Trilogy that Thomas Harris started with the great &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and even better &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. To me, it read as if he wrote the book at the last minute over a long weekend and the editors didn't have time to do their job because they had a deadline. Several reviewers have complained about the ending, but in my opinion, the ending is a merely a continuation of the mindless drivel that started with the first page. One star is too good for this piece of pulp fiction garbage!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The first half is actually pretty good. The scene where he kills the Italian policeman is very well done, if you like that sort of thing, and the pages describing Lecter's plane ride back to the States are excellent. After that Harris seems to have lost interest and decided just to get the damn thing done. The much derided ending seems to be a gesture of contempt towards everybody who insisted he finish the book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Most of the book was actually rather interesting though parts were a bit grotesque. The ending, however, was terrible. It went on for at least fifteen pages in an implausible and revolting haze."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am willing to bet that Thomas Harris had Hollywood in mind when he wrote this book. Why else would he so completely alter the personalities of EVERY character in his book. Mr. Harris you created some excellent characters in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs.&quot; They were engaging, flawed and, in the case of Hannibal, truly frightning. In this book you have made them cardboard cutouts that will look good on a movie screen. I have never been so disappointed in a writer before (and I read often!). I hope that if you choose to write a new novel you will not consider it's marketability and stick to what you do best."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"...I read Hannibal on an airplane. After finishing it, I wanted to be off that plane, and I knew full well we were at 30,000 feet.This book is TERRIBLE. WAIT, LEMME REPHRASE THAT......The first 400 pages are great. Creepy, gory and everything you'd expect of Dr. Lecter and Agent Starling. The final few chapters grind their way into one of the least believable, most idiotic plot twists in recent memory. Reading how the story resolves itself (what happens to Dr. Krendler, then Starling) is the literary equivalent of the sound Jim Carrey made in &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;I am a fan of both the books and the movies. Red Dragon (Manhunter) was fantastic, Silence of the Lambs, even better...This is dreck.I can only hope, pray and light candles to the moot hope that they change the end of this god-forsaken thing and make it into something good.Save your money...for that matter....BURN YOUR MONEY! Don't waste it on this crap!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I admit, as soon as my friend finished this book, I snatched it up and began reading. And finished it pretty much the same day. And yes, bits and pieces of it are memorable, particularly the climax (which will probably be the world's worst kept secret by the time the movie comes out)--I certainly haven't forgotten that. But the slow build and creepy moods and masterful characterizations of RED DRAGON and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS are nowhere to be found here. I've heard that Harris had this manuscript published as he submitted it, with no editorial changes--it shows, and not in a good way. The writing is self-indulgent and over the top and turns Hannibal Lecter into a caricature of himself."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Few books have inspired as much conversation and thought as this one did for me. If you can move beyond Harris' hyperbole of cannibalism into a more theoretical space involving consumption, preservation, and waste, you'll love this book. Otherwise, you'll probably still like it, but just be grossed out by it. In either case, it's well worth the read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading Hannibal, I couldn\`t shake the feeling that there was some kind of deadline in place here. After a great beginning,it seemed that the further along you got into the story, it felt as if Mr Harris was just in a hurry to get it over with. And that, to me , robs both Dr.Lecter and Clarice Starling of much of the qualities given to them in Silence of the Lambs.I would have loved to have seen a completely different ending than what was seemingly tossed out here."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If readers are expecting a terse writing style, they won't getit in &quot;Hannibal&quot;. Comparing Hannibal to his previous work islike comparing a Monet with a Lichtenstein. You have to take a step back, relax your mind and languish in the mood and flow of the novel, nibbling on the references to Italian history and art. If you enjoy books that serve you the tidbits of the author's research, you will enjoy this. Hannibal contained very precise references to places were curiously intriguing on travel to Florence or Paris. END"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Don't let the chance to read this wonderful book pass just because most of people haven't loved it. I am sure the point is it's not they haven't liked the story, it's just they are horrified by the way the story ends.Forget everything you suppose to be normal. Open up your mind on what makes Hannibal such a genial monster. The story gives many details on who is Hannibal, what makes a normal person becomes a marginal. That story is so well-written I couldn't stop reading until the end. I must confess I was very shocked but I just had a couple of porto and then I understood many things. Now, you have read many reviews, you know something very weird will happen. Just think that the thin line between madness and genius is something normal for a person as Hannibal. Don't expect the Hollywood sauce. Just try to understand... Amazing and disturbing !"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Overall, I expected more from Hannibal. Red Dragon and Silence were much better books. Lecter loses some of his creepiness in Hannibal and Harris' ending suffers from being just too incredible. It appears that Harris only creates Starling to be the victim of all men whether they be serial killers or cops. I expected more from Starlings character and was disappointed in Harris' treatment of her. There were faint glimpses of Harris' earlier achievements, but Hannibal was a step in the wrong direction."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Creepy and complex, this is a haunting work whose sustained mood builds to a remarkable and unseen sending. Wonderful writing and marvelous plotting."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I enjoyed SOTL the novel very much, as I read it in one sitting. However, Hannibal was disappointing, As it Mr. Harris spent 450 pages of the book describing Italy, and 30 telling the events in the book. Even though it had a good climax, it was mostly a boring read. Only a very very hardcore Harris fan/Lecterite should buy this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I couldn't wait to read Harris's new book - THINKING it would be as great as Silence of the Lambs. Boy, was I mistaken. What a waste of my time. The ending is totally unbelievable - well actually the whole book was unbelievable, predictable - except the ending. What a great disappointment. If you haven't read it yet, don't waste your time. Total garbage."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I found this very disappointing. Rather pretentious and not a good effort, in my opinion. Don't bother."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Another excellent Thomas Harris book and most rewarding for fans of Lechter and Starling. The audiobook is badly marred, though, by the narrator's ill-advised decision to perform the voice of a major character with severe facial injuries in a &quot;dialect&quot; that renders his (many and important) lines practically unintelligible. This is doubly annoying as Mr. Harris did not write these lines in a crippled speech &quot;dialect&quot; in the book, probably precisely because it makes it so hard to read (with apologies to writers like William Faulkner). This looks like another example of audiobook narrators and producers deciding to &quot;improve&quot; upon the author's work with a contribution that ends up hurting it. When will they learn? Sorry it had to happen to you, Mr. Thomas."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I spent the first 100 pages on the edge of my seat, the next 200 trying to stay awake, and the last 50 laughing uncontrollably. The ending of this book gave me the impression that Harris gave up on the characters and just wanted to finish. The ending is ludicrous. Other than as a guide to pig breeding or a roadmap of Florence, the book is a waste of time."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The very first review sums this book up really well. I had no trouble getting into this book and was hooked after the completion of the first chapter. The small amount of emphasis on Starling was a little disappointing. When we were in Italy with Lecter, there was too much information and terms that are beyond most people's understanding. And I think we spent too much time with the Italian officer and his plans to get Lecter. The end was terrible and ridiculous. It left me sitting for hours asking, &quot;What the heck? Who would ever think that one up?&quot; It's a good read, but set yourself up for disappointments in Italy and the end."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have a thousand things to do; deadlines yap at my heels like wolves learning to hunt.But all was set aside this Monday morning, so I could finish this book.It is brilliant.It is terrifying.And finally it is satisfying.The plot is well-known to anyone reading the reviews. The narrative moves along swiftly, always compelling you to read one more page, one more page before you finally sleep.Not since the Old Testament have good and evil flowed together so finely, the basic ideas of justice and injustice been so woven so tightly together that one can no longer decide what is right and what is wrong.A wonderful, if terrifying, read.Jerry"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I keep hoping that this book would live up to its two predecessors, Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. Every once in awhile it offered a glimmer of hope in that direction but sadly it never came even remotely close to making the mark as it was often labored and the ending absolutely pathetic!!!!!! Please spare us a movie sequel!!!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I listened to the book and lost some sleep over this sequel. It fleshes out the characters so well and left me wondering if, under the right circumstanes that any person can become a monster at the right time, under the right circumstances. The narrator did a terrific job."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I can't figure out what so many reviewers are complaining about. I thought it was great a book finally ends without some big shoot-em-up scene and the bad guy going off to jail or being killed at the last while &quot;justice&quot; prevails. I found myself despising the animal abusing, child molesting Verger much worse than Dr. Lecter, who I did not despise in &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, but rather found a fascinating character. The serial killer Gumb and the faceless Verger were much worse than Lecter. As the subliminal plot and Lecter himself suggested(he didn't like rude people) most of the people Lecter killed needed killing. The other characters in the book claimed more victims worthy of pity than Lecter's. I also came away feeling that the author is much like Dr. Lecter and tries to lend that feel to the book. I thought it was a great read, as long as you have a strong stomach, and I liked the ending!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was forced to read &quot;Red Dragon&quot; by my mother who thought it was the best book ever. I agreed with her and kept my doors locked at night. Also stopped using my 8mm camera for family events...Only kidding. I eagerly awaited &quot;Silence of the Lamb&quot;.....Outstanding is all I can say. It kept me awake for hours just to finish it. I now have waited all of these years for &quot;Hannibal&quot;. What a waste of time, money and paper. Wait until you can pick it up in a USED Book store and even then I wouldn't waste my money.How in the world could Harris think we could actually believe that Starling would end up that way?Is he more insane, than Hannibal?It also seem as if he had a deadline to reach and just finished the book off with gibberish to get it to print. DON'T WASTE MONEY ON FULL PRICE."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I bought this novel the day it was released at the bookstores. Like many, I had anxiously waited to read the sequel to &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot; This book was slow in the beginning, middle and end. The first half of the book contained too many Italian words, I mean way too many. If there is a movie lets hope they change the ending, it was just too silly."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm a quick reader, but I just couldn't get through this book. Instead of not being able to put it down, I just couldn't get myself to pick it up. I began dreading each next paragraph. Finally I decided to stop pushing myself to read it, so I don't know the ending and I don't care. I loved Silence of the Lambs, but this book was just too gruesome and boring for me."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It was fantastic.There is no other way this saga could have ended. A true exploration of the light and dark sides in all of us. No one person was all good or all bad--with the possible exception of Clarice's housemate.Harris is wonderful with words and the scenes were truly evocative of the settings. I could see Florence (and Muskrat Farm--ugh).Can't wait for the movie. Casting Barney, Mason, and Margot should be interesting."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While I thoroughly enjoyed Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs this book took me about 200 pages to really get into &amp; start to enjoy and then when it got to the end I was extremely disappointed and thought that the last page would say something to the effect of it &quot;being a dream sequence&quot;! VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! Hannibal &amp; Clarice, a couple !!! What nonsense"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read Red Dragon before SOTL (the movie) was even a twinkle in a scriptwriter's eye, and found it quite superb, with psychological representations of the characters that really felt like you were inside their skulls. I moved on to SOTL and read it about three months before the movie came out. I found it, once again, to be excellent - perhaps not quite reaching the peak of intensity that RD did, but still several cuts above the standard psychothriller. I saw the movie and was vaguely disappointed (although Jodie Foster was spot on) in its lack of analysis of the characters. I finished &quot;Hannibal&quot; this morning in a total of six hours, reading straight through from cover to cover. Some people have said that it dragged in certain parts; I found that it flew by. I haven't read a book at that pace for a while, and yet I remembered almost every detail of Harris' writing. He surpasses himself in depth of research; the Italian sequences are really quite marvellous. The Doctor is explained in a little more detail (although that explanation doesn't quite have the depth of that of RD).Now for the bad parts: More than ever, Harris flaunts semi-intellectual elitism at the reader, often to the point of overbearance. However, if you consider that to be part of the Doctor's peculiar &quot;flavor&quot; (ie, his contempt for the &quot;normal&quot; people who make up 99.9% of the population of any country), then it fits (remember, the book is named after him). Also, Harris doesn't quite pull off the finale to his Florentine set piece; it was a slight anticlimax compared with the tension of Lecter's escape from jail in SOTL.Okay, enough half-baked critical analysis: my gut reaction to &quot;Hannibal&quot; was as if I had been caught in a particularly nasty car accident, where through no fault of my own, the occupant of the other car had died a messy death. In other words, it left me feeling rather shellshocked, vaguely guilty and more than a little queasy. It also made me want to hold my eight-month-old son for a while.Now, as for the ending, which had been collecting so much vitriol here - I found it surprising, rather unsettling, and difficult to predict from the content of SOTL, but I DID think that Harris was being honest in his choice of outcome. After how he set it up, there were four ways he could have finished it plausibly (ie &quot;to the satisfaction of the average thriller fan&quot;): 1) Hannibal eats Clarice Starling. 2) He kills himself. 3) Clarice Starling manages to take him in alive. 4) Clarice and the Doctor go their separate ways.Ending 1 would have allowed a continuation of the series with Hannibal given top billing. Ending 2 would have wrapped the series up nicely. Ending 3 would have returned us to the beginning of the series. Ending 4 would have left it wide open for a sequel starring everyone's favorite characters.And NONE of these endings rings true to me. I think Harris did all he could to give us an ending that wasn't a sellout, that didn't submit to the demands of Hollywood (go on, I dare you - try and make a movie that remains faithful to the book AND gets funding), and that didn't leave me feeling cheated. Of course, nothing's perfect, and there were places that could have used the (light) touch of an editor, but I think Harris has done a truly fine job.Now, that's not to say that after I finished reading it, I didn't feel like taking a hot shower and scrubbing myself clean..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"By far, this is the finest work to date by Thomas Harris. He is a master of describing such horror that the reader feels he must turn away while at the same time feeling compelled to read on. This was a great book with an unbeliveable surprise ending. Mr. Harris could surely show Stephen King how to end a novel!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book requires more thought than the usual horror novel. I found that the relationship between Starling and Lecter quite similar to many intellectual relationships between real police officers and their arrestees, it can become and has become a trap that some officers have fallen into when they begin empathizing with the very people they are supposed to stop. The line occasionally becomes blurred, fortunately for society this does not happen too often."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I've just started this book and already I'm tired of the endless cliches and movie script like quality. I'm disappointed by the what I felt was the genius of Thomas Harris. With his other books he quickly had me feeling empathy for both the victims and villans. In Hannibal, I can't quite figure out who is worse, the contrived Starling (she didn't seem to be the first person she was in the other novels) or the villans. I was hoping for a page turner...instead I've purchased a page burner! This book is wasting my time, and for my loyalty to the author I will finish it anyway...after all, what's a good movie without a script?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was totally captivated by this book. Dr. Hannibal Lecter is my all time favorite fictional character; so evil, so brilliant, so sophisticated and educated, so cultured, and so incredibly dangerous! What an amazing and fascinating combination of traits and qualities in a man, and yet for all his horror, Harris is able to make the reader feel some amount of sympathy for Lecter. Starling is her ususal competant and intrepid self, and even though she fears Lecter, the way she admires and even in a sense likes him, is the mark of great writing. The complexities to Lecter and Starling continually unfold and keep the reader glued to the pages. I also was greatly impressed with the Italian Pazzi, and his sluething and cunning. Mason Verger was a worthy adversary for Lecter, although I would have liked to see more of a showdown between the two. The ending was entrancing, I could see it unfolding cinematically, with a classical soundtrack, and all I can say now is that I hope there will be another book to continue the adventures of Hannibal!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Despite some other people says, I think Hannibal is twice as scarier than Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs. This book is full of detail that you are in part of Hannibal and Clarice Starling. In my own opinion a well detail book gets in a way of being scare to go on. In Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs, it's the book that goes on but sometimes you felt like you want to stop."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris' latest offering should not be read by those expecting a duplicate of his previous works. He has written it with the intention of portraying human beings as real, diverse and ever-changing. He has taken the character of Hannibal Lector and dug beneath the serial killer exterior in order to reveal something that is complex and engaging. The only difficulty I had with the book came from the guilt of applauding Lector's constant escapes and victories. Bravo to Thomas Harris for writing such a multi-faceted villain/protagonist. The risks Harris has taken with his portrayal of Clarice Starling should also be rewarded, though few will read close enough to truly understand them. Harris also challenges the reader to understand the motives to which each character clings to as they track the killer. The result is a well-balanced, tension-filled story where the reader must rationalize the actions of those they are rooting for. The amount of thought provoked throughout &quot;Hannibal&quot; exemplifies its classification as a newly born classic."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Not having read any of Harris' previous work I found myself deeply enthralled by this book for which I have but one word &quot;brilliant&quot;.The strong details and topographical descriptions easily lure the reader to whatever location is being described. The characters and various sub plots are carefully but effortlessly weaved together, artfully creating one great read. Finally, the ending is suprisigly consice, unpredictable and ties all the character's lives neatly into one little package. There are no strings left over and no wondering thoughs about a sequel.All in all this book is hard to put down."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Having finished &quot;Hannibal&quot; roughly three hours ago, I still have all the details fresh in my mind, and I can still feel the sting left by Harris's remarkable novel. First off: If you are expecting a conventional sequel in any way, shape, or form, I wouldn't buy this book. Examining where &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; left off, this book does not follow the chain of events that one would have expected, which is a mixed blessing. I had in my mind this specific way that the story would go after &quot;Silence,&quot; and Harris has written what is basically the antithesis of that. But it is in this daring, twisted plot that I had a truly marvelous and very scary experience, and with the stroke of an artist's paintbrush he defines some truly amazing characters. It's a pretty easy book to go along with, but the amount of gore and sexuality in this book has occasion to be so explicit that I must warn those who plan to read it. Simply stated, it makes &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; look like &quot;Bambi.&quot; The grisly subject matter runs pretty much the whole length of the novel, so be prepared for it. Also, be prepared for the most surprising, horrific, and distressing ending you may ever read in a novel. I had no idea where it was going. Many people have been put off by it, and that is totally understandable... I still don't know quite what to make of his ending. The book chugs along like a train and then veers off onto a rather confusing and unexpected track in the final pages, almost as if Harris wanted to see how hard he could punch his readers in their stomachs. The novel is a work of art, and if you have no worries over the grotesque subject matter and can get past the novel's final, grand twist, it is one of the best experiences you will ever have reading a book. Don't read it at night."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A sequel to the excellent &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; was eagerly awaited. Unfortunately, it was a huge let-down. The Clarice Starling from the former book had strength, integrity, determination, fortitude, and a working moral compass. In the latter book, however, Starling has been reduced to a quivering, mindless idiot with no will of her own who sinks into a quagmire of debauchery. Much of &quot;Hannibal&quot; is set in Italy, and the reader is provided with some insight into the factors which came into play and exploded to produce a Hannibal Lecter. Although we begin to see into the tormented mind of this man, we gain little sympathy for him. The writing itself is dark and as dense as a thick fog. I was incensed by the ending and thought it did a huge disservice to its predecessor. I found it to be forced and contrived and, frankly, I was insulted by it. I expected better from the estimable Mr. Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is the first Thomas Harris novel I have read. I saw Silence of the Lambs, loved it, and opted not to read the novel. When this novel was released, I immediately snapped it up.The whole story was excellent from the onset. Harris does a great job of further developing Dr. Lecter's character. You even find yourself sympathizing with the crazy ba$tard! It is truly a wild ride and worth the read.BUT, there is the ending. Although I could buy-into 70% of it, the ending as is does not jibe with the story or Clarice Starling. At least not for me. But, worth the read. Unless you are easily grossed out!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Dear Mr. Harris, I read it to the end because I thought ... well ... &quot;maybe it's me, I've been a little distracted lately, I feel I should be enjoying this ... but I'm not&quot;. What in the hell have you done to Clarice? Talk about a sell-out! And, what sort of mind can come up with that last scenario? Oh boy, I'd be worried if that had come out of my imagination. If the film is going to be true to the book, I will not be going to see it. I've given it two stars because I, at the very least read it until the end (and wish I'd skipped that last bit!)."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Why did thomas harris take so long to write such a jumbled, pointless and rambling book like this. You think if the man had spent so long on a book at least a few things would be evident. Simple things like a plot, a sense of intrigue and motives for the characters. This book lacks all the above. The whole time I spent reading this (time incidentally that was not well spent) I could not help thinking what is the point of all of this. The characters are shallow, Clarice especially. He seems to have run out of ideas for her and painted her as simply as possible. Even when I had finished the book, the same question repeated itself why? If you loved black sunday, red dragon &amp; silence of the lambs please dont buy this! It sucks"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was not nearly as graphic as Silence of the Lambs, however it has a very strange twist to it. Took me a chapter or two to get into it, but when I did it was quick reading...you just have to holdout for the end!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal 2&quot;Hannibal&quot; is the first of the Lecter trilogy that I have read. I opened the cover with a sense of trepidation and dread based on the &quot;legendary&quot; reputation of the character Hannibal Lecter. I was surprised to find that the story included a plethora of &quot;monsters&quot; who had been corrupted by their own lusts--- for revenge or sex or money, or all the above--- so that Hannibal is merely a superior monster (erudite, sophisticated, genteel...) surrounded by a world filled with lesser (crass, short-witted, vulgar) monsters. By observing the masses of humanity through the contemptuous eyes of &quot;Hannibal Lecter&quot;, the author subtley but CLEARLY projects the notion that humanity is in fact a race of monsters who ALL hide dishonestly behind the mask of &quot;culture&quot; and a meaningless veneer of &quot;civility&quot;. Remove this veneer, Harris says (through Lecter's thoughts) and all you have left are monsters who are no better than Lecter himself, and in fact, who deserve to be ruled and tormented by Lecter's superiority.I'm no Bible-thumper--- and I'm not saying that Harris intended any of these parallels--- but parallels to Christian scripture are unmistakeable: having rejected God's spiritual ideal personified by Jesus, a corrupt humanity is subjugated (in Revelation) to the rule of the antichrist. So too, Harris portrays that humanity is irredeemably corrupt, and thus DESERVES to be subjugated by evil in its most self-conscious, self-worshipping form imaginable, the genteel cannibal, Hannibal.Harris even draws a distinction between common human corruption and true evil, through the scene where the gypsy-thief looks into Lecter's eyes and recognizes his true identity.The final chapters alone are worth the price of the book. The author skillfully brings his premises to their logical conclusions: where virtue is folly, and hope is in vain, then evil shall rule. The final chapters contain one of most gruesome yet bloodlessly tidy scenarios ever written.... At Lecter's &quot;last supper&quot;, the biblical apostasy and the &quot;scarlet whore&quot; are easily implied.... Even the shattering teacup ingeniously suggests and foreshadows the &quot;Second Coming&quot; of Christ, whose reappearance reverses the entropic nature of the universe, making possible the resurrection of the dead. With a chilling wink and a mocking smile, the author serves everyone (including the reader) their &quot;just desserts&quot;. But most cleverly of all, the author sets aside his own pen and bows out of the play, with the explicit suggestion that the most final chapters of all might be too &quot;fatal&quot; to observe, thus leaving the greatest horrors to be revealed by the reader's imagination... Or possibly, by the hands of Time.This book is a must-read for everyone but the most squeamish and the young. Lecter's erudition and sophistication lend a superficial glamor and charm to an otherwise despicable character. The Memory Palace was a WONDERFULLY mystical touch to Lecter's psyche. The book's theme is disturbing and appalling, BUT... it is nonetheless meaningful and relevant for this--- and future--- generations."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have to admit I used the audio tapes for this book and believe strongly had I chose to read the novel I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much. Much of the Italian language would have frustrated me. But the reader for this book did such a wonderful job, I found myself completely wrapped up in Hannabal and Starling's world. With that said. I think this was the best book I read/listened to this year."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs were terrific in both the book and movie versions. Yet I avoided reading Hannibal (have not yet seen the movie) until now. The reviews gave me a creepy, uneasy feeling that caused me to shy away. Having finally read Hannibal, I am not sorry I waited so long and am shocked by how poorly it compares to Silence of the Lambs. Harris' previous books showed the worst of the human mind, but offered hope and a view that the better side of us will prevail in the end. I recall a review on NPR of the movie Silence of the Lambs that went something like \\"it will chill you in the gut and then warm you up from the inside out.\\" \\"Hannibal\\" does none of this as it goes on a sadistic, nasty, silly, absurd, and sometimes incoherent path. In a way, it is a study of manners and good taste from the perspective of a psychopath. Harris can do whatever he wants with his characters, but what he has done to Clarissa Starling in \\"Hannibal\\" is degrading and just plain ridiculous. The insights into Hannibal Lector's mind are the most interesting part of the book and make it borderline worth reading. For those of you who watched \\"Frasier\\" on TV, Lector can be best described as Mr. Hyde to television's Dr. Frasier Crane."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Enjoyed the story as much as Silence. Dr. Lecter is presented in all his twisted glory in \\"Hannibal\\". Harris's grasp of detail on people, places, history, etc. makes it a great read. Can't wait to see the movie!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is a great book that is hard to put down if you're looking for something fun and entertaining. The characters are well developed and the story is fast paced with lots of twist and turns."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"...in a word!This book will keep you thinking long after you've finished it.The last one hundred pages are certainly the best I've ever read in the genre.Even though it has been said that this is the last Hannibal Lecter instalment, I'm sincerely looking forward to the next one. But please, Mr. Harris, try not to take another decade to write it!On the other hand, if in order to present us with another masterpiece you really must...Lu&iacute;s Monteiro (luis.monteiro@hotbot.com)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I just finished Hannibal; although some of the diction gave me some difficulty (especially the Italian names)this novel was one intense horror machine that sent my mind on a 1-way trip to Thrillvill. What can I say? Hannibal RUUUUUULLLEESS!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I recently finished &quot;Red Dragon&quot; just 2 weeks ago, and couldn't wait for May 23rd when the paperback of &quot;Hannibal&quot; came out. I bought it right away, and couldn't put it down. I thought it was as good as &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, if not better and more lyrical. I just finished it last night (part of it reading by flashlight, as we'd lost power due to a storm). I read a lot of books and some I have to almost force myself to read - not this one. And rarely does a book give me bad dreams - this one did. Although not scary like a ghost story, it's tension and suspense were truly absorbing. And I loved the ending. Loved the treatment of Barney - he's a great minor character. And I won't hear the name Mason without a little shudder. Some have said that Lecter is no longer scary - I think he's even scarier, especially in the scenes where he interacts with an unsuspecting public. I like it that he has a soft spot for women (the signora, Clarice, Margot...). Thanks, Thomas Harris for a wonderful novel!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Apparrently Mr Harris wanted to end Hannibal's reign of terror and put Clarice in her *place* b/c this novel is a huge disappointment. Wait for the movie. It may just be the only time Hollywood's efforts eclipse the author's."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Intense, provocative. I find myself reading and enjoying this book and wondering if perhaps, I, myself am somewhat sick, deranged. Harris finds a way for us to empathize with Hannibal and endure our disgust for such a man at the same time. Hannibal's love of the fine arts and instinct of knowing what a woman likes, paints a romantic picture of the cannibal.The depiction of Hannibal's fate by Mason Verger, if he were captured alive, is brutally gruesome and strangely justified that my heart beats with anticipation wanting and not wanting it to happen. I beg to know where Clarice will stand when the showdown begins and ultimately am dissapointed in the ending.Harris shows his ability as a skilled writer by making readers want to cheer for the bad guy and despise the ones who are seeking justice.I think 7 years was worth the wait for this fabulous book, but the last few chapters leave much to be desired. Harris could have done so much more, but perhaps he is holding out for a 4th book??? =)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After two consecutive tales of FBI operatives gingerly working their way through the cryptic and self-serving oracles of Hannibal Lecter as part of the pursuit of outrageously cunning and savage serial killers, the obvious follow-up for Thomas Harris would have been more of the same. Thankfully, he opted for a different approach.HANNIBAL is, as many fans anticipated (and some feared), a dark romance. It is by no means tidy and it sacrifices the artificial &quot;beat-the-clock&quot; tension of the previous two installments in an attempt to explore the intersection between the operatic reality of Lecter and the mundane, &quot;glass-ceilinged&quot; existence of Clarice Starling.The book is not the masterpiece of psychology and structure that RED DRAGON is, but it is at least the equal of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. Both SILENCE and HANNIBAL are weighed down at times with characters who verge on offensive stereotype and both struggle to find a narrative throughline, creating cul-de-sacs of plot and hopscotching, sometimes absurdly, about the map.Be that as it may, no other writer of thrillers manifests the craftsmanship and integrity of vision of Harris. He brings verisimilitude to the most Baroque situations. He lends unforced likeability--or at least a doorway to empathy--to the most unpalatable characters. The ending of HANNIBAL is surprising, dreamlike and disturbing, in a way most authors would never even attempt to bring off, let alone achieve a margin of success with."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"There are sentence fragments in this book! Harris must have had an agreement with the publisher not to edit his book. He must've had an agreement not to self-edit his book. The book is absolutely over the top in gore and credibility. We waited 11 years for this?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Not in recent hisory has such a long-awaited work of fiction delivered such complete and utter disappointment. I thought I was getting a great deal buying this from Amazon at half price. I should charge Thomas Harris my hourly rate for wasting my time! I was profoundly disappointed by this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Some time ago in order to fulfill a contract with a record studio that he wanted out of, Lou Reed created Machine Metal Music. A Double Album of absolute trash. I wonder if Thomas Harris, in an effort to finally Silence his Lambs just did his version of Machine Metal Music. The book is a sequel of the movie, not the previous novel, and its clear that Harris is writing this one for visual effects only. He doesn't write in complete sentences. (ok, so that's a pet peeve of mine) He's writing a screenplay, and a bad one at that. The action is horrific, the plot thin, and the characters' actions truly make no sense. Harris chooses to forego the part of Hannibal's story told in Red Dragon. He gives him an implausible past in telling of Hannibal's long lost sister Mischa. For all the intelligence Harris has bestowed on his creation he now infuses him with the belief that time can travel backwards. He created another villian, Mason Verger, who apparently has watched too many episodes of the campy Batman series judging by the plan he has concocted to gain his revenge. The scary part about Silence of the Lambs was its plausity, the scariest part about Hannibal is that someone actually published it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is a book I did not want to rush through, but to savor the research, creativity, and hypnotizing text. Author Harris has managed to create not one, but two repulsive characters , as well as other dysfunctional secondary accomplices. He has described their personalities, habits,and thoughts in a way that these unbelieveable, yet fictious individuals seem realistic. Readiing Hannibal gave me the same horrifying,yet mesmerizing feelings that I experienced reading Bram Stoker's Dracula under my bedcovers with a a flashlight at age 15. However, I am now 51 and read the majority of this novel basking in 80 degree weather on my deck !!! Nothing could break the curiosity of what was going to happen next.f I was disappointed in the ending because of the unexplained reasons for Starling's uninfluenced willingness for a long term, romantic bonding with Lecter. It felt like a section of the text was missing.. Also, on a minor note, though the FBI was aware that Starlings disappearance was related to Lecter, they seemed to have dropped any interest in the case. This also did not &quot;flow&quot; with the balance of the book's detail of actions."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Gosh, how we were all looking forward to this book! Never a fan of sequels, I nevertheless felt that if anyone could do it, Thomas Harris could. WRONG AGAIN! I started to put this book down several times while reading it. Discrepancies from facts we learned in &quot;Silence&quot;, bad writing, bad plotting, etc. But I kept on, thinking, surely, with all the hype this book has received, it has to get better. WRONG AGAIN! Finally, I just tired of it and flipped to the ending before replacing it in my bookshelf (towards the back). Mr. Harris, did you honestly think this ending would satisfy your reader? Endings that leave your jaw hanging because of their shock value are wonderful, but mine was hanging out of disbelief. How could Thomas Harris have written such a ridiculous ending? Where were your editors? Of course, all concerned will make a tremendous amount of money due to all the hype this book received. Everyone went out to buy it, expecting something which Mr. Harris and his publisher did not deliver. One last word. A sequel should have never been written to &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;. We were better off deciding for ourselves what happened to Rhett and Scarlett. I will do the same for Clarice and Dr. Lector."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Those collective thuds must be fans of Thomas Harris' Red Dragon &amp; The Silence Of The Lambs tossing this garbage in the trash upon completion of this mess. Where to begin, how about the ending. My first thoughts were that the role of Clarice in the movie version of Hannibal should be played by Lisa Kudrow (Pheobe) of Friends fame, as Thomas Harris has reduced her character into a joke. I genuinely cannot believe that anyone following this story from it's Red Dragon beginnings would be anything but disappointed with this story. Hopefully word of mouth will quickly overtake the hype of this novels release and save millions of people the time, energy and money used to trudge thru this embarassment."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm thunderstruck that so many fellow readers have bought into Harris' tripe. Hannibal is a male fantasy that sets a new standard for the ridiculously absurd. Starling as Lector's star-crossed lover? I'd be more willing to believe President Clinton than this little fairy tale. Wake up people! One star for having Krendler for dinner: that was pretty cool."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Aside from the gramatical and punctuation errors for which there can be NO excuse in a major release like this, the story and the characters were a caricature of the people we remember from the first two novels in this sereis. To begin, I counted a minimum of three incomplete quotes, a minimum of three missing periods, myriad fragmented sentences and rampant changes of tense. These fragments and chages in tense may have been poor attempts at stylistic prose, but let us not forget we're not discussing Joyce here. This is mass market American fiction for crying out loud! Must be nice to have a deal that disallows for editing changes. The worst, though, is the insult to the characters. Not only will it be impossible for the actors to reprise their roles with any dignity in a faithfully adapted screenplay (albeit something Harris need not consider necessarily), but their actions, emotions and motivations deviate so dramatically from those in earlier appearances that we're looking at different people altogether. Darned shame, this, especially after waiting nearly a DECADE for this book. Gone, too, is some of the usual cleverness of plot as this book goes mainly for the gross-out in instances and spirals down into banal predictability."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;Hannibal&quot; is the perfect follow-up to &quot;The Silence of The Lambs&quot; in all but one way. The ending of this novel is shocking, and left me extremely disappointed- Thomas Harris has absolutly murdered the character of Clarice Starling, creating her as the loser in the strange game between herself and Lector, where once they were equals. Harris creates the most bizarre and unsettling &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending for his novel-although I must commend him for not taking the soap opera way out and killing off Lector- and in the process completely distroys Starling's feasible character. Her actions, decisions, and choices are so completely out of character that I chose to ignore Harris' ending and imagine my own. Clarice Starling is one of the best &quot;strong women&quot; characters in modern literature, and by the end of the novel- in a 360 degree twist- when a drugged (nice touch) Clarice submits to Dr. Lector, and they form a relationship, her independence, her freedom and her very character are destroyed. In the end note, &quot;three years later&quot;, Clarice has been transformed into the beautiful trophy bride at the Opera, complete with expensive emerelds, a pretty dress and (another nice touch) platinum blonde hair. Jodie Foster reputedly turned down the role of Starling in &quot;Hannibal&quot; the film (due out 2001) because she so detested what Harris had done to Starling, and I applaud her for her choice."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read. It was hard to follow, it was not interesting and the ending did not make any sense."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was astounded at how awful this novel was. Despite the few redeeming qualities it possesses, such as lovely little tidbits of information about history, literature, music, and art, the book is a total failure. None of the characters are well-developed at all; they are mere caricatures. Harris' attempts at giving Hannibal a psychological motive for being a cannibal make no sense whatsoever and leave Hannibal devoid of the respect the reader has cultivated for him on account of his calculated acts of &quot;whimsy.&quot; Even the cultural references and tidbits information grow tiresome afer a while. The language is dull and repetitive, with entire sentences being repeated, as if they were so delightfully profound the first time around that Harris could not bear not to use them again. Cliche follows cliche, from the FBI shootout to the man whose only goal in life is to sabotage Starling's career to the impossibly evil Mason Verger to the cheesy boy gets girl ending. No elements of the story come as a shock because the course of events are all too predictable. The only frightening aspect of the story is that some people liked it well enough to give it rave reviews."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is a great pulp read. Harris writes better than any contemporary &quot;action&quot; writer I've read; he's an author, not just a storyteller. Don't get me wrong though, the story IS exciting. Lecter is more terrifying than ever. I didn't read &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; until after reading this book, so it is not a necessary pre-rec. Not the deepest book, but certainly worth the thrills. (Don't expect a mystery. While there are elements of a mystery with Clarice going after Lecter, it's NOT a who dun it type book.)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"and enters Italy, the cruciible of art, opera, and all things that Hannibal loves. I have read Tom Harris' previous books and have been constantly amazed at his ability to describe his characters. In Hannibal we see the beautiful and the macabre twisted together like some kind of strange DNA in one person, maybe not in this case fully explained (is it possible! ) but illustrated wiith amazing skill. Be prepared to read about a strange psychopath and his quest for control."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I bought this book and two days later was finished. It was so good that it kept me reading all day. The only disapointing thing is the &quot;motive&quot; given for Lecter's behavior...that seemed pretty unnecessary, as was the whole thing with Barney...but even that was written well. Many people hated the ending but I thought it was great. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Say what you want about the ending. At least it wasn't a&quot;safe&quot; ending, ...Perhaps there is a subtextual meaning tothe dreamy epilogue we just don't get. Or perhaps he is just setting up the next book, in which he Sets Things Right. It's hard to say at this point.Some readers are so emotionally conservative the over-react to an ending they don't know how to deal with and write an exaggeratedly negative review of the entire book, which isn't fair. Hannibal is mostly as thrilling as Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. The stuff in Italy is brilliant, and the set up involving the nemisis is quite compelling. I don't see that much difference in literary style compared to the past Harris novels. I admit the ending is hard to swallow, but maybe it will make more sense when I read it a second time, or when the next book comes out."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is one of those books that you can't put down once you've started reading it because you want to know the outcome. Unfortunately, every few pages you will be asking yourself why you are continuing to read this trash? It's a sick book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is an extraordinarily exquisite book. I found myself engrossed in it within minutes. You would never predict the ending either, which is common for Thomas Harris. I have seen the movie remake of \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" and found it intriguing. When I heard of a sequel, I bought the \\"Book-on-Tape\\" version, I really have no time. This book is riddled with suspense, action, and even drama. Along with what you would expect from a book named \\"Hannibal\\", an open window into Dr. Hannibal Lector's Mind Palace. Please e-mail me to discuss this book further."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"80 - 90% of this book was excellent and then I read the last 30 or so pages. Thomas Harris threw a curve ball that I was by no means expecting and in fact I was pretty mad that he had thrown it and that I had read through all the rest of the book just to make it to this. That was my first reaction but now after a few weeks I kind of enjoy the fact that the book ended in this way. It was nice to read a book that there was no way to predict its ending. I'm still a little dissatisfied with the plausibility of the books ending but am I no longer mad at Thomas Harris for surprising me."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What happened? Did Harris get writer's block toward the end of the book and knew he had a deadline? This was SO NOT even comparable to Silence of the Lambs. He must had a good day when he wrote that one! Don't buy this book, it is a total disappointment! No wonder, Jodie Foster will not be in the sequel, don't blame her at all!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I had to smile sadly when I read someone's review for this book; they were upset that others had &quot;slammed&quot; it. I know it's upsetting when one reads a book they love, and then finds that others dislike it. I'm afraid I'm one of the slammers.After RED DRAGON and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, I thought this book was just dreadful. What amazed me is that Harris had apparently waited eleven years to write this dismal performance. I bought this book before it was on the Bestseller list, and buying books in hardback is really a luxury for me, so just let me say that this was an EXPENSIVE disappointment.The first 55 chapters were background. How utterly dull. And the chapters on Hannibal in Italy sounded like a traveloque, complete with &quot;Italian words&quot; dropping. It's worse than name-dropping to drop as many unfamiliar words AND types of wines as Harris did in this novel. If I'd wanted that, I'd have purchased UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN. By the time I'd arrived at chapter 55 and could see that FINALLY some action was coming, I was already utterly disgusted, and not one bit surprised that in the &quot;Acknowledgements.&quot; the majority went to experts on Italian life and culture.I suppose it's hard to make a cannibal very scary after Jeffrey Dahmer, but if he was attempting to make Lecter frightening, Harris failed terribly.When I'd finished the book, I hardly knew what to think. The ending was so incredibly implausible. Apparently, Mr. Harris had decided to write a travelogue with a fairytale ending.The whole time I read this book, in my mind was the fact that long before it was written, or at least published, the stars of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS had already publicized their interest in doing a sequel. Obviously, it was on Harris's mind as well. This read like a 1930's version of a horror story. Where were the dancers?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Aberrant sexuality, torture, mutilation, cannibalism, revenge, emotional trauma... 'Hannibal' serves them all wrapped up in a nice, tidy package of beautiful writing and poetic justice.Clarice Starling is still the brilliant young agent we met long ago. Her ambitions and desires - yes, desires - take the corner on rails when a certain fugitive psychiatrist falls back into her life. When one of her own serves her up like lamb chops to appease the appetites of a hungry media and feed his own ravenous vendetta, the most startling sympathy comes from the transplanted Lecter, now a world away pursuing his scholarly interests and reaffirming that there's really nothing quite like a good truffle.Though Lecter is chilling, the other creatures inhabiting his world make him look like a Romper Room matron. Rich with eels, strangely graceful but carnivorous swine, child molesters, lesbian weightlifters with a need for seed, cops on the take, crooked government agents, porno movie directors, and the Pigmaster, &quot;Hannibal&quot; will make you wonder, &quot;Really...just who IS the villain here?&quot;Don't let the negative reviews fool you, but DO NOT open this book expecting to find a repeat of &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; or you will be sorely disappointed. Give &quot;Hannibal&quot; a chance; this book is a piece of art in its own right and deserves an unadulterated view. And who knows? You just might get the urge to stand up and cheer for him - or is it 'them'? - at the end."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This homophobic, racist, misogynous, nihilistic book is not writing. It's not even typing. I wouldn't be surprised if Harris used a dictaphone while he was drunk one night while vacationing in Italy, and had some poor sub-secretarial sod transcribe it and FedEx it to the publisher the next day. Worse than the bad writing is the hideously offensive plot. Like the worst excesses of capitalism, Harris tries to top himself, create something new, and in the process manages to do more than offend -- this book is a tract for hateful, sexist, bigoted straight white men. I wouldn't be surprised if some adopt it as a theory of living, a la THE TURNER DIARIES."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'VE READ ALL HARRIS' PREVIOUS BOOKS AND FOUND HANNIBAL BORING AND DULL. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. READING THIS BOOK LEFT ME FEELING THAT HARRIS HAD TAKEN A TRIP TO ITALY AND WANTED TO SHOW OFF WHAT HE HAD LEARNED ABOUT THE COUNTRY AT THE EXPENSE OF TELLING WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD STORY. I FEEL SORY IF SOMEONE IS READING HANNIBAL AS A FIRST-TIME EXPERIENCE BECAUSE THEY WON'T KNOW HOW GOOD HARRIS CAN BE."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I fully expected to love this book. Last week, dusted off my copies of &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lamps&quot;, read them again - one day each. Watched the movies. Waited anxiously. Received my copy of &quot;Hannibal&quot; in the mail, read for six hours straight, and wished to god I could e-mail Thomas Harris and ask him why he had written this book. Or at least, why he had written it like this.&quot;Hannibal&quot; is to this series as &quot;Star Trek V&quot; is to it's own. Excrement. &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; were novels made riviting by the simple notion of remaining true to life, through hours and hours of research. Reading the first two novels is like taking a course in criminal/behavioral psychology, forensics, and criminology all in one. I felt like I learned something, and was entertained immensely at the same time.The story of Starling, Lecter, and Crawford has moseyed off to another dimension. This book is not rooted in reality. Granted, Hannibal is an &quot;unreal&quot; character - never been one like him in reality. But he resided in the real world, and one could imagine him living, functioning, in our reality. Here...well, I don't want to ruin the plot for anyone willing to read it. I simply couldn't stand it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hmmm, what I've said before about chianti and fava beans? Still tops on the menu. In the long awaited sequel to Silence of the lambs, everybody's favorite serial killer is back. Living in Florence as the well named Dr. Fell*, babysitting a gorgeous palazzo, using his talents to overcome his many adversaries and his always subtle way, finally getting the girl. Harris has made Hannibal Lector a little easier to understand, with details of his traumatic childhood. One can finally see where he gets his unhealthy eating habits. There are turns of plot with a former victim and his pets that will make many readers want to put down the book. This is strong stuff even for Lector fans. The author also casually does away with established characters that readers may have grown fond of. (in other words, don't look too far for Jack Crawford!, sorry Scott Glenn) The bottom line is that no matter how charming, how charismatic, Hannibal Lector is a monster, perhaps even as Stephen King implied in his New York Times review of the book, the definitive monster of our time. A happy ending? Well it ended. I don't think Thomas Harris is much on happy endings. As another well known cannibal, Sawney Bean of Scotland might have put it, it will give you a &quot;cauld grue&quot;. 6 fingers up! *I do not like you Dr Fell (anonymous nursery rhyme)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"'Hannibal' is a great read, and I really enjoyed it. The book raised a bit of a storm of criticism over the ending, which shows the depth of ignorance in the minds of the critics rather than any fault with the book.The book gives flesh and soul to Hannibal, making him the centre of the action, and completing his journey from what seemed to be the out of control darkly intelligent monster of the first two books, to a fully realised character with all too human virtues and flaws.Here Hannibal is the hero and anti-hero. His actions have purpose. He is in pursuit of, and aspiring to, the pure, the unsullied, virtuous, the highest of human creations. He kills those who 'deserve' it, the hypocritical, the ruthlessly cruel rich who abuse the power that wealth has conferred on them, those who would deny him his freedom for their own selfish and base greed. He does not kill at random, nor those that pose him no threat. He is as a superior being culling the diseased from the human flock. As such he is almost the kind of strong intellectual of the type that has been admired through the ages, a type that has it's roots in the world of the ancients of Greece and Rome.Indeed Hannibal is a character that the ancients would surely appreciate, their heros were rounded characters. People who had as many if not more faults than virtues. People who might kill unjustly but still be regarded as worthy. It is no surprise then that much of the plot of Hannibal is a reworking of one of the myths of the ancient world (Hannibal has found HIS Galatea!)So Hannibal is something of an aspirational character, strong in body and mind. But he is still flawed. He has unjustly assumed the power to kill and dispose of those he dislikes and despises, and that makes him less than human. Being both above and below us, Hannibal is truly special. Devour this book now. It is one of the best you are likely to read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The ending of &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; left Clarice Starling at her FBI Academy graduation. It seemed that her future, if not assured, was at least on the fast track. She was a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Jack Crawford, legendary head of the FBI's elite Profiling Unit. She had been instrumental in locating the serial killer known as Buffalo Bill and in fact had fired the bullet that killed him. In so doing she had saved the daughter of a United States senator-a woman dedicated to protecting and defending the role of women in government. It wasn't hard for the reader to imagine Clarice thirty years hence as the first female FBI Director in history.But the intervening seven years have changed much. The senator who might have become her advocate was defeated in the next election. Clarice's mentor, Jack Crawford, has become an old man, emotionally crippled by the death of his wife. He is sliding toward retirement and senility with what seems to be equal speed.She has attracted the attention of Paul Krendler, a high-ranking Treasury Department official who believes the only function of women in government is to be bedpartners for men like himself. When she rejects him he decides to punish her by destroying her career.If there's anything more vulnerable than a woman trying to make it in a man's world, it's a woman who is good enough to pose a real threat to the men. Clarice Starling has become a surplus agent, loaned out to the District of Columbia Police Department or anyone else who needs an extra warm body. It is a situation in which she has no way to win but many ways to lose.Playing counterpoint to this melody is Mason Verger, one of the few of Lecter's victims to survive. Wealthy beyond measure, Verger lives on full-time life-support. He hangs onto the frail thread of life for only one reason-he wants to capture Hannibal Lecter and watch him die a slow and agonizing death.As the new book opens, Verger and Krendler have joined forces because they share a common goal. Krendler doesn't want Clarice to capture Lecter because to do so would put her forever beyond the reach of his vengeance. Verger doesn't want Clarice to capture Lecter because the government would just return him to jail. Verger wouldn't have the pleasure of killing him, slowly and painfully.Lecter, meanwhile, has taken up residence in a mid-sized Italian town. Masquerading as Dr. Fell, a retired professor of medieval literature, he is a model citizen. His neighbors think him a little aloof but that's considered normal for wealthy Americans.Here is where we see the only real weakness in Harris's plot. By all accounts Lecter has been behaving himself. There have been no unexplained murders or disappearances in the area to attract the attention of either the local police or the FBI.Despite that, Verger's agents manage to find Lecter. They set a plot to kidnap him and turn him over to Verger. Lecter, of course, anticipates the plot and foils it, killing several of the would-be kidnappers in the process. But his cover is blown; he has to go on the run again. Being, as always, smarter than the police who are trailing him, he decides to go to the one place they're sure he'd never try to go, and where they're sure they could capture him if he tried. Lecter returns to the United States.It is at about this point that the careful reader can almost hear Harris's thoughts. Being a talented and experienced writer, he knows the story isn't working. The readers of &quot;Silence&quot; had demanded a story about Hannibal Lecter, but despite his best efforts this isn't Lecter's story. It is Clarice's. She has become both heroine and victim. Lecter merely plays a strong supporting role, as he did in &quot;Silence.&quot;Even worse, the story is going where Harris knows he cannot allow it to go. The only way for Clarice to salvage her career is to capture or kill Lecter-and that's the one outcome neither Harris nor his readers will tolerate. One can almost see him sitting at the keyboard muttering, &quot;How can I salvage this thing without starting over?&quot;Then, as strongly as we sensed his dilemma, we sense that he has found a solution. The story moves forward with a speed and vigor characteristic of Harris's earlier works but not heretofore seen in &quot;Hannibal.&quot; Crises are resolved and comeuppances gotten. In a grand finale reminiscent of the stunning conclusion of Harris's earlier &quot;Red Dragon,&quot; Clarice saves Lecter's life then he saves hers.But there are five chapters left, and the fundamental conflict of Clarice's career versus Lecter's freedom remains unresolved.In these final chapters the reader is treated to a metamorphosis seldom seen in literature. They are not Thomas Harris but rather Anne Rice out of Thomas Harris, written with the otherworldly texture and subtle eroticism that Rice has made her trademark. The story ends in a way that some readers will find satisfying, others will refuse to believe, and more than a few will find vaguely disturbing.Whatever the reader's reaction, Harris has accomplished what he wanted. The book is a bestseller, and it deserves to be. It may be made into a movie, and probably should be. But there will be no clamor for another book. The story of Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling is finished."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris's 'Hannibal' is suspense at its finest. Harris is able to capture a 'sense of the sinister' with precision and textual economy, sustaining the mood throughout the story. From the genesis to the denoument, the novel's potency is preserved.Three vignettes are worth mentioning. The first, on pages 65-68, is a brilliant case study of the psychotic mind. Here we see Lecter exercising his pathological disdain for accepted social behaviour by openly flossing after eating Steak Tartare at Maxim's. To compound his plunge into darkness, Lecter refuses to tip, stating coldly, \\"I knew I should have gone to Burger King. Doesn't that clown in the kitchen know how to cook a raw meat dish?\\"The second, on pages 145-157, demonstrates the author's dexterity with character development. In this defining passage, Clarice Starling declines Lecter's invitation to go ballroom dancing in a skilfully constructed interplay that includes the line, \\"But Hannibaby, I've heard you trip not only the light fantastic but everything else on the dance floor!\\"The final excerpt validates the author's reputation as a master of both conflict and pathos. On pages 212-236, Mason Verger, one of Lecter's surviving victims, is hospitalized, and the mood is taut. The intensity develops, eventually exploding when Verger shouts to the trembling nurse, \\"Will you get this pelican out of my nightshirt! I said I wanted a bed-bath, not a bird-bath! If that creep hadn't eaten my hands, I'd wring its neck!\\".Thomas Harris is a wiley wordsmith and his book is a classic. And it seems apposite here to clarify my reason for turning down a role in the film. It wasn't the money, as reported in 'Rolling Stone'. It was because I hadn't played a pelican before and my agent said I'd never get the walk right."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; were so very good and I anxiously awaited the sequel, but I cannot remember ever being so disappointed in a book. The story becomes more unbelievable with each page - the last few chapters were just a joke and the ending leaves you feeling ripped off for spending the money on a hardcover edition. Harris should be embarrassed for offering such crap to his loyal readers. And where were his editors? Didn't someone along the way tell him how bad this was? I am considering writing the author and asking him to refund my money."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I believe it has already been said, but this book was a huge disappointment, especially in the ending. I was left in a state of shock and disbelief at the ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It was Mencken who said no one ever went broke by underestimating American taste. Too bad the reception for Hannibal didn't prove him wrong. The ending is contemptible, the moral universe laughably cynical, and the erudition self-indulgent.And no, Harris doesn't 'own' his characters. Good characters own themselves, revealing themselves in their reactions to the god of their universe, who is, ultimately, the Author. Clarice would not have conceded her decency to the sick god of Hannibal.What garbage. When you search for Hannibal,you will also get After Hannibal, by Barry Unsworth. Read that."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Caveat lector. After the appetizer of &quot;The Red Dragon&quot; and the hearty soup of &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot; I was waiting anxiously for Thomas Harris to serve a delectable main course in &quot;Hannibal.&quot; I found myself chewing over a dry overcooked turkey.After building Clarice with such a strong character in &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot; I found her total about face harder to swallow than a lump of gristle. Mr. Harris' sloppy handling of her &quot;conversion&quot; did not set the premise for such a radical change. There is a vast difference to building a suspenseful denouement and an ungainly plot shift handled with the skill of freshman comp student.Anyone who has become disillusioned with a career can identify with Clarice's dilemma, especially when she is faced with what appears to be insurmountable obstacles to her future in the FBI. But the Clarice introduced in &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; would not have given up so easily.While I did find the glimpses into Hannibal Lecter's childhood interesting, they did little to reveal any clues into his psyche. They served more as a diversion than insight.Harris's handling of Dr. Lecter's stay in Italy showed some of the skill that first drew my interest to his works but deteriorated quickly into an exit far beneath the skill of Dr. Lecter.I do give the novel a marginal recommendation for one of those lazy vacation weekends but do not expect this to meet the quality of Mr. Harris' previous works."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I only hope that whomever makes the movie spends enough to do it right. I fear that it could quickly turn into a bad film. Dont read it late at night alone, like I did, unless you have solid nerves. I didn't care for all the Italian history which made it wordy at times. The ending was not predictable, and maybe not believeable, but I cant think of anything better. I agree with most of the negative comments too, but overall I loved it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I did enjoy this book but not as much as its two predecessors in the series.

I don't think Mr. Harris should have waited 11 years between &quot;Silence..&quot; &amp; &quot;Hannibal&quot;. I can't even begin to express how disappointed I was.

But Harris's prose style is witless, pedantic, and artless. The book reads like a script: dialogue is fine, but the descriptive paragraphs read like stage directions. And the ending - UGH - turns an otherwise good thriller with a strong, indomitable heroine into a sentimental romance worse than Richardson's Pamela. I hope Jodie Foster has the good sense to turn this sequel down. Bottom line: A good, fast summer read, but nothing that will stick in your mind."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"My initial reaction was that Harris had gone one step over the line ... Mason Verger is too horrible for print. But once again I found myself both repelled and seduced by Hannibal (as Clarice can attest).

Clearly this is a case of word of mouth not working as fast a popular culture curiousity.This book is awful.I can't believe that Thomas Harris took 10 years to write such a weak, uninteresting novel.Couldn't put it down? Hardly. I couldn't keep reading it, it was so bad. I only continued because I thought that it HAD to get better. People urged me to keep reading for the second half gore.The second half was as boring as the first, and hardly any gore that I can recall.And don't get me started on the ending. The most pathetic and unbelievable excuse for an ending that I have ever read (or at least since &quot;Meg,&quot; that bad shark book).Don't even waste your time with the public library. If any Hollywood screenwriter can save this, I'd be shocked.Worst $25 I ever spent."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What a waste of time. Harris takes two very interesting characters of Hannibal and Clarice and ruins them. I think Mr. Harris was either hurting for money or was under pressure to write a sequel to &quot;Silence of the lambs&quot; (a very good book), because this book is a poorly pieced together hunk of rubbish. I've read all three books in the Hannibal series and the second, &quot;Silence...&quot; is the only good one. In this book, Harris should have focused less on the little insignificant details that have little to with the plot and put that time into developing a plot that was worth something. Let me say this about the ending, it almost seems like Harris is intentionally writing an ending to make his readers mad. This ending is so stupid Harris seems to be saying &quot;HERE-I wrote a stupid sequel for you so leave me alone!&quot; Avoid this book as if it were the plague. Shame on you Thomas Harris for ever writing this."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The major flaw of Hannibal is that the characters which Harris created in Silence of the Lambs do not remain true to themselves. Here, they do not behave in the manner which Harris himself established in his previous work. The characters of Lecter and Starling are unbelievable, and their actions are incomprehensible. I felt that the author betrayed his own work, and that left me very disappointed. I simply cannot reconcile the behaviour of the main characters with the established patterns we have previously been given.I was also disappointed in the trite and simplistic way that Harris tried to explain Lecter's compulsion to kill. The character of Lecter is far too complex to have such a banal explanation. Most of Lecter's appeal lies in the fact that we don't know why he behaves the way he does; this heightens the mystery, and lends itself to believability. In life, there are rarely pat little explanations for human behaviour. The apologia for Lecter was unecessary and undermined the complex and interesting character he was in the first two books.The only remarkable idea in Hannibal is the concept of memory palaces. For that, I'll give Harris a star."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Be prepared for shopping lists that read like a Danielle Steeleguide to what the rich spend their money on - isn't Hannibal tastefuleveryone?

Are you upset because your brain has been pumped so full of Hollywood cliches and formula bestsellers, where the characters are paper thin and the plots are predictable, that you can't handle it when you are surprised by an ending and you actually have to THINK about the motives, intent, and psychology of the characters. The prose in Hannibal was full of poetic images and insight. Harris has played a joke on all of you worshippers of American cliche. The book is not about some serial killer, but it is about challenging our notions on what is good and what is evil, and about the defamation of Women in the 20th century. It's brilliant. Reading the reviews here has shown me that Thomas Harris has kept all of you lambs screaming. It's beautiful."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Several reviewers have beat me to the best lines about how bad this book is....but it is amazing that any book could be so gross and so boring at the same time. I loved Silence of the Lambs and was afraid that the sequel would not measure up....but the ending to this book is soooo awful and downright silly I don't know if to laugh or cry! I will definitely not be lined up for any more Harris books if this is the future of his writing. Save your money and time folks..there are a lot of books more worthy than this hunk of junk."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Don't waste your time or money on Hannibal. There are a lot of good books out right now that don't insult the reader's intelligence like Harris does on almost every page in this turkey, and when he's really rolling, several times per page, sometimes two or three times in one paragraph. Try Black Notice. Try The Devils Teardrop. Try The Target. Try Blind Man's Bluff. Try The Triumph and the Glory. Try watching old episodes of Mr Ed on Nick at Night. But if you have any regard for your poor overworked brain cells avoid Hannibal at all costs."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"While the book lacks many things, it has good qualities,including: Mason Verger- Mason is a bad guy equal to Lecter, bothphysically and mentally. Harris did an exceptional job creating the visual images of Mason and the evil he was capable of. Short chapters- The short chapters in this book lead to a fast-paced tale which I truly could not put down. Stephen King should pick up on this. While King tends to get bogged down in details, Harris gives us just enough details (sometimes too few, see below) to keep us interested. Even though there are good qualities, the book also lacks in many areas, such as: Short chapters- While it is advisable not to get bogged down in detail, Harris seemed to leave out too much detail in some cases. Many of the F.B.I. acronyms were not explained, and left the reader wondering about or accepting what was going on. Further explanation of technical detail, similar to that of Michael Crichton (Jurassic Park, Airframe, Disclosure) would have made Harris appear as an educated author instead of one who just threw in technical detail to appear to know what he was talking about. Grammatical detail- I found it disrupting and unacceptable to find several typing errors in this novel. There were several misspelled words and missing periods, which distracted me. This book came out 11 years after its predecessor, Silence of the Lambs. There was plenty of time to prepare an error-free text, and it shouldn't have been that difficult since Microsoft Word has upgraded both spell-check and grammar-check 15 times in that 11 year period. Not only did this book lack in technical detail, it lacked a quality ending. It was as if the ending was an entirely different plot. I'm not one for giving away endings, and I won't here, but it would spare many of you a lot of pain if I just told you what happened. You'll be disappointed when you get there. In the last subtitled section, Harris created his greatest monster. He created an absurd conclusion to a book that was relatively well written up to that point. The end of this novel was like morphing John Grisham with Disney Land; pure fantasy which had nothing to do with the plot at hand but left plenty of room for the heroes to ride off into the sunset. As a student of English and literature, I have been taught to review books in a fair and unbiased manner, judging only the literary quality and context of the material. In reviewing \\"Hannibal,\\" I feel that it is not only fair, but also generous, to give it a 1 star ranking. Maybe I'm just upset with the conclusion of this novel, but I feel as if I have been betrayed. I spent my time reading a good piece of literature only to find Harris destroying his reputation for a credible and somewhat realistic author."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I found the direction taken with the characters disturbing and unexpected. Definitely not the best of Thomas Harris. Maybe the less we know of Dr. Lector and his past, the better."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I think that this is a horrible book. Thomas Harris wrote a horrible sequel. Silence of the Lambs was wonderful, along with the movie, but this book was a disappointment. I read many books but this had to be one of the worst that I have ever read. He really let you down with the characters, and with the ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm amazed at the amount of negative criticism this book has gotten on the sole basis of its ending -- which, by the way, I found extremely consistent and fun. This isn't a book for the slice-and-dice crowd. Rather, it offers a wider and deeper context in which to understand that monsters can turn human -- and vice versa -- with very little help. By the way, I'm thrilled to know that at some point in the story I happen to be living four blocks away from Dr. Lecter! There goes the neighborhood..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After Silence of the Lambs, I expected more from Thomas Harris and Hannibal. This read more like a Mad Magazine parody, with cartoonish characters. I'm especially disappointed with Mr. Harris' treatment of Clarice Starling. She deserved better...and we all deserve a better book than we're gotten with Hannibal. I can't recommend this book, but I'll recommend a better one...Deception in the RainShadows by Riley St. James...a great mystery with credible characters and a thrilling plot."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Along with everything in the *Aliens* film series after *Aliens*, the most disappointing sequel ever. All of Harris's worst--it's gross for the sake of grossness--and none of his best, because he destroys the character of Starling. Jodie Foster, don't do it. A really, really, really seriously bad ending. Don't buy it; don't read it. I'm sorry I did."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thougts on the book: Enjoyed Margot and Mason quite a bit...could have done without Barney. Clarice is a much stronger, more confident character...a formidible opponent for Hannibal which is why the carnival ending left me feeling so confused, abandoned. Silly subplots. Doubtful situations. Harris is so afraid of the most reasonable ending, implies the supernatural. Like the transition between old world new world. Good exploration of clarice and hannibal pysche, that's when Harris really lets himself go...go flow. Dr. Lector's thought process extremely fascinating to observe. Except for the whole evil thing, Dr. Lector sounds like a good date. Impeccable taste, deliberate moves. However, Harris may get too intimate, personal with him. Having him give gifts ...trying to give him a soft side? Like to see how they get a screenplay out of it. Intensly hypnotic...loved visiting Hannibals mind palace, that was brilliant. Some extremely horrific unsettling scenes, a little far fetched...too much too easy for lector. Overall, good flavor."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"When I re-read RED DRAGON and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS shortly after seeing the movie of SILENCE, it frightened me more than anything in either of the books that Thomas's Harris's identification somehow had shifted from being with the FBI to being with Hannibal the Cannibal.HANNIBAL more than bears this feeling out. The key to understanding this book is the scene in which Dr. Lecter visits the exhibit on instruments of torture. He doesn't give them much attention but watches the reaction of the visitors with disgust and his usual sense of superiority.We, dear readers, are the visitors to the torture show and this book is Harris's one-in-the-eye, over-the-top offering to us thrown as though to a pack of jackals who are hungry for anything dead.If the reading public can't get enough of sickos and pyschos, then he's given us what we deserve."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A worthy successor to Silence of the Lambs. Imaginative, extensively researched, and skillfully executed. A great satire with a smashing denouement. The lobotomy dinner is a tour de force. Clarice and Hannibal dancing in each others arms; who would have imagined such a finale? Fred and Ginger must be disinterred if the film is to be perfect.I loved it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"From the beginning of the book, your hooked. You actually find yourself at times cheering Hannibal on trying to escape from Mason Verger's madness. But the ending between Hannibal &amp; Clarice Starling was just unbelievable. The relationship between the two in the Silence of the Lambs would not allow me to believe the ending in Hannibal."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibel seems to be written for the big screen, not for Harris' readers. I was very disappointed with the lack of suspense and the ending was compeltely unbelievable. Reading about ridiculous torture scenes that are written to outdo the previous one are not entertaining. Harris sold out - how sad."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book held my attention to the point of obsession - despite the the unspeakable horrors Lecter inflicts on his victims you feel inexorably drawn to his defence. A masterpiece of research and understanding of the workings of the human mind, however, I do wonder if Mr Harris wouldn't benefit from some therapy - where does he draw these horrors from?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A VERY big let down after Red Dragon and Silence. The &quot;Hannibal&quot; books seem to lose something with each title. The best of the three by far is Red Dragon. The ending of Hannibal is HORRIBLE!! Save your money!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was so looking forward to this book. I enjoyed &quot;Silence of the LAmbs&quot;. Harris took so long to come out with the sequel, ow could it not be terrifc.What a disappointment. The main bad guy, Verger, is more annoying than scary. Lector's personality is not developed at all the way it was in &quot;Lambs&quot;. He has matured into a benign person.The ending with Starling and Lecter was so poor I wanted to throw the book away.I am so sorry I bought the hard cover.. . a complete waste of time and money."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thought the book was very well done in tying the original story to it. I got a little lost and dis-interested in the Italian setting. I can see the relevance of some of the side stories in Italy but I thought it went into much too much detail. This will make a very interesting and entertaining movie. The ending...well.. I just don't know about that."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I ordered two books from Amazon. Hannibal, which was good, and The Fist of God, by A.T. Nicholas, which was great! I would highly recommend both novels and you should buy them from Amazon. It's cheaper."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I enjoyed the twists and turns in the latest novel in the &quot;Dr. Lecter series&quot;. Harris evokes another equally evil character in the revenge-obsessed Mason Verger. Mason's sister, Margot is quite a piece of work too. An unpredictable fun-read. If your seeking the serious... look somewhere else."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was very dissapointed in this book. It seems to me that Thomas Harris only wrote this book so that there would be a sequel to &quot;The Silence Of The Lambs.&quot; Now that was a book that I could not put down and this is one that I had trouble picking up. I only finished it so that I could fairly review it. If you have not bought it don't waste your time and your money. The author could of done much better. I was truly dissapointed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was absolutely terrible. Harris wastes page after page droning on about how cultured, articulate and intelligent Lecter is. Rather than researching fine wines, Dante, china, opera and art (and then blathering for chapter upon chapter about Lecter's knowledge of each), Harris should have spent more time developing a coherent plot. I enjoyed the films Manhunter and Silence of the Lambs (and have been told that the books are even better). However, these characters would have been better served by another author. For whatever the reason, Harris seems to have decided on a parody for this third installment. Harris attempts to turn Lecter (an outstanding villain) into some sort of hero, whom Harris obviously yearns for us to admire. The &quot;bad guys&quot; are laughable: 1) a drooling pederast (whose face has been chewed off by dogs); 2) the pederast's bodybuilding sister; 3) a corrupt Italian cop (who serves no purpose whatsoever); 4) a misogynistic FBI agent who hates Starling; and, among others, 5) a former mental institution orderly who wants to see every Vermeer painting in the world. Starling's fate is pathetic at best (I'll spare those of you who have not yet read the book). Save yourself the money and wait for the movie. Hopefully, the producers will have the sense to base the film VERY loosely on the book. It would appear that Harris suffers from the same diminishing talent as the formerly great Stephen King."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book clearly has several purposes, not the least of which is to generate a movie sequel to Silence of the Lambs, which will give us another chance to see Sir Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter. The author struggles to maintain Lecter's monstosity while making him sympathetic enough to almost be the hero of the book. The author implies that witnessing brutality as a child pushed sensitive and intelligent Hannibal over the edge into psychopath, and yet delights in describing the brutality of the sympathetic monster against those who draw his well deserved attention. Once we enter the mind of Lecter, the mask of invincibility crumbles, although he still performs superhuman feats when required. Ultimately, the conclusion does not ring true with the reduction of Starling from independent heroine to trophy. I enjoyed reading the book, completing it in four days, and the grisly descriptions will haunt my dreams, but I hope they change the end for the movie (as with The Firm by Grisham)."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Despite the panning here I decided to read it anyway, as I trusted Stephen King's review in the Times more. . . I was not disappointed. Yes, Hannibal is vivid and gross, but not as vile as I was expecting. After all, how gross can it be when there is but a brief description of a man's brain being removed and sliced, but then a much longer description of how said brain was drenched in brioche crumbs, sauteed, and dressed with a butter and truffle sauce, all to the amusing and often witty repartee of the parties eating the brain and the brain's owner himself? It seems like Harris is trying to take you to a very, very different perspective on such an act. The fact that we are all disturbed is expected. But, what does one think if such a passage makes you hungry?In addition, to me, the whole issue as to whether Clarice can take Mischa's place in the world, or vice versa, whether or not this is in fact a better place or worse one for Clarice, and the fact that such a delicate balance remains always in Lector's hands will haunt you long after the book is over. This and other more subtle psychological points is why this book represents a step forward from the &quot;now he's caught and it's over&quot; of other books of the genre. The only character that disappointed me was Mason Verger, who needed at least one redeeming feature (everyone has one) to make him more believable."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This one certainly has some improbable plot details. But it appears to me that Mr. Harris wants Hannibal and Clarice to live the good life after all is said and done. He also obligingly wound up the lives of some of the other fine characters he created. The good life is difficult for a serial killer even one as smart as Dr. Lecter. We recall that at first he was detained in &quot;Silence&quot;. As for Clarice, what's an excellent law officer to do about politics? Since Mr. Harris started out with some improbable dispositions of characters, the ending wasn't so impossible. I read it twice because he is so engaging. Maybe Mr. Harris has had enough of Dr. Lecter and Clarice like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had enough of Sherlock Holmes. I say it was engaging, some times improbable, liked some of it, didn't like other parts. But as always, I was entertained (enchanted by the Italian descriptions) and shuddering as I read the gory stuff. What's new for us, Mr. Harris? Will our author move on to another subject? Ardelia's life and struggles? Will we have to write our own sequels? Whatever happened to Will Graham? Did/Will his wife change her mind? I hope so. Nothing to do but wait."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The publisher should be hanged. If all the industry wants out of this &quot;writer&quot; is a screenplay for a lousy movie, why not ask him to &quot;write&quot; a screenplay and be done with it. Ack!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I really loved Silence, but this novel just isn't quite as good. Still a decent read if you enjoy the Hannibal character."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I bought and read this novel some time ago. I didn't read The Silence Of The Lambs so I can't compare Hannibal with The Lambs but I thought Hannabal was a smooth read from first to last page. Very Well Written"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Is there a cooler villain in all of literature than cannibalistic Psychiatrist Hannibal Lector? In my humble opinion, no. After scene-stealing turns in Author Thomas Harris' previous two books (Red Dragon & The Silence of the Lambs), the good Doctor takes center stage in his own book, Hannibal.To get the comparison out of the way, Hannibal the book blows Hannibal the movie away. I purposely put off reading Hannibal until after I saw the movie (Tough to do, considering I was on line at the bookstore before they opened the day the book was released!); I thought I'd enjoy the movie more that way, and I'm glad I waited now, because if I had seen the movie AFTER reading the book, I would have hated it. The movie is like the Reader's Digest version of the book. They both follow the same plot, but the rich tapestry Harris weaves with his prose just can't be captured on film. (Plus, the film cops out at the end, opting for a more sequel-friendly finale.)In Hannibal, we find our murderous gourmet abroad in Florence, Italy, living the good life. Soon he's the center of a worldwide hunt that involves a disgraced Italian Cop, a hideously disfigured former victim and his pumped-up sister, and Hannibal's former nemesis, F.B.I. Agent Clarice Starling. When Starling is put on the F.B.I.'s hit list, Hannibal puts a daring plan into action that can only end in violence. And a VERY special dinner......As in the previous two Hannibal Lecter books, and his excellent first book, Black Sunday, Harris is a masterful wordsmith; His prose is absolutely elegant, even when describing acts of incredibly grotesque violence, of which this book has no shortage. (I consider myself pretty jaded, and I must say that I was VERY disturbed by a lot of what I read in this book. I treasure any book that can bring out such a strong reaction in me.)His characters, from Hannibal and Clarice right on down to the most minute supporting player, are all vividly rendered and three-dimensional. Aside from the straight-arrow Clarice, who is actually the most bland character in the book, there's really no one but Hannibal to root for. The book is populated by unrepentant scumbags like the faceless pedophile Mason Verger and the shifty Paul Krendler, so seeing the way Hannibal draws them all into his web and serves them their just desserts is quite entertaining, and more than a little cathartic. The book's ending is miles apart from the movie's, and I'm still haunted by the last line. Hannibal is an amazing read, and is probably one of the top ten books I've ever read. Bon Appetit, Dr. Lecter!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Invite Hannibal Lecter into the palace of your mind and be invited into his mind palace in turn. Note the similarities in yours and his, the high vaulted chambers of your dreams, the shadowed halls, the locked storerooms where you dare not go, the scrap of half-forgotten music, the muffled cries from behind a wall.... I own this book, and it is definetly one of the best reads out there. Thomas Harris is a great author, and Dr. Hannibal Lecter is the best character there is. He is such an evil genius! I LOVE it! I eat this stuff up! If you like crazy, evil, disgusting horror, GO GET IT!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What can be said of Hannibal that's already been said? One thing: a truly grueling novel. Harris rejects all public advice and places Dr. Lecter in a realm all to his own. Despite his previous novels involving Lecter, Harris invites us to view Lecter as a main character. And, in my opionion makes for a more entertaining read. Lecter is and will always be the source of entertainment in Harris' novels. In Hannibal, \\"The Cannibal\\" gets his just deserts. The novel is one of the best I've ever read, period. I'm just hoping that Harris will write sooner than later, and maybe, just maybe invite Lecter for one more course. If you have doubts about this novel, reject all of tham and find out for yourself. Do not base you're decision on the film, just lock your doors, turn off the lights, and enjoy of one of the most disturbing novels of recent time. Trust me, it's worth it. Lecter is out and better than ever. Bon appetite."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Before the disappointing movie came out, I read Hannibal over the course of three days and for the most part was satisfied. Say whatever you will about the story, but none can deny Harris' compelling and suspenseful storytelling, it is literally a page turner. Here we get to see Lecter living in the free world according to his tastes. We also get a peek inside Lecter's mind to see the genius behind the cannibal, but there are a number of things which stop Hannibal from being as great a story as Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. The characterization of Clarice makes her seem more weak willed and not so much the strong, compotent heroine that we knew so well in Silence. Also the climax, as another reviewer had stated, seems like an outline for a screenplay for a big budget Hollywood action film, but is nonetheless compelling and has its' share of twists. The ending seems to be everyone's biggest complaint, and I admit I was shocked when I first read it, but come on now, can you think of any other better way that it could have ended? All in all, I didn't like Hannibal as much as Harris' other great novels in the Lecter trilogy, but Hannibal is compelling and suspenseful, and is light years beyond the supremely disappointing big budget film."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It is unlike the two Lecter novels before it. The writing is a bit different, and the Harris goes much more into the lives of the characters than in his earlier books.In \\"Hannibal\\", there are three main characters. We find Dr. Lecter living in Italy, leading a life he always dreamed of. A teacher and Art Director, studying, teaching and hiding, going on with his life as if he was never locked away. Then we have FBI special agent Clarice Starling. Starling knows Lecter from the book \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" where she intervies him for his insight on catching a serial killer. Never giving up on Lector, Starling knows she will find him, but she doesnt know why she wants to find him so bad. She fights herself, knowing that she wants him locked away again, but at the same time, she also hides more reasons for the search. And the third main character is a severly dissabled man named Mason Verger, a middle aged billionaire, who's life was ruined by Lecter when he was a young experimenting homosexual, and now he wants revenge and will do anything to get it.Harris takes on a ride around the world following these characters, and learing about how they all connect to Hannibal in some way, even Hannibal himself. This book is VERY different then the movie, so if you want to learn more about the lives of these people and an ending very very different then the movie, then you will want to read this incredible thriller. We get driven deep into all of their minds, and learn the true reasons for Lectors behavior.Harris did not miss his mark with this book. The ten years in the making was worth the wait.This is an Incredible conclusion to an incredible trilogy."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This sequel to \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" was a terrific read; that is, up until the last two chapters of the book.Poor Clarice. Her life after successfully bringing down the serial killer Gumm certainly wasn't as she had imagined. It seems she found out that if one makes a formidable enemy on the way to the top, the top may prove to be ever elusive.Dr. Lecture's masquerade in Florence was fascinating. Harris really showed the extensive research that he did in writing this book. In many ways, it was an education in medevial art and history as well as an exploration into the mind of a serial killer.The murder of the magistrate was particularly fascinating. This murder was more public than Dr. Lecture's previous murders. (To be sure, being fed a gourmet meal that just happens to include a former member of your board is quite public, but this was different.) The murder brings out Dr. Lecture's love of history and his flair for drama.The in-depth exploration of Mason Virger was truly interesting. Mason happens to have many of the same complexities of Hannibal Lecture, as is obvious when Harris constantly alludes to his escapades during the summer camps that his dad sponsored. Mason's desire to bring down Dr. Lecture was more about the desire to see a human eaten alive, than about acheiving revenge. In the end, what an gorey way to die! Sharing your last breaths with the very eel that you bought because of its ability to consume life.I just cannot accept the ending; however. I was truly wrapped into this. I expected Krendall to be eaten alive, a fate that was depicted in the movie. However, I never expected Starling to succumb to the charms of the doctor.To be honest, the ending really disturbed me. But, isn't that what Harris probably wanted. Just the idea that we could show up at the opera one night and bump into a charming couple that could perhaps be the good doctor and Agent Starling!Despite the ending, Harris has really outdone himself once again. His exploration of the \\"palace of the mind\\" was one of the most fasinating reads ever."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"(*Some possible spoilers*) To me, it was a great read. I turned to the first page, and before I knew it I was finished with it. It's that engrossing. I really liked the Mason Verger character and his plot for revenge. Also, Hannibal's stint in Italy was very cool. I liked all the historical references that Mr.Harris' uses for the Pazzi character. Finally, I liked looking into the mind of Hannibal which was quite fascinating. I can understand how the ending could disappoint people, but I didn't have a problem with it. (Admittedly, it did take me by surprise.) My take was that the politics of it all was just too much to bear for Clarice. (Nothing she ever did ever pleased anybody, and she kept getting stabbed in the back by the higher-ups.) Keep in mind that she did have too much inner baggage she had to struggle with. Her being drugged along with being hypnotized probably didn't help her combat these deep emotional scars any. Overall, a very fine effort by Mr.Harris!!! Did I hear that this was the last book in the series? That's too bad ... Maybe its good to get out on top. My two cents (plus change)."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This review refers to the audio version. I give this work credit for not being more-of-the-same of its predecessor. I also give Harris credit for courageously making the outcome what he wanted rather than what would appeal to the masses, creating some dissonance for the reader. I had to rewind the last side of the last tape a few times to make SURE I heard the dinner scene correctly. He is a FANTASTIC narrator and his own lilt and accent make this a great listen."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Nice continuation of the Starling-Lecter relationship, though the ending was a bit too over-the-top...imho...All in all, however, a fun, exciting read!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was intrigued by &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; because of the detective work, tension, novelty and such. I was pleased to see &quot;Hannibal&quot; come along, thinking &quot;more fascinating, rich character/plot development.&quot; I picked it up in Book on Tape form. The reader was initally disappointing but soon settled in with richly satisfying impressions of Jodi Foster and Anthony Hopkins (perfect Lecter) and the new character Nason. The book is richly developed, I think. For a while this kept me interested, intrigued, anticipating the plot turns. BUT, the book delves into some truly gruesome depths that I really did not need to plumb.I am not that squeamish and am more curious and tough-minded than many, perhaps. But some of the images developed in the book, I never needed to see. I can well imagine some readers, should they persist in turning the pages, would certainly grow nauseous and not a few may throw up!By way of analogy, using erotic media, I feel there is a not-so-fine line between titillation and torture. A line beyond which brutal sadism dwells. I feel Thomas in &quot;Hannibal&quot; has crossed well beyond such a line. Many may argue he did so in &quot;Lambs&quot;, and maybe so. But in &quot;Hannibal&quot;, I think we get images that are the stuff of nightmare and which many readers, such as myself, may never be able to forget, regretfully."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"For years many readers have awaited this book and most of us rushed out to purchase it the second it hit the bookshelves and most of those readers have been somewhat disenchanted.While the plot still holds some twists and turns it could not stand up to Harris' two previous Hannibal books. It seemed as though Harris did not really know what to do with Lecter this time around. The other two books were intricately woven stories this book seemed to be more of a psychological profile of Hannibal - Starling is not really a central character and Mason Verger who was touted to be even more frightening than Lecter was at total disappointment.Harris seems to confuse thriller with sheer violence in Hannibal. Readers do not get that intense, edge of your seat, check to make sure the doors are all locked fear - instead they find a bland story line with more grotesque than gory. It also seemed as tho Harris rushed the ending and manipulated the characters to do something that was way out of character for them (especially Startling).While I still found this book to be enjoyable I was not quite sure if the real disappointment was from the anticipation that the long lag between books created or because the book seemed so unimaginative in comparison with Harris' other Hannibal works.Read this book but don't go in with expectations based on Harris' two previous Hannibal works - you will be disappointed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The Red Dragon and Silence Of The Lambs were grabbingly terrific. I don't think Harris could pass on the money for this one. Why else would he write something this shallow? If it wasn't the money, he's just run out of ideas. If you've run out of ideas on developing characters, leave them alone. This was a true disappointment..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In a sense this book has tainted &quot;The silence of lambs&quot;. I do not want read that excellent book again, since it will remind of this poor follow-up - which in large parts contradicts the personalities of the first book. The &quot;unexpected&quot; ending of this book is not even interesting or logical what that matters. This book is cheap. Maybe it was written for the screen. I recommend you to read something else, like Michael Connelly."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I did not read Silence of the Lambs, saw the movie, loved it and then read Hannibal. I liked the book very much. It keep my attention and was a quick read. However, I was very disappointed in the ending. Just TOO unbelievable. I for one just cannot accept the &quot;Starling Ending&quot;. I have to read the Red Dragon now, just to see for myself and can decide once and for all if I like Thomas Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Wow, the ending was a real let down. As I approached the ending, I was hoping for it to be a dream (like on Dallas). Barney's involvement was thin and Clarice's Daddy-like devotion to Lector was cornball at best. Foster will never do the movie! The ending would have to be re-written in order for this story to fly. Read this one with a bit of caution. Don't aim high and you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, I don't have the words to express what a disappointment this book is. Kudos to Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins for passing on the film.Up until Clarice's ill-fated rescue attempt, it's interesting, although not nearly as good as the previous two books. The ending, however, is so ludicrous and inconsistent with Starling's character, that you'll wish it had never been written.Let's all hope that next book, Harris starts fresh with totally new characters."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am so sorry that I read this book. It has changed and cheapened the quality of the characters that have continued from the earlier books. I will not buy another book by this author"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Poor writing, disjointed scenes, and an unbelievable plot--I kept reading, hoping it would get better. Alas, the ending only cemented my earlier conclusion--this book was a waste of time. I'm sure Mr Harris must be a talented writer, but it was not evident here."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm somewhat surprised at the negative reviews given to Hannibal. The book had the usual characters and suspects, plus a new batch with most of them quite disreputable. Nothing wrong with that. More of this book was directed to political infighting than detective work than before. A couple discrepancies here and there but nothing show stopping. A genuine page turner though most of its length, I found the ending to be a very unexpected but interesting twist. Spoiler alert here! Many reviewers took offense at Agent Starling's fate and stated how implausible it was. Well, her hold on reality was never than great given her one-mindedness and narrow focus on life. Hell, Lecter as a character at all is fairly implausible - once we've accepted him in the book, the final step to the end isn't too unreal."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was so anxious to read this book. Being a fan of Thomas Harris' other books, I bought this one probably before the ink was dry! What a disappointment! It started out fine, but everything you loved about these characters from the other novel was destroyed. He didn't stay true to any of the characters and I can only say that I hope they freely change the movie (if they make one)."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A good friend loaned me the book. He had very high praise for it. I could not put the book down, it was a tremendous read. The ending begs for a comeback. Great!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"That's a couple of days of my life I'll never get back. I'm not going to repeat what most others are saying here, except to say: &quot;Don't waste your time&quot;."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Oh please, PLEASE, save us from authors tired of their characters and aiming only for that bonus check from Hollywood. Ponderous, confusing, stomach-churning (and that's just the prose, not the plot)...was I disappointed? You bet I was. As was my husband.We both agreed the end-game received short shrift. had Harris bothered to spend more time there and less time with Verger and his horrendous plot for revenge, I might have been able to accept the ending. Yes, yes...the bare bones of justification were there but I'm sorry Mr. Harris, it was not enough. You glossed over the details of Lecter's psychological seduction of Starling leaving most every reader bewildered at her abrupt personality change. Shame on you.For those of you who haven't yet wasted your time, don't bother. Go read something by John Sandford instead, or re-read SILENCE OF THE LAMBS."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After waiting, along with all the other Thomas Harris fans who enjoyed &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, for&quot;Hannibal&quot;, I was thrilled when a copy became available at my library. Alas, it was nothing like what I'd hoped. Unbelievable! I simply can't accept this story. This book was a huge disappointment."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Well, I notice many people were disappointed with this...I was too immediately after finishing the book. It was great up until the end right? I agree with that. I thought Mason Verger himself was a stupid and predictable character. I've always felt sympathy for every other antagonist in Harris's books. But perhaps, Harris didn't want you to feel sorry for Mason. Harris has always shown both sides of the villian, so he very well could've done so here. Harris wanted your attention to be turned towards Hannibal. And it was. Now, about Clarice. Who says that she wasn't acting like herself? Guys, Clarice has always been running and hiding from her past, avoiding it. At the beginning of the book, with the somewhat impromptu letter from Lecter, her immediate instinct was to catch him. To redeem herself, possibly, to distract attention from her little Evelda Drumgo incident. Or maybe, despite Lecter's reassurance that he would not go after Starling, she had a little fear for her life. Lecter feels Starling can replace Mischa, and maybe Starling feels that Lecter is almost like her father. Starling realizes that Lecter and herself need each other, they need each other's comfort, she realizes that with Lecter, she can stop running. In &quot;Silence&quot;, the lambs were a metaphor for Catherine, but were they also a metaphor for Clarice? Was Clarice's past a lamb? Clarice's lamb was slaughtered, and, depending on your religious beliefs, the lamb's soul may have gone on to where it wanted to be. Like someone below said, this is the death of Clarice as we know her, she is moving on to where she wants to be. Clarice never needed the FBI. She needed Lecter. So, after you've let the ending sink in, you realize that Starling didn't stop acting like herself, because she was just starting to. I thought the ravenous pigs, the eel, the little feast at the end, were all very stupid things. I thought Mason was a very stupid character. The plot here was not about Mason wanting to kill Lecter as much as it was about the relationship between Clarice and Hannibal. How Clarice learned to stop running, and how Clarice learned to let go of her lamb. As for a sequel, the closing line says it all in my opinion. &quot;We can only learn so much and live.&quot;Movieboy"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I picked up Silence of the Lambs [...] and rushed through it sothat I could get to Hannibal. It was worth it.Hannibal stands beside Dean Koontz's Intensity as the scariest novel I have ever read (and I read a lot in the horror genre). From start to finish it is a page turner, and today, my third day, I have finished it in a 220 page read-fest. I agree with Larry King, of the USA Today, in saying that the final 100 pages are the &quot;best I've ever read in the thriller genre.&quot;Clarice Starling does not hold as dominant a role as she did in &quot;Silence&quot; (don't worry, she gets her share of the plot), and we are instead intoduced to other main characters, including the vile Mason Verger.Visions of Hannibal Lecter will haunt me for years to come, I am sure, as they will haunt all other readers of this amazing piece of literature.I believe that I most enjoyed the 120 or so pages we spend in Florence, which Harris describes so well (without actually describing anything) that we feel that we are there beside Lecter, as well as the Italian policemen (a Pazzi of the Pazzi).[...]All writers have one book that stands out as being their best and most ingenious works. For King it was The Stand. For Puzo it was The Godfather. For Koontz it was Intensity. For Harris it was Hannibal, a book so superior to it's predecesor that it is laughable. While &quot;Silence&quot; seemed to be made for the silver screen, Hannibal was made for the written word, a feat that is rare now in the days where 9/10 authors imagine their works as becoming Hollywood blockbusters. Although Hannibal is soon to be released in movie form, I do not look forward to it, as no movie I've seen has EVER captured the true greatness of the book it is based upon.In closing, I reccomend this novel to anyone who doesn't mind a bit of a &quot;sick and twisted&quot; plot. I have found in reading some of the 2000 reviews for this book that people either love it or hate it. Most of the reviews are either 1 or 5 stars. I give it five, and I consider it to be among the best novels I have ever read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I am not one who reads as many books as others, and I am sad to say that out of all the books out there, I gave this one my time that I will never get back. This is a warning. This book falls very short of anything worthwhile.The plot is thrown together in an attempt to fill the pages. The characters are destroyed from what they have been worked up to from the previous book. With all the reference work done on police procedures, he has forgotten to look back and reference his own work. The book leaves the reader very disappointed as you watch everyone act out of character. You are very aware of the rush to put this one the market and get the movie cracking(which none of the actors or director want any part of). This, if nothing else, should tell you how the book is. Forget the other reviews. When you can't pay people to be in your movie forget the book. All and all, a very thrown together, get paid, rush with the biggest drop of an ending. This book is for anyone who likes to have the characters rewritten in a sloppy way, in a quick rush at unthoughtout story telling. Go repaint the house or go to the dentist, do anything else than read this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Let's just start by saying that I hate suspense-thriller novels. They are tripe. I have been reading the reviews on Amazon, and I have to say I am saddened. DO NOT take the reviews of these gore-o-philes seriously. &quot;Hannibal&quot; is a case study of Hannibal Lecter's psyche mixed with one of Lt. Starling, with a little old fashioned detective story. If you are looking for crap, read something else. This book has a lot of history, research, and fascinating, if somewhat self-indulgent, descriptions of Florence. Mr. Harris is to be commended for writing such an insightful book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":".... Having come to Harris' books through the film 'Manhunter',I was pleased find an author who could drag the serial killer genreinto the realm of literature. After 'Red Dragon' came 'Silence', which was plainly a masterpiece. Imagine my anticipation for 'Hannibal', which was justified until the midpoint of the book, when Lecter leaves Italy. Suddenly, it was as if Harris had grown tired of his writing, his characters, and his theme, and just wanted to be done with it. It was like John Fowles writing half a novel and then handing it over to Dean Koontz to finish. I rather like what happens to Krendler in the end, but I never believed in him as a character (Harris seems to need a straw man to punish in his novels: the tabloid reporter in 'Dragon', Dr. Chilton in 'Silence'). Lecter's flashbacks touch on possible motivation for his sociopathic nature (inspired by Andre Chikatilo?) but are never fully explored, as with the killer in 'Dragon'. And Lecter, ready for even a pickpocket in Italy, fatally dropping his guard on his enemy's home turf? Oh, please! Needless to say, Thomas Harris will never get my hardcover buck again...."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I recieved this book as a Christmas Present and after a throughly exciting beginning and development of the characters. It wandered and meandered like the Snake River, doing it so badly that I finally had to put the book away, where it sat for the past 3 months. One day here recently, I ran across &quot;Hannibal&quot; again while going through my book collection, and apparently during the interim I had developed a case of amnesia, so I picked it up and started reading it again. Somehow I was able to get past the point where I initally stopped, don't ask me how, and was able to continue reading, what a total and complete waste of time. When I reached the ending I remember saying to myself, &quot;I am damn glad that I did not pay for this piece of junk&quot;. The ending while surprising was nevertheless beyond the bounds of good taste, and utterly beyond belief, for me to even fathom it. I actually found myself feeling sorry for &quot;fictional characters&quot; not because of any great storytelling on Mr. Harris's part, rather I felt sorry for them because they were trapped in a hackneyed, and stupid story. This book was so bad I felt the urge to go wash myself off after finishing it, because I felt soiled some how.I am so glad to hear that no one associated with the original cast let alone the director and screenwriter, is even going to take part in bringing this utterly pointless and banal piece of trash to the screen. In order for a movie adaptation to work in my opinion, the ending is going to have to be completely redone since it is far to sickening to even contemplate. Wait a minute I do not even think a movie could be made, since none of the fans of the first one would even be willing to see a sequel without all the original characters reprising their roles, here here!In closing Mr. Harris I would like for you to write a apology for giving your readers such a complete and utter piece of trash as this &quot;so-called sequel&quot;. I know &quot;Hannibal&quot; was meant to be the conclusion to the Dr. Lecter trilogy, but there is no way you can leave it like this. Well I guess maybe you can however, I for one will never buy another one of your books, even if it wins a Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is a book which started off with and consequently, maintained a high level of intensity. But, apparently the author got tired of writing it and decided it was time to go to bed. So...after ten years of working on a sequel to two excellent books, we are left with the most pathetic ending I've ever read. Hannibal is a complete waste of time."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In the first 100 pages we meet Mason whom Hannibal Lector tricks into slicing off his face with a piece of glass and feeding it bit by bit to starving dogs he's penned up. Then Hannibal breaks his neck and paralizes him. Mason does not die but rather lives in a wing of his house, behind a monacle (he cut out his other eye and the remaining eye must be misted for the dogs got BOTH eyelids) where he tortures orphaned black children into killing their kittens. This is revolting. My lord, I thought that I was immune from shock considering what I did in earlier days but this is too much. Realistic detail be damned; that defense could be used of Dr. Mengele's journals. This is perverse. If you read this, it will spoil your associations with the places where you read it. It ruined a vacation on South Padre Island for me."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal has none of the terror and suspense of Silence of the Lambs. Thomas Harris writes this book with nothing more in mind that to see how much he can disgust the readers. The book is slow-moving and does not really capture your attention. I can truely understand why Jodie Foster has opted not to return to &quot;Clairce Starling.&quot; I would do the same thing in her position."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I loved the movie Silence of the Lambs. I read the book and enjoyed it also. I looked forward to the sequel. I bought Hannibal as soon as it came out. I read the book, barely. Many times I put it down out of disgust. When I got to the ending I was simply apalled.This is a bad book. The characters from Silence of the Lambs appear in name only. It relies on shock and the grotesque to maintain the reader's interest. Much of the grotesque has nothing to do with the story line. The violence verges on pornography.The worst part of the book is the ending. First there is a scene of Hannibal's revenge that outdoes any of the perverted violence in the rest of the book. Then interaction between Lecter and Clarice that makes the character of Clarice unrecognizable. In the final ending Clarice is warped into a character that is not the Clarice portrayed in Silence of the Lambs. I took this book to a used book store and couldn't give it away.This is not Silence of the Lambs or any reasonable facsimile thereof. Do not waste your time or money buying or reading this book. It is simply a bad book, just pass it by."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"When I started on this book I was absolutely hooked, I practically read it straight through. But the ending was so awful it was painful. I heard a rumor that Jodi Foster refused to do the movie despite a record-breaking sum of money because her character was so pathetic. I don't know if it's true, but I don't blame her for a second if it is."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It's hard to know what Harris was about when he penned this. Perhaps he was trying to avoid a formulaic sequel. I'll never know. But whatever it was he was trying for, it didn't work out.Some critics accused him of betraying his characters. It's hard to see his reasons for having his characters do blackflips, but they're a whole lot less convincing and less engaging this time around. Barney went from being noble to perfidious, Starling from complex to frankly a little stupid. Where Silence of the Lambs featured some truly beautiful prose, some of the dialogue in Hannibal is wincingly bad. The whole conversation between Lecter and Starling on whether he had to give up breast feeding for his younger sister was less than elegant, and some of Starling's dialogue was the polar opposite of her character. Some of it was just out and out bad.The 'psychology' was ham-fisted and unconvincing. Why Harris felt the need to 'explain' Lecter is hard to tell, but it didn't work.Perhaps because some of this book is written from Lecter's point of view, it is far less engaging. The reader can't invest in it in the same way as Silence of The Lambs. We have nothing to lose. Nothing is at stake. Perhaps this is because the characters have nothing to lose. They are all so glib and uncaring.He frequently sets the reader up for disappointment by employing thrilling devices that go nowhere.For reasons known only to Harris, he has chosen to showcase his erudition in Hannibal. It is to the exclusion of the reader and not at all entertaining. We are instructed to listen, not to participate. He also frequently self-plagiarises.Not his best work."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The ending of this one cought me by surprise, but I loved it. I kept wondering if it would end that way. Hannibal catches up with Chilton, and the two guys trying to catch him add a comic sort of slapstick element that is quite gruesome also. Clarice keeps in touch with Ardelia, and writes her a letter at the end telling her the situation. Read it if you haven't, it's a shocker."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is my favourite book. It's prose is razor sharp and yet still manages to flow like the silkiest of fine wines. Thomas Harris has served up an entirely pretentious and self- indulgent work of fiction; and for this I can only applaud. Harris is not writing for film, for the world of Literature, nor his millions of fans... This is Harris for Harris and it is this method that makes Hannibal more than just a masterpiece, but a standout in the modern world of horror. I personally feel the ending is the best I've ever read- with the final one hundred pages utterlly spellbinding. However, the majesty of this work cannot be fully appreciated with anything less that two reads. In many ways it reminded my of Hitchcocks &quot;Vertigo&quot;: it demands to be revisited more than once- and only then will you fall into Hannibals dark, obtuse and morbid world. The characters are utterly real and fully justified: Clarice Starling is a fantastic mascot for Literatic femininity and Hannibal Lecter becomes much more than a cannibal. He becomes human- one of us. This is a book about obsession, religion, domination, exploitation, failure and fine foods. I have read &quot;Hannibal&quot; five times and will undeniably revisit it again. It begins and ends with the most perfectly chilling sentences to be seen since the words of Edgar Allan Poe.Utterly compelling and totally non-franchise."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I see a lot of reviews and people aren't liking it much. I think they are looking at it from the wrong view. Its not about psychological depth anymore, as it was with Silence of the Lambs.If you read Silence of the Lambs, you'd know that Lecter and Starling are professionally (even personally) intrigued with each other and that Hannibal- merely expands on that relationship past the glass barrier that existed in the Silence of the Lambs. Its not about Starling trying to figure him out &amp; trying to get him to help her anymore, its about the two of them finding their common ground beyond his so-called &quot;dungeon&quot;.Dr. Lecter himself is merely indulging himself in Clarice and she doesn't totally allow it but she merely tolerates it.Its like some twisted love story...Also has a different ending than the movie. If you found the movie lacking something meaningful, turn to the book for a good ending. I find both endings satisfying considering the markets the movie was aiming at and the market the book was aiming at."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris deserves a medal for defiance of conventional writing. He's still the master of shocking fiction...the final scenes of Hannibal may well be the most viscerally stunning fiction ever written, and are likely to retain that honor for some time to come.Though I hate it when authors &quot;sell out&quot; to formulaic plots when they write sequls, I was disppointed by Harris's treatment of Starling and Lecter in &quot;Hannibal&quot;. As so masterfully developed in &quot;Silence&quot;, Starling's character, determination and duty are matched only by Lecter's almost superhuman intelligence, charm and dementedly creative sadism. Starling and Lecter struck a deep chord in the American public, yet these characters, and the balance between them, were (in my view) fatally compromised in &quot;Hannibal&quot;. By the final pages, Starling's character is practically unrecognizable, and Lecter's role as principal antagonist had long since been usurped by the twisted Mason Verger.Perhaps this is the only way the story could have played out, given the powerful nature of these characters, but if that is the case, perhaps it is a story better left untold. Sometimes a book or movie is so good, ending with loose ends so tantalizingly untied, that even the thought of a sequel should be treated like drugs...just say no. Silence of the Lambs was such a book, and, for my part, I wish Harris had just said NO to the book deal for Hannibal."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"this was the book i'd been waiting for, if anybody is like me, then you wanted hannible to escape in scilence of the lambs because you absolutly love him he was so gentlemanly and polite, whether it was in the book or the film, hannibal always struck me as genius. even if you dont like the books, if harris has got one thing right you have to give him dr lecter - he's so perfect! after reading scilence of the lambs i became strongly sucpicious that he was only being psychotic for his own amusement - having a good laugh at the system along the way. hannibal was always seen in so many different ways, scarry, manipulative, psychotic, the gentlemanly vilian, of cause as in all the books, hannibal isnt in fact the vilian (except perhaps in red dragon) its clear to see that harris' own understanding of hannibal changes with each book he writes and the character gets further and further developed until he becomes almost real. if you want to see the real hannibal, if you want to understand him or think you already do, please read this book. hannibal took my breath away, he couldnt have had a better ending for himself. if you watched the film &quot;hannibal&quot; and thought that was good, then read the book, its better, although i have to admit no one but anthony hopkins could have played dr lecters' part so well, and only jodie foster could have played clarice better. i think the fact harris chose to name the book &quot;hannibal&quot; rather than &quot;dr lecter&quot; or &quot;starling&quot; gives you a clue as to how harris wants to portray hannibal. he wants us to see the real hannibal - believe me he does that well enough, my view of dr lecter was completely altered. the final chapters were briliant, nothing like the end ofthe film, it was probably a bit too complex for the average cinema goer. read this book and youll love him as much as do."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Is it good? Well, yes, most of the time. Is it thrilling? Occasionally. Is it horrific? No, not at all. Where 'Red Dragon' left me looking over my shoulder after dark and 'Silence of the lambs' had my skin crawling, 'Hannibal' occasionally made me smile! The monster becomes human, and that's not a good thing to be happening to monsters. Sure, the book has it's gruesome moments. Lobotomizing one of your dinnerguests and frying &amp; consuming his frontal lobes while he is still at the table is particularly nasty. But it happens to a person you want it to happen to anyway, and that takes half the horror out of it. I haven't decided yet wether the ending is very clever or totally ridiculous. Decide for yourself, if you want to. The book is worth reading if you've got a spare weekend, but no more than that."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The first time I read Hannibal, I remember feeling a nebulous sense of shame (not to mention nausea). I just finished reading it again and am left with the sense that Harris is saying something about all of us who turned a monster into a cult figure/antihero and demanded more. In my least generous mood, I would venture to say he was either laughing at or furious with his readers: the whole book feels like a slap in the face. There are some interesting ideas, and some memorable moments, but there is a burlesque quality to so much of the book that doesn't ring true to the understated creepiness of Harris' earlier work. I am haunted in particular by the description of the crowds that go to see the exhibit of torture devices. Read Chapter 20 and ask yourself honestly: how bitter is the ring of the opening paragraph, and can you really believe that Harris is doing anything other than &quot;slapping the clammy flab of our submissive conciousness&quot;? I won't venture to guess whether Harris' intent was to amuse himself by creating a nasty parody, to shock us into seeing how decadent we've become, or none of the above (which would mean my reaction was solely due to a guilt complex). All I know is that the &quot;Atrocious Torture Devices&quot; epsiode has a startling weight to it - especially given the its relative unimportance to the plot - and its tone is bitter and acidic, yet with a ring of authenticity that much of the rest of the book lacks."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was recommended in &quot;On Writing&quot; by Stephen King - a book I highly reccommend.Thomas Harris, who produces a novel just once a decade, offers us now Hannibal. I read the other two...The Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs. Of the trilogy, Silence is the strongest. Hannibal is for open minds only, and the conclusion is very different than that of the movie. There is an entire sub plot involving Verger's lesbian sister that adds another demension to the story.Thomas Harris has a gift for bringing Lechter to life. This book is no exception. Clarice is further developed as well. Because of her roots in lower class America and her rise to the top, she appeals to many women, myself included. In fact, I can nearly see myself making the choice she makes in the conclusion. This book ties in heavily with the Silence book, and I recommend you read them in order if you are going to read this one at all.If you love Lechter as I love Lechter, read this book. He does so many more admirable things. You may also enjoy this book if you are a lover of fine literature and explosive prose. This book is edifying to the reader, offering rich insight to Italian culture and history, as well as human nature. However, if you want to read this book because of the movie, or because everyone is reading it, don't."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon, you meet Hannibal Lector behind bars, locked in an insane asylum. In Hannibal, you see Hannibal living in society according to his tastes and lifestyle. Harris gives you such an incredible in-depth look into Hannibal's psyche, including a look at a very frightening part of his childhood. The detail that Harris uses to describe Hannibal's mind, especially his extraodinary memory, is captivating. I had to reread that part twice because it was so unique.Harris' other characters receive equal attention, including Clarice Starling, one of Hannibal's objects of interest, and Mason Verger, one of Hannibal's victims and now out for revenge. Each character is equally unique and emphasize different personality traits.What stands out the most to me in this book is the ending. While I won't give it away, I will say that the ending is not what you would expect and certainly surprising.I think you'll find yourself glued to Hannibal's pages and its great plot. The book is a credit to Harris' ability to follow his own characters throughout their lives as if he (and the rest of us) are right there with them."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I loved &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;. I thought it was intriguing. I couldn't wait to read &quot;Hannibal&quot;. I found that &quot;Hannibal&quot; didn't rise to the standards set by &quot;Silence&quot;. The book started out well, with Dr. Lecter living in Italy as the curator of the Palazzo Capponi. Lecter is going by the name &quot;Dr. Fell&quot; and is certainly living it up. His rich sensibilities are perfectly in place in Italy. Seven years have passed since he escaped. When Clarice Starling ran into some trouble that got her name in the papers, Lecter sends her a letter. This starts her on a search for him again.A past victim of Lecter's, the only surviving one, by the name of Mason Verger, is also hunting for Dr. Lecter for his own sordid ends. Verger, a millionaire and a child-molester, is certainly the evil one in the book. What I didn't understand was his unhealthy fascination for having wild pigs eat off Lecter's feet. It was one of those things that made me scratch my head in wonder and say &quot;Okaaaay... sure.&quot;The main problem for me was the ending. Since I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone that hasn't read the book, I won't really go into details. I just thought that the ending was totally unbelievable. For an author that writes so well, I found this slide into implausibility ridiculous. I can honestly say I preferred the ending in the movie better. I certainly did *not* think the book was terrifying, since I was too busy wondering where an otherwise wonderful story went bad."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I devoured both Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs in a matter of days, but after reading this novel, I wish I had just stopped there.This book....this book is not like its predecessors. It is a work that could have been something much more than what it was. Red Dragon and Silence were both very well done, intelligent thrillers with solid plots. Here....the story seemed disjointed. Mason's pursuit of Hannibal takes up the main focus of the plot, but that seems secondary to the subplot between Clarice and Hannibal, which seems secondary to the inner workings of Hannibal's mind....in the end, we're left with a mess that resembles more of a big budget action film (all bang, no bite) than a serious thriller. I would have liked to seen more development with Hannibal. It was fascinating to see inside of his mind, from his memory palace to his memories of his beloved sister Mischa, and I wish Harris had given us more of this, as I felt it helped the reader better understand just what kind of monster Lecter was and how he had become that way.The ending, however, horrified me, but not in the way it was meant to. I was simply incensed at what Harris did with Starling. She was such a strong, powerful character in Silence of the Lambs, and to see her be turned into nothing more than Lecter's puppet....it angered me, and cheapened the character. Unforgiveable, in my opinion.I wouldn't recommend this book to any potential Harris fans. Stick with Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs--they are brilliant works in the genre, and much more satisfying than this latest offering."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The story is unbelievable, the characters predictable and the ending a terrible disappointment. If it were possible to rate this book with a minus then I would give it a minus 10 stars. Buyer beware! If you must read it wait until your local library has it in the 'FOR SALE: $1.00' bin."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm not going to blame Harris for my own expectations about what this sequel should be. After digesting this novel for almost a week, and with only slight cramps lingering, I now realize that this book was wonderful. I was really scared. It was creepy, surreal, a slow motion nightmare. I've had more than one bad dream about it. That's my criteria for a good horror novel. So calm down, get over it. Harris gave us better than we deserved - some originality. Glad I read it. It'll make a great movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I tought that after the critics review I would read a masterpiece but I was disapointed, the story is kind of ok but I was expecting a lot more, and that's the problem you dont get more..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading the first 100 pages, it dawned on me that this book is like reading a movie script. Thomas Harris knew before he wrote the book that it was going to be made into a movie, so why would he want to rewrite the book into a script?? I was lost in the Florence section, but thought it was an important piece. Silence of the Lambs was a much better story. I was extremely disappointed with the ending. This is one time where I hope the movie is better than the book!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Having read the first two installments in this series I was ready for another thrilling roller coaster ride. Sadly this installment only proves that Harris is either unclear or totally unaware of why his two previous efforts worked so well. The book opens with promise but soon spirals down into a ridiculous conclusion that makes you wonder if Harris even understands the very characters he has created. Don't bother."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was so disappointed!..I expected to love this book, this author's name like some of my other favorites is enough to sell me on a book, site unseen..Sadly, I wish I had my money back, and I have learned my lesson...A reader in Denver suggests this book was a parody, and if we did not get it, the joke was on us, well, I am not laughing, and I bought what I thought was a 'thriller', not a parody...I am not a happy consumer.."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Unlike many of the reviewers who have reviled the book, I enjoyed it. It was not engrossing or terrifying or anywhere near as good as &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot; The key here is to not compare it to either &quot;Silence&quot; or &quot;Red Dragon.&quot; The ending -- well, it certainly is not expected, although sadly predicted. It definitely is not of the caliber of Thomas Harris' two previous books."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris has taken Hannibal Lecter out of the pages and into the inner depths of your mind. You might not want him there, but you won't be able to resist. This is, without doubt, Harris' finest work to date, and is so well written you are genuinely entranced into reading further. The plot twists and turns, is beautifully developed, and allows you not a moment's breath as it plunges ever onwards towards it's dramatic, and spectacular, climax. If you only read one book this year, make it 'Hannibal'."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The Red Dragon thoroughly intrigued me and left me eager to read Silence of the Lambs. That was equally as good. I was therefore eagerly awaiting the advent of Hannibal and rushed to buy the hard copy. What a disappointment! All the characters disintegrated into ridiculous caricatures of their former selves. What was Thomas Harris attempting to do? Destroy himself along with his characters? He has, of course, set himself up to write another sequel. Who in the world would waste time and money reading it? How unfortunate that no one appeared to critique this book before it went to final publishing--perhaps with some major rewriting Harris would have been able to redeem himself!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I plowed through this book at a quick pace because I was so energized by the story. Clarice and Hannibal are finally back. The story starts with the energy of &quot;Speed&quot; (the Movie). It unfolds quickly with no laboring to build a plot.However, the ending I found horrible. So unbelievable and just not &quot;in character&quot; - I almost put it down without finishing it.If you LOVED Silence - then get it. The first 3/4's are well worth it. Otherwise, wait for the movie (where HOPEFULLY the Director will take some license with the ending)."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It took Thomas Harris this long to write a substandard sequel to &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;? The ending was so lame but then again it only was in keeping with the rest if the book. This really was an insult to the previous books"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book will disappoint those who are looking for a bit of violent titillation. The many atrocities are described with style and restraint with no attempt to linger in gore. I read the book three times in as many days and it improved immensely with acquaintance. The imagery of the writing is so astonishingly vivid that the forthcoming film will almost inevitably disappoint in comparison. My abiding memories of the book, however, are the many moments of lyrical writing. Harris has developed a style of writing that can communicate almost like music; poignancy has never been conveyed so softly. The memories of Mischa are exquisite, little tone poems to read over and over again. The ending is almost surreal but you can sense a Harris smile lurking behind the scenes; it's only a story, he seems to be saying. It is difficult to imagine a sequel, especially if we have to wait ten years for it. However, after spending so much effort in the last twenty years documenting the worst excesses of the human psyche, I would love to see him produce a book that could fill us with hope and warmth and a sense of humanity. He has the power; he has the readership. And the world of today needs it more than ever."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The book started well and it really gets you going through this enigmatic Dr. Hannibal Lecter. It seems to me that Mr. Harris stop drinking or smoking what was inspiring him until Part VI of the book, where I just didn't understand anything. Don't know what happened to him. Very conusing. A mix of Rose Color end for a book that was delivering a catastrophic and bloody final."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Pedestrian prose and a dumbed down Clarice Starling made this book a major disappointment to me, especially so at hardcover prices. &quot;The Red Dragon&quot; is still the scariest book I have ever read, but &quot;Hannibal&quot; is a real ho-hum. Don't waste your money; it'll be all over the used bookstore shelves in nothing flat."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Sorry but Mr. Harris really falls short here. Way too unbelievable to even be entertaining. I was especially dissapointed in Clarice Starling's part, or a lack of one. Hannibal deserved better but in being a fan of his it makes it a must read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"By the time I got a copy of Hannibal, I had heard so many negative and luke-warm reviews I almost skipped reading it. I'm glad I didn't - I raced through it and thought it was great. True, the ending surprised me, but it didn't really bother me, either. I kept thinking all the way through how hard it would be to end this novel in a fully satisfactory way. I'm still not sure he managed it, but I'm glad Harris did it his way and not with one of the endings I had imagined."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"We can finally begin to understand Hannibal Lecter. The characterization is good. Lacks dark, brooding, scariness of Silence of the Lambs. While ending is delightfully sick, it is also rather anti-climactic."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book because of the success of Silence of the Lambs. But I have to say, like many of the other reviewers, I too was disappointed. The names may have been the same, but these weren't the same characters that I was looking forward to reading about. And the ending, well what can you say about that except ridiculous. If you have nothing better to read, go for it. But this certaining isn't one to go out of your way for."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I felt this tale of the inner workings of Hannibal's mind was masterful. Further, as can be seen by the prior reviews, the ending was unexpected and controversial. I think it is to the author's credit that he chose to be wildly original by not giving the reader the ending they were expecting. I'm guessing everyone thought at some point during the book that starling would finally make a move and capture him. I thought it was very imaginative to have the change in attitude by starling about the world around her and line between hero and killer made even thinner. I would like to thank the author for this tremendous experience."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"kept me involved after a somewhat &quot;slow&quot; start... the narrative had some good twists from the predictable... left possibility for (another) sequel - although this may be questionable... Author has obviously done his research..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I can think of no greater disappointment than when one of the penultimate 'bad guys' of thrillers, Hannibal Lechter, ceases to be scary. In this sequel, we're meant to understand and empathize with Lechter because of his rotten childhood (puh-leeze! ) And Clarice is nothing more than a wimpy victim in this one. What happened to that heroic woman we loved in Silence of the Lambs? Oh, I wish that this one could be unwritten, so that my opinion of Hannibal, Clarice, and Thomas Harris could have remained intact!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Unlike &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Silence of The Lambs&quot;, in &quot;Hannibal&quot; Thomas Harris tries to give some rationalization to Hannibal Lecter's behavior and illuminates some of the doctor's background. Hannibal Lecter has to be one of the more fascinating characters in modern literature, and this novel cements it. Lecter is definitely a psychopath, but he is not necessarily a monster--his favorite victims seem to be men with their own sadistic/sociopathic tendencies, like Mason Verger, a victim of Lecter's whose hunt for the doctor is an integral part of the plot. Mason Verger is thoroughly despicable--we learn early on that he was a child rapist, one of his victims being his own sister. Harris obviously wants the reader to think that Lecter did the world a favor by paralyzing Verger (I won't mention what else the good doctor did). Inspector Pazzi, who discovers Lecter living in Florence and decides to turn him in for Mason Verger's massive reward, is also presented as a glory-hungry egomaniac who tries to regain his stature at all costs. FBI Deputy Director Paul Krenzler, with his harassment of Clarice Starling, cements a place on Lecter's list as well. This is Lecter's show, make no mistake--Clarice Starling, the focus of &quot;The Silence of The Lambs,&quot; is illuminated only by Lecter's interest in her. I would have liked to have read more about Lecter's background--the hints Harris drops are fascinating, and I wouldn't be surprised if his next book really goes into detail--but in the end even Harris' haunting, highly visual writing can't save a very predictable ending. This is definitely not a book for the squeamish (I made the mistake of reading the part about Hannibal's last victim while eating breakfast) but a lot of the language will stay with you, and you'll never look at pigs quite the same way again."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I guess the title of my review says it all. This is the worst book that I can recall reading. Harris apparently ran out of ideas but was under contract to produce, and this hunk of garbage is what he came up with. No wonder Jodie Foster turned down a chance to play Agent Starling in a sequel. I wish that I could just erase that book from my memory. It really was that bad!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'll be brief. This novel serves two purposes. It shows off Harris' extensive knowledge, and it will make him a large sum of money. Apart from these, the book is overwhelmingly disappointing. Clarice would never behave in the ways Harris has her behave. The characters do not ring true, and at times the plot sequences themselves are murky and almost impossible to follow. Stay with the first three Harris novels. This one's a failure."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"These characters would never behave the way they do at this book's end. Harris changes tense at a dizzying pace (even in mid-chapter) and clearly doesn't share the love of his characters that fans of his earlier works possess."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal was a let-down. Most of the story line was very difficult to follow and I expected much more. The parts of the book that took place in Italy were poorly written."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have not read the previous two Hannibal books but my sympathies go out to fans of the series, who have had to witness the carefully crafted characters of Starling and Lecter destroyed in the space of 30 pages by a completely ridiculous and unsatisfying ending. However, despite the ending it is still an entertaining read - one for the airport or journey to work."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Red Dragon was a good focus on serial killers and how they are caught. Silence of the Lambs was a shocking study of serial killers and of Hannibal Lecter, a minor character in Red Dragon, who now becomes a real force of prescence and introduces us to the dark side of the soul through Lecter's demented view of the world. Now, with &quot;Hannibal&quot;, we are allowed to actually step inside of Lecter's mind and discover that, horribly enough, we are him. He has the same (almost) ambitions as all of us, the same ideals. And yet he can be so ruthless. That is what makes him fascinating. We cheer for him despite his murders. We want him to get the woman and beat the bad guy even though he is ruthless and often malicious. We sympathize for what made him what he is. Some people gave this book poor reviews. I think their expectations were too high. If you want a good story, stand alone or sequal, sit down and read Hannibal. It is well worth it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is a hell of a book, and I don't mean that in a good way. It is Hell to get through, what with the constant switching between tenses, the sloppy writing (Harris reportedly refused to let an editor touch it), and the unbelievable actions of the characters. This was totally unfaithful to the character of Starling, especially.Please, please, Ms. Foster and Mr. Hopkins, make a sequel to the film, and disregard the novel completely. You could even use the novel's reported working title &quot;Morbidity of the Soul&quot;, which even sounds more like a film about the not-so-good doctor."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read the first two books of the Hannibal series and they were just amazing. I could not read them fast enough. And when I finally received Hannibal, I was excited to start it. But as I continued to read it took so long for the plot to build. The story line was not flowing. Mason's plan is not original. It is only towards the very end when the book finally picks up the pace and maintains the speed and suspense as Harris's previous novels.All in all, it is a very disappointing book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I, like every other reader who have read Mr. Harris' previous books, was waiting anxiously for the release of Hannibal. What a disappointment!!! I actually had to force myself to finish it. And the ending, what were you thinking Thomas!!! Did you really think that this ending was the only way to finish the book?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I had several problems with Hannibal. First, you absolutely had to have read SOTL to appreciate the characters. I dislike books that basically require you to have read an earlier novel (not an issue w/SOTL and Red Dragon). When this happens, I think the author gets lazy in character development: i.e Mason. His character was oversimplified: he didn't scare me that much, and we didn't learn enough about him. Lastly, I was blown away and very frustrated with the ending: was it drugs that changed Starling behavior, why would she possibly do it. I guess I don't understand enough about psychology."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"You need to let this one simmer in your mind after you've finished. Save your analysis for later, after it has digested a little.The book was everything and nothing that I expected it to be. I had to force myself to only consume 35 pages a sitting, so as to lengthen my reading pleasure. This one makes you stop and think for days afterward. My initial reaction to the ending was similar to those shared prior to these comments, but after taking a few days to churn it around in my mind, I realize what Harris was trying to accomplish at the conclusion. A true novel of horror to the very end. I know that this won't be the last time we are invited to dinner."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Not what I anticipated yet exactly what I needed. The disappointment for many is the insight into Dr. Lechter allows him to become more human and less monster. What the naysayers forget is the nurse who felt the same way at Baltimore State Hospital in SOTL -- and she lost her tongue.... The snake hasn't lost its bite or its venom, but is soothed by the momentary music. My only hope is it doesn't take eleven years to publish again. Continuing with this charachter or not, Mr. Harris is arguably the best in the business at thrillers."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"At first I was looking for the sequel to the screenplay of SOTL and was disappointed. Then as I got into this super novel I realized what a terrific, totally new work Harris has given us. If you want a great read this is it, if you want another SOTL you may be disappointed."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Kudos to Thomas Harris for not confining himself to writing a screenplay sequel. The complaints about this novel are largely unwarranted. The only one I have is about the very long interlude in Italy. It could have been shorter. I felt it was taking time away from the characters I was reading the book for in the first place; Hannibal &amp; Clarice. The ending was so out of left field that I found myself totally accepting every word of it. Afterall, if the reader is willing to accept the cannibalistic superman that is Hannibal Lecter, why not this? My only question is, where did Will Graham go? Ultimately though, an exceptional, quirky ending to a remarkable trilogy."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I can't say much more about the book that the others have not already said. The only thing I'd like to add is that I really enjoyed the first 3/4 of the story. During that portion I had intentions of going immediately to the bookstore to get &quot;Red Dragon&quot; after finishing this one. After learning the ending, I immediately went to the bookstore and bought a totally different book. I give three stars for the part I enjoyed. The last several chapters get ZERO stars."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book does for pork what Philip Roth's &quot;Sabbath's Theatre&quot; did for sex...makes the delicious seem unpalatable.And the ending?! It's as if Gloria Steinham appeared at a NOW rally squeezed into her old bunny suit.Can I have my mind hosed down please? I feel greasy."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Contrary to what others thought about the book, I thought it was great (apart from the ending!) Quite different from the first book. I cannot wait to see the movie!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"BEWARE: I DISCUSS THE ENDING OF THE BOOK IN THIS REVIEW!! T. Harris would do well to get another editor or listen better to the one he's got! He has done his research (food, music, wines, scents, mushrooms, art, etc.), writes very well, is very descriptive, has a good command of the English language, etc., but fails to satisfy this reader in the end. The dinner scene where Hannibal and Starling dine on the brains of a fellow dinner guest is ludicrous, and in 3-5 pages destroys the credibility of both Hannibal and Starling and guts the book's value (pun intended:)). The incredible push-pull attraction between Hannibal and Starling --in my humble opinion-- can never be consummated and be realistic or seductive to the reader. I'm willing to bet (name your price here) that the movie version of this book with completly eliminate this scene and Starling and Hannibal will never share the same bed. Nor should they. Harris seems to forget something very important: Hannibal is a serial killer and a cannibal. Did he really think that he made a plausible argument for the reader to believe that (1) Starling would eat human organs; (2) Sleep with Hannibal; and (3) Hannibal would somehow become a prince charming you could turn your back on? I think not."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I throughly enjoyed reading the most recent of Mr. Harris' writings. I had guessed at the ending and hoped I was wrong..... but wasn't. That is the reason for not a 5 star rating. I loved Red Dragon best of all."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read earlier reviews where the listeners were not happy with the narrating of this audio book. In fact they felt it was so bad that they had to buy the book to finish the story. I saw the movie &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; before I read the book. I now have the voices of Jody Foster and Sir Anthony Hopkins inbedded in my mind as Clarice and Hannibal. For me the narrator of the unabridged version of &quot;Hannibal&quot; was wonderful. When he read Clarice, I could see and hear Clarice. When he read Hannibal, I could see and hear Hannibal. In fact, he was so articulate with the different charactures that I knew immediately who they were. Once introduced to the story, the narrator did not have to use their names again. The narrator brought the story of &quot;Hannibal&quot; to life. I found myself visualizing every detail of each &quot;scene&quot;. His reading of this book put my own reading to shame. This book is the best in the Hannibal Lector series. I recommend it to all. I'm sold on audio books."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It seems apparent that Mr. Harris was counting on the success of the first two books to help him here. There is a very weak plot, poor character development and a really poor, weak ending. My only hope is that they do not make this dull book into an even duller movie. Anthony Hopkins beware!!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I really enjoyed Harris' three previous books, but what a disappointment this was. No substance but plenty of gore, in fact it seemed to me that Harris was seeing how gross he could get. No supsense, no mystery, just &quot;can you top this for disgusting...&quot; excess. Sadly, too, not a single character with any redeeming qualities. I finally gave up half way through. I asked my husband how it ended and was glad to put it away."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The story had me at first and then it lost me quickly. Too much detail about the Italian Art history. Too much Italian to interpret. The ending was absolutely ludicrous!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"(in italiano) Chi legge Hannibal pensando che sia come Red Dragon e Silence of the lambs rimarr&agrave; deluso. Mentre negli altri due libri la parte dedicata al detective e quella dedicata al killer si equivalevano, questo libro &egrave; molto pi&ugrave; sbilanciato nell'analisi del caso clinico Hannibal Lecter. Il mistero qui non &egrave;: verr&agrave; preso l'assassino, ma: cosa succeder&agrave; tra il detective e la sua preda. Non c'&egrave; la tensione tra il cattivo e il suo cacciatore, che &egrave; lo schema classico, perch&egrave; preda e cacciatore hanno una relazione inquietante, un po' dostojeski a rovescio. E il cattivo &egrave; un terzo, Mason Verger, che fa un po' qui la parte del Gumb nel Silence. Hannibal &egrave; un vero romanzo pulp, pieno di orrori, ma anche di grande raffinatezza e tensione, avvincente ed eccessivo, un viaggio dantesco nell'inferno della psiche umana. La conclusione &egrave; il vero problema. Ho fatto molta fatica ad accettarla, e mi ha lasciato un senso di incompiutezza."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I almost didn't read the book after seeing all the negative reviews. What a mistake! I read it in one sitting and enjoyed it immensely. The first part of the book is routine and comfortable, introducing the players including a great new paralyzed and disfigured villain called Verger who was Dr. Lecter's sixth victim. His quest for revenge on Lecter, with his clever resources, dominates the book.Another question is always hanging out there - Does Lector want to xxx her, kill her, or eat her (Starling). Verger hunts Lecter, Lecter stalks Starling, Starling hunts Lecter. Enough tension for everyone!The ending is a great psychological suspense tale. If you loved Silence of the Lambs you'll want to read this - for better or worse.But don't get fixated with Jonathan Demme's image of Starling (Jodie Foster)in Silence of the Lambs. Remember Harris wrote these books, not Demme."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I almost didn't buy this book because of some bad reviews I had read, but I am glad I did. If you can get past the gore, it gives an insight into the reason Hannibal is insane. Most people would be if they had lived through the trama he did. And, if you think about it, he took nifty revenge on some people who really deserved it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was astounded that Thomas Harris could outdo himself in a sequel to a book as kinky and fascinating as Silence of the Lambs. But here is the proof. Those who have blasted it can't even spell correctly. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I love to read but I found myself skimming throughout the whole book. It was so contrived and implausible. What a disappointment. Thank God I got it out of the library and didn't waste my money. Just my time."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I found this book to be great up until the ending. I do have to give Harris credit for his creative and twisted ending. When I first put the book down I felt great disapointment but now that some time has passed I am beginninmg to agree more so with the ending that he choose.After reading some of the previous reviews on this site here are my comments:Harris is a great writer people and there is no need to criticize his work so harshly. I think that he composed a wonderful sequal although it could have been better.Worth reading for sure"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I bought this because I am a huge fan of SOTL and Thomas Harris. I can't decide if it is Anthony Hopkins or Dr. L. who fascinates me so much. No matter...I found the book nearly impossible to put down. Very rarely am I actually emotionally shaken by a book. I was OK until the final chapters, then....WHEW!! Many people will be disappointed in the ending...but no one could ever admit to foreseeing how it would turn out. Too many novels are predictable...this one most definitely is not.. The sheer evil of the characters is so frightening, it makes one wonder if the world indeed has people like that in it. And what is so scary is knowing that it most likely does. Part of me can't wait for the movie... even though I don't see how the screenplay could ever be true to the book without an NC-17 rating at best. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Insatiable reading... from beginning to end Harris disrupts our sense of good and evil and throws the equilibrium of reality into disarray. That there exists a evil greater than Lechter, that Lechter's evil transforms into a twisted heroics and that Starling comes to embrace that which she has dedicated herself to terminate - this is Harris delivering the reader beyond the bounds of formulaic prose. The reader savors the words, the journey through the palace of the mind, as Lechter savors a white truffle - rich deep and amazingly complex. This is remarkable storytelling."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I experienced &quot;Hannibal&quot; via abridged audiobook, and I can hardly wait to read the whole thing. While not as engaging as SOTL, this book is great, and I enjoyed it immensely."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Like the other Harris fans, I have been anxiously awaiting this story for years. Like the other fans, I wanted to love it. I expected to love it. But, loath as I am to admit it, I do not love it. The characters I met in this new novel are not the ones I knew from the previous ones. They are strangers. Their behavior does not follow from what we know of them. The book seems to have been hastily thrown together, which is strange considering the length of time since Silence. Typos suggest it wasn't even proofread with much care. Whatever the case, I will always remain in awe of Harris for The Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Lesbian bodybuilders! Faceless meatpacking heirs! Italian porn directors!Against this cast of supporting characters, even Hannibal Lecter can seem a little pedestrian. However, in spite of the fact that his, shall we say, appetites, are rationalized and his latent menace diminished by his daily contact with humanity, the emminent Doctor still remains a presence that exists outside of humanity.The novel screams to be made into a movie. The imagery that cuts through the novel, from the constant oscilations of a swimming eel, to an elaborate moviemaking apparatus involving a large roccoco mirror, to the bizzare life support mechanism of a central character (including a monacle designer, a la Clockwork Orange, to continually moisten a lidless eye) screams to be interpreted on the screen. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing...Were I to give away the ending, it would be a great disservice. Were I to summarize it, it would make no sense. However, when taken as result of two novel's worth of cumulative momentum, it achieves a kind of sickening result that doesn't even stem from the gore that puctuates the rest of the book. A kind of pshcyoanalytic shudder..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris pretty much throws you in the action of catching an enigmatic killer by a sick &amp; demented victim, and spits you out by the ending. Part of me thinks that it was Harris' intention of totally disturbing the reader with its totally gothic &amp; unpredicatable ending, and the other half may be just to let the reader realize that the whole &quot;Hannibal Lecter&quot; hype is no more than a big joke. Harris may have taken too much hallucinatory mushrooms by the time he wrote the conclusion.I really wanted to like this book since it was quite expensive (even if it was 50% off). What a waste. I couldn't even admit to my girlfriend how much I thought the novel wasted my time not to mention my enthusiasm."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After finishing \\"Hannibal,\\" I was struck by a desire to find Thomas Harris and demand a refund. The ending of the book was easily the most disappointing, annoying, and baffling I've ever read. Was Harris trying to drive away loyal readers? Perhaps he'd been so pestered over the last 11 years to write the sequel, that he decided to get his revenge by concocting such an amazingly bad ending? I don't know. Maybe he grew tired of the book or simply wrote himself into a corner. Was it a weak effort at black humor? Who knows. In any event, it was a sad end to an otherwise highly engrossing book in particular, and trilogy in general."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It seems most readers are disappointed that this novel doesn't follow the standard horror formula. One reviewer complains that Starling and Lecter make a &quot;360 degree turn&quot; from Silence of the Lambs. Do the math! Don't come looking for a rote good-defeats-evil horror novel. Harris shows us that Lecter and Starling are multi-dimensional characters and not always what we'd expect.Unfortunately, while Harris is willing to probe depths and dimensions of Lecter and Starling he does not extend this courtesy to Mason and Krendler, who are pretty much cookie cutter bad guys. Here Harris follows the Hollywood formula of dehumanizing his villains so the reader looks forward to their demise.An engaging read with a refreshing twist at the end. Harris intends to disturb his reader and succeeds."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The beginning of the book started well and continued well, however, the ending left me very disappointed. It was not a believable way the main character would have ended up. I got the feeling the author wanted to hurry up and finish the book to meet a deadline."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As a fan of both Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, I must say I was disappointed by Hannibal. It was an interesting, compelling read that, had I not already developed a relationship with the characters, would have stood well on its own.Unfortunately, Harris took several plot paths that drove me crazy. Much like many prison films from the '70s attempted to make the viewer feel compassion for murderers and rapists by showing these characters in situations where they are mistreated by the guards, (They're murderers for goodness sake! big deal if the guards don't let them watch HBO!!!!) Lecter is being persued by individuals who are arguably as dispicable as himself, causing the reader to feel empathy for the monster who deserves none.Harris also used the tact that I have found to be a favorite of John Grisham. If enough money is involved, even the most rightous person would murder. I don't buy it.I HATE what he did to Starling. He took a strong willed, heroine and reduced her to a pathetic Patty Hearst character who develops a relationship with the devil simply because he &quot;understands&quot; her.The book was not terrible by any means. It was an entertaining page turner that I could hardly put down....Until the final chapter where I was tempted to throw it!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I don't understand all the one star reviews of this book. Even if one dislikes the plot, a one star rating is ludicrous -- Thomas Harris is a poet, a deranged poet, but a poet nevertheless. For me, this is the Book of the Year."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I've been a big fan of Thomas Harris' novels, going all the way back to Black Sunday. I loved both Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs, and I've reread both of them. Silence, in particular, is a pretty tough act to follow. As far as Hannibal is concerned, I agree with a number of my fellow readers about the quality of the writing, which for the most part is excellent. And, as with Silence, it is obvious that Harris has done plenty of research about the places and the objects he puts in his story. The book jumps around quite a bit, but there's some terrific character development (in particular, we really get a strong sense of the origins of Lecter's impulses). I was disappointed though to see Jack Crawford's character rendered virtually sterile in this story. And even Clarice, who was so strong and intuitive in Silence, seems a bit more vulnerable (and even naive) than one would expect. I found the last couple of chapters more irritating than anything else, not because of the &quot;gross-out factor&quot;, but more because of the complete departure from reality. One of the best aspects of Silence was its believability; in Hannibal, Harris takes the small strain of believability that exists in the early parts of the book and throws it right out the window. I think it'll be tough to do a movie out of this without completely rewriting the last quarter of the book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In high school I was taught that fiction (novels, movies, etc.) is the sum of three elements: Story, Setting and Characters. It's as simple a scheme as you can get, but when it comes to judging a book, it works. Judged by these conventional parameters, Hannibal is unsatisfying. The story, unlikely and sometimes boring, adds nothing to what was told in The Silence of the Lambs, it lacks the thrill of the search, the investigation job is almost always behind the scenes, the action is always so unnaturally conceived that makes me wonder why it was there and to what purpose. The setting, since I'm Italian, was another disappointment. I hope Mr Harris didn't do a lot of research, because he would have learned the same things about Italy just by listening to the old cheap jokes. His Florence is so laughable and unlikely, his portrait of the cultural institutions so amateurish and uninformed, his knowledge of Italian society so poor that makes me think he was speaking of another country. As for the US part, I can't tell, the usual interjurisdictional stuff, lots of let-me-tell-you-something lines and he was done. The characters: Starling is a She-Rambo waiting for Mr. Right, unfit for both these roles, like the ones I've seen in too many movies and, not too miss a common place, Harris even puts her behind the wheel of an All-American muscle car. In a word, Jennifer Beals in Flashdance, the glamourous steel mill working girl was real life, in comparison. Pazzi, the Italian investigator, looks Italian only when he's riding a moped. Hannibal is less frightening than his worn-out dandy tastes and it's unbelievable how he manages not to get caught, given his ability to get noticed. As for the others, they're just ill-conceived macguffins to bring Hannibal back to his homeland."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Like a long-anticipated meal, Hannibal is bound to disappoint, if only a little. The sequel to the amazing Silence of the Lambs feels and reads as if it has been worked over again and again, a little too much salt here, too much pepper added to take away the bite of the salt, too much sugar to balance the spice. There is a lack of balance in this book that is worrisome. The reader is troubled by frequent tense changes, from present to past, especially at the beginning of chapters. Only too late do you realize that what you are &quot;hearing&quot; is, possibly, Lecter's own personal narrative as he strolls through the memory palace in his head, wandering from room to room to savor experiences long past. There are moments of brilliance here, such as a delightful scene on an airplane in which Lecter, a monster sought on several continents, is irritated by a small boy who wants to share the doctor's lunch. The opening scene, a botched raid on a drug factory, reintroduces Clarice Starling in stark, brilliant, cutting light, and she never shines as brightly again. There are things amiss in this novel, as one might find in a fruit de mer royale left only hours too long out of the sea, or medallions of veal francaise made with RealLemon and Parkay. Many central characters are neglected almost to the point of becoming comic book caricatures. This is especially true of the primary antagonists, Mason Verger and his anabolically enhanced sibling Margot. When all is said and done, we know little or nothing about these scoundrels, except that they were, somehow, a little evil and vindictive. So, what's to like? Why give this long-awaited story four stars? There is something deeply disturbing in the last ten chapters, which make up a macabre, scintillatingly frightening short story inside the novel. It is at this point, when you believe that all the action is completed and the story is drawing to a close, that Hannibal shows its true colors. Like a dessert of fresh fruit in jasmine syrup, these last chapters wash the palate of all the shortcomings of the previous courses of this meal. This is not a dessert to be ingested just before bed, however, as it may return on you in the night. Do yourself a favor. Read for the poetry rather than the plot, until you think the plot is finished. From that point on, Hannibal is a thorougly satisfying, incredibly disturbing look at genuine psychopathy and malevolence in action. You may discount the first seven-eighths of this novel, but you will return again and again to smack your lips over its ending. Can't wait for the movie."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"One can rationalize for several squarely typed inches here but nothing can excuse the cruelties, large and small which permeate these pages. Harris has run out of places to go and the only suspense left is whether one monster will have the chance to wreak revenge on another monster. Who cares and why should we? With a large Italian section which is utterly predictable (the only question being what gruesome way some will die) and an ending which tries to be poetic and winds up unbelievable and foolish. A waste of time and a precipitous drop from his earlier work."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Just as Mario Puzo, the genius who gave us the Godfather also produced the Last Don and Michael Crichton followed Jurassic Park with Lost World, Thomas Harris has taken what was a stellar record and added a severe blemish. Dislikable characters, implausible plot turn after implausible plot turn and absurd ending and you have a real dud.JODI and ANTHONY if you are reading this, take my advice, do not agree to make this movie, do not give this a second life, let it die or get someone else to play the parts.This book needs to be priced more than 50% off for you to get your money's worth."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Throughout much of the book I was wondering where Harris was going with the characters and the storyline. And like a true suspense thriller I was hooked until the very last page.Occasionally the writing style would change in a manner that was a bit confusing. It seemed that pieces were left out, when really Harris was bringing us truly into Hannibal's intricate mind, where trivialities matter not as much as results.Hannibal, nor Starling let the trivialities in life get to them. They are calm through and through. I admire these qualities and came to admire the characters. Harris brought them to life for me. Sometimes I fancy that they really are alive.To quote Poe, [Hannibal] &quot;thrilled me -- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before&quot;. Also it made me giggle with delight. It was exquisite! How I would like to talk to Mr. Harris about this book as I think much of Hannibal Lecter is really part of himself (though I doubt Harris is such a monster). Harris must be a man of distinguished taste and class, as well as humor.Bravo!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In this novel, Harris further expands on the events that happen after the escape of his horrifyingly realistic character, Hannibal Lecter. We are allowed a tiny glimpse into the hallways of Lecter's mind, and what one finds there can only be described as the remenants of one with great potential that was diseased and corrupted by a childhood trauma. I recommend that anyone with an interest in the psyche of a brilliant madman, imbibe this novel as well as its prequels The Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The brilliance of The Silence of the Lambs was the mental connection between the two main characters - the &quot;quid pro quo&quot;. Unfortunately, Harris has written a storyline that keeps Hannibal and Starling apart until the very last scenes."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"&quot;Hannibal&quot; was an experience I found to be everybit as delightful as was it revolting.Granted, there were plot continuity gaps and flagging pacing throughout, however there imperfections served to compell me all the more.The novel's ending seems to have become a consistant source of literary debate, and divided down the center between the camps of those whom found it unutterably mind blowing (as did I), and others whom, from my perspective, appear as if they were perhaps expecting something from a Steven King best seller.I give this end of a fine trilogy my highest esteem!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal was NOT up to par with Harris's other terrific books. It took me 3 painful months to finish it. If you have not read Red Dragon--it is one of the most powerful psychological profiles of a serial killer. Don't bother with Hannibal."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"For readers seeking a formulaic sequel to SILENCE... this tome might disapoint, but for those who take this effort on it's own merits, HANNIBAL is an extremely well written ride with a shocker of an ending. I found the introduction of characters even more disturbing than Dr. Lecter a provocative move, and think the background on Lecter is a fascinating piece of characterization. Mr. Harris also continues to show strong female relationships in Clarice and Ardelia, and Margot is as formidable a presence as any male. Kudos to Mr. Harris for not bending to public expectation for the sake of popularity, and for producing a truly mind shaking work of fiction. What will he do for an encore?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What a shame that Harris wasted the terrific characters he introduced in Silence (and Dragon) and dragged us through what I'd call one man's love affair with Italy. Sadly enough, the only time I detected some excitement in Harris' writing was when he described the buildings and streets of Florence, Italy. Otherwise he threw Clarice Starling and Hannibal to the pigs (literally). By the time the finale rolled around, the only thing I was interested in finding out was what wine the doctor was serving with dinner! (Note to author: You and Patricia Cornwell need to get together some time and talk about Italy. She can wax ecstatic over its cuisine and you can ramble on about its architecture and history. That way you can get it out of your system and your readers won't have to suffer through pages of the stuff waiting to find out what became of the main characters.)"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris has once again brought the intriguing character of Dr. Hannible Lecter back into our lives. Throughout his books the reader wonders &quot;Why would someone do what he does? What happened that made him the monster that he is?&quot; Our questions are finally answered, and in a way that almost leaves us feeling sorry for him. The book had me turning page after page; Never expecting the story that unfolded with each paragraph. This book is a great read for people who use their imagination to see what happens as they read. I can't wait for them movie to come out. I want to see if the director and actors will act it out as I saw it at 2:30 A.M."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have been a faithful reader of Mr. Harris until now, I will no longer assume he will write at a level of quality, as he has in the past."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"An excellent sequel to Silence of the Lambs. It continues from where Silence leaves off. I loved the was Harris has dug deeper into the psychy of both Clare and Hannibal. I couldn't put the book down and was at the edge of seat waiting for the finale! I recommended it to a friend who loves psychological thrillers and he loved the book also!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This long awaited sequel did not erase the image of Anthony Hopkins as the supergenius, phychologist, cannibalistic serial killer.The suductive madness of this charcter is unforgetable.I was gripped,frustrated,and ultimately surprised by the events following the silence......of the lambs.The book had one more effect on me, one that distubs me a little... It left me hungry....."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"As a lover of these gory dramas, I couldn't wait to get my hands of Hannibal. Once I started, I couldn't put it down. I look for a total suspension of reality in my world (I'm retired with an unrelenting heart problem.) and for one brief moment I believed. Bring on more, Mr.Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I cannot comprehend all the negative, put-down reviews I've read of this book. It shines and scintillates like the finest jewel! The suspense never falters and Thomas Harris has brought off a true piece de resistance. From the opening bloody and mismanaged shootout to the final chapter (and what a finale!) I was glued to my seat and the pages. I sat up till 3 am to finish this, and I don't often do that anymore. I prefer to davour good books and discover the gems slowly. But I defy any TRUE lover of suspense and/or horror to put this down before it's finished. I'm not going to give away any mopre of the plot/storyline - most of it's been blown by the other reviewers anyway - buy it yourself and enjoy. Definitely excellent - I'd give it 6 stars out of 5 if the system would let me.HOWEVER - I do have one beef with Mr Harris, though; where's the FIRST Hannibal Lecter book - the one where Will Graham catches him because of the &quot;whimsey&quot; with the wound man killing/execution? I want to read it. I'm waiting, Mr Harris."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It seems most readers of Harris' latest are either irated and feel cheated or are ecstatic. I don't feel either way, but rather surprised. The novel feels like a radical departure from the previous Dr.Lecter saga offerings. This is a plain horror novel, written as a &quot;literary screenplay&quot;, with the over-tones and the graphic sensibility of a comic book. That said, except for some elements in the too long ending, it works for me. I'm tempted to believe that Mr.Harris' point was to portray a society that is much more monstruous than Dr.Lecter himself, to do so in a bitter, black-comedy fashion that lambasts all he sees as putrid and repulsive in our little world with the license only a best-selling author with a 11 year waiting fan base can. No publisher would have put out this book unless this was a new Harris. No one. No editor would have let the prose, the characters, the toneof this escape. The fact that it did escape the system is a good thing. Maybe it is flawed, over the top... but it is, I feel, sincere, smart and says all those things about us we don't want too hear, not from Dr.Lecter or from Dr.Harris. Reading &quot;Hannibal&quot;, beyond the horror house ride, is peering into the fact that maybe WE are the monsters, and if ever was a message that gets the messager killed, that's it. Read it at your own risk. I think it is worth the time and effort..."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book couldn't get published if it had been written by anyone but Thomas Harris. It's truly awful. The first four-fifths or so of the book read like a sloppy, overheated police &quot;thriller&quot; -- dozens of which line the shelves of every airport bookstand. The final fifth of the book is bizarre. Imagine a couple of college freshman getting stoned and then trying to write a gothic romance, and you'll have some idea of just how bad the ending of this book is."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I do not understand why people think Hannibal could follow the same path. I think Harris did an excellent job of taking the characters in a new direction. I could not put the book down as the ending was VERY unpredictable! We would have been bored with another &quot;Lambs&quot; this shows a lot of creativity to include another character almost as gruesome. Great read!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Absolutely wonderful. Deep - thought provoking- different - the best"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"One star because I can't give a zero (or negative) rating. I cannot express my disappointment in strong enough terms. There's no character here worth caring about, the writing is poor, the ending is ridiculous. And the grammatical errors were very distracting. Are we sure this wasn't a book created by a room full of monkeys banging away on typewriters all day?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is a book you can absolutely put down. In fact if you do put it down I'd respect you more. Why is America and the rest of the world getting so excited about a book about a serial killer? Is there nothing else we can get ourselves worked up over? Do the world a favor and buy any other book but this one."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After reading Red Dragon, I developed a grudging respect for Hannibal Lecter. Silence of the Lambs further heightened Lecter's wicked genius, and I again found myself respecting the monster. In these two works, Thomas Harris created a contemporary Moriarty and gave him more dimension than Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ever gave the original.Now we come to Hannibal. In Hannibal, Thomas Harris pulls out all the stops and reveals Hannibal Lecter in all his gory. He explains Hannibal, which is a difficult job, but Harris pulls it off fairly well. Explanations lead to understanding. Understanding leads to compassion. Understanding does not lead to acceptance, however. Yet, it seems that Harris wants us to accept and perhaps even venerate Hannibal Lecter--never mind that Lecter's a serial killer who slices and dices and spices his victims.Personally, I find the idea of a serial killer hero quite interesting. What's so bad about killing off a few people now and then? What's so bad about manipulating the inferior minds of weak intellects and bending them to your own? And maybe those who have unlimited wealth and exquisite taste should be free to do as they please with the rumpled and ruffled lives of the proletariat.Maybe not.I think fans of Silence of the Lambs will be very disappointed in this book. I enjoyed reading it. I found it fascinating to get a glimpse of the mindstyles of the warped and infamous, but I think many readers will be troubled by Harris' choice of hero. I can't speak for serial killers, though. They might find it a good read.One last thought... I wonder what Thomas Harris does during all those years between books?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I really enjoyed this book, for many of the reasons others did not. I think Thomas Harris did exactly what he wanted to do, mainly write the continuation of Silence. I must say I was shocked at the ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris is Lecter and we readers are the pigs devouring this book. I can only assume Mason Verger is the mangled myopic publisher who feeds Harris to the readers. What a clever little inside joke played on the victims who bought this book!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Boy, it's been a long time since I actually sat agape as I read a book. I got up in the middle of the night to finish it! I like how Harris made the character's lives take a big change from what would be expected by the end of &quot;Lambs&quot;. I'm glad he didn't just go with a formulaic re-hash of a book he's already written. Don't get me wrong, &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; is a masterpiece. Harris is one smart cookie for realizing that and not trying to repeat it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I eagerly anticipated reading this book after reading his brilliant Silence of the Lambs. In Lambs he very cleverly and completely developed Clarice Starling's character. In Hannibal, he made her a two dimensional character easily duped by Lecter. I felt the ending was as terrible an ending I could have imagined. I think Harris is in love with the character he created and this clouded his normally excellent writing and plot flow. The book began very well but after Starling's career was halted by Krendler, thereafter book seemed to have been written by another author. It is weak and uninspiring.If you loved Lambs, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Anyone who has read previous books by Thomas Harris has to read this thriller.. It beats all his others but maintains the same characters in this story so he has you saying oh so that's so and so from the other book. Blends beautifully from Silence of the Lambs. I highly recommend this book to lovers of mystery and suspense.. I enjoyed it. The ending was a real surprise!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm not sure I understand why so many people disliked this book, except that many seem to want Hollywood-type endings. However, those type of endings are near the bottom of the quality scale. It scares me somewhat that most reviewers didn't like the book because of the way it ended. Personally, I think they need to broaden their horizons a little bit, get out more, see the world.....There's not much to dislike about 'Hannibal', except for the fact that it will be difficult to turn it into a film (because of the ending). The writing was crisp, to the point, and the characters engaging. Unlike the first two novels in the series, which were about the hunts for serial killers, this one is about Hannibal Lector and Starling - period. Which is refreshing - why do yet another serial killer novel, a genre that's been done to death?Found it difficult to put down. The finale is - different - but fitting and gutsy. A good finish (sad to say) to the saga. There's nothing to stop Harris from bringing Hannibal Lector back, of course, but that would probably be a mistake."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Very few books capture your imagination and attention the way Harris does in Hannibal. I found Hannibal the best of the three Lecter works--hands down! The best fiction I have read...period."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely, especially the detailed descriptions and background that Harris incorporates into the story. Those who dislike this book are too dependent on the film version of Silence of the Lambs and have only a narrow vision of Harris' work. The depiction of Lecter especially in this book was much more favorable than I remember from Harris' previous works, and it was convincing enough that I found myself hoping for the slightly predictable ending. The true villain got his just desserts(pun definitely intended), and the antihero pair got theirs."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thought this book was a bit of sham. It seemed that Harris couldn't decide whether Lecter was just a poor misunderstood elitist/genious or the devil. Mason Verger was properly portrayed as the real monster, but I just can't get a firm picture of his she-hulk sister. Overall, a major disappointment."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thought this book was going to be a work of art, really, until I got to the &quot;Florence&quot; section then realized later that the &quot;Florence&quot; section meant ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to the denoument of the story!A breakthrough beginning for Clarice, Harris makes you see that she is tough and strong-willed... which makes the end remarkably odd, in my opinion. It was almost as if Harris was put under a deadline and came up with a quick and ill-advised ending to an unusually planned out story.After you have read the last page, you find yourself wondering &quot;was this supposed to have been good vs. evil?&quot; Who is the antagonist? Who is the protagonist? And I am wondering if Thomas Harris really meant for the reader to see it that way."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I found Hannibal's new life somewhat interesting, but not at all what I expected. I truly expected a few more snacks along the way. Mason Verger's character? Too horrifying and unbelievable. Why would anyone serve him in the way they did? He'd be nothing to bump off. But then, the book would be a few hundred pages short.But I was most upset with was what happened to Clarice Starlings character at the end. What was the author thinking? To shock us? Disgust us? This is one book where the movie HAS to be better. But why take the chance, skip them both."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was so disappointed by this book. I was thrilled to hear that their would be another chapter in the Silence of the Lambs and didn't hesitate to buy it. I can't believe that Thomas Harris write this - he really let a lot of people down. Do yourself a favor and stick to the originals."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was a huge disappointment, and not even close to Harris's previous books. &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; were both excellent - this thing is just absolutely terrible. I think Harris has fallen in love with his Lector character, who is a cannibal and a murderer, and can't bear to give him up to his just desserts. The way this book ends is disappointing and so awful and unbelievable that it made the rest of the story seem like nothing but a set-up. Frankly, I hated the thing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It wasn't until the last 8 pages of the book that I realized what Thomas Harris was actually writing about: The corruption of all by greed, and the loss of God and any societal relevance in the process.No major character (and practically no one at all) escapes the influences brought about by greed, mostly by money. None exhibit the usual concerns about society that are learned through religious and cultural exposure. Was this Harris' point? I was disturbed by the utter lack of social conscience, with all 10 or 20 major characters - even Starling - driven by the prospect of personal gain and personal gain only.The ending was unexpected. There are also holes in the details. All in all, however, the book is a worthwhile and easy read, with much of the real gore left to the imagination. It could have been much worse."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"...disappointing in every way. Flat, unbelievable characters; ridiculous situations; hare-brained schemes. Harris's (former) genius was that he could take the unimaginable and make us picture it. But not this time. I rolled my eyes too many times.The openng sequence read like a novelization of a bad movie, as if Harris had merely watched some Joe Bob Briggs fave and faithfully transcribed it--without adding any insight into characterization or motivation, or even the attention to revealing detail that made RD and SOTL horrific and yet believable.I'll no longer have nightmares about Dr. Lecter coming to eat me, because I no longer believe in him. And that's a darn shame."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"well i had great expectations after the first 2 books in this trilogy and although hannibal is a good book,it is not a great one. i found a lot of characters and situations in the book were alien to the previous works. oh yeah and the title stinks of hollywood,what was wrong with harris's working title&quot; the morbidity of the soul?&quot; saying all this though i still read it in a day"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Not much to add to the numerous reviews already in (it's got to be a record}. I thought Harris was quite daring in this sequel and I commend him for the fine effort. The ending sequence to this novel was quite unusual, but hey, Hannibal's quite an unusual character! Loved your book Mr. Harris!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"After seeing the great number of (quite puzzling to me) negative reader reviews, all I can think to do is to remind you: don't be rude!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Hannibal is the third and presumably final title in the trilogy which began with Red Dragon and continued with The Silence of the Lambs. In it, the homicidal genius Dr. Lecter has made his home in Florence, using his gracious charm to establish himself in the community. Back in D.C., Clarice Starling is fending off a barrage of unwanted media attention after a bungled drugs operation in which five people died, when she receives a letter on familiar stationery, in a familiar hand. This unleashes the power of Mason Verger, Lecter's only surviving victim, a skinless monstrosity with a pen of man-eating swine, whose only desire is to see Lecter eaten alive. These are the players: the scene is set. But Thomas Harris has, unfortunately, let this book down somewhat. Starling gets only cursory notice in this volume, and Jack Crawford, her &quot;safe&quot; mentor and Will Graham's colleague, is absently disposed of halfway through, for no apparent reason other than his impending retirement. Characters from Silence are dredged up and take fairly minimal roles, seemingly superfluous to the main plot. Mason Verger somehow seems to have switched roles with a James Bond villan, and there is a bungling Italian police officer in his employ who is an obvious candiate for Lecter's dinner table. In fact, Hannibal Lecter's superb performance is the only thing that keeps the whole book together, and you find yourself rooting for him because no one else seems worth the trouble. Then you come to the end, where the narrative lapses into a thoroughly odd description of Starling's own descent into cultured madness. Hannibal is a book worth reading, especially if you like Hannibal Lecter, but unfortunately it lets itself down with the rather weak and unsupported end. Enjoy the beginning and middle, but skim over the ending and just read the last chapter."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I had to read the end three times before I believed what I was reading! I could not believe what Thomas Harris had in store for Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling and yet it was a strangely satisfying ending. I welcomed back characters from The Silence of the Lambs and of course, imagined them as they were protrayed in the movie. Doctor Lecter is a character written by a person who must share some of his characters' darker thoughts and visions, or perhaps it was me who shares them. I could visualize some of the action as sequences and scenes in a movie (the sequel) which was the only slight disappointment I had in the book. A very good book, and in keeping with history, I look forward to the year 2010 for the next Harris book, even if it does not contain Lecter or Starling."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris has done his homework, especially in the area of Italian history and art. These help make the book more than a simple scary story. Those parts, however, were a bit cumbersome for me because I read the book aloud to a friend and fumbled with Italian pronunciation. But the book is both smart and entertaining. I'm still wondering about the significance of some events and items. I'm a Harris fan, and I wonder how this tome can work in a movie unless Hopkins, Foster, and Scott are cast."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is way above any other thriller on the market, for one simple reason: it dares to break out of the sterotypes that have ruined the genre. There is no formula here: everything is unpredictable. Hannibal Lecter's transformation into an antihero is the logical follow up to Silence of the Lambs. The people who have trashed this novel all suffer from the Disney &quot;Bad Guys Should be 100% Evil&quot; mentality.There's a little Hannibal in all of us; that is the point of the book.And the ending is perfectly appropriate, and easily filmable."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris is a &quot;One-trick pony&quot;. Harris wrote the same book twice, in &quot;Silence&quot; and &quot;Red Dragon&quot;. Now we know why. I will sell my copy of Hannibal for 25 cents. NO REFUNDS! The characters are completely without consistency, the plot far-fetched. Harris should have named this book, &quot;Take the Money and Run.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Maybe authors write for themselves or for their readers. I'm not sure and probably will never know, but this book upset me because I was expecting so much more. Nothing to look for in a movie here."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Like everyone else who's reviewing this book, I'd been waiting for this sequel for a long time. And while 'Hannibal' isn't the complete success that 'Red Dragon' and 'The Silence of the Lambs' were, it's definitely a book that MUST be read by fans of those great adventures. 'Hannibal' doesn't seem to follow a 'Serial Killer Hunt' format, so it isn't structured like RD or TSotL. Rather, it concentrates on the fallout of the events in TSotL; Starling's rapidly disintegrating career, and Lecter's flight from captivity. The book travels along as both Starling and Lecter's worlds slowly come together again, and for the most part, I found the bulk of the book to be less engrossing (or just gross-ing?) than I would have expected. But when the two of them inevitably meet again, by design of a malicious victim of Lecter's from long ago, Harris has concocted one of the most astounding reunions I have ever seen in recurring fictional characters.I don't entirely buy into the motives or circumstances of the ending, and maybe I missed something along the way, but I have to give Harris his due, for his courage to wrap things up in such a shocking and unexpected manner. After I've had some time to think about it, I can honestly say...I like the ending because it's nice to be suprised, even though I don't think the circumstances or motivations are clear enough to be believable.I rate 'Hannibal' at four stars, but the high rating is for the emotional shock value, not for a convincing, or entirely satisfying read. Harris has guts, I'll give him that."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris is being pilloried for not writing the book people expected. I won't easily forget the book's chilling final chapters. It's in these final scenes that Harris truly reveals how much of a monster Hannibal really is."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It's amazing what a pre-publication marketing effort can do to sell a book without a review! For the past two or three months, &quot;Hannibal is Coming&quot; (kind of like the &quot;Jaws&quot; ads &quot;Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water...&quot;) has been seen everywhere -- bookstores, web sites, etc. In the meantime, big pitches were made to sell &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; and &quot;Red Dragon&quot;. I wouldn't be surprised that this has been one of the most successful marketing strategies employed in recent bookselling history.To the book: It's an interesting read. I generally feel it's very unfair to compare a new book in a series where characters continue from a previous one. Our favorite book is likely never to reappear again in any series, so we really shouldn't go looking for it in a new book. I believe readers are better served by enjoying the merits of each story as it stands alone.Harris writes an engaging book (Why it took over ten years is beyond me.) While a slow start and some disconnected pieces here and there, the book does indeed move into a gripping mode. However, the ending is just downright ridiculous. I was angry as I ended Hannibal -- about the last ten pages.&quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; will stand as the best among the three for all time. This ranks second and Red Dragon is a forget-about-it.Enjoyable if you take it as a stand alone story. A bit frustrating at the very close."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"First of all, it seems that this is one book that has to be either loved or hated. I have only just finished it, and I'm still reeling from the ending. True, it wasn't quite &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, and to make a movie of this one might be a serious mistake, but it was, nevertheless, engrossing and excellent entertainment."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I loved the previous books by Thomas Harris and couldn't wait to buy Hannibal...I should have. This was a mess....mixing of third and second person in the writing; wandering sentences; characters losing their characterizations; and an ending ... well that I just couldn't stomach.My own imagination created a better tale than this and I really feel betrayed....it was as if Harris felt he had to give us &quot;something&quot; ...better if it had been &quot;nothing&quot; .... because this was less than nothing."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris went exactly where I didn't think he'd ever dare to go and I love him for it. This book was not what I was expecting, it was better. A thrilling dark and messy ride."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"How else to explain the shoddy product he took 11 long years to craft? I have no direct knowledge of Harris' motive in choosing to tell this particular story, but I for one got the distinct feeling of disdain for the reader, particularly in the last 50 pages. I completely disagree with those who say Harris has written this story with his eye on filming it. On the contrary, it seems to me he purposely wrote this knowing it WOULDN'T be made into a film (at least not with the same Oscar-winning team who made SILENCE). My two-star review reflects the multiple scenes where I was actually engrossed in the plot. For keeping me interested, it deserves more than a single star. But the ENDING!!! For me, the most important part of a novel, and we're given this sub-par DAWN OF THE DEAD nonsense? Look, SILENCE is a great book, and I count the movie as one of my favorites, so I obviously don't have issues with violence that is an integral, ORGANIC part of the story. But every character in this novel followed no motivation other than to allow the author to push the boundaries of plausibility and create a stir. I take that back; one character behaved in a believable way, and that was Ardelia Mapp. Everyone else in Harris' HANNIBAL world seems to exist in some goofy alternate reality. Mr. Harris, if this is a joke, can we please have a WORTHY follow-up to your masterpieces? On second thought, how about just an apology and we'll forget about the whole thing?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The strength of Silence of the Lambs lay in Harris' meticulous exploration of the psychopathology of his monsters. By giving Jame Gumb a history and a disease, Harris made Gumb's evil believable. Here, in Hannibal, he explores Dr. Lecter's history and turns him into a human being, albeit a highly damaged one. I got a great vicarious thrill from watching Dr. Lecter on the loose: secretly, I suspect many people would like to be smarter than everyone and simply eliminate anything that tries to block their way. The surreal ending was appropriate and reasonably well-handled. I understand the frustration of some Lambs and Dragon fans who saw Harris' writing as a brilliant example of tight, scary crime fiction -- Hannibal is more of a literary epic, hinting at Bulgakov in its surrealism and imagery of the devil on the loose on earth."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Harris has written a terrific book up to the last twenty pages or so. He exhibits, as always, an ear for a penetrating description; I loved, &quot;The press brought out the Feliciana Fish Market incident every day and shook it like a rat.&quot; I love hearing about Lecter's various forms of expertise, from Italian Renaissance art to the proper way to field dress a nasty poacher. However, I think he misgauged how much readers liked Starling for her earnestness and her sense of justice."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I have no idea what the professional reviewers above are talking about. Certainly they are not refering to Hannibal. This book begins well, then degenerates into the most pornographic (and I do mean graphic) trash I have ever had the misfortune to read. I also get the impression that Harris did not want to write this novel. The writing is uninspired, the conclusion repulsive. The characters' actions are nonsensical. I am no prude. I thoroughly enjoyed the first two novels, but this I have removed from my home. It is just wretched."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is an easy read, and compelling throughout. The fast pace was pleasing to my literary appetite, and I quickly devoured the book. Even so, it was more like a feast than fast food. Come back Hannibal, I want more."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"How one Earth could Mr Harris hope to follow his two earlier successes? The serial killer theme, which he reached ahead of every one else, was a popular literary gold mine. Such new material does not come along every day, or even every decade. So Harris stuck to his guns and, after years of pacing up and down, churned out more of the same - except that it wasn't the same. RED DRAGON and SILENCE were based on real cases. That was what made them so startling. And it excused the horror, because it we knew these things had really happened. In this book Harris spirals off into pure horror fantasy. No real cases this time, just the author's imaginings pushed to the limit of nastiness. The result is a pale shadow of his earlier work: indulgent, lurid, exploitative. Well, I guess that was a hell of a lot easier than coming up with new, well-researched, factually-based material."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was amazed by all the negative reviews from readers. Simply put -- they don't get it or else wanted to settle for the gory plane of the the previous two novels. This sequel is brilliant. I was mesmerized, fascinated. I simply could not put this book down."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It amazes me...I have never read a book as good as Red Dragon. Silence was very good, but it was no Red Dragon. This book does not even deserve to sit on the same bookshelf as Red Dragon. While I read what seemed to me to be one long contrived epilogue to Silence, I could not help but wonder why this book was written. Certainly &quot;series&quot; books can be published and maintain a certain quality (just look at James Patterson's Alex Cross books), but this book continued the series unnecessarily. It would have been better had Starling not even been in it, much the way Graham was not in Silence. This book could have been a new story, with Lechter in the background, again, as he was in Silence. I suspect Harris was pressured to write an actual &quot;sequel&quot; instead of a new story with new characters. I believe in Harris, I know his ability, it just seems as if he bent to the Hollywood peer pressure to continue the Lechter/Starling saga. What is funny is that I believe this book is unfilmable, as it would lose whatever inner quality it has by placing a mostly non-action orientated story onto the screen. As for the ending...It seemed to stark, out of nowhere, therefore making it unbelievable. I applaud the effort to bring things together in an unexpected way, but it just doesn't satisfy. Go read Red Dragon again, I know I plan on it!!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Books like this one aren't published every day, and this book was certainly worth the wait. Although some parts of the plot sound a bit implausible at first, Harris pulls off what many could not, and makes these parts believable and entertaining at once. The book provides a terrific follow-up to The Silence of the Lambs, and while it can be read without having read Red Dragon or The Silence of the Lambs, I would recommend reading the previous books first, even if you have seen the movies based upon them. As the relationship between Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling deepens, and as we learn more aobut them, the book becomes increasingly hard to put down before reading it all. Although it is not for those with a weak stomach, the action is engaging. While the book isn't as frightening as The Silence of the Lambs, I feel that it is much better than Red Dragon, and is a thoroughly enjoyable read that has left me hoping that Thomas Harris will be releasing another book in the Hannibal Lecter series very soon."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was really looking forward to this sequel; I enjoyed the book and movie of &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. While this book was well written, well researched, I feel Mr. Harris really went over the edge. I felt physically sick when I was done with the book. I love murder mysteries; Robert Patterson, Tami Hoag, etc., so I am not a prude on the issues of violence or sex. I cannot imagine this book becoming a movie. Please do yourself a favor and do not buy this book. If you must read it, check it out from the library and when you return it, wash your hands."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I loved Hannibal - the whole book was great!! Talk about a mind numbing ending....for 10 minutes after finishing I went from smiling to myself to mouth open in amazement. The ending alone is worth the full price of the book. There are not too many books that I have read that make me feel so many different ways, once I have put it down. There are some slow spots and some of the characters I really didn't care about...but the two that I do care about.....WHAM!!!!!!!! Read the book!!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I waited a long time for the sequel to The Silence of the Lambs- and I should have waited a lot longer. I was angry as I forced myself to finish this story but I found some comfort at having bought it at a 50% discount. If I had paid full price I would have sent it back to the publisher and demanded the return of my money. Silence of the Lambs is a great novel because it is scary and believable. Hannibal is a poor novel because it is neither scary nor believable."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What can I write that hasn't already been said? After reading the reviews posted previously, I can only rehash what others have written through my own words. First of all, I was totally engrossed in this book even up to the surrealistic ending. The scenes in Italy and the history of the Italian characters was truly engrossing. And for Mr. Harris to give us a &quot;victim&quot; that rivals the &quot;villian&quot; in delusions of self-granduer and misanthropic attitude is truly orginal. When I read the synopsis of the book, I thought here is an interesting idea, a victim survives and wants revenge. Little did I know how unsympathetic that victim would turn out to be. Given the brief glimpse of Hannibals history, it is not suprising the manner Hannibal adopts with Margo, and you feel he will not be paying a call on her anytime soon. As for the ending, the ending, gees! I was far more disturbed by the ending than any of the violence depicted in the three hundred pages before hand. I did feel like I was reading those final scenes through a dense fog, and that maybe some of the drugs Hannibal had where somehow seeping into me through the pages. Like others, when I first read Mr. Harris was working on a sequel I hoped it would include the character of Will Graham in it, along with Clarice and Dr. Lecter. For the person who wrote earlier about using Will Graham to help Clarice catch Hannibal, I want to say that was the sequel I was envisioning. That way we might have also gotten flashbacks on how Will caught him the first time. But maybe that is a story for the new millenium."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Always have been an ardent fan of Thomas Harris..discovered him long before the critics and filmmakers..but Hannibal is an LSD dream gone bad! 200 pages into this 486 page book, I have just about surrendered. Poorly constructed and organized. locales changing from city to city,country to country almost constantly; characters entering the story and leaving almost instantaneously; our Ms Starling of the FBI,a fascinating character in Silence of the Lambs disappears on page 97 of Hannibal..ever to return? If one reads the critics..this is a book of near epic proportions,enhancing the author's reputation. Makes one wonder..what book they have been reading???"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Much of the detailed and repetative descriptions of Italian locations was too wordy and unnecessary. Beyond that, the book picked up speed and intensity until the terribly disappointing ending, I came away angry I had read the whole thing. Definitely not recommended."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"For the first time in several years I bought a book before it came out in paperback. My mistake. Hannibal was a major disappointment. The characters were cartoonish and the plot was thin. Also, the narrative portions and the ending were surreal. Too bad Hannibal Lecter didn't sautee my book with a tenderloin before I wasted my time reading it."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I can't believe after reading 400 pages of great character development that the last 100 pages would reverse itself into the cheesy plot of a daytime soap. ACK! Was Mr. Harris pressured to finish the book? We'll never know. What we do know is this book should not be put on the shelf next to his earlier work. When they make this into a movie, they WILL change the ending, unless Susan Lucci is starring!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Started off and continued up to the last 4 or 5 chapters to be a worthy sequel to Silence of the Lambs. I felt the book should have ended earlier and would still have left the reader satisfied but wanting more. The last few chapters were &quot;hokey&quot; and added nothing and nowhere to go from here."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Wow! That's the first word that comes to mine. This book went well beyond what I had expected. The events that lead to the final part of the book (don't worry, I won't give nothing away) was extremely well thought out and well executed. I could find almost no loop holes in the plot.However, the section dealing with Florence couldv'e been written better. Harris definitely kept the tension high throughout but I felt he couldv'e done a better job in his description of Florence. If this section was an insignificant part of the storyline, I wouldn't have a problem. But Mr. Harris spent 100 pages on this section and I feel I'm making a valid point. I felt it deserved losing a star.Mr. Harris wanted us to feel the beauty of Florence with it's history and architecture. I assume the cities beauty contrasts well with Hannibal's ferosity. Hannibal Lecter definitely enjoys the finer things in life. But Mr. Harris spent very little time in his descriptions of the city. He tells us of churches, paintings, bridges, museums, etc. But I couldn't get a clear picture in my imagination of what they looked like. What made them beautiful. Perhaps when I read the book again, I'll have a different opinion. But my initial reaction is: he couldv'e written it better. He couldv'e have added a little more detail.Anne Rice, in her vampire books, goes into great detail about cities with it's history and art. But sometimes she overdoes it and kills whatever suspense she's built up to that point. I guess the author was trying to avoid that.Other than that, the book was FANTASTIC! To those people who hated the ending, too bad. Hey, I hated what happens to Starling too, but the fact is Starling was never a match for Lecter. Lecter had certain faults that Starling was able to use to track him, but Starling had even bigger faults that Lecter was able to exploit. Starling was never more than a tool for Lecter's amusement.It's a shame that alot of readings a too close-minded to recognize a good story when they read it. It's got to meet their exact expectations or the book's garbage. But it don't bother me, I'll just read (and enjoy it) all over again."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In Hannibal, Thomas Harris reclaims his characters from the pop culture cocktail party that began with Silence of the Lambs. After Jody Foster and Anthony Hopkins successfully translated Harris' characters from prose to cinema, the pair seemed more suitable for endless appearances on talk-shows and magazine interviews than participants in the author's grand themes of battles between dark and light.Readers should well be warned that Hannibal is grisly. However, Harris has suitably warned us of this through his other two Lector books. The maroon-eyed serial killer is, and will always be, a dangerous being. No popular worship from afar will buy any mercy when his appetite for action is piqued. He is a predator. He cannot be tamed. But, he can be predictable. Given the chance, he will kill. Given a challenge, he will persevere.With that in mind, read Hannibal as the dark journey Harris intended. The author, much like Virgil, leads you, the reader, through a dark Inferno of intigues.Clarisse Starling has more in common with Will Graham, of Red Dragon this time around. Clarisse has new lambs that disturb her sleep. The world has turned a few clicks and she is &quot;in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes.&quot; Isolation is a powerful crucible. Harris exploits it to the hilt.Much has been made of Lector's childhood recollections as a grand explanation for his condition. Rubbish. In Red Dragon, Will Graham says Lector has been labeled a sociopath because &quot;...they don't know what else to call him.&quot; Lector's childhood recollections no more explain why he has his appetites than sociopath lucidly describes his character. He will always be an enigma; classically urbane and utterly lethal in the same paragraph.Harris' grand theme, the struggle between darkness and light, enjoys numerous variations as new and old characters move into Lector's dark circle and become influenced by the same dark forces. It is, however, his domain. Few can survive it. None are left unchanged."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is the first one of Harris' books that I have read, having only seen &quot;the Silence of the Lambs&quot;, and getting introduced to the good doctor that way. I thought the first 430 pages or so of the book were great, but what a strange ending. Seemed very out of character for Starling to do something like that. Think there will be a sequel to this one? I'm not sure what Harris has been doing for ten years, but I hope for his sake it was not concentrating on the ending of this book. I would probably reccommend it to others. Looking forward to reading Red Dragon, as I have been told it's the best one."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In the last hundred pages, Harris betrays everything he apparently worked hard on establishing in his previous books about Hannibal Lector. To say the characters behave inconsistently does not begin to tell the story. You will feel cheated when you get to the end of this book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"A fan of Harris' earlier novels - Black Sunday, Red Dragon and 'Silence' - I had hoped for another. The characters were finely drawn as usual - I loved hating Verger - but the ending was a gyp. It felt like Harris didn't know what to do so he did what he did. Also, I'm not sure I wanted insight into why Lecter was Lecter - the whole point of the previous novels in the series being that he was undefinable. So read it to enjoy Harris - but don't expect to be satisfied by the ending."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I enjoyed this book, a much more perverse tale than the excellent, though romanticized, film. The Hannibal of the book is not Anthony Hopkins at all, more like a Bela Lugosi type of Dracula origins. Count Lechter is not a modern man.In the film, I loved the tracking scene when the pickpocket Gnocchi trailed Lechter to obtain fingerprints on a silver bracelet. In the book, that sequence is more complicated with more characters involved, particularly the gypsy women who fail to get fingerprints once they realize they are dealing with the devil.I also loved Lechter at the gun and knife show, observing Donny Barber replaying endlessly a video of a deer hunt. Where Harris came up with Lechter's commands, asking Buck to \\"make him a parcel\\" of his purchases, I don't know but very funny.And of course the ending. I was stunned although I also saw it as a liberation for Clarice whose life otherwise would have been predictably dreary."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Although I, like indeed many other reviewers do, think that Thomas Harris' earlier work is better than \\"Hannibal\\", I still think it's a good read and that it dosen't warrant such harsh criticism that is displayed here in this forum and elsewhere.It is true, that Mr Harris' style of writing in the first two books in the Hannibal Lector trilogy is indeed very poetic, aspiring to literary genius even. Also it is true, that the style of writing in \\"Hannibal\\" is less than perfect compared to the two previous volumes, but this dosen't mean that it is bad. Far from it. It is very enjoyable and Mr Harris still manages to thrill and captivate the reader with his fine storytelling. It is still far better than most you'll ever see in print.As for the main character, I tend to agree with many other reviewers, in their claim that Hannibal has changed. It is only natural that he would have. The timespan over which the three books take their course is consierable, also this volume is in an entirely different setting than the last two. He is now free instead of being kept in a maximum security prison. He is arrogant and mad as ever though, and still very much a murderer. There have however, also happened bad things to the character. He has become a sort of guardian angel to Clarice Starling, in very much the same way, a school bully, who fancies a girl \\"over\\" him would do. This trait of his, I think is a bit out of character, and I don't really care for it.Clarice Starling also goes through some changes in this book. Her transformation I think is just a bit too sudden, however drug induced it may be. I think it is a bit of a stretch the way her character ends up in the ending of the book.The supporting cast is very colourful. Some characters are very sound I think, take for instance the Italian police officer Pazzi, whereas others seem a bit more far fetched, par example the body building sister of Mason Verger. However, I believe that they all in all create, at least an interesting gallery of people to act in this story.The last chapter could have been omitted or better yet, have been rewritten.[SPOILER] The last chapter didn't go that well with the rest of the story I think, and honestly, I think we could have been spared the whole love story between the doctor and Starling. The affection/admiring from afar was about as far as that storyline should have been taken.All in all, I think this is a good book. It may not be as good as Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs, but it is still a good book, and definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"'Mischa loved dark purple, loved the color aubergine, for as long as she lived.' --Hannibal p.283Mr. Harris has given readers a wonderfully complex and terrifying character in Hannibal Lecter. We at once are repelled and yet facinated by him and that I think is the reason for his appeal.'Hannibal' is by far the best of Mr. Harris' books to date. Although it takes place after the events of 'Silence of the Lambs' it really is not a sequel. It offers insights into just why Hannibal may be the way he is and provides all the suspense one could hope for.Unlike previous reviewers, I found the ending to be intriguing...albeit unexpected. As much as I enjoy seeing Anthony Hopkins play the character on film I was very dissapointed in the butchering of the climax of the story in the movie. Read the book...it is worth the time and you will not want to put it down...*well, I did once, but only to say \\"did he REALLY write that?\\" and upon picking it up again say \\"yes...he DID!\\".If you don't like suspense then don't read this book.

I just took the book out on audiotape cuz I heard from several reliable sources that the whole sequel [disappointed]...but decided to give it a try, who knows?Now I'll tell ya, if I can barely get thru the FIRST TAPE, how am I supposed to enjoy the book?The only really funny thing about the whole thing was listening to a guy with a Southern accent doing a British accent (Thomas Harris has a southern twang to him)...Then i plodded thru the first chapter of the book, cuz I figured, you know, I wasn't getting anything out of the tape cuz my mind kept wandering and I kept falling asleep.Nothing different with the book...I give it no stars if that were possible"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I read here on the back of the copy of the book i read that this was one of \\"the most frightening popular novels of our time.\\" Well, no it really wasn't. Still, it was a good book. I watched the movie first and when i started to read the book I regretted that, but by the time i got to the end of the book I was very glad that I had. If you read the book and expect the movie to be anything like it, you'll be dissappointed. The end of this book was the part I liked and disliked the most. I can't tell you what happened, but i could definately see a really bizarre next book coming out of it.

I thought they were both great so I had high hopes for this one. I would say that it is a bit of a let down, not so much that the effort is not a good one, but probably becuase I built it up in my head. I not only read the last book, but we all know the movie was just wonderful - that and the buss around this book probably meant Th I would be disappointed. The story was a good one, the additional characters are ok, not playing that large of a roll in the story so the fact that they are average is not a big deterrent. It was just that I thought he lowered his standards a bit by so heavily detailing the gore. I think the pace is great and if you like a straight forward story this is it, there are not a lot of sub plots. Overall the book was an ok effort from Harris, in the genre it is above average."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I loved this book! Although, it isn't really as frightening as the back cover implies. It is more romantic, albeit, in a really sick and twisted way. The book is MUCH better than the movie. And the ending is much more different."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"If youre looking for a deliciously disgusting novel that will creep up on you in your dreams you should definitely read this.Its a straight ahead shock thriller and Harris's attempts at shock value work.One of the best horror novels since The Exorcist,The Shining and Salem's Lot.If you think that most Stephen King and Dean Koontz novels just arent horrifying enough give Harris a try."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book by Thomas Harris. If you are trying to compare it to the movie, don't, you may have some difficulties. The book does describe a number of the relationships in much better detail and it is interesting to see the history/relationship of the characters to one another. I do not wish to give away the story. It was a quick read."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book was truly written in a gorgeous and poetic way, just as Lecter himself would have written it. Harris is truly a mastermind. The movie, for those of you who have seen it, cannot compare to this incredible novel. The book delves into the sadistic and maniacal character of Mason Verger, it also speaks of the strong and beautiful F.B.I. agent Clarice Starling. Most importantly, the book delves into the past, thoughts and feelings of Hannibal Lecter. The reader finds out exactly what the term \\"free range rude\\" truly means. For those of you who are true Lecter fans, this book is a terrific read, and for those of you who are trying to understand exactly why and who Hannibal Lecter is, read this book. It is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I was a huge fan of both Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs, but I simply thought this book was horrible.

One of the worst books that I have read in years."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In retrospect fans of Red Dragon &amp; The Silence Of The Lambs should have been content with those two masterpieces. Hanniball, which may be the most anticipated novel of modern fiction is an absolute dud. Most true fans of Thomas Harris's books will wonder how this embarassment took 11 years to complete. The book completely lacks the psychological tension that his previous books so cleverly demonstrated. I have already wasted enough time reading this joke, so to review it in its entirity would be compounding my mistake, but I will say that the ending to Hannibal is absolutely ridiculous and an insult to fans of his two previous works."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I admit that I awaited this book as eagerly as a million other people, and I was disappointed! I have read 17 other reader reviews before I wrote this, so I will not repeat what several of the &quot;one star&quot; reviews said, since I basically agreed with them. Red Dragon was a terrific book and a very underrated movie(Manhunter). I didn't like Silence as well, but obviously Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster made the book seem better than it was because of their movie performances. Hannibal is a letdown, the ending was disappointing and the last part of the book was stomach churning--Which I guess you expect with Mr Harris. I did read it in one day though!!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Thomas Harris seems to have lost all interest in Lecter and Starling, and instead of writing a sequel, he is written a parody. The book is more screenplay than novel, with only the visual sense employed for most of it. The new villians are frankly, terrible, not so much James Bond as Austin Powers.This book doesn't deserve to be made into a film. There's better fan fiction around than this."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"An astonishing reprise of the Hannibal Lecter legend which turns all pre-conceptions of character development inside out. Thomas Harris has the ability to take literary stereotypes and imbue them with characteristics most of us only have nightmares about. Harris has obviously decided that Dr Lecter is worthy of more attention as an (anti) hero and has created an even more reprehensible monster in the form of Mason Verger as Lecters nemesis. Buy this book and buy it now, but be prepared to be unable to put it down, really."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Worth the wait? Absolutely! &quot;Hannibal&quot; is gruesome, horrifying, beautifully written -- dang near perfect, in other words. Harris gets a little outlandish with certain elements of the plot and cast (Sardinian kidnappers? A face-deprived psycho billionaire? His musclebound lesbian sister?), but the core characters -- Lecter and Starling -- are as compelling as ever. Their lethal pursuit of one another is never less than fascinating -- and believe me, it goes in directions you would never, ever expect. Not for one second did I know what was going to happen next (which is just about the highest compliment I can pay to a thriller novel). The ending will CHILL YOU TO THE BONE. Lotsa luck sleeping afterwards. . ."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Great story-telling and suspenseful build-up, but the ending reads like it was pre-taylored for the silverscreen adaptation.

It is elegant, romantic, very well-researched, unspeakably gruesome, and suffers not at all by comparison with Harris' last masterpiece. I have waited nearly seven years for this book, and I am not disappointed at all. Guten appetit!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This book is to literature what Star Wars: Episode I is to movies, and Thomas Harris and George Lucas seem to share common struggles in living up to the hype. Harris revives much of what readers loved about Red Dragon and the Silence of the Lambs -- most notably the eerie insights into the twisted psyche of a serial killer, but also the deliciously creative confrontations and killings, and enviable attention to detail. Sadly, though, he seems to forget much of what we loved about the earlier books, like the brilliant and relentless chase offered by the FBI, and tightly contained if original plots. Harris seems to have one eye on the inevitable movie (consciously or not...). Starling is too good, the rest of the FBI is implausibly bad, Lecter is superhuman, and the band of villains is farfetched and ultimately bungling. The novel moves quickly and the Starling/Lecter subplot certainly keeps the pages turning, but the climax is sadly predictable and leaves an untidy mess of loose ends. Like Lucas, Harris struggles to escape the shadow of his earlier works. But who wouldn't?"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The good news: from the first page, this book is nearly impossible to put down. Harris' writing is incredible. However, I thought the book's ending was off-the-scales bizarre, and greatly reduced my enjoyment of the preceding 400+ pages."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This is my second book by Thomas Harris. I must say I found The Red Dragon far better and more entertaining. Hannibal is just too over the top and the ending just does not make much sense. Why would such a law abiding Sterling end up with a guy like that, short of brain washing? BTW, I just drove by Teatro Colon last night and I think I spotted them coming out."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"....Everyone, this is not literature. Neither is it complete drivel.I do think it is a step above many works. Unlike many of the reviewers who find the sequences with Dante, the memory palace, etc., to be too &quot;artsy&quot; I think it lends a bit of character and feeling to the book. We wouldn't expect Lecter to be hanging out in Las Vegas now, would we? It adds to and complements his character. There were parts that were chilling,although everything having to do with Mason Verger was too over the top to really be scary.I enjoyed seeing Barney and Ardelia again, and even Crawford. The character of Mason's sister is so grossly stereotyped it's offensive. The settings are wonderful, and the allusions to Dante and Pier della Vigna and Judas Iscariot are fabulous foreshadowing. Pazzi's character is interesting, without being stereotyped.I do find the ending of the book improbable. Ultimately, the story is about the attraction between good and evil. Evil (Lecter) is attracted to good because good (Clarice) is incorruptable. Good is attracted to evil because he is brilliant and in some ways (ie. the psychoanalysis he performs on Clarice) more honest to her than anyone ever has been before. He cuts into her soul,figuratively. I can't discuss the ending, except to say that that relationship between good and evil would fall apart. It's not believeable as written.I don't want to go into the movie comparison here, as that's not the point, but I will say the movie ending is tighter and superior. Still, there is *lots* that people who didn't read the book first didn't understand about the movie. I suggest both."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"It almost seemed as though the book was written to go directly to the big screen. There was a lack of character development and suspense. I'm glad to know that the ending of the movie is different than the book. This is one book that I can't wait to see the movie so I don't remember the book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"This a great sequel to a great book. The plot is stranger then the other books but it is not over the top. i don't feel that any of the characters are unbelievible. If you are looking for a book on Clarice, this is not really that much about her. The Silence of the Lambs was about her, this book is about one of the greatest literary characters, Dr. Hannibal Lecter. The character is so well written about, Hannibal is a well developed character. Allthough you may think that Hannibal is the &quot;bad guy&quot; in this series it turns out with this final novel that is not the case. The only reason this I didn't give this book 5 stars is the ending. It's a good idea but a few pieces are missing. I think poeple who say it's way over the top don't understand the characters. The ending is almost there, it justs missing one critical part. I think Thomas Harris should have added a little bit more to the ending. You see for yourself. Read this book! It's great!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"In our world of best selling drivel and paper thin plot lines, I was hoping to find in this author a much deeper semblance of character development. However, while Hannibal Lecter is arguably one of the most distinct individuals in our recent times -- the other characters are barely uncovered. Sure -- Starling is back and we do delve a bit into her past... but there isn't enough there to really associate with anyone in this book. To add to this pain, the ending makes absolutely no sense. I won't give it away -- but really... please... it isn't even a shocking ending -- it just happens. Oh well -- this was my first/last Thomas Harris book."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"Dr, Hannibal Lecter, a madman, was a cannibal but was out on the streets. The cops could not find him. One young cop named Clarice Sterling went looking for him, picking up on every clue. The idea of this book was difficult to understand through several chapters. It was even hard for me to understand in the beginning. As I kept reading through the book, I started to get the concept. I thought the book was pretty interesting. It does take a good amount of your time to read, but I am sure if you read through it, you may enjoy it as I did. I recommend you grab this book and read it!"},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"I'm not a big fan of horror stories or movies, but with all the buzz about the movie, I decided to pick up this book. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The book gets close to being scary, but unfortunately it constantly retreats back into a laundry list of upscale clothing, art, food, literature and wine. Reading this book didn't make me scared, it just made me want to buy a new tailor made suit, visit an art museum and go out for a gourmet dinner (or better yet, prepare a gourmet dinner). The only real horror in this book was trying to guess what wine Hannibal would choose for his &quot;gourmet&quot; cannibal meals. Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs were scary, this is just commercial."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"What can I say?Once again, Harris provides us with a very thoughtful, psychological read. It stands up to its own merits, and yet at the same time, it pales in comparison to Harris's prior novels.The problem here is not that the story is not necessarily a &quot;psychological&quot; thriller; it's simply that its main draw, Hannibal Lecter, no longer possesses the air of superiority that he formerly carried. The mystery, the suspense, the sheer genius of Hannibal Lecter disintegrates halfway through the book. In its stead, we're presented with a caricature of Lecter's former self, who now has a purpose to his actions: a purpose which reminds us that despite how intelligent this man may be, he is no different from any of us. We find that this man is delusional, so to speak; &quot;insane.&quot; And it feels as though everything that he was meant to be amounts to nothing. It carries rather well with one of the themes of the novel: regardless of who or what you are, you will always be found expendable in one way or another.As usual, it's a pleasure to read the meticulous descriptions of everything that transpires in the story, particularly the politics involved. All of the newly introduced characters are personalized in an excellent fashion, with numerous chapters deviating from the main story simply to add a little more depth and insight as to why these characters may act in a particular way towards Lecter or Starling. But the downside is that at the end of the book, you get the peculiar feeling that Harris spends more time on these people than the two main characters, opting to let the previous books do the characterization for him. It works, but it makes the story lose some of its edge; it also makes the new Lecter somewhat of a contradiction to the old one, though in the end, one could argue that it is either self-restraint or a process of change.As far as the ending is concerned: in a gesture of sheer mockery, Harris strikes us in the face with what I can assuredly describe as the most surreal, farfetched series of events in recent literary fiction. It left a bad taste in my mouth, although I do admit that the last set of paragraphs were done with quite a bit of class.In the end, my recommendation would be to take the novel at face value. Don't come into it with any expectations, and you won't be severely disappointed. Who knows what Harris was trying to do."},{"Title":"Hannibal","review":"The person who lent me Hannibal warned me to be ready for a letdown in the latter half of the book. While the entire second half was not a washout the book did start dragging towards the final third. Firstly the conversion of Starling to a sort of female Lecter was too facile, too glibly accomplished- drugs or no drugs. Secondly the attempt to humanise Lecter was a mistake, I feel. His appeal is in his monstrosity, making him susceptible to romantic inclinations and providing a reason for his cannibalism were unnecessary. And having him be rescued at the last moment and making him some kind of demi-god (witness the pigs' behaviour), hmm... avoidable. I did so want the pigs to eat his legs at least! Thirdly all the name dropping of fine champagnes and food and vendors started to occupy too much space and seemed more reminiscent of Judith Krantz.All said it is still a well-written book and does make the reader infer stuff rather than having it thrust into the face which is always a pleasure"}]`),A={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:L},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},D=["disabled"],j={key:0},M={key:1};function C(n,e,s,c,r,i){const w=b("PoemCard");return t(),o("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",x,[(t(!0),o(g,null,f(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(t(),y(w,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),o("span",M,"Loading...")):(t(),o("span",j,"See more"))],8,D)):p("",!0)])}const E=u(A,[["render",C],["__scopeId","data-v-3b6056a8"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/2.md","filePath":"people/2.md"}'),B={name:"people/2.md"},W=Object.assign(B,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(E)]))}});export{R as __pageData,W as default};
