It spans most of human history and the entire globe. It has history, economics, money, adventure, world politics, war, personalities, social commentary, geopolitical strategy, geology, geography and the lyrics to the Beverly Hillbillies theme song.Through almost 800 pages, Yergin manages to sustain a high level of interest. The writing is logical and concise without being dry. He manages to follow oil into all its nooks and crannies and yet to keep things organized so it is easy to follow. It's a page-turner!I cannot say enough good things about this book.

It gives insight into history, without which, you can not understand history since the discovery of oil. This book gives history substance and excitement. In between the lines you can see the many small changes in the history of oil, each typically the work of a single person, that totally changed the history of WWII and the world as we know it. For example,Yergin shows that the history of WWII was very much determined by the availability of oil over and over again. The destruction of the Japanese in the south Pacific because their ships could not use proper tactics or go full speed for lack of oil is one example. The story of the \\"Henderson\\", a little destroyer, that was able to cripple the Japanese fleet by making it go into a defensive action that caused it to use more oil than it could afford and at the same time wipe out a cruiser was awe inspiring. The story of how the Japanese air force was largely destroyed by poor quality and inadequate fuel for training and flying was shocking. The book was long but fantastically interesting. I could hardly put it down. This is a book to be read slowly and pondered to allow the awesome magnitude of what is being said to sink in."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"The best thing I can say about \\"Prize\\" (other than the fact that I found it a fascinating read) is how it gave me a thorough sense of the complexities of matters I thought were simple and straightforward in the past. I never knew of the serious macroeconomic, negative ramifications to having cheap gasoline at the pump. The relationship between government policymakers and oil companies is not as simple as I had always assumed. I was very surprised to learn of the historical discord that has existed among OPEC member nations. There are many other examples of how my perspective has been broadened by reading this book.My one serious gripe about this book echoes a view expressed by another reviewer, namely that Yergin seems to say little that is negative about the oil industry. I wanted to read more about how oil companies have related to the search for alternative fuels, specifically whether they have actively thwarted such efforts or not. Nothing at all is mentioned about this. The same can be similarly said about the wholly lacking coverage of how the industry relates to environmental concerns. More generally, in an industry so powerful and so awash in money and influence, it simply doesn't make sense that there aren't any patterns of abuse to recount. I've read elsewhere that Yergin is or has been a consultant to the oil industry, and it shows.Four stars for being a fascinating and educational book.

All history is biased, I can deal with that. What makes this book great is that the author is very clear about his perspective so you don't have to guess where he's coming from or who's story he's advocating and because he tells his story with style and with an incredible attention to details, facts, and historical context.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"Simply, this is a book one simply must read in order to get up to speed on the history of oil in world history. It affects the way we live, our prosperity, our technology, what we wear, what we eat, how we build our homes and work spaces, and even how and why we wage war. The book covers the history from the time that oil was sopped up from surface pits, to the discovery of \\"rock oil\\" and its uses to make kerosene and cheaper lighting through the 1991 first Gulf War.It has always been a wild industry with big winners and big losers. Huge risks have paid big off handsomely and even more often have handed out ruin. Those building and running the industry have gone to the ends of the earth and down to its depths to acquire the crude that is made into so much of who we are today.Yergin handles this big canvas well. He writes even handedly about the development of the industry and its geo-political implications. For example, the decision to move ships from coal to oil in World War I had huge implications and added much to British Naval Power. We all know how the issues of oil and the Middle-East and Israel are all mixed together in a dangerous balancing act that has been used by a few for their own ends rather than trying to find a path to peace.This is an excellent book and one that I think essential to one's understanding of the world we inhabit. Please get a copy and enjoy all it has to offer. The book is about 775 pages with another couple of hundred pages of notes, index, and a three page chronology of major events in the history of oil from 1853 to 1991."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"Interesting book full of extensive research, but as a few other semi-negative reviewers have said what's NOT in the book would be a more useful history of Big Oil.Author has a tendency to go out off on a tangent (or seemingly irrelevant detail), but at least these passages provide dozens of new info for the reader.More serious is the author's apparent hesitancy to dish the dirt on Big Oil, eg. Standard Oil's providing bulk tetraethyl-lead and associated processes to I.G. Farben in the late 30's.Given the detail the author enjoys providing, this omission was intentional, and leaves the reader open to disappointment at what else was elided from the record."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"The trend toward authorial self-glorification has gone too far when the back cover of a book reads: 'Daniel Yergin is an authority on world affairs'. What's next? An Expert on Matters Pertaining to the Universe?Considering his exalted position in the world, this is a remarkably mediocre book, though there are details worth pondering, such as the irony of Japan powering its Pearl Harbor raid with oil imported from California. Worse than that, and more sobering, is the realization that Japan subjugated Taiwan, China, and other parts of Asia over the course of four decades with oil from California. Millions of lives were destroyed, but the oil spigot was not shut off until July of 1941. Why? Roosevelt did not want to give Japan a pretext for attacking the East Indies. Yergin relates this astounding spinelessness without a hint of irony, as though it were a perfectly good excuse for supplying a fascist power with the means to mass murder.Yergin misses the boat entirely when it comes to the price drop of the mid-eighties, claiming the Saudis flooded the market to gain market share and that George Bush went from place to place as the 'point man' for the Reagan administration arguing for a price floor for oil. Nonsense. Ronald Reagan's goal was the destruction of the Soviet Empire, and one of his key strategies was to take away the Russians' source of hard currency: the sale of oil. Every one dollar drop in the price of crude deprived the Soviets of billions of dollars of revenue, revenue that their own paraplegic of an economy could never hope to generate on its own. If there was any 'point man' for the administration in the Middle East, it was William Casey, who guaranteed the Saudis' security against Marxist revolutionaries and regional dictators like Saddam. In exchange, the Saudis flooded the market with oil. This not only deprived the Soviets of real money, it also gave Americans the equivalent of a tax cut. Is it just coincidence that the Soviet Union began to collapse just a few months later? Just coincidence that the US saved the Saudis and Kuwait from the fourth largest army in the world, when just a few years earlier these same Arab sheikhs were universally reviled for having us over a barrel?Also lacking in this very thick book is any serious technical discussion of oil, theories of exploration, pros and cons of new technologies...In place of this, there is seemingly endless talk of contracts, and, even more mind-numbing, negotiation of contracts, interlarded with impertinent anecdotes about people who wandered in and out of the industry. Yergin devotes a lot of space to rehashing trivia about Rockefeller and cliches about Americans and their love of cars, material that has been presented elsewhere so many times as to be almost common knowledge. In a book that is ostensibly about oil and money and power, almost nothing is said about the governments of Europe and their hyper-taxation of oil or what their goals are and whether they've been attained. One looks in vain for any mention of the natural gas or propane or diesel or asphalt or plastic industries.Overall, The Prize resembles a mass of articles from Newsweek and Time: flaccid, insipid, superficial, slick. This would not surprise me if it were the work of anyone other than 'an authority on world affairs'."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"THE PRIZE by Daniel Yergin is an 884 page history book about the oil industry. High points include the discoveries of oil in Pennsylvania, Texas, Baku, Sumatra, Iran, and in off-shore locations. (Baku was an independent duchy that was taken by Russia in 1813, by way of the Treaty of Gulistan. But now, Baku is the capital of Azerbaijan.) High points of this book also include info on collaborations between companies, e.g., Standard Oil of California, Standard Oil of New Jersey, Texaco, Socony, Gulf, Royal Dutch Shell, British Petroleum, and Compagnie Francaise des Petroles (see page 503). The book avoids chemistry, and avoid disclosing innovations relating to the detection, drilling, and refinement of oil. The book is mainly about politics. For me, the most exciting part of the book was about oil supplies for the Allies and Axis countries during WWII. For example, we read that U.S. General Carl Spaatz, under Eisenhower, led an attack on May 12, 1944 of 935 bombers against Germany's I.G.Farben synthetic oil factory in Leuna, Germany (page 346), and on May 28th attacked Germany's oil facilities located in Rumania. The book is essential reading for anyone interested in WWII, in the Middle East, or in how the world is put together. The book is abundantly readable, and can be understood in its entirety by any intelligent high school student. Difficult words rarely occur, and they make their appearance on only a dozen or so pages in the entire book. For example, we find imbroglio (page 477), condottiere (page 501), disquisition (page 521), nostrum (page 570), and hegemony (page 638). That's about it for the difficult words in this book!PHOTOGRAPHS. The book contains 32 pages of glossy B & W photos showing, e.g., an oil well in Pennsylvania (1859), an oil field of 15 oil wells in Pennsylvania (1865), George Bissell, John Galey, Spindletop oil well (1901), Marcus Samuel, oil well in Sumatra (1885), Calouste Gulbankian, King Ibn Saud, Germany's synthetic fuels plant before and after being bombed, Mossadegh, George McGhee, etc. The following (below) outlines some of the highlights of this book.JAPAN IN WWII. In entering WWII, Japan believed that it had enough oil to last for two years, and that afterwards it could get oil form the East Indies (Borneo, Balikpapan in Borneo, Sumatra). In fact, the Japanese were able to capture enough East Indies territory to provide 50 million barrels/year, sufficient for the Japanese fleet. Japan discovered a huge oil field in Sumatra, called THE MINAS STRUCTURE. However, a problem was that Japan did not bother to provide convoys to protect their oil tankers. Eventually, Japan provided convoys, but the US used the radio signals from the convoys as homing devices. US submarines, by early 1945, cut off 100% of Japan's oil supply. In desperation, Japan tried using tug boats pulling rubber bags filled with oil, but the oil dissolved the rubber. Also, Japan decided to build coal-burning ships, but these sailed slowly. Also, Japan turned to pine roots, which were dug up and distilled in thousands of small stills, producing 75,00 barrels of oil/month (pages 73-75, 318, 350-364).RED LINE AGREEMENT. This concerns Mesopotamia and interest by Anglo-Persian Oil Co., and by Turkish Petroleum Co. Turkish Petroleum Co. was assembled by CALOUSE GULBENKIAN, son of a wealthy Armenian who imported Russian kerosene into Turkey. In 1917-1918, that is, at the close of WWI, England realized that it would need oil for any future wars, and thus decided to invest in Mesopotamia and Persia. Three groups, (1) Anglo-Persian, (2) Royal Dutch, and (3) American companies, in 1925 sent expedition to Iraq, and on October 15, 1927 at BABA GURGUR discovered a huge source of oil (page 204). A contract was then signed, giving Royal Dutch/Shell (24%), Anglo-Persian (24%), French (24%), Near Eastern Development Co. (24%), and Calouse Gulbenkian (5%) the indicated percentages. The contract included a map with a red line circling Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Iraq (but not circling Persia or Kuwait) (page 204-205). The RED LINE AGREEMENT provided that participants in the Iraq Petroleum Co. (IPC) could not operate independently within the red boundaries. They were required to act in unison or not at all (page 282). After WWII, American companies (Jersey and Socony) argued that the RED LINE AGREEMENT was no longer valid, but France and Mr. Gulbenkian argued that it was still valid (pages 413-414). France needed the RED LINE AGREEMENT to be intact, because without it, France would have no access to middle eastern oil. Gulbenkian wanted it to remain intact, because IPC and its predecessor (Turkish Petroleum Co.) was his life's work. The book then details the formation of ARAMCO, a company that was totally American, with the concurrent dissolution of the RED LINE AGREEMENT (page 419). The book discloses the plan of STANDARD OIL OF NEW JERSEY and SACONY to merge with STANDARD OIL OF CALIFORNIA and TEXACO, in order to form ARAMCO. This merger agreement was signed on March 12, 1947. Aramco means, \\"Arabian-American Oil Co.\\" Initially, Aramco was only Standard Oil of California and Texaco (p. 410), but later it consisted of the above four companies. The book highlights one aspect of the Aramco merger, namely, the opinion of KING IBN SAUD. King Saud was interested in only one thing, namely, assurance that none of these four companies was controlled by the British. In particular, he was worried about Jersey and Sacony being controlled by the British. But as it was, Aramco was 100% American.CRITICISM. A failure of this book is that it does not explain the practical consequences of dissolving the RED LINE AGREEMENT, and the expansion of Aramco into four companies. In other words, the reader is not told if Gulbenkian's access to particular oil fields, or if his fees and profits were changed. Also, we are not told if Aramco's access to particular oil fields, or if its fees or profits were changed by dissolving the RED LINE AGREEMENT. Please note the following general criticism of this book. If you ask a person who was \\"really there,\\" and who experienced first hand the events in history that are disclosed in this book, it is possible that you will learn that some of the narratives in THE PRIZE are not accurate. But type of shortcoming typical of many newspaper reports, and it might also be expected to result in a book that is based on newspaper reports. It is thus the case, that THE PRIZE is mainly trustable as starting point -- good for initial orientation -- should one be possessed to embark on a career relating to the oil industry.SPINDLETOP. Patillo Higgins, a 1-armed mechanic and lumber merchant, noticed gas bubbling through springs at a hill called SPINDLETOP, near Beaumont, Texas. In 1892, he organized Gladys City Oil Co., but geologists investigating the area called it nonsense. Higgins found a partner (Anthony Lucas), and Lucas went to Pittsburgh, PA to attract the interest of wildcatters (John Galey and James Guffey). Galey was a geologist. Guffey was a politician and promoter who dressed as Buffalo Bill. On January 10, 1901, Higgins' team struck oil at 880 feet deep, and oil flowed at 75,000 barrels per day. Land that previously sold for $10/acre now went for $900,000/acre (page 85). The result of SPINDLETOP was that the focus of America's oil production moved from Pennsylvania to Texas and Oklahoma. Shell Oil. Co, located in London, and run by MARCUS SAMUEL, took an interest and signed a 20-year contract with Guffey for marketing oil from SPINDLETOP.REZA PAHLAVI and MOSSADEGH. At the halfway point in this book we find an account of goings-on in Iran. This part of the book is fairly dense, and so provide the status of things by way of these bullet points:(1) Reza Pahlavi (the father) (1878-1944) was pro-Germany. He died in exile in South Africa.(2) Reza's son, also Reza Pahlavi (1919-1980) became king at age 21.(3) Islamic fundamentalists led by Ayatollah Kashani hates all foreigners, and hates the fact that Reza allowed women to not wear veils.(4) Bribery is the rule among all politicians in Iran.(5) In Iran, it was almost universal to hate foreigners, especially the British.(6) Elevated hatred was directed against Anglo-Iranian Oil Co., a British company.(7) United States, represented by George McGhee, Asst. Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, was afraid of Soviet's taking control of Iran, and in order to fend off the Communists, the US told Anglo-Iranian Oil. Co. to increase royalties to Iran. The result was a hike in royalties in the year 1949, paid by Anglo-Iranian to Iran.(8) US urged British government to pressure Anglo-Iranian to make Iran a bigger offer. But William Fraser (1888-1970), head of Anglo-Iranian (later named British Petroleum), had from experience realized that Iranian attitude was one of \\"ingratitude, deception, backbiting, and new demands.\\" (page 420).(9) Fraser was aware that other oil producing companies were winning 50/50 agreements, and at that point (autumn 1950), decided to give more money to Iran.(10) Mossadegh became prime minister of Iran in April 1951, and nationalized Iran's oil, and declared that Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. to be abolished.(11) Britain made plans to attack Iran, but to limit its attack to the capture of ABADAN island. The US was against this, since this might inspire the Soviets to attack Iran from the north.(12) But Britain countered that if it did not attack, all middle eastern countries would begin to nationalize the work-product of foreign investments, e.g., Suez Canal (pae 458).(13) In July 1951, AVERELL HARRIMEN arrived in Tehran to act as a broker. Harrimen stayed in a mirrored room in Shah's palace. Harrimen tried to make Mossadegh understand the expenses entailed by Anglo-Iranian in marketing the oil, e.g., expenses for wharves, storage tanks, pumps, roads, rail tanks, and a fleet of tankers (page 462). But Mossadegh refused to allow Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. to resume business in Iran.(14) On Sept. 25, 1951, every last British employee of Anglo-Iranian escaped from Iran.(15) The British set up an oil embargo, preventing all Iranian oil exports, and within a few weeks, Iranian oil production dropped from 666,000 barrels/day to only 20,000 barrels/day.(16) George McGhee tried to persuade Mossadegh to allow ROYAL DUTCH/SHELL (not a British company) to operate what was formerly Anglo-Iranian (page 466).(17) At this point in time (1943), rule under Mossadegh involved murder, chaos, and poverty.(18) On August 18, 1953, Reza Pahlavi ordered Mossadegh out of power (details on this accomplishment not explained by this book), and Reza Pahlavi became extremely popular in Iran (for reasons not explained by this book).(19) On October 29, 1954, Reza Pahlavi agreed to let a consortium operate in Iran (page 476).

If you are angry about the price you pay for a gallon of gasoline at the pumps, give these books a read to understand why the price is so high instead of complaining about greedy oil companies. Oil companies have literally nothing to do with the price of a gallon of gasoline. The real things you can blame are oil traders around the globe, OPEC and Middle East instability, rising demand from China and other developing countries, global supply/demand, potential terrorist or natural threats to supplies, and others. The real issue is that we in the U.S. aren't paying enough for a gallon of gasoline. That same gallon in Norway costs $10.12 as of August 2012. We would do well as a nation to actually increase gasoline taxes, thereby bringing in much needed dollars to decrease the national deficit and decreasing our demand and need for foreign oil.The Prize is the first book by Dan Yergin, a world renowned energy and oil expert. It tells the history of the oil and gas industry from its meager days supplying kerosene for lanterns in the Northeast U.S. to arguably the largest industry in the world. Working for an oil and gas company gives me a great appreciation for the history of oil and how companies like ConocoPhillips came into being. The history of oil has done more to shape the history of the world than the average person would ever guess.The Quest acts as a sequel to The Prize. In this book, Yergin continues the tale of how oil is shaping the modern world. Since The Prize came out in 1993, much has happened in the world of oil. In fact, arguably more has happened in the last 20 years to change the oil industry than occurred in the previous 150 years.These books are a must read if you want to understand the world economy and the energy challenges we face in the very near future. Expensive oil seems to be here to stay. The global economy is so intertwined that supply shortages across the globe can affect every aspect of our lives here in the U.S. Hopefully the underlying message that people take away is the importance of U.S. energy independence or at least near independence. With the reserves of shale oil, oil sands, natural gas, etc. in the U.S. and Canada, we finally have the opportunity to decrease our dependence on foreign oil, especially from the Middle East, Venezuela, Nigeria, and other unstable countries. We just need lawmakers to get out of the way. Maybe they should consider reading these books."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"Dense read, encapsulating everything in the oil industry from the first oil wells in Northwestern Pennsylvania to Rockefeller Standard Oil to the rise in milt-nationals and Middle Eastern surplus. If you have a genuine interest in energy markets, this book is a must. Interesting to see the price fluctuations throughout history on this \\"not so common\\" commodity, and compare it to the wide spread panic we have today on peak oil. Whether it is drilling new holes, applying political pressure, conserving or setting new efficiency regulations, it seemed as if the market has and will continue to respond to this powerful material.Also astonishing is the complexity of the oil market. Fully integrated oil companies of the 19th and 20th century - comprising of production, refinery, shipping, and marketing - has increasingly been discarded for a pell-mell approach that combines nationalized companies with capitalism. My overall take away going into the future is that renewable energy can only be acceptable if the transportation industry adapts as well. 2% of home energy is oil (the rest is mostly natural gas, etc.) but our fuel dependent cars are keeping oil demand high (as well as demand of developing countries). Great book, will see the oil industry as \\"foreign\\" again."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"Daniel Yergin's \\"The Prize\\" is a true prize indeed. What a fascinating book ! I got it as a present in 1996 from a business relation and since then I have read it twice. It is one of the ten best books that I have read in my life, and I have read a lot ! Being 51 years of age now, I grew up with books. Although it might be branded as a \\"history book\\" it certainly doesn't feel and read that way. At more than 900 pages it is a lengthy read. I truly hope it will be available as a Kindle e-book anytime soon so I don't have to carry around this hefty but spell-binding tome when I want to read it for a third time. If you are looking for an understanding of the oil industry and the global power it exerts in society and politics, I highly recommend this excellent book."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"Reading \\"Prize\\" is like reading the history of the last 120+ years through the lens of the oil business. When I started reading this book, I knew very little about the oil business. Today, I am fascinated by the topic. I almost bought 19th century advertisement posters of the Standard Oil Company when I was in Bombay recently and was busy explaining the ownership structure of Q8 to my family while driving through Italy. The author does a great job developing all personalities involved and explaining the circumstances behind what they did at the time."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"Great book. A must-read for anyone interested in energy, natural resources, environment, political science, international business, and wanting to understand how we got to where we are now.The book covers the entire history of oil since its discovery in Pennsylvania in mid-19th century up to the contemporary events. Though it is thick, the book is rich and thoroughly engaging. You will not be bored!"},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"If you want to know how the oil industy began and how it works today, then read this book."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"The new edition costs the same.Yergin's prize-winning history stretches from the first Pennsylvania oil rush in 1860 to the crash of world oil prices in 2008, and it all reads like a novel. Well, not quite. The epilogue, which covers the period after the Gulf war in 11 pages, skims along ten times faster than the rest and feels a bit more like a history lesson. But it gives you a balanced view of recent events.I bought the original version as I started researching energy. Two full bookshelves later, I can tell you, no other book in this field holds a candle to it for fascination and information. I've read complaints about what it doesn't cover so here are some alternatives, but if you want tales of the way greed, ignorance, and cleverness respond to natural wealth and, in turn, shape world history and current global politics, this is your book.For oil geology and exploration, readHubbert's Peak: The Impending World Oil Shortage (New Edition). Oil industry nitty-gritty:Oil on the Brain: Petroleum's Long, Strange Trip to Your Tank. What to do about OPEC:Carbonomics: How to Fix the Climate and Charge It to OPEC. Alternatives to Oil:Plan B 3.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization, Third Edition. Big Oil's power:The Tyranny of Oil: The World's Most Powerful Industry--and What We Must Do to Stop It.There's no summarizing such a book, but here's the sort of tales he tells. The 1930 discovery of the Black Giant in East Texas nearly destroyed the oil industry, sending prices down to thirteen cents a barrel. After a voluntary shutdown failed, the Governor of Texas sent the Texas Rangers in on horseback. They shut down production and sent prices back up. This led to the Texas Railroad Commission becoming the first government-organized oil cartel &mdash; a model for OPEC years later.As an economist I really appreciate the fact that Yergin gets his economics right. This is crucial for a book about price manipulation, and it's quite uncommon among popular books. For example he understands why the Saudis tried to hold price down in 1979 and why Bush Senior flew to Saudi Arabia in 1986 to try to get them to raise the price back up. Yergen helps you understand exactly why things happen in this topsey-turvey world. In any case, The Prize has been selling like hotcakes for 18 years. Whether you're fascinated by powerful historical forces or disgusted but intrigued by fossil fuel, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"I read this book, translated to portuguese, here in Brazil.This book is good to read, but has some failures.At first, the history ends in 1990.In other words, this book is now a little outdated.I don't know if this ediction is now updated.The second failures in this book is that it doesn't tells basically nothing about Brazil.I read it from the firts to the last word.\\"Brazil\\" is writen only one time, as a scale to a trip to Saudi Arabia.In fact Brazil had a part ridiculous, part fun , oil's history.Oil here was(and sometimes continuous to be) a demagogue's god.In 1980 decade, Brazil was producing more oil then Barain.Today in fact, Brazil produces more oil, then Lybia , Egipt,Argentina and Algeria.And this book tells nothing about oil in Brazil.Today, Brazil is a net oil's export.In fact Brazil will produce about about 3,000,000 brents each day, in less than one decade.Brazil will have decline about the same time or even after countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq,Iran,etc.Having so many oil in deep ocean, Brazil will grow his oil's production for many decades , in this century.It's possible that Brazil will be the biggest oil's producer in the world, about the half of this century.Being outdated and failed about Brazil, I'll give 3 stars for this book."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"Incredible book could not put it down, so many facets in the giant puzzle that has made the world as it is today, it opened my eyes to the great geo political game and it's so relevant to what is happening presently / Present link between Oil-Economy-Military (the non oil energy crisis).From an Avid war history reader and earlier Special Forces UDT EOD solder."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"This book is an impressive work on how the petroleum industry was turned into the most important industry of the world.A excellent job, well wrote and nice stories about our recent history."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"Interesting history lessons, but time for an update. has a tendency to be long-winded."},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"This piece of non-fiction is more exciting than FICTION novels"},{"Title":"THE PRIZE; THE EPIC QUEST FOR OIL, MONEY, AND POWER.","review":"I worked on a deal for one of the majors and wanted to get a feel for the industry.

Unemployed in 1935 he sold his first short story under the name Luke Short, after selling several stories in the 1930s he then began to write for motion pictures. Several of his books, Ambush, Ramrod, Blood On The Moon (Gunman's Chance), Coroner Creek, among others became motion pictures. There are well over 3 dozen of his books available.The Man On The Blue refers to the type of horse ridden by the main character, not a river as I thought prior to reading. We have a bad man or 'hardcase' (in fact one of Luke Short's books is entitled just that, Hardcase-1941) as we so often do in a Luke Short western, a man with a price on his head and a chip on his shoulder. We also have a much worse man as town sheriff. There are a couple of unsolved murders in the story and if the sheriff has time and his way there could be more. A gold mine, a land swindle, and murders all add up to a western with an edge of mystery. As with all Luke Short writings, it is not just another 'formulaic' western, it has some depth.I cannot say I enjoyed this book as much as thought I would, it will never take the place of a few of my Luke Short favorites: Ambush, Summer of the Smoke, or Station West, but it remains a readable, complex western story with a tightly woven plot. The improbable name of the main character bothered me all throughout the book: Shamrock Ireland. Sad to say, doesn't sound western enough for me. All other names were well suited to their owners, even the crooked, murdering sheriff had the name Lobell. But I could not get used to Shamrock Ireland. Fast gun, Shamrock, has wanted posters out on him in three states, so the action all takes place in the one state in which he is not wanted: Arizona.This is a western taking up only a couple night's reading and does provide some enjoyment. Anyone reading it will find it so, no doubt. Also, no doubt, the book shows its age in its rambling, slower paced way. As I say, a reasonably good read, but not one of Luke Short's classics as far as I'm concerned, having at least 3 dozen on my western shelves. Been collecting Luke Short books most of my life.Read on book-a-roos.Semper Fi."},{"Title":"Anni's India Diary","review":"India is a large and diverse country, the home of many ancient and interesting cultures. This book is the travel dialog of a young girl named Anni as she travels through India with her mom and dad. They travel by train, bus, camel and elephant. There are many illustrations and they illustrate the daily street life of India. You see people bathing in the Ganges River, carts being pulled by oxen, people cooking their food in the streets, street vendors hawking their wares, children at school under a tree, and the clothes that the Indians wear. What was most interesting were the pictures of products they encountered in India. Postage stamps, matches, cameras, railway tickets, lottery tickets, honey, fireworks, fabrics, hotel receipts and other products that I did not recognize.An excellent introduction to India written for young people, this book demonstrates some of the variety and vitality of a country whose culture was old when the first white people landed in North America."},{"Title":"Anni's India Diary","review":"This is a great book! My son is 9 years old and went to India a couple of years ago. This book vividly brought back all his memories. What I liked best was that even though it is not written by an Indian, it is so authentic. The illustrations are just great! I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Anni's India Diary","review":"This book really captures the feel of traveling through India and is very different than other travel and picture books. It brings me back to my many trips there because it shows the stuff you see on the streets as you travel from one place to another. The ads and labels from packages were particularly nostalgic for me, they are everywhere when you are in India but of course you wouldn't see them in a more conventional travel book (it's been twelve years since I visited last).This book has great descriptive text, is very respectful yet easy to relate to for my kids, and really gives a more \\"on the streets\\" flavor of the Indian travel experience. I think my four year old really enjoyed this book, and my six year old was definitely into it, so I think it's appropriate for much younger than third graders (although that might be the correct reading level for reading on their own). I give it five stars because it communicates an experience that I haven't seen in other books on India."},{"Title":"Anni's India Diary","review":"This is a great book if you're planning a trip to India with children aged 4-11, or if you've been to India with them and you want to help them recapture the experience. (I'm not sure what children who have no other connection to India would make of it.)My son is four and loves the book in spite of all the text. He's been to India, and so have his parents. The wonderful jumble of drawings (mostly quite accurate--must have been either on-site or from a good photo collection) and collage is captivating enough that I think most youngsters would be capable of sitting through the lengthy text, though the diary format is a little awkward for reading aloud. There are occasional minor inaccuracies (the library review above correctly points out the \\"puja\\" problem... but then, this book doesn't pose as an encyclopedia entry), but as children's books on India go, this one's on the more accurate side of the scale. What's most impressive is the girl's eagerness to meet children from another place, culture, and economic class. She makes friends in a way that seems genuinely non-judgemental. (She and her family chat with a poor pavement dweller in Calcutta, an incense worker in Mysore, a fruitseller on the beach in Goa...)"},{"Title":"Anni's India Diary","review":"This is a great book!

This book is considered by critics to be the companion novel to Jimmie Higgins (1919) and acts like an antithetical drama to Higgins's proletarian Bildungsroman style (see Karsten Piep). The protagonist in this story is a luckless opportunist in the middle of the Red Scare who becomes embroiled in a plot by the D.A. to infiltrate and spy on an enclave of Socialists who have been wrongfully connected with a domestic bombing. In my opinion, it helps if you're already sympathetic to Sinclair's politics to appreciate or even, dare I say, be 'moved' by \\"100%.\\""},{"Title":"A Summer Bird-cage","review":"Sarah had come home from Paris to be a bridesmaid for her sister Louise. When they were young Sarah adored her sister, but her sister never seemed to be the least bit interested in her. The novel traces a year in their lives through Sarah's eyes. It is a book about growing up, learning about different kinds of people and most of all its about the institution of marriage as viewed by Sarah through Louise's marriage.Although this book has been around for 40 years it is still fresh and relevant today. People have always hidden who they are and what their true motives are.I have never read a Margaret Drabble book before, but I will definitely read more in future. I love her prose and her acute observations of people. Well worth a read!"},{"Title":"A Summer Bird-cage","review":"A Summer Bird-Cage by Margaret Drabble is a book with a hyphen in the title. This is apposite, since it presents a tale of two sisters, Louise and Sarah who, in a short but intense period of their lives, realise that there is an enduring bond between them, even if that bond may be no more than an agreement to compete.Louise and Sarah have both been to Oxford. Louise is three years older than Sarah, who estimates that her sister is thus also three inches taller than herself. They are both beautiful, desirable young women, clearly drawn from society's existing elite and destined not to tread beyond the boundaries of their class. Sarah's first person narrative begins as she graduates, just as her older sister is about to marry Stephen Halifax. He is an awfully sophisticated author - whose books, nevertheless and by common consent, are pretty ropey - who seems permanently to roll in it, where \`it' refers to a mixture of money and whatever it is that allows an individual to claim the label \`Bohemian'. (Being born in Bohemia would not endow that status, of course. We are literary, darling, not literal!) And Louise is twenty-four, for God's sake, if we still demand His approbation in the 1960s. It is time she did something with her life, settled down, started a family, at least aspired to the respectable.Sarah laments her sister's good fortune. For years one side of her assumed future has yearned to attach such trappings to her own life, a standpoint to which she might only occasionally admit in mixed company. There is a gentleman friend, but he has hopped it across the Atlantic for a while to do some research. She wonders if he will ever come back. In matters of the heart, the immediate is always more likely to stir the emotions.Throughout A Summer Bird-Cage the two sisters interact and we hear Sarah's version of the envy, the bitchiness, the conflict, the resolution, the co-operation, the closeness and distance of their relationship. There are several parties where new people appear to gossip, to speculate or to provoke. Much is learned in these highly ceremonial gatherings about others.And, as far as plot goes, that's about it. There are some flaming rows, but no-one draws a gun. There is conflict, but no-one's life is threatened. There's duplicity, but the greatest sting is committed by a taxi driver who goes off with a whole two shillings of extra and undeserved tip. But even as early as the nineteen sixties lovers would sometimes take baths together!Via Sarah's frailties, imaginings, intellect, prejudice and eventual good sense and loyalty, Margaret Drabble presents a magnificent study in character and the human condition. If the reader were to pass Sarah on the street, not only would she be recognisable, she would immediately demand greeting. \\"By the way,\\" the reader might ask her, \\"did you really feel such resentment at everything your sister...\\" And no doubt Sarah would reply at length and in detail.In A Summer Bird-Cage the encounters are real. The events are credible. The failings of these people are purely human, rendering them completely three dimensional. Yes, the society they inhabit is rarefied, elitist and limited in its world view, but surely they existed and, via this superb novel, still do."},{"Title":"A Summer Bird-cage","review":"Female narative about living in England in a certain era - always interesting to get a glimpse inside someone's head from another time and see that she struggled with many of the same concepts I did at her age and some I still do.Maybe it was just the writing style, or the narrator's thinking patterns, but this book reminded me of Doris Lessing - I've only read her Golden Notebook so I'm not an expert by any means. Nor am I a literary person, I'm more of a book hound and not all that picky.

Here is a well-written story by first time author Alison Longstaff, that is vivid in detail and unfolds without effort. The characters evoke empathy and emotional response with each challenge that faces them. It isn't preachy or proclaiming perfection among the members of the congregation which makes it an enjoyable read for anyone.

This is not a formula written romance novel; it is so much more, with mystery, intrigue, and above all, characters so real that you will swear you have met them somewhere before. If you have ever been a member of any community, you will recognize the stuggles of the various egos at work in the seemingly real Cliffside New Christian Community of Alison's imagination. These are not stereotypical church-goers, but real people, with real issues. Ms. Longstaff's love of God and family become central to the story, but at no time does this threaten to become moralistic or piously overbearing, as is the case in some 'insprational' writing. The novelist Alison Longstaff is here to stay, soon to reward us with \\" To Rule Britannia\\", the much anticipated sequel to \\"Heaven Sent\\". Move over ordinary romance novels!"},{"Title":"Heaven Sent (Cliffside Chapel, Book 1)","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. While Romance novels are not my usual choice, I was intrigued by the setting and theme for this novel. Living in a church community and being closely involved with the lives of various members of a congregation, I am accutely aware of the complexities involved with this kind of life. Could Longstaff capture the essence of such complexity and do justice to the intracicies involved with church life while holding the reader's attention?Truly, Alison Longstaff has done just that, creating believable characters including some colourful and sometimes unpleasant ones, in order to explore her theme. I was reminded of Jan Karon's Mitford series, and I found myself caring enough about the characters to be engrossed late into the night in order to finish the novel. Despite a plethora of subthemes, which at times felt somewhat contrived, I was nonetheless thoroughly impressed and look forward to the next book!I have recommended this novel to others, as a truly good read.

There is a church community with strained group dynamics, trying to balance modern and traditional ways. It is also caught in solving an intricate mystery set up by a recently deceased church member, a mystery thay threatens the very existence of the community. It is a story of personal growth, where the main characters rely on their faith and the support of family and friends to rise above the pain and conflicts that might otherwise unhinge their lives. And woven through it all is a very touching, gentle love story. The young woman at the center of it is a widow with two daughters, and I like the way in which both adults never lose sight of these girls in their own emotional struggles. \\"Heaven Sent\\" was impossible to put down after the first few pages, and I feel I have grown so close to its characters that I can't wait to find out what their future holds for them!"},{"Title":"Infinite Game Universe: Mathematical Techniques (Advances in Computer Graphics and Game Development)","review":"Infinite Game Universe is based on a concept derived from the game Elite, of which I have happened to play extensively in my former gaming life. The overall idea behind this book is outstandingly stimulating, that being the use of mathematical equations in place of rampant memory use in order to create games with limitless dimensions of play.Unfortunately, most of the actual specifics detailed in the book were yawners and I nodded off more than once trying to read this book. It had the flair of your typical college textbook. For example, a good 1/3 of the book is dedicated to writing and analyzing your own psuedorandom generators and I found this to be a good example of excess.However, I am not actively trying to create an infinite game universe and it is quite reasonable that there are some people out there who would enjoy the specifics far more than I did. I picked up a couple cool ideas and the importance of the &quot;infinite game universe&quot; concept was emphasized by the very existence of this book! It is almost worth adding to your shelf as a reminder that there are patterns in this world that can be represented in better ways than 80 Megs of disk space. (Remind me to mail my copy to Bill Gates one of these days.) And, this concept has quite a future in the embedded world where resources will be quite limited for a new wave of interactive media &amp; games.Overall, I enjoyed some examples in the book and did not consider this to be a poor use of money. And I applaud the author for detailing the physics of the &quot;Infinite Game Universe&quot; because if more programmers considered these methods, we'd all have a little more space on our hard drive and games that provided a lifetime of adventuresome play!"},{"Title":"Infinite Game Universe: Mathematical Techniques (Advances in Computer Graphics and Game Development)","review":"I was interested in the book based on its title, which is very pertinent to both my professional and academic interests. A procedurally generated universe is a powerful (but not a very new) concept.Anyway, aside from being a reminder (as another reviewer put it) that this field has potential and is growing, this book was overly verbose in describing vague, undetailed ideas. The examples were poor. There was never any &quot;hard&quot; math (one wonders how it got in the title). Most of the ideas were no-brainers. I felt that many of the solutions that were presented, were solutions that many people would come up with on just a few minutes of pondering. After having read 2/3 of the book, I wanted to hurry and finish just to get it over with. I was not the least bit stimulated by the possibilities, as none were offered that I hadn't already thought of just daydreaming. In fact, the book is so dry, it tends to take the excitement out of the subject. Even the section on Fractals--which I looked forward to the most--was completely lacking.In conclusion, I'd say that the important material could have been condensed into a thirty page paper on random number generation with some commentary on its application in video games."},{"Title":"Infinite Game Universe: Mathematical Techniques (Advances in Computer Graphics and Game Development)","review":"The \\"universe simluation\\" view of game design draws on a diverse array of topics in computer science: random number sequences, cellular automata, neural networks, fractals, formal languages, scripting, object-oriented systems, physics, algorithms, data compression, artificial intelligence. While Thompson's book manages to touch on most of the above, no topic is explored or applied in any real depth, and the difficult prose hinders reading.The text is full of off-hand references to the classic computer game \\"Elite\\" as an example of an infinite game universe, but awfully short on specifics. A few hours of web research into gaming sites would have filled in the blanks. Even more shocking is the omission of \\"Starflight\\"---a groundbreaking computer role-playing game that used a good number of techniques in this book (i.e. fractal terrain generation) to support hundreds of detailed, explorable planets and star systems, each with its own atmospheric conditions, mineral deposits, ancient ruins, and mysterious life-forms. All that crammed onto a 720K disk---surely of great interest to this book's audience. Why is there no coverage of this classic?Likewise, I can't understand why the author provides an illustrated reference to \\"R-Type\\" --- the most predictable shoot-em-up game ever --- while not mentioning the massive, still-unequaled world-simulation that was \\"Ultima VII - The Black Gate.\\"What exposition remains is obscured by the awful writing style and distinct lack of mathematical rigor.What should you read instead? I recommend \\"The Computational Beauty of Nature\\" for the math side, \\"The Official Book of Ultima\\" for the design philosophy; you can read up online about the relationship of object-oriented systems to simulations. For people who are thinking about game design, read up on Interactive Fiction and some of the old papers applying discrete maths to storyline, plot, character, environment. I've been planning for years to write a book on these types of games someday---perhaps it'll be sold on Amazon? :-)"},{"Title":"Infinite Game Universe: Mathematical Techniques (Advances in Computer Graphics and Game Development)","review":"This is a good book for game programmers who are just starting to realize that the need a background in mathematics to reach the next level in the careers.Other audiences will not really like the book. Mathematicians wanting to know more about gaming or graphic techniques will find the math lacking. There is not enough action to keep game players from yawning. There is no cut and paste code for second rate programmers to plagerize. Only a narrow audience will really find the book of interest.I am really happy to see this book on the shelves. Game programming is a multi-billion dollar industry. Many of the people got their start in the business through graphic arts, or simply banging on computers without much training. This book shows how programmers need to evolve from just plain code monkeys to true thinkers.It was interesting to see what subjects the author found to be important. He concentrated a great deal on random number generation, seeding, plot development, basic oop and finally he touched on fractals. Unfortunately, the mathematics in the book was pretty much obvious stuff. The book would not serve well as a reference, nor as a text book.If you are in the game programming business, I would recommend this book. Others will not receive much value from it."},{"Title":"Infinite Game Universe: Mathematical Techniques (Advances in Computer Graphics and Game Development)","review":"I bought this book hoping for information on fractals, random number theory, compression, etc. Very disappointed. He seemed to lean heavily on a few particular sources that I didn't think were very strong. (For example, I can't imagine anyone covering random numbers without mentioning Knuth's book which is considered one of the authorities on the matter.)Basically, this book spends a lot of time describing to you in generalities the basic principles, without actually giving any compelling examples. In many cases, he teases you by talking about what *could* be done with the types of techniques he is describing, and you're like, &quot;all right, now we're getting interesting.&quot; But then he never actually gets around to the meat of the matter. He talked a lot about fractals in general, but never any good examples of how to actually make fractals. Or in the chapter &quot;probabilitity as a compression technique&quot; (which is only 5 pages long, btw) he discussed RLE encoding, which is an excellent trivial example. The only problem is, that's where he stopped - I can't believe he didn't discuss ADPCM encoding, for example.It's not that this is a beginner, book, either. There really just isn't that much material at any level. I'm still trying to figure out where all the pages went. Basically, a disappointment. Lots of fluff. Not much math, which is what the title would lead you to believe this book is all about."},{"Title":"Infinite Game Universe: Mathematical Techniques (Advances in Computer Graphics and Game Development)","review":"I got this book because the title sounded like just the sort of good algorithm design discussion I was interested in. Sadly, the book doesn't live up to expectations. By a long shot.I got the book before reviews were up on this site, unfortunately... Listen to these reviewers!The book provides a lot of interesting discussion and pontification without a lot of specifics or advanced concepts. The techniques described are nowhere near cutting-edge. It honestly reminds me of listening to one of my CS professors rambling after a long day.The upside is that it contains a lot of interesting ideas and could be a good introductory text for programmers not already experienced in advanced algorithms, real-world game design, or higher mathematics. Unfortunately, that's a small audience, I suspect."},{"Title":"Infinite Game Universe: Mathematical Techniques (Advances in Computer Graphics and Game Development)","review":"is in the infinite. This is an excellent book covering mainly the theoretical aspects of games that require infinite to near infinite spaces, objects, names, behaviors, what have you. I say mainly theoretical because although there is some code coverage it is up to you as the programmer to implement Guy's theories and his theories cover a vast array of subjects and possibilities for application. And herein lies the five star rating. This looks to be one of those books that is overlooked in its time because it doesn't provide that immediate gratification of copying code and seeing a 500 level demo of interactive graphics pop up instantaneously. This book leads the mind into the possibilities of the future and allows the reader to see without being lead by the nose. Think first, think second, think third, implement fourth. To fully appreciate this book, you will need either a math background or at least the interest in the math that truly underlies all of computer science. Although this isn't required and the concepts can be understood without it, knowing computer-related math or having an interest in it will greatly increase the depth of understanding to master the topics presented."},{"Title":"Spiritual Quest: A Guide to the Changing Landscape","review":"Spiritual Quest is an excellent survey of current reflections on the spiritual life as well as a superb guide for personal spiritual growth. Hart clearly points to the Mystery in life, always respectful of the ultimate reality that we can never capture God/Mystery in words. He points to the Mystery with insights that move us in the direction of greater knowledge and appreciation of a God who is with us and for us.Using quotes and references from thologians, poets, playwrights and &quot;ordinary people&quot;, Hart illustrates one salient point after another as he guides us through the sometimes bewildering world of living life spiritually. The chapters on God and Jesus eliminate verbage that often interferes with a relationship with the Mystery. In place of excessive verbage, pious pronoucements, and wishful theologizing, he offers clear, personal, emotive descriptions of the real search for God and Jesus.His chapter on the principles of spirituality deliver on the subtitle of his book: they guide us through the changing landscape of spirituality. In one chapter, he applies his insights and principles to sexuality and the result is a liberating and balanced approach to the beauty of sexual expression.This book is a &quot;must read&quot; for all people who teach or seek a deeper experience of spirituality."},{"Title":"Spiritual Quest: A Guide to the Changing Landscape","review":"I was not comfortable with Christianity until I read this book.

Some believe in fate. Some believe in magic. It seems this talented writer believes in angels conjured up in the imagination of a wounded child wo would stand by to guide and direct forever more.Sabrina finds herself at one of those points in life where everything that could go wrong has gone wrong. Faced with financial ruin, with the Inn that is her heritage going bankrupt, and in sore need of repair, she needs help and she needs helpnow. Jason enters the picture. Unbeknownst to Sabrina, he has been sent by a land acquiring company to buy her land and her inn and turn it into a golf-course resort. Also unbeknownst to Sabrina, a guardian angel has been called in to watch over and guide her -- straight into Jason's heart.I will be honest with ou. The moment Jason walked into the scene exuding masculinity, virility and vitality, I knew the story would end with Jason and Sabrina living happily ever after. Even though I figured the ending, I immensely enjoyed the roller coaster ride as Sabrina and Jason failed to hear their destiny being whispered (and sometimes written, and sometimes very blatantly spoken) to them.Selena Robbins has done a superb job of making this reader fall in love with all the characters in the book as she sweeps them along on a magic-carpet ride toward their destinies.

I just hope that mine are as cool as Sabrina and Jason's. There were so many different plot twists to this story. The comedy, the magic, the fascination with angels, the business side of life, the hardships that some people go through and most of all one of the most believable romances and love I have read in a long time.

And this is an interesting treatment insofar as I can read it. But it suffers from one serious defect. The reproduction is very bad. Parts of letters, even whole ones, do not print. It seems as if perhaps they were somewhat light in the original, and a threshold was set for the minimum darkness to print in the reproduction, so in many places where the original had ink, the reproduction is white.I do not know whether this could have been fixed by using a better-preserved original, or it could have been done by simply adjusting a threshold, but in any case, this particular reproduction has to be considered less than fully acceptable."},{"Title":"The Modern New Testament from Aramaic","review":"This is an excellent refrence for New Testament Bible study.

Typically, you face requirements, the combination of which is quite unlike anything on Earth. The instrument must usually be able to withstand low temperatures, on the Kelvin scale, as well as survive direct unfiltered sunlight. If parts of the instrument cannot tolerate this, then you might design suitable shielding.Also, will the instrument be orbiting Earth or will it go further out into space? If the former, then will it be inside the van Allen belts, or above? This dictates the amount of radiation shielding needed to prevent latchup in the electronics. Whereas, if the instrument is part of a spacecraft that will go into space, but not around a planet with a magnetosphere, then less shielding might be needed.Oh, the instrument needs to survive the launch, of course. Depending on whether it is launched from a rocket or from the bays of a space shuttle, the mechanical requirements for this can vary.The book goes into the above issues in detail; and many more. The overriding consideration is that repairs are usually impossible or prohibitively expensive and rare. Vital reading for anyone in the field."},{"Title":"Jacksonian America: Society, Personality, and Politics.","review":"In his Jacksonian America, Edward Pessen seeks to dispel what he sees as an unfair glorification of an era and a man, using harrowing statistics and anecdotes concerning the condition of \\"the common man\\" to support his thesis that the Jacksonian era was by no means egalitarian. He states that the era was one of \\"inequality, whether in material condition, status, opportunity, or influence and power.\\" He further contends that the title of the era is a misnomer, in direct contrast with Page Smith, in that Andrew Jackson did not dominate the era in any historically responsible sense, and that it is ironic that an era that is named for a supposed champion of the common man was actually quite harsh for that segment of society.The book opens with several chapters of social history, based predominately on the observations of foreign travelers and statistical information from domestic sources. The outlook is grim for large segments of society: the Irish, blacks -- free and enslaved -- any other poor, and women. Women (though many contented themselves with what is called the \\"cult of womanhood\\") are virtual nonentities in any legal or political sense; property is transferred to the husband upon marriage, and even in divorce due to the husband's infidelity (in those states where divorce exists), the property does not revert back to the woman. If a woman did not marry, she was a perpetual minor in the eyes of the law. Yet by age 25, she was considered an old maid. Free blacks and Irishmen, besides having to contend with extreme discrimination from others, not to mention ethnic riots, also endured a deep antagonism between each other, a by-product of job competition, among other things. The outsiders who came to America and wrote of the egalitarian ideal and how it was apparent in America are not supported by what Pessen presents as the facts. He contends that the possibility of upward mobility was a myth, though fervently believed by Americans and foreigners alike at the time, and virtually no power at all was in the hands of anyone except a very small, privileged elite. The gulf between them and the common man was huge.Alexis Tocqueville, widely considered the most astute foreign observer of Jacksonian America, is criticized at the base of his thesis; in claiming that egalitarianism was rife in America, he is charged by Pessen with seeing only the surface of the country. Indeed, Tocqueville's glowing reports that he saw nopoverty and want in America belie his rose-coloured glasses.In the political realm, which occupies the second half of the book, Pressen finds little to praise. Though he concedes that at the beginning of the area general suffrage improved, he writes that Jackson was the beneficiary of this move rather than an instigator. Despite Jackson's reputation as friend to the common man, this was little more than successful political demagoguery.Indeed, Pessen finds no support for the belief that what can be considered the common man reaped any benefit whatsoever from the reign of Andrew Jackson, although certainly they fared better than the Indians or blacks. On the subject of the latter, Pessen reserves some of his strongest indictments for Jackson, claiming that he and his policies were \\"anti-black.\\" The only positive notion Pessen puts forth about the era politically is that the 1928 election was the first time that a campaign dealt with actual issues, such as Indian removal, the Bank of America, etc.; still, it was clear to observers that the \\"issues\\" were not the issue at all. Instead, a political campaign was won by lavish money spending, partisan newspapers for whom the truth was secondary, and local campaign organizers. Of course, a handsome warrior/hero helped -- someone who would appeal to the brawny masses rather than the thinking minority. Listeners at public rallies would be washed down with free whiskey before being treated to such thoughtful soundbites as: \\"John Quincy Adams, / Who can Write, / and Andrew Jackson, / Who can Fight.\\"This pandering to the common man got the politician votes, but the common man didn't get anywhere under that politician's rule. Even the alternatives were useless, as Pressen contends that there was really no difference between the Democrats and Whigs, as far as the impact on the masses was concerned.Pessen's work is a fascinating study in social history, delving through the countless travelogues produced by the visitors to the country in the Jacksonian era, diaries of American contemporaries, and other meaningful social documentation. He produces a vivid account of the poor at the time, their opportunities (or lack thereof), and how they occupied themselves in their day to day lives. Similarly, he is able to condense the perceptions of outsiders admirably, going beyond such generalizations as \\"rude\\" and \\"uncouth\\" in the minds of the Europeans and attempting to analyze the insights as well as shortcomings in their observations.The other accounts of social history are equally compelling, especially the section on medicine; while by no means an exhaustive treatise on American Medicine 1828-1836, the chapter makes for fascinating reading.Unfortunately, the political history of the era fares less well in Pessen's hands, seeming to be a rather biased account. Jackson, especially, comes under violent attack. While one can applaud a reaction against the hagiographic tendencies of some historians or taking for granted the egalitarian reputation of the era, Pressen seems to have little balance and, indeed, a particular agenda. Furthermore, the era comes under significant fire for being inegalitarian with no question as to whether such a condition is particular to the era. It seems that much of what is criticized in term of equality is as much true today as it was then, and in light of this some of the indictments lose some of their relevance.Pessen's book is nonetheless a useful examination of the social conditions at a particular time, well researched and well presented, despite the fact that some of the political contentions can be seen as significantly biased, even revisionist. As for \\"Jacksonian America,\\" it may well be a misnomer in every sense, despite its position as a seminal time in United States history."},{"Title":"Jacksonian America: Society, Personality, and Politics.","review":"I pity the poor students who are assigned to read this rambling, poorly written exposition on Jacksonian America circa 1825-50. Admittedly the book is packed with facts (many fascinating) depicting this period, but it is a difficult read because it sets forth conflicting data and rambles incessantly. This leaves the reader to do his own screening to separate out important information. What I also found disappointing is that the book fails to present an exposition on Jackson, the father of the modern Democratic party. Rather the book focuses on the political parties at the time (Democrats and Whigs) and their allegedly self-aggrandizing similarity. Pessen also devotes an inordinate amount of time arguing, non-persuasively, that America was and is not a classless society. I found the book a disappointment and cannot recommend it."},{"Title":"Jacksonian America: Society, Personality, and Politics.","review":"This book is by a \\"new historian\\" who hates andrew jackson.

There is something about his work that is other-worldly. He is so talented, gifted, far above the realm of mere mortals that listening to his work stirs something in the soul. Capablanca was a rare genius on the chess board. Playing over his games one senses, even if only slightly, the crystal clear clarity he must have possessed in understanding any given position. To work through his games is an education, not given by too many other chess-masters. To read his little book here is also an education. It seems elementary, simple, almost \\"See Dick and Jane Run--ish.\\" But to go over it, is still to be taught by a master, even if one thinks that they know how to read, or to play chess, already."},{"Title":"Chess fundamentals,","review":"Truly a masterpiece of the chess literature! First written almost a hundred years ago, it remains arguably the premier chess primer. I first studied this book in my early teens, and it immediately made a great improvement in my chess game. (The fact that it did not turn me into a chess master is not the book's fault, but more likely due to laziness.)I recall seeing somewhere a reference to the \\"mathematician\\" Capablanca. That resonated with me. Later I found that he had actually studied chemical engineering at Columbia -- and that only sporadically -- dropping out before completing his education to concentrate on chess. But no matter, the fact remains that his thinking had all the hallmarks of a mathematician. For example, in several of the included endgame studies, Capablanca divides the task into \\"phases.\\" These phases are analogous to what a mathematician would call \\"lemmas,\\" and this \\"divide to conquer\\" provides the novice with an insight into what constitutes \\"strategy.\\" We might say that \\"strategy\\" constitutes the art of navigation when the destination is over the horizon. We then divide the journey into a number of phases, each (hopefully) getting us closer to the final objective.It is interesting to speculate how the book would be different if written today. Certainly there would be concessions to \\"hypermodernism\\" (which partly contributed to Capablanca's undoing). But perhaps the biggest change would be due to the insight computers have given in certain difficult endgames, and mistakes computers found in classical games that were overlooked by masters. While on this topic, I have wondered about a statement he makes in the book: two bishops and a knight are slightly stronger than two rooks. Really! I think I would take the two rooks in an endgame, but I am sure Capablanca saw something I am not seeing. This is the kind of problem that a battery of computers can profitably be put to work on."},{"Title":"Chess fundamentals,","review":"Well, Petrosian said, this book, teachs me to delelopment my positional skills, when i was a kidThere are nice games, the chapter i remenber well ending games.This book is for beginer, but are very nice explained, and has some nice tip about, how to see a plan, that even today remenber.this book is a clasical, the best but very basic, if you buuy it for a beginer player, you shoul have it."},{"Title":"The Wizard of Quarks: A Fantasy of Particle Physics","review":"At last the author of &quot;Alice in Quantumland&quot; has written another parody, mixing a well-known tale with modern quantum physics.

The characters live large, perhaps larger than many of us did during that time, yet the canvas they paint on tells the story of the American dream gone awry, of an entire culture's devastated idealism.

Original published in the first &quot;Amazing Stories Annual&quot; in 1927, the story again begins with a letter, from Paxton, a Captain in the U.S. Army, to ERB in which he tells how he was fatally injured on a World War I battlefield and was transported to Barsoom, in the same way John Carter made the trip in &quot;A Princess of Mars.&quot; Paxton has sent the author the manuscript, which allows Earthmen to &quot;become better acquainted with the manners and customs of Barsoom.&quot; In what strikes me as an attempt to further explore the brain switching from previous novel, &quot;The Chessmen of Mars,&quot; with the Kaldanes and Rykors, ERB's pulp fiction story has to do with human brain transfers performed by the title character, Ras Thavas.Early in the novel Paxton witnesses the scientist transferring the brain of Xara, Jeddara of Phundahl, in the body of a young girl. Now called Vad Varo, Paxton becomes the bodyguard and assistant to Ras Thavas in the city of Toonol, and falls in love with Valla Dia, the young girl whose mind is now in the ancient body of Xara. Our hero helps Ras Thavas transfer his brain to a younger body as well, but extracts a promise from the scientist to help restore Valla's body. Of course, just to make things interesting, Valla is the daughter of Kor San, Jeddak of Duhor, so once again ERB's damsel in distress is Barsoomian royalty (that is to say, yet another princess of Mars). The remainder of the novel follows Vad Varo's attempt to restore his beloved to her own body, which is complicated by a series of brain transplants that alternately help and hinder his effort.The brain switching angle is rather interesting, and actually makes more sense than your standard &quot;strange alien device transfers consciousness between bodies&quot; that we usually find in such science fiction stories (I just saw that on an old &quot;Farscape&quot; episode), but &quot;The Master,ind of Mars&quot; is pretty much an ERB potboiler where everything is resolved in the final chapter. The novel also has his standard indictment of the futility of war and a rather humorous little attack on false religions, as well as a rather confusing roster of characters. After the classic &quot;Chessman&quot; this next Martian yarn is a bit of a disappointment, but it is still at least an average offering in what is ERB's best series."},{"Title":"The Master Mind of Mars (Martian Series #6)","review":"This is the sixth novel set upon Barsoom, and it finds a second American making the fateful crossing to the red planet during the first World War. This time, it is Ulysses Paxton, and he arrives upon a thus unmentioned area of Mars, the city of Toonol. Here he meets Ras Thavas, the greatest physician upon the planet and becomes embroiled in his grisly and amazing experiments.Thavas has discovered how to transfer not only organs from body to body, but brains as well. He proceed to train Paxton, now known as Vad Varo, in this discipline, with the objective of achieving immortality for them both. The plan runs astray though, when Vad Varo falls in love with a beautiful woman whose body has been sold to an evil Jeddara, leaving her a wrinkled old husk. What follows is the rather standard &quot;chase the princess across Barsoom (or at least the body of the princess) that has been the mainstay of the Series thus far, with the new added wrinkle of having bodies change hands with regularity. There is, of course, the obligatory meeting with John Carter at the end where everything is wrapped up quite succinctly.Like all of his martian novels, &quot;Mastermind of Mars&quot; is a fast moving easy to read and enjoy adventure.

There is an evil genius in this, a damsel who needs rescuing, and lots of adventure for our hero. What a pity Hollywood doesn't make movies of books like this. I read these in high school, and I still read them now, from time to time. If they had stuff like this in high school, instead of dreary English novels from the 1800's, they'd have boys who actually read the text, instead of going nuts.A Fighting Man of Marsis also very good."},{"Title":"The Master Mind of Mars (Martian Series #6)","review":"A different American, Ulysses Paxton, arrives on Barsoom. He meets the greatest physician/scientist on the planet, and becomes his assistant. The experiments conducted by the this great physician are still not feasible on earth in 2012. However, the the action and adventure continue. We get to explore new areas of Barsoom, as well as fantasize about possibilities of the future.I am still constantly surprised at the imagination of Edgar Rice Burroughs. He is able to allow me the chance to experience another world, and not forget the idea that a world must constantly change. Instead of continuously changing the characters and maintaining the same story and background, I love the changing areas of the planet. I also greatly enjoy the descriptions of different species and races on Barsoom. It is these very vivid descriptions of the changing landscapes and peoples that keep me reading these books.I think this book has slower action than the preceding books. However, that is not a bad thing. It is good to be able to slow down and enjoy the story again. The action, excitement, and adventure must match the reader, without causing a drain of the readers emotions. By slowing things down a touch, the reader is allowed to become immersed in the story, instead of flying by it as rapidly as possible.I should explain that I read a lot of books. I read everyday, sometimes several times a day. I read a chapter at a time, because a chapter makes a nice place to pause. Because I read a lot, I read a book or two from this series, then take a break and read a different book or two. This allows me to digest what I read, without forgetting where I last left the series. It also gives me a chance to view each book on its own merits without mixing up the story with the last one I read."},{"Title":"The Master Mind of Mars (Martian Series #6)","review":"\\"The Master Mind of Mars\\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs is the sixth book in the Barsoom series. Burroughs moves further away from John Carter by introducing a new hero, Ulysses Paxton, who uses his Martian name Vad Varo for most of the book. Ulysses is a much different hero than John Carter, or for that matter Cathoris or Thuvia from \\"Thuvia Maid of Mars\\" or Gahan of Gathol or Tara of Helium from \\"The Chessmen of Mars\\". Ulysses's connection with John Carter is that when on Earth he read the stories of John Carter and believed them to be real. The difference is that unlike those who came before, Ulysses/Vlad does not have the skill in hand-to-hand combat that they possessed. This was a very smart move by Burroughs, for what would be the point of making yet another great warrior to repeat the epic adventures which already exist in the series? Instead, the story has a much different feel, smaller in scope, and yet just as absorbing.Ulysses is a soldier in World War I, and when he becomes wounded and stranded on the battlefield, he uses the force of his mind to transport himself to Mars. Not surprisingly, though severely wounded as Ulysses on Earth, Vad finds his body whole and healthy on Mars. The first person Vad meets on Mars is Ras Thavas, a.k.a \\"The Master Mind\\". When circumstances result in Vad's saving Ras, he is taken on as a trusted servant and bodyguard. Ras shows Vad medical techniques far in advanced of those which exist on Earth, and Vad learns quickly. One key difference though is that Ras has no moral conscience, though he often does very good things, he is just as willing to do horrible things, and when one of the horrible things is to give the body of Valla Dia to the evil Xaxa, Vad realizes that he needs to do something.Through the course of the adventure, Vad gains allies to work with, and he is resolved to capture Xaxa and force the return of Valla Dia's body. Because of the help he has provided them in escaping from the sleeping storage of Ras' lab, his allies are willing to help, and of course Vad is keen to help them achieve their goals as well. Unlike the previous adventures, there is no great evil in this story, though Xaxa is fairly close to it. Vad is not trying to kill those who oppose him, but rather set things right with the woman he has fallen in love with, as well as help his allies regain their lives. John Carter is referred to in the letter which opens the story, and he shows up in the last chapter, so Burroughs maintains the connection to the rest of the series well.This book ranks fairly high in the series for me. I would consider \\"The Chessmen of Mars\\" which comes right before it to be superior, but this one would rank very close to \\"A Princess of Mars\\" which opens the series. Because of the key role \\"A Princess of Mars\\" plays in the series I would rank that one above \\"The Master Mind of Mars\\" as well, but only slightly, and I feel that this story is better than the rest. While \\"The Gods of Mars\\" and \\"The Warlord of Mars\\" are good, they do become a bit repetitious and neither one of them are complete in and of themselves. \\"The Master Mind of Mars\\" does not have that problem as it can stand on its own, as long as you are familiar with the setting of the series as a whole."},{"Title":"The Master Mind of Mars (Martian Series #6)","review":"\\"The Master Mind of Mars\\" is book #6 of 11 John Carter adventures that Edgar Rice Burroughs gave to the world. It first appeared in the magazine \\"Amazing Stories Annual\\" in July 1927, and John Carter himself only puts in a cameo appearance near the book's end. Instead, our hero is another Earthman, Ulysses Paxton, who mysteriously gets transported to Barsoom (Mars) after being critically wounded on the battlefields of WW1. Paxton becomes an apprentice of the eponymous mastermind Ras Thavas, and from him learns all manner of surgical miracles, including brain transplantation. Paxton falls in love with a young woman, Valla Dia, whose body has been sold to an old empress, so that that empress can now live on in her new hotty body. Paxton vows to travel across Mars, kidnap the empress, and restore his beloved's body to her. He enlists the aid of some of Ras Thavas' medical subjects: a Barsoomian white ape with a half-human mind; a professional assassin; and another Martian who has had his body bought/stolen by another. This is a short but extremely entertaining and fast-moving fantasy novel. In it, Burroughs gives us some interesting philosophy on the correlation of mind and body (as he did with the kaldanes in \\"Chessmen of Mars\\"), as well as some interesting speculations on the necessity of war in any culture. He also pokes fun at the mumbo-jumbo aspects of organized religion. So there is some actual food for thought, in addition to the fun. And that equilibrimotor chase and scene in the Temple of Tur ARE very much fun! The heart, lung and other assorted transplants that Ras Thavas is engaged in must have seemed like real sci-fi improbabilities back in 1927, although these things are fairly commonplace today. The brain transplants are another matter, of course. (Perhaps one day...)\\"Master Mind\\" seems to be slightly better written than some of the earlier Barsoomian novels; Burroughs DID improve with age, at least as far as technique is concerned. Still, there are the usual inconsistencies that crop up. For example, in one scene Thavas complains of the new young blood in his new young body, when it has been established that recipients of new bodies receive their old blood back. I was confused by this. In another scene, the 15-foot-tall ape/man puts on the leather harness of a regular-sized man. Does this seem possible? Clouds are said to obscure the moon in another scene, yet in earlier books, Burroughs has told us that clouds exist on Barsoom only at the poles. A body of a dozen Toonolian soldiers at one point mysteriously turns into 20, and the great scarlet tower of Lesser Helium, which was destroyed in \\"Chessmen,\\" is inexplicably back again in this book. (I grant that it may have been rebuilt, but Burroughs might have said something to this effect.) The surprise regarding Valla Dia at the book's conclusion was one that was so obvious to me that I don't even think it was really meant to be a surprise after all. And here's another quibble: Paxton falls in love with Valla Dia only after he has seen what her actual body looks like. It might have been more effective had he fallen in love with her only AFTER she was trapped in the haggish body of the empress. A young, strapping American male falling in love with an old ugly woman, based solely on her gracious personality. Now THAT would have been a REAL fantasy!"},{"Title":"The Master Mind of Mars (Martian Series #6)","review":"Ulysses Paxton proves that John Carter is not as unique as the reader was led to believe. Mortally wounded on a World War I battlefield, Paxton is transported to Barsoom much like Carter was decades before. His sojourn on the red planet starts out more humbly, as Paxton fidns himself apprenticed to Ras Thavas, arguably the greatest scientist of the day.ERB dons his lecturer persona once again as he unwinds an intriguing story about the perils of allowing science and political power to proceed in all directions unchecked. Knowledge gained irresponsibly leads to irresponsible actions. Paxton struggles to transport the moral lessons he has learned from the horrors of World War I to the almost savage and near-mercenary social hierarchy he finds himself trapped in on Barsoom.The best elements of the story are undoubtedly the bizarre twists and turns which unsettle the hero and force him to fall back on his courage and ingenuity."},{"Title":"The Master Mind of Mars (Martian Series #6)","review":"Again, we have pulp fiction at it's best.

I had problems following the many, many characters when I was a young boy, and found I still had the same problem now that I am in my dotage. We do have a new character here, a fellow by the name of Baxter, so we get away from following John Carter somewhat. In a way this was good.

Ulysses Paxton, Captain, U.S. Army Infantry, a life long follower of the tales of John Carter of Mars, transits the void to arrive on Barsoom. He finds himself in the company of Ras Thavas, the brilliant but aging surgeon and scientist. Re-named Vad Varo, Paxton becomes the champion of a stunningly beautiful martian woman whose body has been stolen by the aging and ugly ruler of another city. Our hero vows to get the brains back into the correct bodies so he can have the girl with the looks AND the personality he loves (and give the cruel and oppresive queen her due). He finds allies, undoes injustice, fights bad guys, sneaks in, abuses the religion of a people, saves the day, gets the girl, and becomes an ally of John Carter, Warlord of Mars. All possible because he was a loyal fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs' (ERB) books.If nothing else, this book deserves kudos for recognizing fan loyalty. But there are other great aspects of this one. With Paxton, ERB was able to shift perspectives more than in other books. In this one, Mars is given a breath of fresh air, as a new set of eyes tries to describe it. ERB takes on some fairly heavy philosophy, addressing the relationships between atheism, religious fundamentalism (as demonstrated by the Phundahl...), obsessive and ammoral persuit of science, and the need for a balance between rational thought, faith, integrity, honor, sentimentality, and objectivity. His take on religious fundamentalism was insightful, thought provoking, and fairly funny. The discussion of the pursuit of science without morals was equally insightful and thought provoking but much more sober and at times disturbing.The usual Barsoomian heroic fun, but with layer of more nuanced reflection. ERB pulled it off brilliantly.E. M. Van Court"},{"Title":"The Master Mind of Mars (Martian Series #6)","review":"&quot;The Master Mind of Mars&quot; by ERB is a great book! ERB's Mars series takes second fiddle to his Tarzan books, but I respectfully argue they are superior. In &quot;MMM&quot;, Ulysses Paxton, a critically wounded WWI soldier, is astral-projected (plot device to get things moving) to fabled Barsoom (Mars), dying planet of canals, hordes of 4-armed green warriors, scantily clad women, strong warriors wearing only their &quot;sword and harness&quot;, and home of Ras Thavas, the Master Mind of Mars. It seems that Ras Thavas has an enormous talent - only he, among all the inhabitants of Barsoom, is able to perform the life-extending brain transplant. (Or maybe we should call it, ominously, the brain exchange. Too bad for the young body donor whose brain is unceremoniously evicted for the old, rich plutocrats...) However, now Ras Thavas is growing old and he needs his own brain transplanted. Who to train in the procedure? Why, none other than Ulysses Paxton (now called Vad Varo). But our hero turns out to have ethics and morals, and not only that, has fallen in love with a beautiful girl. Unfortunately, she is a body donor for a rich old hag. What happens next? Ulysses, the girl, and some sidekicks go off on a tour of Mars to reunite young girl brain with young girl body! On their Grand Tour of Barsoom, they come to various cities, each with different religious doctrine (I think ERB is indulging in a little gentle satire here). Take it as a given in pulp fiction that our heroes are successful and all ends well. Great enjoyable escapist reading. I found out later on as a veterinarian that it's a little tougher to do brain transplants than described in the book.

He meets the love of his life, a beautiful woman, only to discover the man he works for has stolen her body and now houses the brain of the wicked Jeddara (queen) Xaxa. Thus Ulysses goes on a quest to find Xaxa and recover the body of the woman he loves. To accomplish this he recruits a religious zealot, an atheist and a Great White Ape that has had it's brain spliced with that of a man's and thus can talk.This story is a little slow at first but it's very interesting. It contains action and suspense.

Do you feel that many of the claims and pronouncements made by social theorists (of any political disposition) are unjustified, but do not really know why you feel that way? If so, this book is a useful starting point for an examination of the problem.In it, Popper develops the argument that \\"Historicism\\" (the term has more than one meaning in different contexts) as he defines it is a flawed approach, and that it is not a justifiable base for the sweeping claims of the historicist. To Popper, historicism is the concept that, by examination of history, we are able to define the rules that govern social change and hence are able to predict those changes. His initial impetus to look into this area was a critical evaluation of Marx - see his essay \\"How I became a philosopher without really trying\\" published in \\"All life is problem solving\\".In its simplest form, Popper's argument is the observation that observation of the past does not allow one to accurately predict the future. This may seem to be a fairly obvious statement, but it is worth keeping in mind as he develops the various arguments that make up the case for and against historicism.Popper's philosophy is often overlooked, perhaps because he attempts to limit himself to goals that he can reasonably achieve. He is a very prominent figure in the philosophy of science, and much of his epistemology relates to the methodology of the empirical sciences, and hence to direct observation, and the relationship of observation to development and testing of theories. Perhaps because he is not too ambitious, his philosophy is less \\"sexy\\". It is, however, eminently reasonable, and avoids many of the great stumbling blocks of traditional Western philosophy - for example, the problem of induction and infinite regress.This book is non-technical, and is accessible to those with little formal philosophical training. It addresses the dominant paradigm in social engineering, and suggests why we may be unhappy with that paradigm."},{"Title":"The Poverty of Historicism (Routledge Classics)","review":"Sir Popper is considered one of the most important thinkers in the area of philosophy of science. \\"The Poverty of Historicism\\" despite its complexity, carries a fundamental simple message: prediction over the course of history (its social and economic implications) is nothing more than a fantasy, an illusion. And this assertion is based on the principle that the events/persons responsible for changes are themselves affected by these same changes. It is Heisenberg's principle of uncertainty applied to social sciences!Historicism is the theory that history develops itself according to pre-determined, inexorable laws with a fixed objective or end. Fascism and communism were laid upon these presuppositions, and the course fo history has proven the fallacy (therefore poverty) of such assumptions. The attempt to have a holistic approach by eliminating individual differences through \\"brain washing\\" is incompatible with critical thought, and although it will bring about a concentration of power it will also cause an erosion of knowledge. The Poverty of Historicism becomes a poverty of imagination, of the ability of critical judgement and analysis. Historicism, according to Karl Popper preposterously assumes the postion of having discovered the problem of \\"change,\\" but revolutions are not unique to our modern era and the metaphysical speculation of what constitutes \\"change\\" has been addressed since the time of Heraclitus.The goal of applying scientific methods with the same accuracy and predictability as those in theoretical physics is bound to end in failure when it concerns the course of history. The influence of the prediction upon the predicted events is here being termed as the \\"Oedipus effect.\\" Physics can arrive at universally valid uniformities, whereas sociology must be contented with the intuitive understanding of unique events, and of the role they play in particular situations, occuring within particular struggles of interests, tendencies and destinies. If sociological laws determine the degree of anything, they will do so only in very vague terms, and will permit, at the best, a very rough scaling.Karl Popper who was a fierce advocate of democrary and social critiscim, dedicated this book to all of those who have been victims to the fascist and communist belief in the inexorable laws of historical destiny."},{"Title":"The Poverty of Historicism (Routledge Classics)","review":"Karl Popper's book is an outstanding critique to what has become known as historicism, the belief that the future of society can be accurately predicted, and that history follows a fixed path towards a specific goal.This idea is mostly associated with two influential figures. The first is the German philosopher Hegel who produced a philosophy of history based on the tradition of philosophical idealism, and the other is Karl Marx, who, strongly influenced by Hegel, created the concept of the \\"materialistic conception of history\\", or as is commonly known today, dialectical materialism. In this concept, Marx laid out the theory that history is pre-determined to move towards its ending point, which is a classless, stateless, propertyless society he described as \\"communism\\". Marx believed that he had uncovered the scientific laws of history and thus could predict its development and its end. The main problem arises when such ideas escape the scientific community and are translated into political action. Hence Communism was driven by Marxist historicism, and other oppressive regimes, such as the Nazis, had a touch of racialist historicism in their ideology.One needs to understand that not all of what Marx and Hegel wrote was plain historicism, and their methods and theories have been adopted in various disciplines, based of course on their relevance. But this notion of a fixed historical road, or the idea that one can clearly predict the major events of the future, is what Karl Popper objects to. In this book, he explains with clear logic, that such ideas are unscientific, and should be included in the trash-can of pseudo science. Popper's argument is strong and to the point, demolishing the scientific and the logical basis that historicist theories claim to have. I strongly recommend this book, for it demolishes a branch of thought that has stayed way too long with us, and has caused, sometimes intentionally, but many times unintentionally, great harm to humanity."},{"Title":"The Poverty of Historicism (Routledge Classics)","review":"1. Historicism is a term that was invented by Karl Popper. He did it on purpose to prevent confusion with any other existing term.2. The book is about methodology of social science but of course most of the conclusions are about the nature of social science.3. He seeks to refute the two core arguments that are advanced to show that social science is not like science.4. The anti naturalist doctrine says social science is not like science because unlike in science we cannot really follow the hypothesis>experiment>conclusion> refinement of hypothesis cycle. Various reasons are offered for this such as being unable to experiment, complexity of social science (includes biology, psychology etc.), novelty (every situation is unique because of the \`uncertainty principle') and the fact that social experiments is not worth doing in a piecemeal fashion because their generalisability is very less.5. The naturalist doctrine on the other hand looks at social science as being similar to astronomy (global laws which explain everything about the universe and cannot be disobeyed or overturned no matter what we do) and says that laws of social science can be found. These laws are not accurate in the short term but work very well in the long term across periods of history and in fact are necessary to be able to make out the transition between different periods of stages of history as the deeper content of each of these stages cannot be known with accuracy. Also these laws can be solely understood by studying the history that is records of past events. These laws are called Holism by Popper and he shows that even in the anti naturalist doctrine holism is popular because it is used as a constant between the various stages of history (which in the short term cannot be analysed and predicted).6. The holism is central to historicism and leads to a position where in the short term we cannot do anything about social sciences in the manner of being able to rationally change and predict the consequences but in the long term we have to ensure that we are in tune with the tide of history as revealed by laws such which have roots in Plato's republic and the Marx's march of the proletariat etc. The only proactive thing we can do is to hasten the transition of various stages or change our values and beliefs to be in tune(Marx ...reduce the birthing pangs in contrast to his call to action of changing history rather than interpret it).7. So what will work according to Popper :a. In terms of experiments he suggests piecemeal engineering that is based on the scientific method. He says that scientific experiments may look on the surface easier to setup and control as compared to social experiments but this is because we are usually comparing a limited scope experiment to one on a large scale. If the scientific experiment was on the large scale as is expected in a social context it would be just as difficult.b. Also large scale social experiments such as centralised planning are actually not helpful in understating cause and effect because it is very hard to learn from very large failures .Specifically with respect to planning they cannot centralise knowledge and control all kinds of relationships. To get around this they use propaganda and fear which defeats the purpose of seeing whether planning works to better the society as it stood before the start of the \\"experiment\\".c. In a large scale social change recognise that often one can only offer interpretations based on various point of views(e.g. capitalist) and the starting conditions ( equivalent to initial conditions) as opposed try to come up with a set of unchanging laws that this large scale event seems to justify (e.g. Russian Revolution.d. He rejects the holism argument and march of history as he says that there are no laws of social science that can be gleaned by studying many separate events. There is just a trend and a trend has to be explained by multiple laws. The mistake of historicism is to see trends as laws.e. So even if these multiple laws were there they would not be that relevant because other than in fields such as theoretical physics ( law of gravity) the laws themselves act as background to solving a practical problem rather than being the cause of the practical problem (e.g. prediction of earthquakes in a place is not going to be found out by applying the law of gravity although any hypothesis must be consistent with gravity).f. So to solve these practical problems we can take the piecemeal engineering approach by formulating the hypothesis as negative statements ( e.g. progress in science cannot occur in a totalitarian regime). These can then be tested using the experimental approach.g. We should take a technological view of social science ( build a building to guard against a storm) as opposed to a theoretical view ( explain the occurrence of storms in a location over 30 years).h. The poverty of historicist is a poverty of imagination as it says that there cannot be a scientific approach to social science but at the same time there are absolute and unchanging laws - called essentialism on the lines of Plato's Republic (that only a few people understand ) which TODAY (this generation, this period in history where the historicist is) are operating far quicker than ever before because of the \\"pace of progress\\"."},{"Title":"The Poverty of Historicism (Routledge Classics)","review":"In this book, Karl Popper explains his vision on the course of history, on historical determinism, and on the theories of Descartes, Poincar&eacute; and Duhem.The course of historyFor K. Popper, evolution in history is never dominated by theories, although they may exert some influence, at the same time many other less rational or even completely irrational factors are at work.Historicism (Engels, Marx, Spencer, J.S. Mill, K. Mannheim)Historicism is that part of social sciences which considers historical predictions as its main objective. It pretends that this goal can be achieved if we discover the 'laws' or 'trends' that underlie historical developments.Karl Popper rejects this approach for the following reasons: the course of human history depends heavily on the increase of human knowledge. We can not rationally or scientifically predict this increase. So, we can not determine the future course of history. Developing a theoretical history which is the equivalent of theoretical physics, is impossible.Descartes, Poincar&eacute;, Duhem, essentialismFor Descartes, the principles and premises of deductive systems must be certain ('clear and distinct'). For K. Popper, these principles are only provisory, are only hypotheses. Popper does not agree either with Poincar&eacute; and Duhem, for which some systems may not be subjected to empirical tests. A world of universals (essentialism) doesn't exist, only a world of real objects (nominalism).Popper's proposition of piecemeal adjustments (not revolutions) in the social sphere has been heavily criticized. One critic even asked how a HIV plague can be attacked by piecemeal interventions. But, in fact, the HIV plague was attacked in a piecemeal manner; first by individual drugs, then by cocktails.This defense of indeterminism is a must for all historians and for all Popper fans.The best introduction to Popper's philosophy is Bryan Magee's \`Philosophy and the Real World. An Introduction to Karl Popper'."},{"Title":"The Poverty of Historicism (Routledge Classics)","review":"The Poverty of Historicism refuted the major arguments which propped up the myth of historical determinism, possibly the most damaging myth of modern times. It is a neglected classic because it was overshadowed by The Open Society and its Enemies which was published in 1945 while The Poverty did not appear in book form until 1957.In the context of Popper's lifetime achievement it is the work where he first developed the ideas of institutional analysis and the logic of the situation which, in alliance with work by Talcott Parsons and Ludwig von Mises, could have changed the direction of economics and the other social sciences after WW2.The Poverty of Historicism is a short book on the methods of the social sciences and social reform. It appeared as a series of three journal articles in the 1940s and in book form in 1957.Popper's aim in this work was to transform the social sciences in the same way that he transformed the philosophy of the natural sciences in Logik der Forschung (1935). This had a moral and political purpose because he believed that defective methods in the social sciences had contributed to the rise of fascism and communism. The book is dedicated to the victims of these movements.He wanted the social sciences to develop a body of knowledge to enable social reforms to deliver peace, freedom and prosperity in the way that the natural sciences and technology increased the productive capacity of the earth. This knowledge and the kind of piecemeal reforms that he advocated would be subject to abuse, like science and technology, but not nearly as much as grand schemes driven by dictators or \\"philosopher kings\\" who believe that \\"history is on our side\\".A Window of OpportunityDuring the 1930s three men worked on the same problems in the social sciences and they came up with practically the same solutions. The American Talcott Parsons wrote The Structure of Social Action (1937). Ludwig von Mises worked for the Austrian government during the day and in the evenings he worked on \\"The Fundamental Problems of Political Economy\\". Human Action, his masterwork, appeared in German in 1940 and in English in 1949. Not far away in Vienna Karl Popper worked on \\"The Fundamental Problems of Epistemology\\" after teaching science and mathematics in school. Logik der Forschung appeared in 1935 and then he turned his attention to the social sciences. The results were The Poverty of Historicism and The Open Society and its Enemies (1945), both completed in New Zealand during the war.All three men offered a framework for the study of economics and the other human sciences which could have:Maintained sociology and economics as an integrated discipline.Sponsored partnerships between economists and students of all social institutions - law, politics, literature, religion and cultural studies at large.Ensured that \\"high theory\\" and empirical studies informed, enriched and corrected each other.Contributed to good public policy, especially by monitoring the results of increased regulation and intervention by Big Government and the impact of the erosion of \\"civic virtues\\". This work could have commenced when the role of government was much smaller and less entrenched.The common elements in their schemes could have either prevented some of the unhelpful developments in economics since WW2 or at least promoted more helpful alternative research programs. The unhelpful developments include over-specialization, neglect of historical studies, excessive formalism to describe unreal systems that do not exist on earth (general systems theory and mathematical welfare economics), inappropriate aggregation of data (Keynesian demand analysis and econometrics).There was a window of opportunity for these three leading figures in their respective fields, plus their followers, to form a united front across the disciplines of sociology, economics and philosophy to promote the ideas that they shared and to debate the views that they did not share.This did not happen. The published works of Popper and Parsons contain no references to the other parties. No reader of von Mises would be moved to read the work of the other two. So there was no united front across the three disciplines.After 1937 Parsons turned to general systems theory and a form of functional analysis of society that made no contact with the interests of von Mises in economics. They were also ideologically poles apart. After the war Popper returned to his main interests in logic and physics. He only made spasmodic contributions to the methods of the social sciences, including a significant paper on situational analysis and the Rationality Principle.The fertility of the approach is demonstrated by several programs, notably the work by Jarvie and Agassi in social science, Jack Birner, Boland and Wong in economics, some work by Burgess and others on education in Britain, North's work, the Virginia School of public choice theory, and the interdisciplinary studies in the Economics School and related research groups at the George Mason University."},{"Title":"The Poverty of Historicism (Routledge Classics)","review":"Popper's argument here and his general view are somewhat surprisingly in synch with that of American Pragmatic philosophy. Elements of surprise, of creative newness are what for Pragmatists make the human future, history itself as a whole fundamentally unpredictable. Popper argues in this work that total theories such as Marxism which claim to contain within themselves the true course and outcome of history, are by their very nature, mistaken. A total predictability of history is impossible in part because the prediction itself effects the actors, but also because of unseen, and unforeseeable elements which come with our always imperfect knowledge. The position taken here by Popper is in consonance with his own defense of the Open Society, and human freedom- other major elements of his thought.Popper sees here a fundamental truth of the human situation."},{"Title":"The Poverty of Historicism (Routledge Classics)","review":"For Popper's fans, this is a great reading. It's a classic, and the philosopher of science makes his point about historicism.Excellent choice!"},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Dictionary","review":"An improvment on Lewis and Short in that it uses modern lexicographical principles. Meanings and senses are better distinguished. Notes on etymology and word formation are included. As a whole, the work is much easier to read.As it does not include later authors, it is perhaps better used by Classicists than Medievalists, who may find medieval Latin vocabulary lacking. Thankfully for Classicists (and those using Classical texts) it does not present anachronistic distinctions in the graphs for /u/ and /w/, as well as for /i/ and /j/. In this respect, it is truer to Roman orthography and allows the student to look up 'iaceo' where it belongs, under 'i', rather than making up a letter, 'j', which was not part of the Roman alphabet.Those who have used Lewis and Short for a long time will of course find it difficult to give up their longtime companion. However, those who take the time to acquaint themselves with the first major attempt to improve on the nineteenth century classic, should find the OLD to be a more thorough and accessible guide to Latin of the 'Golden' and 'Silver' ages."},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Dictionary","review":"I'm afraid I cannot agree with those reviewers who underscore the excellence of this dictionary without any nuance. I'd like to point out that in the university where I'm not working at, in Belgium, many Latinists have in its desk the Lewis-Short, and when they need more detail they consult Forcellini or the Thesaurus Linguae Latinae. The OLD is of course extraordinary in what regards very rare words, and makes very good use of the evidence of papyri; nevertheless, when it comes to more or less usual words, its advantage over the Lewis-Short seems to be much thinner.Let me put it with some examples:You're reading Horace, and you come across this verse: \\"frigidas noctes non sine multis insomnis lacrimis agit\\". You doubt about what \\"agere\\" means here and you look it up in the OLD. Before coming across with the meaning number 34, subdivision b, (\\"34. To spend [one's life]; b [other periods of time]\\"), you'll have easily spent twenty minutes. Even worse: meaning 35 doesn't seem to be so palpably different from the one you've just read (\\"35. To live one's life\\"). There are yet more subdivision, that don't seem to add anything substantial: \\"35: (also transf., esp. of places). b (w. pred. adjs.). c (w. locality indicated).\\" The main concern of the OLD, here and in other entry, seems to be taxonomy and not meaning. The authores want to classify and sub-classify to an extent that makes the distinctions useless, and the dictionary bulkier than it should (this space could have been used to make the definitions themselves longer and clearer). On occasion, however, they warn the reader. In \\"postis\\", for instance, they make clear in the second meaning that \\"this sense is not always clearly distinguishable in the example from sense 1\\". This is doubtlessly true; they should have added that these shades are almost never \\"clearly distinguishable\\". But this is not the case of \\"postis\\" only; it happens in virtually every long entry, and in many of the shorter ones too. A previous reviewer commented extensively on how often two, three or even more different senses are assigned, when it would have been much more user-friendly to put all of these together. In many cases, this excessive subdivision is not just an excess of subtlety, but a mistake, for it aims at putting apart what for Latin writers, but also for us, is rightly felt as only one meaning.This is in my opinion the first problem: the obsession with classification, which is not even consistent in different parts of the dictionary (some words have much more sense than they reasonably should, as \\"ago\\", but some are just fine; I suspect that the first fascicules were much worse than the last ones, and \\"ago\\", of course, was already in the first fascicule).The second problem is that examples are abundant, but they are utterly separated from the meaning of the words; they even appear in a smaller font, as in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary. The problem is that, more often than not, this abundance of examples does not help you to see any clearer in the meaning of the word, because they are just an accumulation of instances when the same word is used, and, what is worse, often without any distinguishable shade of meaning. In the Liddell-Scott Greek Lexicon, examples are perfectly integrated with the discussion on the meaning of the word itself, and they always illuminate the meaning; they are never, ever gratuitous. In the OLD, examples seem to be there for its own sake.This leads to another questionable editorial decision: the actual space devoted to defining a word is very restricted. Take \\"nobilis\\": there are eight meanings, most of them with two or three sub-meanings, and yet all of these are exceedingly short; possibly some 200 words, all in all. Examples, on the other hand, are many: some 1000 words. I believe that examples are fundamental, but in a dictionary they should help illuminate the meaning of the word. Examples, on the other hand, are in 98 % of cases just thrown there, without any explanation whatever (which, again, is not the case in the Liddell-Scott). I seriously doubt many readers, however interested they may be in the meaning of the word in question, will browse twenty lines of Latin text, just to find the same shades time and again.In short, this was not what I expected when I bought the OLD. I had been reading a lot of Latin poetry with the Lewis-Short, and thought I would invest some money to have the last word in Latin dictionaries. Needless to say, I was let down. If you want to understand the Latin text, I believe the Lewis-Short is still more useful.It is also true that the OLD follows the latest lexicographical conventions, and has incorporated material from many sources absent in Lewis-Short. However, as regards the contents, it is difficult to assess if there has been any substantial progress. The proof that it has not simply superseded the Lewis-Short is that Oxford University Press, very sensibly, has not put the Lewis-Short out of press, and this is not, I believe, only because the Lewis-Short include some words from after 200 AD.Very beautiful, very useful dictionary. Be warned, though, that not everything is as bright as it looks, and that this dictionary is definitely not the gem of scholarship and usefulness the Greek Liddell-Scott is."},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Dictionary","review":"The Oxford Latin Dictionary is a very special dictionary.Yes, it is expensive.But I have found no ancient language dicitonary which can compare to it in terms of organization, clarity and fullness of example sentences.

If this acts as an obstacle, then you probably have not a need yet for this work; you may want to use Lewis' Elementary Latin Dictionary.

For such audiences the OLD is not a good value, as it goes far beyond what a beginner or a causal enthusiast requires and you may be overwhelmed with an excess of information. A more concise volume is much better suited to beginners and there are many such dictionaries available. For example, when I started studying Latin, I happily used the Bantam New College Latin & English Dictionary for several years, and I still use it when I need a dictionary I can toss into my laptop case.2) This dictionary is for classical Latinists. If you are primarily working with medieval/Christian Latin, or even authors from the later empire (post 200ish A.D.) you are better off with Lewis & Short.Neither of the above two points applies to me, and I truly adore this dictionary. If you belong to its target audience, I imagine you will too. This is one of the most beloved books in my library and I seldom go a day without using it.On a practical level, I appreciate the clarity of presentation and the readability of the type face. The quality of the printing is important, too: the pages are thin but sufficiently opaque, and there is no sickening chemical 'inky' smell to give me a headache, as with so many other modern books.From a scholarly perspective the book is even more worthwhile. The meanings given are accurate and precise. As for usage, the ability to quickly see the usage of each sense of each word in literary context via author excerpts is invaluable. I cannot count the number of times I have discovered a previously unknown point on etymology or an interesting parallel in usage because of this dictionary. The specificity and thoroughness of this dictionary are in all senses excellent.The price *is* hard to swallow, and I wanted this dictionary for a good while before I actually bought it. However, given the use I have gotten out of this dictionary and the time it has saved me, I cannot imagine I would regret owning it even at three times the price."},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Dictionary","review":"This tome (and it indeed _is_ a tome!) is a fine investment for those who are really, really deep into Latin (i.e., *very* serious scholars, translators, those pursuing a college degree in Latin, etc, etc.). For the majority of us mortals and casual dilettantes, the fabulous Oxford Latin Dictionary is superfluous and overkill (especially considering its price), in my opinion.Other publications, such as Cassell's Latin Dictionary, are excellent and are a very sufficient Latin reference for most. The latter features a great _English-Latin_ section as well! Of course, one might also consider various other volumes (for instance, Oxford's Elementary Latin Dictionary, and any number of abridged/condensed references..).If you insist on a Latin dictionary much more comprehensive than Cassell's, I suggest Oxford's \\"Lewis & Short\\" Latin dictionary. The latter has a broader scope than the OLD and is a hundred dollars cheaper, as well as being slightly more compact.Again, the great Oxford Latin Dictionary is a classic work and a wonderful accomplishment but is simply not the best choice for everyone, especially Latin neophytes and those merely desiring a handy and economical home library reference."},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Dictionary","review":"Oxford has a clear philosophy about dictionaries: they should be based on the philology: the study of the history of the words.

If I like a book, I will finish it in one or two evenings. I started this one on Monday and couldn't bring myself to pick it up again until Thursday. It didn't get any better, and I couldn't get motivated to finish it until the next Sunday night.Abby lives with her manic depressive sister, Mona. Abby has not had a steady girlfriend in years. Everyone she brings home eventually gets turned off because of Mona. After Mona \\"creatively\\" paints portions of several rooms (including woodwork) in their home, Abby hires Shirley to clean up the mess.

Sally understands the issues surrounding Mona and helps Abby move past many of them.Not only is the story not very believable, it's riddled with cliche.

At first, there is an introduction of the characters followed by a first action in which Drinkwater shows his fire as a military man. Then the characters and situations develop until there is a climactic battle that requires Drinkwater's unique skills for good to triumph over evil. The Corvette is somewhat of a departure from the established formula and the result is perhaps Woodman's finest entry since the first of the series.The Corvette finds Nathaniel Drinkwater recovered from wounds following a failed attack on Boulogne, an action that has occurred after events in The Bomb Vessel. Drinkwater is given command as a job-captain, a temporary position, to guard the Greenland whaling fleet. He must overcome hostility from the whalers and guard against French attempts to disrupt the vital whaling operation. The crew must be molded into a fighting force and elements overcome. All of these demands are suitable challenges for the skills of Nathaniel Drinkwater.Woodman has enriched The Corvette with a fascinating cast of characters. Tregembo and Mr. Q are back. We are also introduced to whalers some of whom are Quakers. In addition, Drinkwater provides passage for a Quaker missionary en route to Greenland. The Corvette features a marvelous discussion of theology between the learned Quaker and the more pragmatic fighting man Drinkwater. Although the discussion is set in the early 19th century, it is as relevant today as it was then. Also, the morality of killing such magnificent creatures as whales is briefly questioned, I suspect more as a nod to modern readers than to reflect historical accuracy. One great bit of dramatic tension is between the surgeon and Drinkwater. The surgeon sees Drinkwater as being responsible for the horrible slaughter. Drinkwater, while regretting the slaughter, sees it as unavoidable if homes and hearths are to be protected.The Corvette is first and foremost a sea story. Woodman continues to provide extensive details and even includes a sketch of a repair at sea. Unfortunately, Woodman does assume that the reader has a detailed knowledge of the hardware of sailing ships. If this novel were reprinted, the publisher would do well to include a glossary of terms and a sketch of the vessel. Like all books in the series, The Corvette has a map that shows where the action takes place. The details and problems of sailing in the arctic in wooden vessels are described well. On the other hand descriptions of clothing were sparse. In particular, I was curious to know if the sailors remained barefoot in the high arctic.I suspect that The Corvette was not the novel that Woodman set out to write. The raid on Boulogne and serious injuries after The Bomb Vessel all seem to be major events in the series. Perhaps the failed raid was intended as a precursor to The Corvette or it was intended to stand on its own. Whatever the intent, it appears that excluding the Boulogne action from the series led to The Corvette being different in structure than the earlier entries. The Corvette is a very effective change of pace.There is little violent action at the start of The Corvette, perhaps due to the missing Boulogne scenes, but Woodman skillfully builds up the tension until the climactic battle scenes that are some of his best. Woodman is particularly adept at describing the confusion of battle. The reader sees the battles from Drinkwater's eyes. Often it's hard to tell who is winning and who is losing. Perhaps that's part of Woodman's message, that everybody loses in war. Whatever the case, The Corvette is one of Woodman's finest entries in the Drinkwater series and well worth a reprint."},{"Title":"The Corvette","review":"This is book five in the Drinkwater series, and was a bit of a disappointment after some of the earlier books. Once again, the author skips forward. Book four, &quot;The Bomb Vessel,&quot; ended in July 1801 after the First Battle of Copenhagen. This book covers a relatively brief period from May to November 1803, falling into the tendency that Patrick O'Brien had in some of his later novels of putting a little too much action into too short a period of time (sometimes moving ships about the ocean at fantastic rates of speed).At the beginning of this story, we find Drinkwater on the beach, recovering from a wound received between novels. Admiral Jervis (now Earl St. Vincent and First Lord of the Admiralty) was known for promoting officers based on ability rather than interest, and he gives Drinkwater (now a commander) temporary command of the twenty-gun sloop Melusine after the ship's captain in incapacitated and resigns (why this would only be a temporary command is not entirely clear - Jervis had the authority to promote officers).Action finds Drinkwater guarding a whaling fleet in the Greenland Sea, dealing with French privateers and English renegades, and seeking a French base. There is considerable detail about the operation of the whaling fleet and the hazards involved in arctic whaling. John Nicol, in his autobiography, gave a brief description of a voyage on a whaling ship to the Greenland Sea, and noted his resolution not to make another.Like other novels in the series, characters in this novel carry over into the next."},{"Title":"The Corvette","review":"The book is in three parts, in the first of which Acting Captain Drinkwater must establish his leadership in a new command and lead a convoy of hard-bitten and angry whalers onto the Greenland whaling grounds. The second concerns the hunt for whales and, despite its misfortunes, how Drinkwater slips into a yacht cruise mentality. The third part returns us to the fact they are all at war with the French, who are rumored to have sent out corsairs during the false peace of 1802 to lay in wait and cripple the British economy when the world war resumed.I found this one of the most interesting in the series. For all the Napoleonic era novels out there, this contains the first discussion of whaling in the North Atlantic I recall (and only a few other series include the more familiar Pacific whalers). Also, Drinkwater essays humor on occasion, despite his author's rather grim prose and concern with political machinations. Drinkwater often struggles with scepticism and faith, God, and duty to the navy, abetted here by a pastor/surgeon who is philosophically inclined and by a righteously subversive whaling captain. Woodman describes the arctic well, but only occasionally does he evoke its beauty and terror. Pay very close attention to the beginning chapters for there are clues to anticipating a final mystery. If you understand sailing commands and constantly track the state of the wind through the story then all the ship maneuvers make sense; otherwise ignore them as nautical \\"period atmosphere\\" and be poorer for it.We get to hear more sail commands than usual, thanks to an insecure but punctilious 3rd lieutenant, and also learn in great detail the meaning of \\"jury-rigged.\\" What strange names some fictional captains have: Drinkwater, Hornblower-and quite the opposite of their true characters."},{"Title":"The Corvette","review":"Richard Woodman can be habit forming if you love stories from the days when men went down to the sea in ships that had clouds of sail on them and guns to run in and out of port holes when engaging the enemy. Having just finished this book, I felt compelled to embark on the next.Some have commented that Woodman writes with an authenticity that makes you understand what it is like to stand on a quarterdeck with an enemy bearing down on you with both ships set to loose broadsides upon each other, or to navigate in the Artic Sea, as Drinkwater does in this particular novel as he commands a captured French corvette while protecting English whale fishermen from the French who are known to have designs on the area.Edward R. Murrow, used to host a TV show, many moons ago, entited \\"You are There\\" where he would interview various people from history as though they were alive today. Woodman takes you there with his words and his writing and it is a very real trip indeed. You would be well advised to come on board."},{"Title":"The Corvette","review":"Nat is now elevated to Master & Commander and given Job-Captain cy in charge of a corvette as escort to a group of whalers bound for Greenland. As well as the usual excellent sail evolutions, there is wonderful description of below-decks life here, as well as incidental details (some qory) of whaling boats and the hunt.Several plots run together in this story; the threat of privateers; the differing agendas of the whalers; insubordination in the officers; and a pastor with a past. All are handled by a Captain who has matured as much as his author, in a way that has neither the bluffness of Jack Aubrey, nor the asperity of Hornblower.Excellent reading; but why can I not find Mr. Woodman on the average bookstore's shelves? *****"},{"Title":"The Corvette","review":"I've now read the first five books in the Nathaniel Drinkwater series and continue to be impressed with the author's command of the English language and his colorful characterizations.In reading these books I get a strong feeling of having been with Drinkwater on his adventures; such is the extent of Woodman's talent for description and characterization.Even minor characters are not neglected. For example, here's a quote from page 167 describing the gunner's reaction to an unusual order: \\"The gunner frowned, raised an eyebrow and compressed his toothless mouth. Then, without a word, knuckled his forehead and waddled below.\\"Gratuitous characterizations such as that demonstrate that Woodman misses no opportunity to animate his characters.Even though Drinkwater at this stage of his \\"life\\" is 40 years old and captain of a ship, the reader can sense that he's still learning how to be a good commander. He hurts from his old wounds and misses his wife and children. In other words, he seems real.I hate to compare Bernard Cornwell's Richard Sharpe books unfavorably to another author's series because the Sharpe books are entertaining, and I have read nearly all of them. But Sharpe is almost a cartoon character in comparison to Drinkwater. I often skip over much of the fighting scenes in Cornwell's books, but Woodman's power of description makes the fight scenes a pleasure to read.I expect to read the rest of Woodman's Drinkwater novels in chronological order."},{"Title":"Recollections of Rifleman Harris, (Soldiers' tales)","review":"This book is one of the classic Peninsular War recollections of the period. Harris was a devil-me-care lad of the English shires, who was first chosen by lot to join the English militia in 1806. Once in Ireland he becomes enamored of the green-jacketed 95th Rifles, Britian's new experimental Rifle corps, and decides to join them as a volunteer. The memoirs of Harris and many others like him were no doubt the inspiration for Bernard Cornwall's now famous &quot;Sharpe&quot; series. But Harris's work is certainly worth reading for its own merit, as it provides a vivid impression of what it was like to be a British soldier in the Napoleanic period. Unlike many of the memoirs of his compatriots, Harris only served for a brief time. He experinced Britian's initial efforts to support Spain in her rebellion against napolanic France's domination. As part of that early expedition, harris sees action at Rolica and Vimero (1808), and partakes in the grim retreat to Coruna (1809). He is thus privy only to the initial stages of what would become the Peninsular War in Spain (1808-1814) Harris's recolllections are vivid, but at times confused and lack chronology. This is reflective of the fact that he was a common ranker, and his level of education was somewhat less than many officiers. This does not detract from the value of his work; for Harris is in fact an amusing writer with an adroit sense of humor. He recollects his experinces as they come to mind, and the reader often feels as though he is seated right next to him relaying his stories as they come to mind. At times this can be confusing, and some knowledge of the period certainly helps in understanding the merits of this work. Christopher Hibbert has provided some valuable notes both in the introduction and within the body of the work, which adds greatly to it. Modern readers will certainly find Harris worthwhile, and with the recent interest sparked by the &quot;Sharpe series&quot;, will see how the real thing compares to the fictionalized character. Sharpe is most certainly part Harris, and the reader also gets an understaning of the 95th regiment as well. Worth having."},{"Title":"Recollections of Rifleman Harris, (Soldiers' tales)","review":"I agree almost entirely with the fine review written by Roger Kennedy. Just a few more points to add: (1) I think what sticks in my mind more than anything else are the horrific marches and the lack of medical care - the authors descriptions are all the more memorable for their off-handed understatement. (2) It's also an interesting recording of the social mores of the time - the author feels that the Lash is a necessity, and deplores the idea of having promotions done by merit rather than by noble birth.

I even sort of enjoyed it, though the treatment of Brenda and the racism in the book was jarring at times. Then I read the introduction. The best thing about this book is that years later, the author was slapped at an event by a female activist for his horrid portrayal of women in the book. For a man writing about a character who supposedly had sex with hundreds of white women and managed to get Brenda to sleep with him even after he let his friend try to rape her without interfering, this author seems to have neither respect for nor understanding of women."},{"Title":"Moses Ascending (Caribbean Writers Series)","review":"I have read Selvon's earlier work called The Lonely Londoners which was written 20 years earlier which introduced the main protagonist in this novel, the delightful Moses, a black immigrant from Trinidad. Moses has moved on and upwards in the 20 year gap and has become the owner of a property in Shepherds Bush. Moses occupies the top floor and rents the other rooms to a random assortment of other immigrants. Selvon writes with much humour and yet delivers alot of the undercurrent feelings as Black people were starting to become a political force. However, there are some serious flaws in the narrative. The account of the Asian tenant who is running an illegal immigrant smuggling racket is far fetched and Moses seems to be mindless of whether he is dealing with Muslims or Hindus. This book is very much a work of its time and there will be readers who find some of the novel potentially offensive: one character is called Paki, Moses asking for pork from a halal butcher and Selvon's treatment of Brenda, the only female character in the novel, is misogynistic. Notwithstanding these defects I enjoyed this engagingly funny and historically interesting account of Moses who tries to live apart from the day to day ramifications of life in London and live simply whilst writing his memoirs."},{"Title":"Moses Ascending (Caribbean Writers Series)","review":"This is a classic of postcolonial literature.

It had so much information on everything that I needed. It had information on mummies, life, and gods, and more all in this book. If it wasn't for this book I wouldn't be hear with a good grade."},{"Title":"How Would You Survive as an Ancient Egyptian?","review":"This book is an excellent children's book about the ancient Egyptian culture and would serve very well for homeschooling or independent study. The first dozen pages give a map and general overview of ancient Egypt and where it fits into history's timeline. Several following pages colorfully illustrate an Egyptian scene, ask intriguing questions about what's going on in the scene, and give page numbers for where the reader can turn to find the answers. The following pages are successive 1- to 2-page spreads that each delve more deeply into a specific facet of the culture (family structure, houses, clothing, careers, mummification, religioun, etc.) Each section uses excellent illustrations and attractive layouts to provide additional detail about that topic. Corners of the pages contain questions that lead the reader on to another 2-page topic spread.Cartoon-like series are used to explain successive steps or events such as the process of mummification, a day in the life of a particular type of person, or the farming year. Illustrations are colorful, interesting, and active. Nudity is illustrated in applicable situations (giving birth, bathing, dancing), but is done in a tactful, non-explicit and non-sexual manner. Thankfully, there is also no mention of some of the more child-inappropriate details of the myths and legends of ancient Egypt.There are several sections of varying detail within each page spread so it would be easy to assign beginning students smaller portions of the text, or assign specific topic spreads. This segmentation breaks the book up into something that may be easier and less intimidating for students who aren't avid readers. (Avid readers will probably devour the entire book at a sitting or two.)The final pages involve a \\"How Do We Know?\\" layout that explains how and when research was conducted, a \\"Have You Survived?\\" quiz, a glossary of terms, and a brief timeline that summarizes kingdoms and dynasties as well as particularly noteworthy events.I think this is an excellent resource for grade school and middle school students to learn more about ancient Egypt. It would also serve well as a broad but introductory review of the culture for high school students. It's one of a series of similar books which include other cultures such as Ancient Greece, Rome, and American Indians.

Do you feel that many of the claims and pronouncements made by social theorists (of any political disposition) are unjustified, but do not really know why you feel that way? If so, this book is a useful starting point for an examination of the problem.In it, Popper develops the argument that \\"Historicism\\" (the term has more than one meaning in different contexts) as he defines it is a flawed approach, and that it is not a justifiable base for the sweeping claims of the historicist. To Popper, historicism is the concept that, by examination of history, we are able to define the rules that govern social change and hence are able to predict those changes. His initial impetus to look into this area was a critical evaluation of Marx - see his essay \\"How I became a philosopher without really trying\\" published in \\"All life is problem solving\\".In its simplest form, Popper's argument is the observation that observation of the past does not allow one to accurately predict the future. This may seem to be a fairly obvious statement, but it is worth keeping in mind as he develops the various arguments that make up the case for and against historicism.Popper's philosophy is often overlooked, perhaps because he attempts to limit himself to goals that he can reasonably achieve. He is a very prominent figure in the philosophy of science, and much of his epistemology relates to the methodology of the empirical sciences, and hence to direct observation, and the relationship of observation to development and testing of theories. Perhaps because he is not too ambitious, his philosophy is less \\"sexy\\". It is, however, eminently reasonable, and avoids many of the great stumbling blocks of traditional Western philosophy - for example, the problem of induction and infinite regress.This book is non-technical, and is accessible to those with little formal philosophical training. It addresses the dominant paradigm in social engineering, and suggests why we may be unhappy with that paradigm."},{"Title":"The Poverty of Historicism (Routledge Classics)","review":"Sir Popper is considered one of the most important thinkers in the area of philosophy of science. \\"The Poverty of Historicism\\" despite its complexity, carries a fundamental simple message: prediction over the course of history (its social and economic implications) is nothing more than a fantasy, an illusion. And this assertion is based on the principle that the events/persons responsible for changes are themselves affected by these same changes. It is Heisenberg's principle of uncertainty applied to social sciences!Historicism is the theory that history develops itself according to pre-determined, inexorable laws with a fixed objective or end. Fascism and communism were laid upon these presuppositions, and the course fo history has proven the fallacy (therefore poverty) of such assumptions. The attempt to have a holistic approach by eliminating individual differences through \\"brain washing\\" is incompatible with critical thought, and although it will bring about a concentration of power it will also cause an erosion of knowledge. The Poverty of Historicism becomes a poverty of imagination, of the ability of critical judgement and analysis. Historicism, according to Karl Popper preposterously assumes the postion of having discovered the problem of \\"change,\\" but revolutions are not unique to our modern era and the metaphysical speculation of what constitutes \\"change\\" has been addressed since the time of Heraclitus.The goal of applying scientific methods with the same accuracy and predictability as those in theoretical physics is bound to end in failure when it concerns the course of history. The influence of the prediction upon the predicted events is here being termed as the \\"Oedipus effect.\\" Physics can arrive at universally valid uniformities, whereas sociology must be contented with the intuitive understanding of unique events, and of the role they play in particular situations, occuring within particular struggles of interests, tendencies and destinies. If sociological laws determine the degree of anything, they will do so only in very vague terms, and will permit, at the best, a very rough scaling.Karl Popper who was a fierce advocate of democrary and social critiscim, dedicated this book to all of those who have been victims to the fascist and communist belief in the inexorable laws of historical destiny."},{"Title":"The Poverty of Historicism (Routledge Classics)","review":"Karl Popper's book is an outstanding critique to what has become known as historicism, the belief that the future of society can be accurately predicted, and that history follows a fixed path towards a specific goal.This idea is mostly associated with two influential figures. The first is the German philosopher Hegel who produced a philosophy of history based on the tradition of philosophical idealism, and the other is Karl Marx, who, strongly influenced by Hegel, created the concept of the \\"materialistic conception of history\\", or as is commonly known today, dialectical materialism. In this concept, Marx laid out the theory that history is pre-determined to move towards its ending point, which is a classless, stateless, propertyless society he described as \\"communism\\". Marx believed that he had uncovered the scientific laws of history and thus could predict its development and its end. The main problem arises when such ideas escape the scientific community and are translated into political action. Hence Communism was driven by Marxist historicism, and other oppressive regimes, such as the Nazis, had a touch of racialist historicism in their ideology.One needs to understand that not all of what Marx and Hegel wrote was plain historicism, and their methods and theories have been adopted in various disciplines, based of course on their relevance. But this notion of a fixed historical road, or the idea that one can clearly predict the major events of the future, is what Karl Popper objects to. In this book, he explains with clear logic, that such ideas are unscientific, and should be included in the trash-can of pseudo science. Popper's argument is strong and to the point, demolishing the scientific and the logical basis that historicist theories claim to have. I strongly recommend this book, for it demolishes a branch of thought that has stayed way too long with us, and has caused, sometimes intentionally, but many times unintentionally, great harm to humanity."},{"Title":"The Poverty of Historicism (Routledge Classics)","review":"1. Historicism is a term that was invented by Karl Popper. He did it on purpose to prevent confusion with any other existing term.2. The book is about methodology of social science but of course most of the conclusions are about the nature of social science.3. He seeks to refute the two core arguments that are advanced to show that social science is not like science.4. The anti naturalist doctrine says social science is not like science because unlike in science we cannot really follow the hypothesis>experiment>conclusion> refinement of hypothesis cycle. Various reasons are offered for this such as being unable to experiment, complexity of social science (includes biology, psychology etc.), novelty (every situation is unique because of the \`uncertainty principle') and the fact that social experiments is not worth doing in a piecemeal fashion because their generalisability is very less.5. The naturalist doctrine on the other hand looks at social science as being similar to astronomy (global laws which explain everything about the universe and cannot be disobeyed or overturned no matter what we do) and says that laws of social science can be found. These laws are not accurate in the short term but work very well in the long term across periods of history and in fact are necessary to be able to make out the transition between different periods of stages of history as the deeper content of each of these stages cannot be known with accuracy. Also these laws can be solely understood by studying the history that is records of past events. These laws are called Holism by Popper and he shows that even in the anti naturalist doctrine holism is popular because it is used as a constant between the various stages of history (which in the short term cannot be analysed and predicted).6. The holism is central to historicism and leads to a position where in the short term we cannot do anything about social sciences in the manner of being able to rationally change and predict the consequences but in the long term we have to ensure that we are in tune with the tide of history as revealed by laws such which have roots in Plato's republic and the Marx's march of the proletariat etc. The only proactive thing we can do is to hasten the transition of various stages or change our values and beliefs to be in tune(Marx ...reduce the birthing pangs in contrast to his call to action of changing history rather than interpret it).7. So what will work according to Popper :a. In terms of experiments he suggests piecemeal engineering that is based on the scientific method. He says that scientific experiments may look on the surface easier to setup and control as compared to social experiments but this is because we are usually comparing a limited scope experiment to one on a large scale. If the scientific experiment was on the large scale as is expected in a social context it would be just as difficult.b. Also large scale social experiments such as centralised planning are actually not helpful in understating cause and effect because it is very hard to learn from very large failures .Specifically with respect to planning they cannot centralise knowledge and control all kinds of relationships. To get around this they use propaganda and fear which defeats the purpose of seeing whether planning works to better the society as it stood before the start of the \\"experiment\\".c. In a large scale social change recognise that often one can only offer interpretations based on various point of views(e.g. capitalist) and the starting conditions ( equivalent to initial conditions) as opposed try to come up with a set of unchanging laws that this large scale event seems to justify (e.g. Russian Revolution.d. He rejects the holism argument and march of history as he says that there are no laws of social science that can be gleaned by studying many separate events. There is just a trend and a trend has to be explained by multiple laws. The mistake of historicism is to see trends as laws.e. So even if these multiple laws were there they would not be that relevant because other than in fields such as theoretical physics ( law of gravity) the laws themselves act as background to solving a practical problem rather than being the cause of the practical problem (e.g. prediction of earthquakes in a place is not going to be found out by applying the law of gravity although any hypothesis must be consistent with gravity).f. So to solve these practical problems we can take the piecemeal engineering approach by formulating the hypothesis as negative statements ( e.g. progress in science cannot occur in a totalitarian regime). These can then be tested using the experimental approach.g. We should take a technological view of social science ( build a building to guard against a storm) as opposed to a theoretical view ( explain the occurrence of storms in a location over 30 years).h. The poverty of historicist is a poverty of imagination as it says that there cannot be a scientific approach to social science but at the same time there are absolute and unchanging laws - called essentialism on the lines of Plato's Republic (that only a few people understand ) which TODAY (this generation, this period in history where the historicist is) are operating far quicker than ever before because of the \\"pace of progress\\"."},{"Title":"The Poverty of Historicism (Routledge Classics)","review":"In this book, Karl Popper explains his vision on the course of history, on historical determinism, and on the theories of Descartes, Poincar&eacute; and Duhem.The course of historyFor K. Popper, evolution in history is never dominated by theories, although they may exert some influence, at the same time many other less rational or even completely irrational factors are at work.Historicism (Engels, Marx, Spencer, J.S. Mill, K. Mannheim)Historicism is that part of social sciences which considers historical predictions as its main objective. It pretends that this goal can be achieved if we discover the 'laws' or 'trends' that underlie historical developments.Karl Popper rejects this approach for the following reasons: the course of human history depends heavily on the increase of human knowledge. We can not rationally or scientifically predict this increase. So, we can not determine the future course of history. Developing a theoretical history which is the equivalent of theoretical physics, is impossible.Descartes, Poincar&eacute;, Duhem, essentialismFor Descartes, the principles and premises of deductive systems must be certain ('clear and distinct'). For K. Popper, these principles are only provisory, are only hypotheses. Popper does not agree either with Poincar&eacute; and Duhem, for which some systems may not be subjected to empirical tests. A world of universals (essentialism) doesn't exist, only a world of real objects (nominalism).Popper's proposition of piecemeal adjustments (not revolutions) in the social sphere has been heavily criticized. One critic even asked how a HIV plague can be attacked by piecemeal interventions. But, in fact, the HIV plague was attacked in a piecemeal manner; first by individual drugs, then by cocktails.This defense of indeterminism is a must for all historians and for all Popper fans.The best introduction to Popper's philosophy is Bryan Magee's \`Philosophy and the Real World. An Introduction to Karl Popper'."},{"Title":"The Poverty of Historicism (Routledge Classics)","review":"The Poverty of Historicism refuted the major arguments which propped up the myth of historical determinism, possibly the most damaging myth of modern times. It is a neglected classic because it was overshadowed by The Open Society and its Enemies which was published in 1945 while The Poverty did not appear in book form until 1957.In the context of Popper's lifetime achievement it is the work where he first developed the ideas of institutional analysis and the logic of the situation which, in alliance with work by Talcott Parsons and Ludwig von Mises, could have changed the direction of economics and the other social sciences after WW2.The Poverty of Historicism is a short book on the methods of the social sciences and social reform. It appeared as a series of three journal articles in the 1940s and in book form in 1957.Popper's aim in this work was to transform the social sciences in the same way that he transformed the philosophy of the natural sciences in Logik der Forschung (1935). This had a moral and political purpose because he believed that defective methods in the social sciences had contributed to the rise of fascism and communism. The book is dedicated to the victims of these movements.He wanted the social sciences to develop a body of knowledge to enable social reforms to deliver peace, freedom and prosperity in the way that the natural sciences and technology increased the productive capacity of the earth. This knowledge and the kind of piecemeal reforms that he advocated would be subject to abuse, like science and technology, but not nearly as much as grand schemes driven by dictators or \\"philosopher kings\\" who believe that \\"history is on our side\\".A Window of OpportunityDuring the 1930s three men worked on the same problems in the social sciences and they came up with practically the same solutions. The American Talcott Parsons wrote The Structure of Social Action (1937). Ludwig von Mises worked for the Austrian government during the day and in the evenings he worked on \\"The Fundamental Problems of Political Economy\\". Human Action, his masterwork, appeared in German in 1940 and in English in 1949. Not far away in Vienna Karl Popper worked on \\"The Fundamental Problems of Epistemology\\" after teaching science and mathematics in school. Logik der Forschung appeared in 1935 and then he turned his attention to the social sciences. The results were The Poverty of Historicism and The Open Society and its Enemies (1945), both completed in New Zealand during the war.All three men offered a framework for the study of economics and the other human sciences which could have:Maintained sociology and economics as an integrated discipline.Sponsored partnerships between economists and students of all social institutions - law, politics, literature, religion and cultural studies at large.Ensured that \\"high theory\\" and empirical studies informed, enriched and corrected each other.Contributed to good public policy, especially by monitoring the results of increased regulation and intervention by Big Government and the impact of the erosion of \\"civic virtues\\". This work could have commenced when the role of government was much smaller and less entrenched.The common elements in their schemes could have either prevented some of the unhelpful developments in economics since WW2 or at least promoted more helpful alternative research programs. The unhelpful developments include over-specialization, neglect of historical studies, excessive formalism to describe unreal systems that do not exist on earth (general systems theory and mathematical welfare economics), inappropriate aggregation of data (Keynesian demand analysis and econometrics).There was a window of opportunity for these three leading figures in their respective fields, plus their followers, to form a united front across the disciplines of sociology, economics and philosophy to promote the ideas that they shared and to debate the views that they did not share.This did not happen. The published works of Popper and Parsons contain no references to the other parties. No reader of von Mises would be moved to read the work of the other two. So there was no united front across the three disciplines.After 1937 Parsons turned to general systems theory and a form of functional analysis of society that made no contact with the interests of von Mises in economics. They were also ideologically poles apart. After the war Popper returned to his main interests in logic and physics. He only made spasmodic contributions to the methods of the social sciences, including a significant paper on situational analysis and the Rationality Principle.The fertility of the approach is demonstrated by several programs, notably the work by Jarvie and Agassi in social science, Jack Birner, Boland and Wong in economics, some work by Burgess and others on education in Britain, North's work, the Virginia School of public choice theory, and the interdisciplinary studies in the Economics School and related research groups at the George Mason University."},{"Title":"The Poverty of Historicism (Routledge Classics)","review":"Popper's argument here and his general view are somewhat surprisingly in synch with that of American Pragmatic philosophy. Elements of surprise, of creative newness are what for Pragmatists make the human future, history itself as a whole fundamentally unpredictable. Popper argues in this work that total theories such as Marxism which claim to contain within themselves the true course and outcome of history, are by their very nature, mistaken. A total predictability of history is impossible in part because the prediction itself effects the actors, but also because of unseen, and unforeseeable elements which come with our always imperfect knowledge. The position taken here by Popper is in consonance with his own defense of the Open Society, and human freedom- other major elements of his thought.Popper sees here a fundamental truth of the human situation."},{"Title":"The Poverty of Historicism (Routledge Classics)","review":"For Popper's fans, this is a great reading.

So thats why this book was interesting to me."},{"Title":"Freedom, Modernity and Islam: Toward a Creative Synthesis (Modern Intellectual and Political History of the Middle East)","review":"If you want to read just one book to find out why many Westerners feel that their lives are empty and why the Muslim world languishes in backwardness and repression, I recommend that you read this one.As I was reading the book, I remembered two close friends. One is Pakistani elder statesman Mahmud Ali, who laughs when he watches George W. Bush getting excited about the blessings of American \\"freedom.\\" The other is Ayyub Malik, an architect and writer in London, who would hang every Muslim \\"fundamentalist\\" for blocking Islamic reforms.During a phone conversation from Islamabad, Mahmud Ali said the Americans spent two years and hundreds of millions of dollars to pick a president and they \\"ended up with Bush, who needs to be sent back to school to learn English.\\" In the United States, he continued, the family, the church and ethnic and neighborhood communities have unraveled and old folks are \\"rotting and dying in loneliness at nursing homes.\\" Bush extols freedom in America because he doesn't know the quality of life of a typical \\"Punjabi farmer\\" who lives on a modest income surrounded by his children, grandchildren and kin groups and is devoted to the affairs of his mosque and spiritual order (tariqat).The Pakistani statesman was echoing a main theme of Freedom, Modernity and Islam. The Westerner is free to do anything he wants, but there may not be a lot he really wants to do. His freedom doesn't necessarily bring him happiness. Social breakdown, anomie and a lack of appreciation of non-material values have rinsed Western life of much of its meaning. A Wal-Mart cashier may be working two jobs to make ends meet and may not have a family or friends around. What can he do with his \\"free\\" time to be truly happy?Author Richard Khuri is a philosopher who grew up in Lebanon and lives in the United States, and he belongs to the rare breed of intellectuals who have intimately known both Islamic and Western civilizations. He's troubled to see freedom \\"shrink\\" in the West and is suppressed in the Muslim world.Khuri traces the degeneration of freedom in the West to Enlightenment philosophes, especially Rene Descartes, who argued that in order for man to be happy, he should follow the dictates of reason unencumbered by a priority beliefs, morality, intuition or experience. What these thinkers didn't realize, says Khuri, is that \\"reason is always guided by something else, be it our moral and social ends or, within science ... aesthetic or metaphysical bases.\\" (p. XXIX)The \\"sovereign\\" Cartesian reason was reduced to technology, which spurred industrial capitalism. Industrialism degenerated into exploitative market economy, which has unglued the family and civil society and narrowed the space of freedom available to our Wal-Mart cashier. Khuri calls this \\"negative freedom,\\" which fails to tap the sources of deeper meaning and happiness.\\"The negative sense of freedom,\\" he explains, \\"is that in which we emphasize our freedom to choose, whether among trivial or serious matters, and the opportunity we are given to do so through lack of interference from the authorities. The positive sense of freedom is that in which we emphasize the quality of our choice and what we do with the opportunity we are given, the transcendent root of freedom, and freedom itself as meaningful expansiveness in a boundless world.\\" (p. 81)Freedom can gain that \\"meaningful expansiveness\\" only when reason draws on human sensitivity, experience and morality and faith.Muslim societies do provide rich resources for \\"positive freedom\\" inherent in Muslims' belief system and ethnic and religious communities (partly because those resources are not eroded by modernity).Man needs, however, \\"negative freedom\\" as well to live a meaningful life, which is lacking in most Muslim societies. Mahmud Ali's Punjabi farmer isn't quite free to question the interpretation of Islam by the local Sunni establishment. Punjabi customs would require him to pick a husband for his daughter, who cannot initiate a divorce even if that husband oppresses her. Pakistan is under the rule of an army general, and our farmer has little say over how his country is governed. Partly because of this absence of \\"negative freedom,\\" the line of visa applicants at the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad spans a quarter-mile.Khuri emphasizes, rightly, that Muslim societies need religious, social and political reforms to slacken the barriers that stifle Muslim thinking and creativity. He mentions the failure of epistemological, religious, spiritual and political movements to expand the scope Muslim freedom. The fundamentalists represent the most visible among the contemporary movements for Islamic renewal.He also points out that Islamic fundamentalism is an intolerant, \\"oversimplified\\" school of thought, \\"which is incapable of absorbing the subtleties and pluralism that Islam had long cultivated.\\" (p. 261) And he calls on Muslims to shed their \\"defensive posture,\\" characteristic of fundamentalism, and tap their \\"spiritual roots\\" through \\"individual choice\\" to revitalize their faith and civilization.I tend to disagree with him and with my friend Ayyub Malik on this point. For all the virtues of pluralism, I'm not sure that Islam, or any other society or civilization, can be revitalized by pluralist reformers. Historically, social and religious movements have been spearheaded by revolutionaries who show little tolerance for dissent. Pluralism sets in once a society has settled down. In the United States, the Puritans didn't certainly entertain religious pluralism, and Catholics, Jews and African Americans were mistreated and discriminated against for a long time.Having observed Muslim youth activism on three continents, I believe that many Muslim societies are ripe for renewal. And I see Islamic fundamentalists blazing the trail.In any case, Richard Khuri has done a superb job of spotlighting what ails Western and Muslim societies and how they may be reformed. Everyone interested in contemporary human condition in the two civilizations ought to read Freedom, Modernity and Islam.Mustafa MalikCheverly, Md."},{"Title":"Freedom, Modernity and Islam: Toward a Creative Synthesis (Modern Intellectual and Political History of the Middle East)","review":"Richard Khuri's book is great because it makes you think. In terms of what it discusses about freedom in the Muslim-Arab World, it is especially pertinent now - what with the recent movements for democracy in north Africa/Middle East. His most important and vital of questions is when he asks: \`what is the quality of the freedom that has been won?' When we struggle for freedom and after we get it - what is it that we've actually got?His book examines modernity, by drawing attention to the dangers of a (reductionist) mechanistic rationality without restraint, and refers to the reflections of leading contemporary physicists, including Stephen Hawkins; he also discusses J. Habemas' ideas of subjectivity and reason: the nature of freedom has been delimited by the very way we think about the \`subject'. His book discusses positive and negative freedom; on notions of the \`enabling community' versus a fragmented (selfish) one; he also looks at how freedom has been conceived by Ibn Taymiyya, Al Ghazali and Ibn Arabi; in his investigation of unfreedom in the Arab-Muslim world, Khuri explains that within the three said scholars are both the locks and keys towards greater freedom. Khuri closes his book with an account of the routes to freedom currently discoursed from the \`scholarly heralds' (citing the ideas of S. H. Nasr, F. Rahman and M. Arkoun) and the \`mystical heralds' (citing M. Iqbal and B. S. Nursi).This is a great starting point for someone wanting to get their feet dirty in intellectual ideas about Freedom, Modernity and Islam. It is written in a clear style, which is not overly dense or complex for the novice, but it does have a more academic tone rather than a 'popular' one. Regardless, this was a fantastic read!"},{"Title":"Complete Dykes to Watch Out For, Volume One","review":"I feel as if Dykes to Watch Out For is the original L Word.

I purchased the hardbound version sometime during 1995-96 and paid at most $30 for it, more likely $25. The book's evidently got some connection to all three of Chapman & Hall/CRC, Wiley, and Springer: My copy says \\"Chapman & Hall: New York, London\\" on the (fifth edition) cover page. A brief check of Wikipedia's Chapman & Hall page shows that they were owned by Thomson Scientific in 1992. In 1998 ownership passed to CRC Press. In 2003 CRC was purchased by Taylor & Francis (which was purchased by Informa in 2004). The Chapman & Hall/CRC name lives on as an imprint of T&F.; On the copyright page of my copy, Van Nostrand Reinhold is listed as the rights holder. Wikipedia's Van Nostrand-Reinhold page redirects to John Wiley & Sons. This Amazon page says the book is published by Springer.Somehow I suspect this long and varied list has something to do with the stupid (in the wrong direction) price. I could see maybe $60 tops due to inflation. The problem may partly be that math dictionaries (even as good as this one is) have become all but obsolete with the emergence of free online reference sites like Wikipedia and MathWorld.

I first used the third edition and being duly impressed, I purchased the fourth and later this edition. Although, there are really only modest changes between editions. Definitions are accurate, concise, and perhaps most importantly clear, and there is broad coverage of classical undergraduate mathematical areas. However, owing to its age, mathematical topics that have risen in importance in modern times, e.g., cryptography, discrete mathematics, etc. have relatively minimal coverage. Although I have a variety of other mathematical dictionaries and handbooks, when I need the definition of a traditional mathematical term or concept, this is still the dictionary I prefer.In addition to the standard entries, the dictionary provides excellent appendices for the translation of mathematical terms from French, German, Russian, and Spanish into English. It also provides appendices of mathematical symbols used in a variety of mathematical disciplines. Highly recommended of its coverage of classical mathematical topics, but will need supplementation if your current needs include more recent areas of mathematical interest."},{"Title":"Squizzy the Black Squirrel: A Fabulous Fable of Friendship","review":"I bought Squizzy the Black Squirrel for my 8-year-old niece.

Marcus wonders how will he make a newfriend when he sees the same kids all the time.One day while playing, Marcus sees a black squirrel. He tries to befriendthe squirrel but the squirrel keeps running away. One day Marcus and thesquirrel talk. Marcus tells the squirrel that he has never seen a blackone. The squirrel does not know what black means and reminds Marcus he is just a squirrel.After much discussion about squirrels and their color and the correlation topeople and their color, Marcus comes to the conclusion that using color to describea friend is silly.The illustrations are beautiful and the close-up features of Marcus andSquizzy are beautifully detailed. The rest of the illustrations support the textand are well done but the story itself is weak. The concept of being a friend tosomeone regardless of color is a good one. While squirrels will play with each otherregardless of color, in a color-conscious society like America, most people socialize withpeople of the same ethnic group, or people with similar backgrounds or interests.We describe people by their color or other physical feature. We also describe animals by their colors, too.Thus, when Marcus tells Squizzy that he is black, Marcus is naturally describing Squizzy. It is not offensive or negative. It is a statement of fact. Is this statement worth a story built around it? I'm not sure.However, if the author wanted to make a point about befriending someone who is different, he somewhat succeeded. Marcus, a boy, befriending Squizzy, a squirrel, is different.

Multiple readings will only raise more questions, and/or cause you to rethink the conclusions you've previously thought solid. Merely for the fact that this is a book that makes one think and ponder and consider, it is a great book.The basic story is that of a WWII bomber crewman shot down over Tokyo immediately prior to the great firebomb raids of Spring 1945. He is utterly alone on a hostile foreign island, likely listed as missing, presumed dead, with the book's opening pages promising a superior adventure as our protagonist struggles to stay alive and eventually repatriate. But, as the story matures and we gradually learn more about Muldrow, we see that repatriation has been only a fleeting inspiration. Mudrow has been freed, and he pushes north toward a place that is much more imagined than real.As he struggles north Muldrow changes from serviceman to fugitive, from survivor to predator, from endangered hero to questionable protagonist to a perplexing and difficult-to-like principal character. To my reading, Muldrow is an unpredictable, dangerous psychotic, with only the regimen and discipline of societal interaction and military service having kept him in check during brief periods of his life. When in his element, out in the wilderness relying only upon himself, he is a nation unto himself, free to make any choice which suits his needs and his whims. We see it in the flashbacks to Alaska, and we see it in his maniacal odyssey to Hokkaido and the White Sea, and to a mental and physical place which of course does not exist.In the end where does Muldrow go? This is as debatable as the nature of his character, the origins of his actions and thoughts, and his motivations. Dickey takes us from a strong, pulsing adventure narrative in the opening pages to a lyrical, poetic, almost mythical climax as Muldrow finally dies/transforms/transcends. It is a fascinating transformation for the character, for the narrative, and for the experience of the reader. I wholeheartedly recommend this riveting, expertly written book."},{"Title":"To the White Sea","review":"I had the rare honor of a long telephone conversation with James Dickey 12 months before his untimely death. We talked about &quot;To the White Sea&quot; and the novel I was working on &quot;Greif&quot;. James was busy writing the screen play for the novel, which I hope his daughter will finish. When I first read it I was sucked in, shocked, stomped and emotionaly drained. Here we have a novel written in the first person which is essentially some of Dickey's best poetry. At the same time Dickey places the reader squarely into the mind of a serial killer (Muldrow) who has the entire Japanese Home Army tracking him down. They are faced with &quot;Muldrow's&quot; ultimate camouflage! Himself! A wild human being hunting other human beings with absolutely no conscience or feeling for his victims. The reader will, at first, cheer on Muldrow! But as Dickey begins to work on your mind, you feel a chill up your back as he takes you on a wild ride that seems to have no end. I discribed my experiences in Alaska exploring the Brooks Range to Dickey, who merely chuckled. I had the impression this consummate Southern Gentleman had an unreal grasp of those desolate wind swept and COLD plains. COLD IS THE WORD THAT BEST DESCRIBES 'TO THE WHITE SEA'."},{"Title":"To the White Sea","review":"I read this due to the fact that I heard that the Coen Brothers were making it into a movie -- although I've read that this is no longer the case. In any event, this was my first Dickey novel and I have to say that all in all, I was very satisfied with the effort. The prose is interesting, lush and vivid in some parts and caustic in others. Some of the other reviewers seemed to be appalled at the plot and the surgical sterility that Dickey used to describe the deaths inflicted by the main character, but I found those exact things to be quite within the realm of believability, especially when the whole idea of the book is to survive like an animal behind enemy lines.I liked the book enough to want to go back and read more of Dickey's other works..."},{"Title":"To the White Sea","review":"An unforgettable, hypnotic meditation on survival and finding peace among chaos.

Based on the book's appearance on that list, I was greatly surprised by the content of this book; it was less a war novel than it was a story of a man in a crisis.As has already been said, it is a novel of an aviator shot down during a WWII bombing raid over Tokyo, and his story of survival. The novel has a single narrative and a single voice (the protagonist's), and no chapters. One story-line, one voice, and one long chapter has the potential for tedium, yet I found the novel to be gripping and excellent.Dickey's character doesn't really tell you what is happening to him, but relies on an indirectness to tell the tale. You don't so much get the action, rather you get the effect. You don't read the words of this novel; you just sort of take in the pages.As the story unfolds, the character's traits, flaws, and past transgressions seep out. It is a novel way to get to know a character. While this book moved slowly at time, and wasn't the war novel I thought it was, I really enjoyed it and would recommend it.

It's a masterful piece of story-telling, for sure, but much more: a complex portrait of a serial killer which is also remarkable lyric poetry. It's this juxtaposition which is so disturbing: a cold-blooded killer with the mind of a poet. Dickey's ability to &quot;paint with words&quot; is incredible. I don't know what else I can add to what other reviewers have already said. I was disappointed to discover (as I should have expected) that this novel is probably going to be made into a movie. No, no no! I don't care who does it or how good it supposedly is; it can't achieve what the novel did, which is told in the first person. Why, oh why, can't Hollywood leave this one alone? In any case, read the book by all means. I haven't read anything that caught my attention like this one did in a long time."},{"Title":"To the White Sea","review":"This review is of both the hardback edition, read in 1993 and the unabridged tape edition, listened to recently. Dick Hill's reading is awe inspiring, especially the nuance given by correct pronunciation of Eskimo words. I realize that when I read to myself, I projected more than was warranted. Mr. Hill provided reality to the character I never would have thought to create. The depth of the book seems too great to easily fathom. After having read the book once and listened to the tapes three times, I still do not know the answers to the following questions:1. Is Muldrow's fictional experience &quot;real&quot;, or is it a Jacobs Ladder-like confabulation? 2. Does it matter? The exact details and narratives of conversations, talks by &quot;the colonel&quot; and Major Sorbo's command remarks certainly made me feel that this is intended to be a narrative of events through which Muldrow lived. The experience in the aircraft rings realistic, and the bailout seemed authentic as did the description of actual events in the firebomb raid of March 9-10, 1945, superimposed upon the one-day stay in the sewer pipe.But, little details sort of collect in the back of the mind as the adventure unfolds. Doubts about the &quot;reality&quot; of the experiences rushed in upon the description of Hokkaido as an arctic-like landscape with snowdrifts available for spear-throwing practice. The apparent sequence of events, though a bit vague, would have put Muldrow up there no earlier than very late April or early May, 1945. Maybe Hokkaido is like that, but my guess is no, since its latitude, although is about that of Oregon. But, maybe Muldrow stayed with the tribe longer than he lets on; it began snowing as he left, or maybe Muldrow forgot to let us know that he had really made it as far north as Sakhalin or Siberia and he really finally was tracked down by some army in winter, 1947 or so; which is maybe what does him in as the book ends? Dickey seems to have salted these small inconsistencies within the text to evoke doubts. Muldrow's story about why he went to the lower-48 to enlist so as not to get drafted doesn't make sense, either-they never could have found him, much less drafted him from back in those mountains, given the way he lived, hunted, tracked, never went to school, etc. People must have noticed that the Kansas girl never got back to Kansas. Dickey is setting out for us and for our critical examination, Muldrow's subjective and, perhaps self-serving, consciousness. Of course, Muldrow continues to speak to us after his death, but that seems OK, too.There are little inconsistencies, which Dickey sprinkles into the text, between Muldrow's recollection of events from one part of the book to a later sequence, such as an expanding impact of the candle-glint off the bread knife on the family having dinner; changes of emotion on recollection of the sound of the calving glacier, and other details. These changes over the course of the events in the book, raise doubts as to the Muldrow's truthfulness as to all or any of them.Everybody seems to end up dead. His mother, his father, the Kansas Girl, (I worry, too, about Tor Nar Suk) the Ainu hunter, the old falconer of the &quot;shack/shed/hut&quot;, as well as those unfortunates who happened to be in the wrong place when he passed through. &quot;I laid on the bear skin as I would have laid on the bear; if he had loved me.&quot;The US did not have to endure a &quot;Nuremberg&quot;, but this book convicts it of a war crime. The &quot;colonel's&quot; briefing on March 8, 1945 proves his and US guilt of Geneva Convention violations to a logical certainty for the March 9-10 firebomb raid. Muldrow became a deserter upon his formulating the intent to stay away from the Army permanently on the second or third day of his trek through the terraces north of Tokyo, so his killings of civilians are simply murder, according to law. But law doesn't apply to the situation which Dickey portrays. The circumstances for Muldrow are beyond any reflective judgment. Dickey makes it unmistakable that what Muldrow faced took him outside any civilization; the briefings about prisoner of war abuse and especially the beheading of the airman seen from the hill above the airfield excuse conformity to social constructs regarding behavior.I glean that Muldrow is one-half Eskimo or Indian. His repeatedly expressed denials that he looked anything like the Japs are too strident, and his descriptions of himself show that he was close enough to a Japanese appearance to get by. His narratives of the effect of alcohol hint at native heritage as well. He may have suffered unspeakable abuse in the cabin on the Brooks Range. His mother's people must not have wanted him, and his father took him in, perhaps reluctantly. Such experience reportedly creates killers. A serial killer may be the only person who could have survived for long enough for a story in these circumstances to come into existence.This leads me to worry that maybe he was killed just trying to get out of the gantry cab after sleeping too long and dreaming of the white buffalo before much really happened and that we have read the creation of his extremis. But, on the other hand, no?Are there any scholarly treatments of this work known, such as theses or other reviews by philosophers or literary professors? I'd like to know if my take on this book; that it is an important work on ethics, is shared by anyone else."},{"Title":"To the White Sea","review":"This a beautifully written and perplexing book. Muldrow is a complicated protagonist/antagonist - arrogant and condescending but a pure professional. He is obsessive about his equipment, from his twin .50's on the B-29 to his customized bread knife. Dickey does an excellent job of bringing you into Muldrow's mind before putting him into crisis. Upon being shot down in Japan, Muldrow begins a slow but unstoppable transformation from a warrior behind enemy lines to behavior that is really more savage than predatory. Muldrow kills to survive and escape, but as his journey north gains momentum, his self-justification for each kill gets thinner and thinner until Muldrow drops any pretense of humanity. The novel's primary accomplishment is how Dickey slowly turns up the heat on the reader until the very last sentence. We all go along for the ride with Muldrow and each sane reader, even the most battle-hardened, will want to get out at some point. But you can't.The prose in this book reminds you that a poet laureate wrote it. For all his violence, Muldrow is very sensitive to animals and some of his musings on nature possess their own beauty. It is these sentiments that make him so compelling and, despite his murderous behavior, morally ambiguous. What kind of creature can feel so deeply and still be so destructive? Dickey's answer is the human being."},{"Title":"To the White Sea","review":"Narrated entirely in the first person, the reader of the audio version is superb. He IS the &quot;hero.&quot; He delivers Dickey's poetry in a voice that is both mesmerizing and believable. You listen to this man's words and you will never, never forget him, his story or the sound of &quot;his&quot; voice. I listened to this book while on an exercise bike and was totally absorbed for the entire 9 hours (obviously in 1-hour segments!) It helps is you are old enought to remember World War II, but not essential."},{"Title":"To the White Sea","review":"I've been listening to the book on tape after having read it several years ago. It is brilliant either way. I'll keep this review short. Dickey's use of language is phenomenal. The recurring themes of camoflage and eyes are chilling. This book does an exceptional job of capturing a man's descent into paranoid schizophrenia, all in the first person perspective. He is not a serial killing in the way that term is usually applied. The main character begins the book as a tightly wound, somewhat paranoid character, but as the plot unfolds and he has no structure or familiar reality to ground him, he begins to decompensate. The book is harsh and disturbing ... and utterly brilliant and compelling."},{"Title":"To the White Sea","review":"If you are a fan of the more popular war writer, Tim O'Brien, I think you will particularly enjoy this book. Like a lot of O'Brien's work, Dickey's story is a mixture of flashbacks amidst a harsh war reality that is hard to cope with. Unlike, Dickey's Deliverance (another fantastic book), this book doesn't have a lot of interesting side characters--the main character is on a solo trip behind enemy lines, killing without remorse and sinking deeper and deeper into his thoughts and memories of the wilds of Alaska. Where this book does share with &quot;Deliverance&quot; is a great understanding of nature and how man 'reverts' back to instincts shared with other predators and prey in the animal world when placed in a survival situation. I really enjoyed this book--the language is beautiful and even if it is often hard to be sympathetic to the main character because of his violence, we can understand his state of mind."},{"Title":"To the White Sea","review":"This is the story of a serial killer, who just happens to be a WWII airman shot down over Japan in the closing days of the war. Dickey excels at painting our &quot;hero's&quot; surroundings and does a nice job of profiling a man you don't want living in your neighborhood. A pretty good read for &quot;Deliverance&quot; fans....may seem bizarre to others. This was my reading material on a flight from Australia to the U.S. and it got me from Point A to Point B"},{"Title":"To the White Sea","review":"The basic story is that of a WWII bomber crewman shot down over Tokyo immediately prior to the great firebomb raids at the end of the war. He is alone in enemy territory. We follow our tail-gunner as he plans to escape Tokyo during the confusion of the upcoming firebomb raid the following night. We watch him as he struggles to stay alive with his only goal to keep moving north. To the ice regions like his home in Alaska, where he feels he will be safe. We are given many glimpses into the thoughts of our crewman as he tries to survive. The ending of the book we have our main charcter sort of at home with his surroundings and he seems to accept his fate at the end. I did find this a bit of a slow read. And therefore rated it 3 instead of 4 stars."},{"Title":"To the White Sea","review":"At first this seems like the story of a resourceful US aviator shot down over Japan near the end of World War 2. He manages to avoid capture on his way out of Tokyo mostly because the Japanese never seem to look at him; they are too busy deferently looking down at the ground. So Muldrow escapes from Tokyo and makes his way northward to Hokkaido. At first his killings of civilians along the way seem necessary for his escape and to provide the clothes necessary to prevent recognition and capture. But then he commits several unnecessary murders. He cuts off a woman's head and puts it on a water wheel. Later he enters a home at night and kills the elderly occupants---even though the man has a samurai sword. He then sleeps the night in the house and sews a set of winter clothes for his northward trek, never concerned that someone would come to the house looking for the occupants. Later, after reaching Hokkaido, he kills the man who helped him and who sheltered him in his village. By then it is pretty clear that Muldrow has either become deranged by his flight or was deranged to begin with. Never do we get the impression that the Japanese army or even civilians are on his trail, yet the ending seems to have a company of men finally coming upon Muldrow at the end and killing him.There is a lot going on here, psychologically. It's very poetically and lyrically written. But I think that most Japanese readers would not enjoy it. Indeed, it is not a book to be read for enjoyment."},{"Title":"To the White Sea","review":"There are hints in this book that the protagonist may have been a serial killer in his previous life before being shot down over Japan. For instance, he briefly mentions a \\"college student\\" that he may have killed back in Alaska. Is there the implication that the skills and attitude needed to make his way from Tokyo to Hokkaido, living off the land, were molded in his previous existence as a \\"hunter\\" in Alaska ?"},{"Title":"To the White Sea","review":"Reports are Joel &amp; Ethan Coen are working on a film version of this book to follow their next feature &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;. Supposedly save for the first 5 minutes, it will be completely sans dialogue."},{"Title":"To the White Sea","review":"This tale will both excite and disturb a thoughtful reader. Muldrow is not quite your average man and he certainly reacts quite differently. Or does he?As the story unfolds you find yourself facing the tension and stress that Muldrow is experiencing. Yet, to become Muldrow is to confront the price one is willing to pay for survival. Is life itself worth the price of becoming Muldrow?"},{"Title":"To the White Sea","review":"I'm about half way through this novel, and while the main character and the situation he finds himself in are intriguing, I'm a bit disappointed by how slow the story moves. Being inside the protagonist's head shouldn't mean we need to follow every fleeting and repetitive thought that goes through it, does it? I have no doubt I'll finish this book and be satisfied with it in the end, but it won't be without a fair amount of effort. Call me a philistine, but I want a book to draw me in, not challenge me to stay engaged."},{"Title":"To the White Sea","review":"I knew James Dickey at the University of South Carlolina, and I later spent 14 years living in the interior of Alaska. His last novel is a stunning achievement, missed utterly by anyone hoping for &quot;Hogan's Heroes.&quot; Critics who wrote at the time that the protagonist is &quot;a sick puppy&quot; were probably also offended by the first 20 minutes of &quot;Saving Private Ryan.&quot; If you want standard Hollywood, and you buy Dickey, you will be disappointed.To be a hunter, keen and alert, raised to know the life of the wild and the ways of the hunted, and then to be placed, as Muldrow was, into a world of aliens, each one a hunter, and to have all the usual means of becoming inconspicuous stripped away: that is the story. That was Muldrow's lot; what exactly was he supposed to do?No one who hates this book can admit to even a vestigial smidgen of the feral in mankind. Dickey's unlikely and unwilling hero had it, and so when he appears to be camouflaged at the book's end, he really is: no one in the crowd who sees him understands what he is seeing--and that includes some readers."},{"Title":"To the White Sea","review":"This book starts slowly and then actually gets slower. Thank God it was only 275 pages. Dark thoughts from the writer."},{"Title":"To the White Sea","review":"\\"To the White Sea\\" is the second novel by James Dickey that I have read. The first was \\"Deliverance\\" and I came away from \\"White Sea\\" wondering what the heck his poetry must be about. After all, his prose comes across as a sort of \\"disfunctionally bestial man in the wilderness who does whatever it takes to survive\\". I'm not sure that there's much poetry out there that emanates from such subjecdt matter. I'm also not sure I want to find out if there is.\\"To the White Sea\\" challenged my value systems and left me rejecting the hero and actually cheering for some of his later \\"adversaries\\". The hero is an WWII American airman who parachutes from a downed US plane and lands on the edge of Tokyo. His survival skills are impressive and I found myself cheering him on. As the book progresses (and we learn more and more about his upbringing on the North Slope of Alaska) our \\"hero's\\" survival techniques become more and more ruthless. When he reaches his \\"destination\\" he discovers a lifestyle we expect him to embrace. What happened next (and why it did) totally turned me off to this guy. The resulting few pages were probably what Dickey meant to leave us with but I got left behind about 20 pages earlier.As I struggled with what to think about \\"To the White Sea\\", I pondered whether Dickey meant it as a statement against the self-destructive nature of war. By baring it all on a man who will stop at nothing to survive, was Dickey saying that war causes nations to stop at nothing to prevail? I'm not sure that the pattern of his prose doesn't point to a baser level of study. Perhaps it is meant to be Dickey's exploration of man's degenerative nature period. \\"Deliverance\\" was a masterpiece that challenged our senses and sensitivities. \\"To the White Sea\\" merely challenged my patience."},{"Title":"To the White Sea","review":"I don't think I have ever read a book that I found so completely unpleasant as this one. The main character, an airman shot down in a WWII raid over Tokyo, keeps himself alive by one murder after another of the Japanese civilians he encounters. It is not the act portrayed so much as it is the way it is presented that I have a problem with. Whatever Dickey intended the reader to think about this numbing round of killing, I personally found it - and the 'hero' portrayed in the book - and the author who wrote the words - objectionable in the extreme.Apart from the unpleasantness of the story and main character, the language, especially for a writer who fancies himself a poet, is so bad. Passages alternate between the flat and the flatulenty overdone. Quite frankly, I found reading this book a kind of torture, and only endured it because I kept hoping that Dickey would work some of the same magic he was able to pull off in Deliverance - an ugly story that could as easily have failed but didn't.If you hate humanity and/or love deadpan descriptions of violent death inflicted by strangers or feel the need for some deadly droning prose, then this is the book for you. Dickey must really have been down on the human race and his own life when he penned this one."},{"Title":"To the White Sea","review":"Despite what the jacket summary may say, this is not a story of a heroic soldier struggling to stay alive in enemy territory, like Capt Scott O'Grady's true story. Instead, this is a disturbing tale about a twisted, bloodthirsty murderer with no grasp on the value of human life (and little grasp on sanity). Dull dreamlike sequences drag on and on, slowing the pace of the book. Extended ramblings about such topics as smashing human pelvic bones and drinking blood attest to the narrator's (and author's) ugly morbidity. The narrator's boasts about his unmatched skills as an outdoorsman grow stale quickly. On the whole, this book will bore you and turn your stomach. For an exciting survival adventure, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Three Collections","review":"In spite of the tough-looking photo on the cover, I found &quot;Three Collections&quot; full of insightful, vivid, thoughtful poems. Comprised of sections from three of the authors series of poems, &quot;The Women,&quot; &quot;My Roaring 20's,&quot; and &quot;The Brenda Poems&quot;, this books offers a little something for everyone. &quot;The Women&quot; details poems written about women from all walks of life; &quot;My Roaring 20's&quot; is a gritty, realistic look at Lewis' second decade, chronicling troubled relationships and growing self-awareness; and &quot;The Brenda Poems&quot; are a collection of dialogues between the writer and the (I think) fictional Brenda. The author cleverly uses this device to address issues in male/female relationships. I'm not usually a fan of poetry, but reading this book (recommended by a friend who also writes poetry) made want to dig deeper into the genre."},{"Title":"Three Collections","review":"Nathan Lewis' THREE COLLECTIONS was a refreshing read as well as a learning experience. This poet and writer lays it all on the line in three collections: his thoughts, his women, his love, his learning. This book is definitely poetic, and speaks the words of many black men. I thought this writers poetic testimonies were so great that I definitely passed this book on to my brother who is not an avid reader of anything. But guess what? He could not put this book down. He immediately identified with the author's experiences and admired the charisma and sense of honesty in each poem. This book is a profound testimony of hope and redemption for any reader who dares to pick it up. I recommend this volume of poetry not only for black men, but for every man and woman because it speaks boldly from the experiences and issues that are maligning our men, our women and our times."},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Course: Sample Cassette","review":"I thought this book has been helpful getting me to learn Latin so far. I bought the CD with it to help practice hearing it and get some pronunciations down. If I were a brand new language learner completely, I don't know how helpful this was, but my background in studying German for 9 years helped me understand things like the accusative case and made me pay attention to verb-endings. If you've never studied a foreign language before, I would hesitate to do this alone."},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Course: Sample Cassette","review":"I taught Latin I for 20+ years in the public school system and stayed frustrated with the texts we were given to use. Now that I'm teaching independently and can choose my own text, I'm going with the Oxford Latin Course. The vocabulary is similar to other texts, but this series gives accessible translations so students can master that important skill early. I'm also pleased that the OLC does not give dull grammar exercises but presents important concepts and gives practice through the cartoons, the translations, etc. The lessons are short and move quickly. The cultural info is also good. Other than wishing for more info on derivatives, I'm enjoying using it to teach Lain 1 students."},{"Title":"Mark Twain & the Starchy Boys","review":"I actually haven't read the book.

They are one with the forest, in a way I've seen described inJourney to the Ancestral Self: The Native Lifeway Guide to Living in Harmony with the Earth Mother (Bk.1)and maybe alsoGrandfather. Do you remember the story of the elves and the shoemaker? They weren't described as elves- just smaller people, apparently without a lot of clothing, as with Pygmies. The larger Polynesians that invaded Hawaii c. 750 AD displaced the smaller manahune population. Isn't it interesting that the Hawaiian word for elves, minehune, is so close? I have to wonder if all the stories of elves, fairies, and so on, aren't a recollection of a smaller race, that was displaced. The Tuatha de Danaan could have been such. Well I don't know. Reading books like this makes me wonder, however. Why are there stories of elves and fairies all over the world? Even in 1,001 nights? And humans could marry with them, even, reportedly? All Native American groups I've looked at have a word for these beings, also."},{"Title":"The secret commonwealth of elves, fauns and fairies,","review":"To be honest, this isnt what i was expecting for the book. Half the book is an essay and explinatory discourse by Andrew Lang on each section of that which is written by Rev Robert Kirk.

The reason for this, if you are studying the Fair Folk, then you shouldnt need an explination about the meaning of words used by Rev Kirk.Im sorry, but i cannot support the decision to put a 45 page explinatory essay or what seems to be a thesis infront of the works of Rev Kirk.

Each chapter is a quick 10 or so pages, but contains all the essentials: worried about [pimping] by attendings, this book will ease your fears.I cannot say enough about this book: almost every orthopaedic surgeon that has seen me reading it has said \\" WOW, wish we had something like that when I was getting started training!\\"If I could give it 6 stars, I would...The only downside is that a lot of the material is in a psuedo-outline form....there were times I was wishing there was more material to read about a particular topic.....but I guess thats why they call it \\" Fundamentals of Orthopaedics\\"."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Orthopaedics, 1e","review":"Mark Miller gave this text to me when we began working together in Charlottesville.

Similar to the other recall series books, the book was written in questions and answers style. The questions are in the left side of each page and the answers are on the right side of the same page. The questions are short and clear and the answers are brief and written in clear simple English and to the point. This style of writing makes reading quite easy and the concentration level needed to grasp the information much less than the classic way of writing review books in essay style. This style has made the books quite handy as light reading material when you are in your way in the train or the bus or whenever you do not feel like reading a textbook to get an answer to a basic question because of having to read long paragraphs to get the answer. The book covers the definitional, clinical, basic patho-physiological, diagnostic, and management aspects of the hot topics in medicine. The target readers of the book range from medical students starting their clinical rotations to house officers. The questions' flow in most chapter is quite logical starting by definitions, epidemiology, clinical signs and symptoms, diagnostic tests and findings, prognostics, and ending up with management. They are the sort of questions that consultants like to pimp their juniors with and they cover high yield information that show up in viva's or at the end clinical assessment exercises.In this book, I particularly liked the hematology, infectious disease and nephrology sections. The hematology section was the best or in simple words most of what you need to know and to the point. In the infectious disease section, many of the common infections e.g. UTIs and sexually transmitted diseases were covered in very nice summaries of what you need to know about them with little to be looked up in other books (does not often include dosages or duration of treatment).One of the problems of the book is the use mg/dl unit instead of the international unit system of mmol/l, so you will have to convert those units to mmol/ l. The index could be improved as some of the covered topics may not show up there. The book lacks a reference ranges which would have the book even better.I found this book very useful in aiding my learning and I would highly recommend it to medical students, trainees interns, and junior house officers as a crash course for the different medical runs that are covered by this book I have got most of the other books of this series and I believe it was the best of them all! However, you have to realize that for the highly specialized questions you will need to consult one of those high BMI ( > 30) textbooks or medline to get an answer to the question J ."},{"Title":"Medicine Recall (Recall Series)","review":"This book is excellent for an internal medicine rotation, giving you exactly what you need without any unnecessary filler. Covers every topic in internal medicine, including psychiatry. I used this to study for the oral exam, and all of the questions were straight out of this book.

The bible measured about 12&quot; by 18&quot; and came in four very stout volumes. I flipped through checking out my favorite verses, in both the Wycliffe and Purvey translations, which appear side-by-side. My favorite verse, 1 Cor. 3:11 read like this, &quot;For no man may sette another foundement, outtaken that that is sett, which is Crist Jhesus.&quot; Anyone interested in the history of the bible should check this version out if you are in the D.C. area. Also, just a plug, but the Library of Congress also has the Guttenburg bible on display. And just as a side note, I do not agree with the previous review. I will not try to woo the masses, but I urge anyone who happens to read these reviews to research and decide for themselves if Jesus claimed to be the Son of God. Recent authors to check out would be Strobel and McDowell (very simple). More thorough works are of course available. Don't forget to research the Dead Sea scrolls!"},{"Title":"The Holy Bible: With the Apocryphal Books in the Earliest English Versions from the Latin Vulgate","review":"I will let the book speak for itself. Early English translation of the Holy Scriptures.However, just to clear up a little historical inaccuracy.Pope Honorius lived 2 centuries after the Council of Nicea.

They made up all the rest. In fact, the predominant sect of Christianity in the first days were the Arians, who followed Barnabus and Arius, who understood that Jesus was not God nor ever claimed to be God.The Catholic Pope Honorius declared once and for all that Jesus was not God nor had ever claimed to be, but years after the Pope's death at the Nicean counsel of 325 A.D., the latest version of the Catholic church declared that the Arians had been heretics, and in fear of the spread of such word, anathematized Pope Honorius and all his teachings, which is like declaring that not only was he wrong, but that the Pope never existed. This is how fearful the Church at that time was of alternate ideas getting out. They even burned all copies of the Bible that contained the Book of Barnabus, which include copies of the Vulgate Bible, a version that included books that clarified that Jesus was not God and had never claimed to be.Sorry to say that the present mixed up Christian Church is based on a variety of falsehoods and legends. Jesus was a great Prophet and did perform miracles at the behest of God, but Jesus was not and never claimed to be God. Many present day Christian sects, such as the Mormons, Unitarians and Jehovah's Witnesses actually recognize this to some fashion, but most Christian sects still propound the belief that Jesus is God.Besides all this, the problem is that we don't even have the original texts of the Bible; we are dealing with translations on translations, and in many areas the meaning has been changed so dramatically that it is quite clear that not much remains of the original. So it is impossible to even judge the Bible, since we don't have the originals.Sorry if I have offended anyone, or if this truth blows your mind, but 2000 years of falsehoods must be addressed. Many of present ideas in Christianity came not from Jesus, but from PAUL, who promulgated the idea that Jesus came to him in visions and told Paul that he was divine and so on. Actually, Jesus never said any such thing, but this particular early sect of Christianity, that followed Paul (the Paulenes) won out and established dominance over time.In other words, the current sects of Christianity that adhere to the Trinity or the divinity of God, are all based on the ideas of the Paulenes. If the Arian, monotheistic, sect of Christianity had won out, today no one would believe that Jesus was God. It's that simple. It is because of PAUL that people today believe that Jesus was divine."},{"Title":"An Unspeakable Betrayal: Selected Writings of Luis Buuel","review":"This is a wonderful and funny collection of surreal writings from one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. Many of the earlier, surreal writings by Bunuel, written when he was with the Surrealists in France, are imaginative and funny. There is also the complete collection of poetry originally titled An Andulsian Dog, which is surprisingly strong. The criticisms by Bunuel, along with the autobiographical material, offer insight to his aesthetic beliefs and his thinking. There are also snatches of the last screenplay on which he was working before he died in addition to the original screenplay for Andulsian Dog and a Hollywood treatment for an unrealized film GOYA.

This collection proceeds chronologically, from poetry and short stories written in Bu&ntilde;uel's youth in Spain to an essay written in 1980, not long before his death. Newly translated into English, the writings offer startling insights into the filmmaker's life and thought. The earliest pieces came well before Bu&ntilde;uel joined the Surrealist movement in Paris and created the landmark film Un chien andalou with Salvador Dal&iacute;. Yet these and the early Surrealist writings reveal the inventiveness of the mind that would later create such masterpieces of cinema as L'Age d'or, Los olvidados, Viridiana, The Milky Way, The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, and That Obscure Object of Desire. Later writings, which include screenplays and reflections on his own and others' films, illuminate many aspects of Bu&ntilde;uel's career, as well as the ways of thinking and perceiving that underlie his unique cinematic style. The final essay by this extraordinary artist sums up his view of the world--still vibrant and full of contradictions--at the end of his life. &lt;&lt;&lt; Publisher's NoteAltogether now - not a lot, he had others for that part of his movie making process - but much still, the genuine sound of the Master's hand and brain.

The unconventional format in which this fairy tale type story is told, with the competing boy and girl narrators, coupled with the variety of illustation styles to complement who is narrating at the time make this a favorite bedtime book. Also the way it is written makes it fun for me to read, which is good, seeing as I've read so many times. All around a FUN, FUN book to share with your kids."},{"Title":"Once Upon a Cool Motorcycle Dude","review":"So here I am wondering what to read to my jaded fifth graders. They don't go in for the ultra serious, they yawn through the books beloved of second and third graders. They groan when I mention poetry or nonfiction. And then this book falls into my lap. One read through and I'm hooked--and so is my fifth grade audience! Kevin O'Malley has brilliantly joined artistic forces with Carol Heyer and Scott Goto to create a book that is a commentary on story telling, the battle of the sexes, and a great graphic novel picture book yarn!The premise of this tale is easy to absorb; two characters, a boy and a girl (probably classmates at school) are telling the readers their own made up fairy tale. Each takes a turn at the story, and offers commentary on their partner's part of the tale. The girl starts off with a flowery story of a princess and her ponies and the giant that comes and steals the ponies away. No prince seems up to the challenge. At this point, our male narrator has become heartily sick of the way the story is being told and takes over the narrative. No prince may be up to beating the giant, but a motorcycle-riding Dude with a sword just might be able to win the day. The boy continues on with his tale of action and adventure and finishes off the tale--leaving the princess doing nothing but spinning gold thread. The female narrator has her own idea of how the story should end, and it takes some work for the two to come together on an ending that satisfies them both and delights listeners. The narrative is broken into actual story text, and dialog bubbles, combining traditional picture book style with graphic novel sensibilities. This book will most likely appeal to readers already familiar with comics and graphic novels and who will be delighted to find a picture book in the same format. While this break up of text can be challenging to read aloud, older readers will have no problem following the story on their own.But the text is hardly the whole story. The pictures are what make this book so delightful, and hysterical. A veteran artist and illustrator of over 25 children's books, Kevin O'Malley's flair is found in the cartoon style boy and girl that speak in dialog bubbles that appear throughout the main fairy tale, offering extra commentary. Mr. O'Malley's characters speak directly to the audience, breaking the fourth wall and pulling the readers/listeners into the story crafting experience. Carol Heyer is an award winning fantasy artist who has illustrated several fairy tale books for children and her talent shines through in gorgeous romanticized images of a lovely princess and her ponies. Everything is in royal hues shaded to pinks and purples. The pictures are lovely, but very \\"girl\\" and extremely saccharine--which the readers will figure out fast enough. The menacing giant doesn't look all that mean or foreboding, and the princess inhabits that \\"magical fairyland\\" quality that would be at home in most \\"girl-centric\\" advertising. Carol Heyer knows just how to play this up without making the pictures themselves comical or caricatures--they're lovely, but funny as hell when added to the text. Scott Goto also has a fantasy background to his art, but his style is bold, sweeping over the whole page and defining itself with strong colors. His Dude has a modern touch that hints of world wrestling while still managing to capture a more Conan-like spirit in the battle. Goto's giant is monstrous and hideous--in keeping with the male narrative of grossness. \\"And his breath smelled like rotten, moldy, stinky wet feet!\\" The combination of these styles as our narrators battle for control of the story highlights the differences and encourages the laughter, while giving some great artwork for the reader to enjoy. Some of this stuff would be at home in any high fantasy collection!This book manages to highlight what could be considered traditional differences in the way male and female narratives are handled. The girl's narrative focuses on emotions and names of the ponies and more descriptive elements of the text while the boy focuses on action and big events without necessarily finishing the narrative tale. It takes both of them working together and taking elements from the other's story to come to the conclusion. Of course nothing remains in agreement for long! I will be the first to admit it is a hard book to read aloud. If you're really good at voices and humor however, this book is the perfect read for older, more cynical listeners. It took me several tries to get it to read well, but now it's the book that all my kids request. They love hearing it as much as I love telling it!Those who enjoy this book might want to take a look at the Captain Raptor series also by Mr. O'Malley. Likewise, \\"Mars Needs Moms\\" by Berkely Breathed may appeal with its similar whimsy and powerful illustrations. And don't miss \\"Superhero ABC\\" by Bob Macleod. This comic-book style art alphabet book is sure to please those with a love of action heroes and humor.Happy Reading! ^_^ Shanshad"},{"Title":"Once Upon a Cool Motorcycle Dude","review":"A boy and girl have to make a fairy tale.

They couldn't decide what fairy tale to tell, so they just made one up. They each used their own voice and own personality. The result was a hilarious fairy tale.There were many things that we treasured in this book. We particularly liked the characters'strong personalities and the illustrations. We recommed this book to children who like fractured fairy tales like Shrek and The Wolf Who Cried Boy.Red group at Norco K-3"},{"Title":"Once Upon a Cool Motorcycle Dude","review":"I have not yet read this to my class, but personally I loved it and will appreciate it just for myself if need be. This hysterical picture combines an amazing author/illustrator and two more illustrators to celebrate the difference between boy and girl thought processes. Maybe they're a little typical, but I've been around enough kids to know there is a lot of truth.A boy and a girl, partners for a class project, are supposed to retell their favorite to the class. However, they could not agree on a story, so they decide to instead tell their own, combining the adventures of a sweet princess and a muscle-bound guy on a motorcycle. The two sides of the story play off of each wonderfully as the kids banter.Not only is it funny and all three illustration styles fantastic, but it's a clever exercise in voice. Even the fonts change.This is a delight to read. I can't wait to share it with my class.EDIT:I have since read this to my class. This is the second book in three years of teaching where my class demanded a reread immediately after the book was finished.I made the mistake of loaning it to another teacher. My class nearly rebelled when it wasn't on their shelf for their own perusing.Yes, 1st grade age can appreciate this book."},{"Title":"Once Upon a Cool Motorcycle Dude","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. It takes to extremes the differences in the stories that girls and boys tend to be drawn to. It certainly would be great for a reading out loud event as there very distinct characters that could be well voiced. The art (of three different illustrators) is fantastic, especially towards the end where the princess pulls a She-Ra. Great, fun read."},{"Title":"Once Upon a Cool Motorcycle Dude","review":"This book won the North Carolina Children's Book Award in 2007 (students vote for the winning book from a list developed by children's librarians). I read it to my Pre-K through 3rd grade classes when it was a nominee--they ALL loved it. (I'd have read it to grades 4-6 if I'd had the chance!).So when I went on a librarian interview and had to give a 5-minute presentation at the end, I knew what I'd do--a read-aloud of Once Upon a Cool Motorcycle Dude. I had to present to about 6 adults--both librarians and non-librarians (Human Resources, etc.) I know it went beyond the 5 minutes and I stopped partway through to double-check, but they wanted me to keep going. At the end, they immediately asked the children's librarian if they had that book in their collection. I then became the top candidate for the job, too!I'm going to a conference to meet author Kevin O'Malley--I can't wait!Child-recommended, librarian-recommended. Buy this book!"},{"Title":"Once Upon a Cool Motorcycle Dude","review":"I'm all about the illustrations when I read a children's book. This has excellent illustrations, in two competing styles, one comic-bookish, the other the classic fairy-tale look. It artistically hits the stereotypes of the young of both genders.Additionally this is just a neat concept. A \\"He Said She Said\\" for the younger crowd. Something to appeal to all, and highlight what is enjoyed- at least by the average girl, or average boy.Where it falls apart is where it misses the mark. It aims high, but doesn't quite reach. The story is juts too disjointed, and doesn't fascinate, teach, or pull at the emotions. The concept itself isn't fully played out. This would have been a better produced book if every page was by a different child, creating a spin on the classic story game. It would also have served the illustrations better if the poorly illustrated boy and girl telling the story weren't on the same page as the beautiful illustrations of the story. As it is, they are glaring, and detract from otherwise beauty."},{"Title":"Once Upon a Cool Motorcycle Dude","review":"This book was very funny. It was funny when the main characters fought back and forth about a story they were supposed to write together. It was supposed to be a fairy tale. They fought about the story because the girl wanted the story to be about a princess and the boy wanted the story to be about a motorcycle dude. The book has a clever solution to this problem.Another cool thing about this book is the illustrations. There are three different illustrators for the three different plots going on.We recommend this book for readers who like funny fairy tales, books with a little action and a bit of a twist."},{"Title":"Once Upon a Cool Motorcycle Dude","review":"I use \\"Once Upon a Cool Motorcycle Dude\\" for Story Time at my library and my granddaughter's school.

Now, if my kids produce kids, I'm prepared."},{"Title":"Once Upon a Cool Motorcycle Dude","review":"Once Upon a Cool Motorcycle Dude by Kevin O'Malley, Carol Heyer and Scott Goto is one of our family's favorite picture books. My youngest daughter brought it home from the library at the age of four. We read it aloud together and laughed, and laughed, and laughed. Then my husband read it aloud, doing voices as only he can, and we laughed even harder.We checked the book out from the library over and over again, until my mom in a wonderful Grandma moment, gave the book as a gift to us.Since then, we've read the book over and over again, even if we are all \\"older\\" readers now. We've read it aloud at sleepovers, we've recommended it to friends, and I re-read it for my 15 books for 15 days challenge.The storyline is simple it seems, as the book flap says, \\"Once upon a time there was a boy and a girl who had to tell a fairy tale to the class, but they couldn't agree on the story. Will everyone live happily ever after?\\"The girl tells a story of Princess Tenderheart and her eight ponies, which are being stolen one by one by a horrible giant. Princess Tenderheart spins gold thread and cries, until the boy interrupts the story and brings in his hero, \\"this really cool muscle dude rides up to the castle on his motorcycle.\\" The hero does battle with the giant and the Princess has to keep spinning gold thread to pay him. \\"The End,\\" the boy says triumphantly.The girl says, \\"I don't think so . . . I'll tell you what happened, bubba!\\" Then she tells of how Princess Tenderheart becomes a Princess Warrior and the dude has to make his own gold thread. Of course, then the boy isn't satisfied with the ending, and they, finally, work together to create a happy ending for all, happily arguing their way through the story to the finish.There are three sets of graphics for this story, one by each of the illustrators, and in the end story they are skillfully woven together, just like the story.I have to admit one of my favorite pages from this story is where one of the fight scenes take place, and the boy and the girl are adding their comments at the bottom of the picture. It goes something like this:\\"The muscle dude has this really big sword. The giant and the dude battled all over the place. The Earth was shaking and there was lightning and thunder and volcanoes were exploding.\\" (text with main picture, told by the boy)\\"It was huge.\\" (boy's interjection)\\"Volcanoes? Where'd the volcanoes come from?\\" (girl's interjection)One could argue that this book pays too much homage to biases about boys and girls, but therein lies the humor, and is a great discussion point for parents. Our family agrees, we've seen those differences between boys and girls . . . but do all girls think one thing and all boys think another? No. Not every girl wants to be a beautiuful Princess with 8 ponies that she plays with every day, and not every boy wants to do battle with a giant whose breath smells like \\"stinky, moldy, wet feet.\\"If you ever want to have an example in creative, interactive storytelling between two characters, or have a story to use as a jumping off point for \\"stories in the round\\" where family members or students take turns adding to a story told for the fun of the whole group, this is a book you'll definitely want to read.Or, you may just want to read it for the fun of it."},{"Title":"Once Upon a Cool Motorcycle Dude","review":"Three contrasting art styles by three different illustrators meet in a single picture book. It works! Here's how:For a library project, a girl and a boy must team up to tell their class a fairy tale, but they can't agree on a story. \\"Once upon a time, there was a beautiful princess / a cool motorcycle dude / who loved all her beautiful ponies / who rode an awesome motorcycle.\\"Clever formatting keeps the complex storyline from becoming confusing. As the boy and girl alternately narrate, each has cartoon-style speech balloons to comment on the other's contributions to the tale.Author O'Malley uses a comic-book style (pen and ink drawings with digitalized color) to show the arguing boy and girl. In contrast, Heye and Goto offer rich acrylic and oil paintings. Heye's dreamy Princess Tenderheart drifts in a classic castle, while Goto's fearsome, nameless biker roars out of a stormy landscape worthy of the darkest fantasy world. When the two meet, sparks fly.To complicate the conflict, a marauding giant stomps into the kingdom, hungry for ponies. Saying any more here would spoil the effect of a truly original, stereotype-smashing twist.This innovative (and fun!) picture book is highly recommended for mid- to upper-elementary readers, who will relish all the in-jokes. Even teens will laugh at the outrageous one-upmanship and unexpected ending."},{"Title":"Once Upon a Cool Motorcycle Dude","review":"_Once Upon a Cool Motorcycle Dude_ is simply a joy to read. Two children have to present a fairy tale to their audience but they cannot agree on the content. The resulting combination is an hysterical fairy tale for our time that both boys and girls will love. This story just SCREAMS to be read aloud or performed as a skit.

It is easy to see their distinct voices coming out, and there are also drawings of the boy and girl interacting as they write with their reactions to each others' ideas. It is going to be fun to use in the classroom to illustrate multiple voices (especially in conjunction with novels). I can picture my students having fun doing similar activities."},{"Title":"Once Upon a Cool Motorcycle Dude","review":"This book focuses on a boy's perception of fairy tales. Boys can be turned off by the topics that teachers choose for study. It really illustrates that teachers need to differentiate reading and writing topics for boys. I suggest using this book in professional development activities to bring this awareness to teachers."},{"Title":"Once Upon a Cool Motorcycle Dude","review":"My son thought this book had very cool illustrations and it was very cute.

Fun illustrations!"},{"Title":"Once Upon a Cool Motorcycle Dude","review":"My 4 year old absolutely loves this book. She's a girl who loves princesses, dinosaurs and pirates. And I am sooooo sick of princesses. This book was refreshing for me to read aloud versus reading same old princess stories.

My niece and nephew laughed a lot and really enjoyed this book. My niece especially enjoyed the part when the princess got aggravated, took matters into her own hands and proceeded to kick some major butt! Even I got a tickle while watching as the kids assumed different voices to animate their characters. The book itself is well written & has glossy full color pictures on every page.

This fairy tale-within-a-fairy-tale-within-a-school-project sounds confusing, but the \\"manly\\" fairy tale pages have tough guy illustrations, and the \\"feminine\\" fairy tale pages have pink and purple princessy illustrations.

The belief that the human expands or becomes spiritual has been problematic and not fruitful for me. It was not until I began a serious study of John Hargreaves' book that I began to recognize life as wholly spiritual. This has changed my perspective on who and what I am. Living universal and eternal divine completeness now as the truth of all creation is expansive in ways I could never have imagined and establishes me in the line of spiritual creation with the whole of the world."},{"Title":"As \\"I\\" see it : the scientifically spiritual perspective","review":"In an age where everything must have universal/worldly appeal; including all arts, government and religion; there is a \\"voice\\" in each of us, guiding us to be greater and more harmonious together; telling us who we really are. Clearing the mist of worldly desires and oversimplifications of the complex universe, in an attempt to make it appear \\"stupid/immoral friendly\\", there is the universe of Truth or reality. Books from all sectors of religion have pointed to a loving and giving God, called by many names, but all of us have something between a guess and working knowledge that this Being is what we refer to as the Creator of All; that which is all in all. This book, \\"As \\"I\\" See It\\" by John Hargreaves, does the decidedly significant task of defining \\"the tares from the wheat\\" separating the Truth from the lie.As \\"I\\" See It brings the reader closer to a functional knowledge of divine metaphysics and challenges the reader to raise the bar on their own sense of what consciousness is and what \\"I\\" (referring to both \\"me\\" and \\"you\\") means to them.Using The Bible and The Science & Health (by Mary Baker Eddy which is the companion book for Christian Science along-side the Bible) as the starting point as well as stories from people of different walks of life, \\"As \\"I\\" See It\\" brings in many useful angles of what reality is. This book puts the idea, paraphrased from the Bible, of \\"work(ing) out our own salvation...\\" in a new light for me; stating it, in the sense that each of us is responsible for our own sense of what and how we see reality. That what we perceive is not out there but is all within us- and as we gain more correct views of God's creation, \\"life\\" becomes harmonious, happy and fruitful.I highly recommend this book to anyone, regardless of their religious beliefs, who seeks a greater understanding of what Life is all about and how to bring more Love, Truth, and Principle into their experience. Unfortunately, \\"As \\"I\\" See It\\" is out of print as of early 2004 and older copies seem to go for quite a bit; but if you do come across one and have the dough, you may very well find this book to be one of a kind and helpful on your spiritual journey as I have."},{"Title":"As \\"I\\" see it : the scientifically spiritual perspective","review":"This book, long out of print, will be republished by Mulberry Press in Spring 2006 in paperback!"},{"Title":"Santos statues & sculpture: Contemporary woodcarving from New Mexico","review":"Although this book is in great condition and arrived ontime, it was not what I expected.

Other then that is was OK."},{"Title":"The Wapshot Scandal","review":"If you have not yet read The Wapshot Chronicle, I strongly urge you to read that novel before this one. The Wapshot Scandal is written as a sequel to The Wapshot Chronicle, and the situations and character development in the first book are important background for the second one.Cousin Honora is back in The Wapshot Scandal, but in an unaccustomed role. She is one of the most original and interesting characters of 20th century literature, and my interest in her grew from reading this book. You will also follow Moses and Coverly through their developing careers, continuing marriages and family life. You will probably grow to be more interested in Coverly than before, because his character also receives much more development. The characters of Melissa, Moses's wife, and Betsy, Coverly's wife, are also nicely filled in from the simple sketches in The Wapshot Chronicle. A major new character is also introduced who serves as the exact opposite to Cousin Honora, Cameron, Coverly's brilliant scientist boss. The other significant new character is a young man whose life will remind you of the adolescent fantasies of teenage males.What each character has in common is an incompleteness, a weakness so profound that it causes each to be mightily humbled. These weaknesses are exposed as the comfortable facade of social position that has surrounded and protected the Wapshots is gradually stripped away. Some of the characters find new meaning from the changed circumstances, while others find the harshness of life without protection to be unbearable. You will find it rewarding to think about what it means to have \\"grace under pressure\\" after reading this book.Those who like lots of action in their books will find that this story gets off to a slow start, and only speeds up to a fast pace once or twice (depending on your idea of a fast pace). But this leisurely story constantly sets you up for unexpected events, that make you feel like Mr. Cheever has literally pulled the rug out from under your feet. Each time the unexpected blindsided me, I felt like I had been entertained by a master story teller of rare skill. Be especially patient in the beginning. The least amount of action occurs there.My favorite quality in the book is its unabashed challenge to the following tenets of American life: Work hard; get ahead; have a nice family life in the suburbs; enjoy your friends and neighbors; do the right thing; and find solace in acquiring material possessions. Mr. Cheever clearly makes the case that more is needed to be a good person and to survive within one's own limitations. Some of the comic scenes where consumerism is lampooned are absolutely priceless! The satire aimed at the hypocrites who look down at those who can't cope is so sharp that their heads roll almost without showing blood.This novel is a good one to savor . . . to read slowly . . . to discuss with others . . . and to reread.What do you assume you should do with your life? Where do you have evidence that those assumptions may not be right? What goals would better serve you, those you love, those you care about, and everyone you come into contact with? Where is fatal complacency stealing away your opportunities to choose better directions?If the events in this book happened to you, what would you do?"},{"Title":"The Wapshot Scandal","review":"In \\"The Wapshot Scandal,\\" published in January 1964, John Cheever continues the story of the Wapshot family that he began in 1957's The Wapshot Chronicle. Family history and reputation managed to retain a certain amount of prestige and respect for the Wapshots in tiny St. Botolphs for a decade or two beyond the time that the decline in Wapshot family prospects became evident to outsiders. Now \\"The Wapshot Scandal\\" focuses on the youngest members of the family, brothers Moses and Coverly, as they build new lives for themselves far from the little town in which they grew up. Thankfully, Cousin Honora is also a part of this second Wapshot book and, as it turns out, the contribution she makes to the overall sense of scandal that envelopes the family is a key one.Moses and Coverly, having successfully secured Honora's financial support, are now married, with families and careers of their own. But despite Honora's decision to share what is left of the family fortune with them, neither man is particularly happy with his lot in life because each is married to a troubled woman and tied to a job he secretly despises. Honora, in the meantime, still reigns in the big family home in St. Botolphs where she lives alone with her longtime housekeeper, the closest relationship she has in the world despite what either woman might say about it.Honora, as spirited and eccentric as ever (and described by Cheever as looking \\"a little like George Washington might have looked had he lived to be so old\\"), does not recognize the precarious decline the Wapshots are enduring until she is forced to match wits with an unhappy IRS employee who appears suddenly at her door. The resulting confrontation, and Honora's approach to solving the problem, will leave the reader smiling in admiration as the elderly woman proves to be more than a match for her young challenger.Despite its humor, however, \\"The Wapshot Scandal\\" is overall a much darker book than the one in which Cheever first introduced the family. Life in the suburbs, the lifestyle chosen by Moses and Coverly, is portrayed as bleak and despairing, a world often dominated by alcohol and adultery, a world in which hard work and doing the right thing for one's family are not always appreciated or rewarded. The \\"Wapshot Scandal\\" offers a much harsher brand of satire than the comic version of its predecessor and it leads nicely to Cheever's even grimmer look at the suburbs, his third novel: \\"Bullet Park.\\"Rated at: 5.0"},{"Title":"The Wapshot Scandal","review":"If you enjoyed the Wapshot chronicle, you will enjoy this,however he doesnt get into his stride until Chapter 6, or page 53. I have friends who claim they could never get into this book, and my advice to them is pick it up and start again at page 53 after which there is a great deal of the customary absurdity over which we lovers of Cheever drool. Thats all, enjoy!!"},{"Title":"The Wapshot Scandal","review":"As a follow-up to his \\"Wapshot Chronicle,\\" John Cheever has continued his well-chosen style, almost Dickensonian in mood and tone. And while the first book had its share of scandals, nothing surmounts what is contained herein. Chapter after chapter brings on marital cheating, tax evasion, suicide, abandonment, etc., cropping up in the most unexpected places and peopled by the most interesting characters. The Wapshots, once a rich and proud family, certainly have fallen upon hard times. I highly suggest you read \\"Chronicle\\" first. If you do, I firmly believe you will definitely want to continue with \\"Scandal.\\""},{"Title":"The Wapshot Scandal","review":"This is highly enjoyable and interesting for the way in which Cheever constructs this New England world. The plot is only so-so, but as a vehicle for understanding the characters it pays dividends. Cheever's best work remains his body of short stories."},{"Title":"The Wapshot Scandal","review":"Cheever has a great eye for character development, and he doesn't disappoint in this volume. The characters are definitely out of the ordinary, and the way he presents them is sympathetic, allowing their actions to tell the story.Pretty depressing stuff though -- make sure you take your meds before sitting down with it."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"Pico Iyer captures the spirit of Kyoto as a foreigner in this book. Iyer portrays in his book the difficulty in communication between Japanese women and the foreigners they fall for. The mysticism of O-Bon, the Japanese festival of the dead. And the frustrating and even heartbreaking relationships of too many Japanese couples - all while he himself is slowly falling for a married Japanese women that he cannot effectively communicate with. But he does a good job at it. I lived in Japan as a foreigner for a few years (made me appreciate the book more) and can say that Iyer is pretty accurate in his analysis of the country. Nonetheless, it's a good read for anyone."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"Maybe its my love of Japan and Japanese culture. Maybe its how wondeful I thought Kyoto was. Maybe it was my failed romance with a beautiful Japanese girl. Whatever the cause, this book struck a nerve. It was like I was transported back to the beautiful city of Kyoto. The whole time I read this book, I truely felt like I was back in Japan. The descriptions of the city and its people, plus the contrast of Western expecations and Japanese realities made this book almost magical. This book is a must for those who have been to Japan and still think about their magical stays there. It is a must for those of us who still try to cling onto the memories of our visits."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"In my opinion, Pico Iyer seems to be a very moody writer. He usually writes well, but then there are moments when he comes into his own and writes with an amazing surreal quality. The transition from good to surreal is very smooth: It is like being transported to another (sometimes surreal, but very vivid) realm and you'll lose count of the time. I was particularly impressed by his prose wherein he describes his late night walks amidst all the floating lanterns.Pico has an uncanny knack of doing accurate and exhaustive research about the place and cultures he visits. Japan is an intriguing place that is steeped in three religions, immense & immaculate aesthetics, humbling hospitality, spellbinding natural scenery and Zen. Pico's interpretation of Zen is very interesting (though not very complete) and will give you opportunities of reflection, contemplation and fulfillment: In effect, living in the moment, which is quintessential Zen.There are some parts that Pico could have done without. These are:1. Description of his visits to Kyoto's high-end and nouveau bars. In these chapters, he squanders his high-prose to a reporter's anecdotal write-up.2. The hallmark of this book is his interaction and lovely relationship with Sachiko San. However, at time he has made some give-take remarks about Sachiko San (in my opinion). This in some ways taints the beautiful relationship between Pico & Sachiko.Nevertheless, this is a very good read. I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"Having never lived in Japan, I can't say anything about Iyer's accuracy on that account. But it was the lyrical writing in this that captured me, the descriptions of the places and people and most of all, the accounts of the food (corn-and-pineapple pizza! hot drinks dispensed from machines! the box of temple food!).I've read a few of Iyer's other books, and none of them comes close to &quot;The Lady and the Monk&quot; for sheer imagery, that soft feeling of rain and cherry blossoms and salty plum tea that I get when I read it. It's left an irrevocable mark on me, even if the real Japan isn't quite like this.Well worth the read, and it's a permanent part of my library."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"This beautiful book sold me on both Iyer and Japan. In this thoughtful volume, Iyer details his perplexing and wonderful experiences as he attempted to understand another culture. The process is not so easy! But I love Iyer's narrative. He set out to Japan to clear his head, to think, to be alone. Then reality hit, and his year turned into something completely different.People who chose to study or live abroad are either quite brave or quite naive. Their experiences can send them to heights of pleasure and back to their own drawing boards. Iyer's frank explanation of both successes and failures in his new culture make this book a special treasure. I was enthralled while reading every page.Although I had already been to Japan when I found this book, now I can't wait to return, not to mimic Iyer's adventure, which would be impossible, but to appreciate even more of his observations and difficulties."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"This book...was so adorable in a sense.

This story is very cute and I will read it again when I find the time."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"Pico Iyer writes so well. His images are fitting and so graphic, yet his touch is very refined. His treatment of his relationship with a married Japanese woman reveals the Japanese culture of the 1980's (much of which carries over to today) and draws the reader into caring about these people. The way the communications are carried between people is so different than what the American direct style. It gives a lot to consider in the way we relate with others, It is not primarily a spiritual book, but way more than a travel book."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"This is my first book by Iyer. As travel books go, I still prefer John Gimlette in terms of style and content. Iyer's is a very personal account of his one year spent in Kyoto. He spends quite a bit of time roaming the streets and temples, seeking just what I am not sure. Perhaps enlightenment or simply some material for a book such as this one.The real meat of the book is his encounters with a young married woman with two small kids. It is certainly a clash or mash of cultures and respective fascination and infatuation. You will in no uncertain terms get Iyer's perspectives and analyses."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"a very good read author a thoughtful writer, insightful reflections, gives picturesque description of japanese culture and people. recommend to broad readership."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"Iyer moves to Kyoto, Japan to write.

Thus a relationship was born, a link between the two very different cultures. A deep relationship despite the differences. Fascinating book."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"I loved this book at first and then began to slowly grow distrustful of the author. He's constantly hooking up with \\"The Lady\\" to goto various places around Japan but around halfway through the book, she's gushing feelings of love to him and he's weirdly stoic. The odd clue like them sharing a hotel room and meeting up in a foreign county make it seem as if he's hiding something. Once that feeling was in me, the book became a lot less fullfilling. I kept thinking about The Lady's two kids and, really, how lame the author was acting (especially after finding out they currently live together in Kyoto).It's also a lazy book. the author doesn't even try to learn the language before moving to Japan and spends half the book with various foreigners living in the country. A far superior book about a foreigner residing in Japan and REALLY living with the Japanese and writing about their lifestyle/culture is LEARNING TO BOW."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"I've been living in Osaka, Japan for almost a year. I read this book three times before I came here, and each time I did so I felt even more impatient to get here. What struck me the most about Iyer's portrayal of Japan was not the beauty of old Japan, but rather that this beauty is juxtaposed with ugly urban modernity. In fact, I made up my mind to buy the book when I read one detail on the back: the monks who befriended Iyer when he arrived wore Nike shoes. Like many Western visitors to Japan, I wanted to see an old culture, knowing full well that this culture no longer exists in its pristine state. So, far from tempering any yearning on my part for ancient Japan, incongruities such as the monks' shoes made me even more curious.In the character of Sachiko, Iyer attempts (among other things) to personify this clash between ancient and modern. However, I don't think Sachiko is an entirely plausible character because Iyer presents her as a personification of the incongruities that he finds in Japan. She embodies contradictions that I, at any rate, have never discovered in any Japanese person. (Maybe I should get out more.) In other words, I can't help feeling that Sachiko is painted in extreme colours for artistic purposes, perhaps even exploited. Ultimately, therefore, the book is much more about Japan than about Sachiko.It is often said that Japanese people see what they want to see, ignoring the unpleasant or unpalatable. Like any other cliche, there's a kernel of truth in this. I think that &quot;The Lady and the Monk&quot; is a consciously 'Japanese' kind of book, from the flavour of certain metaphors to the way that certain details are left tantalisingly implicit - as other reviewers have already pointed out. Even more importantly, however, Iyer sees what he wants to see. There is little, if any, criticism of Japan in this book; it is by no means a balanced picture. Still, is criticism compatible with infatuation? I think not.A couple of days after arriving in Japan, I saw a woman in a kimono making a call on her mobile 'phone. Iyer had been right."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"I stayed up all night reading the Lady and the Monk. This is the second book I have read by Pico Aver, the other being Video nights in Katmandu. I teach Japanese woman in Hawaii, and I can attest that Sachiko is real. Her constant tears brought me back to encounters with my Japanese friends. When the Japanese mask is removed, there is alot of repressed emotion and longing there. I am going to reread this book again. A first reading is never enough to digest Pico Ayer's lyrical descriptions. I feel he is a poet. I feel his soul through this book. For example, the way he comforts Sachiko, never lying to her that he will stay with her. It is a beautiful love story as well as a transporting guidebook to Kyoto. I am going to Japan to teach and can't wait to see Kyoto through his eyes. I encourage readers to read all of Ayers books. He has a way of observing aspects of a culture in a very short time that are both right on and romantic. He respects different cultures but is not shy about revealing his perceptions that are most of the time true. I recommend this book highly to all sensitive armchair travelers as well as for people who are just interested in Japan. I think I am a little jealous of Sachiko. They say it is better to have love and lost than to never have loved at all. And I think she was truly in love. This is one observation that Pico Ayer kept to himself"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"Pico Iyer goes to Japan intending to sample the legendary discipline of Zen Buddhism, but instead finds himself swept up in life there, and especially in Sachiko, a Japanese woman who dreams of a freedom her society is not prepared to offer.In one sense, the conflict of the book is in Iyer's changing notions about Japan; on arriving (not speaking the language and knowing almost nothing about Kyoto proper), he is somewhat chagrined to find out it's not the Heian Era anymore. As time goes on, he begins not only to come to grips with this, but to appreciate the ups and downs of modern life in the country.Even so, he does have certain lenses through which he insists on viewing his experience. The book's title announces his favorite theme, that of the woman at the temple gate who leads the monk astray; or, more broadly, the enduring tension between the sacred and the profane. This, combined with his love of Japanese poetry, causes him to read a literary quality into almost everything. (Maybe it is Kyoto itself that does this to him; I wonder how different his experience might have been had he gone to, say, Tokyo.) His musings in this vein are never quite disingenuous, but they sometimes wander into the starry-eyed.The book, though, is less the story of Japan than of Sachiko, which Iyer (characteristically) takes as a type of the stories of many Japanese women, yearning to have \\"little bird feeling\\" (as Sachiko puts it) and fly away from their restrictive lives. Unfortunately, this is where Iyer mostly indulges his own ideas about the Japanese, rather than actually interacting with them. (Most of his \\"characters\\" seem to be bohemian ex-pats rather than Japanese people.)Whatever the value of his lay sociology, his relationship with Sachiko teaches the incorrigibly analytical Iyer to start thinking with his heart, even as he teaches Sachiko to grasp the dreams she has denied herself for so long. And in the midst of it he manages to evoke, if not Japan, then the longing we all have for the unknown as well as the familiar, the jolt when we discover that what we always thought we wanted might have been what we had all along.~"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"This is Iyer's most lyrical, heartfelt work. More than a bit autobiographical, the book is rich with rhythms and cadences that conjure up Kyoto as it is: a complex, chaotic mix of old and new. Work and play have taken me to Japan many times, and to Kyoto in all seasons. This book remains among my modern favorites on Japanese culture, for the ways it captures the quirky little things so often \\"lost in translation.\\""},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"Any reviewer can find something wrong with a book, if s/he tries hard enough. And many have been quick to do so here. I suppose I could as well (e.g., by picking on Iyer for not going into the implications of the faux-Utopian society Japan has created). But I have absolutely no desire to do so. The book is so beautifully and deftly written, the romance so touching and piquant without falling into bathos, that it would, to me be similar to picking at the lovely haikus interspersed herein, stylistically complementing the lyrical writing.Yes, as one reviewer has pointed out, it is more memoir than what is called \\"Travel Literature\\"-though the boundaries between the two have always seemed blurry to me at best.This book will be enjoyed most by lovers of poetry, lyrical poetry - such as that of Yeats and Shelley, than by readers of the \\"hard-boiled\\" school of travel writing epitomized in V.S. Naipaul's works. If you believe that poetry is the deepest sort of writing, that one can get to \\"know\\" a society or people better through a Romantic relationship with a member of that society than by doing a Sociological study of it, if your dream life is as important to you as waking life, in short, if you have a poetic nature: This is the book for you!\\"Everyone falls in love with what he cannot begin to understand.\\"--Or, as Pico finds out, thinks he cannot, but through patience and love finds that he can...begin.PS-Pico and Sachiko are still together, according to wikipedia at any event."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"Most travel books follow a conventional path. An intrpedid traveller goes to an exotic locale and begins a journey from Point A to Point B. During the trip, the narrator describes the landscape and the intersting characters he meets along the way. The reader leaves the book feeling that they have a better understanding of some distant locale.Pico Iyer's \\"The Lady and the Monk\\" is a very different type of travel book. First and foremost, Iyer goes to Kyoto for a year and never really leaves the city. His book is more of a sedentary tale that revolves around his romantic relationship with a 30 year old, married mother of two.The emotional center of this book is about a Japanese woman's attempt to break out of the strict confines of a society that keeps her from realizing her dreams. This tale of rebellion and rebirth is not told by the woman but by her Anglo/Indian/American lover. His analysis and insights are interesting but they are by there very nature second hand. And yet the one area where Iyer is an expert, his own feelings, he is a bit coy. This is a very unusual traval narrative. It is interesting but not a classic."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"Can't believe how everyone raved about this book.

He makes another reference early in the book about street vending machines full of every kind of fruit juice you can imagine. I wish it were so! The only fruit juice you can buy in a vending machine is from an American soft drinks company, sometimes!

By the way, some reviewers keep referring to Sachiko as a &quot;character&quot; as if this is a work of fiction, which it is NOT. Pico Iyer obviously would not use the real name of the individual, but this is an account of his stay in Japan, not a fictional tale. I have been in Japan, and studied the Japanese language and culture for over ten years, and I can attest that Mr. Iyer's observations are accurate and descriptive of Japan.

Although Mr. Iyer was only searching for insight into Zen, he found much more than this in his relationship with a woman he met while in Kyoto. As their story unfolds, we are able to peel back the layers of what we conceive Japan to be, and we can see the jewel that has been a secret to the West since Perry sailed into Tokyo Bay.

It is Mr. Iyer's prose that carries the day and here he is at his warmest and at his best in evoking Kyoto, Sachiko,the romance of travel and the search for self-realisation.

The writing's not well-done, the love story with Sachiko (among other themes that could have been interesting) is wildly underdeveloped (what ever happened with her, anyway?), and his &quot;gee-whiz this is so different&quot; Pollyanna attitude loses its appeal very early in the book.

The book details both his coming to grips with Japanese history and society and her struggle to find her own identity within the constraints of the rigid roles that exist in Japanese society. In the end, both learn much about themselves, and about Japan.While The Lady and the Monk is a mainly a story about two people, it nonetheless manages to convey more about the nature of Japan than many books that devote hundreds of pages to that end. Iyer also conveys much of the spirit of Zen, and of the differences and similarlities between Western and Eastern culture, and how we perceive each other."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"I found msyelf somewhat interested in the story-line, but the ill feeling in my stomach took away most of the enjoyment. Iyer does not hesitate to pass judgement on just about EVERYONE in this sad, boastful book. He attempts to elevate himself by making semi-obscure literary references and speaking above the majority of his readership by using Japanese words and not adequately explaining all of them, as well as frequently referring to how much Zen literature he was reading, which is particularly ironic due to the fact that someone who truely understands Zen does not look down on everyone (or anyone, in fact) he meets. He also uses metaphors and similes that are overly complicated and often do not make sense, apparently constructed to show his great literary prowess. The overall impression I've derived from this book is that of a conceited individual walking around laughing to himself about everything and everyone he sees at the same time he professes his great love for it all. Please.That having been said, if you want to read a book with some insight on Kyoto and Japan, although it is somewhat inaccurate in places, and can handle the above-mentioned writing style, then by all means read the book. In my opinion, however, you'd be doing yourself a favor by reading something else."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"Save your money by not purchasing this book.Iyer strikes me as one of the most conceited writers I've ever come across, and I usually have a thick skin to that sort of thing.His florid writing and puffery frequently turned me off as I waded into this book.I'm an enthusiastic reader about Japan, and I've lived there and I can say that Iyer is writing for the folks back home (who may never visit Japan) and not reporting it straight. If you want a fancy-pants fairy tale, buy this book.I'd even rate Dave Barry's book about Japan as better quality journalism.If you want to read some first-rate books from an author who traveled in Japan and wrote about during roughly the same time, I wholeheartedly recommend Alan Booth.His books, _The Roads to Sata_ and _Looking for the Lost_ have a well deserved place on my bookshelf.Buy those instead."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"First let me just say i liked the book and could almost give it 4 stars. The reasons i decided to only give it 3 was the way it was written and the length.I feel Pico could have covered what he did in about 30-60 pages less if not more. The story mainly focuses on the way Japanese society is with it's reservations and freeness. Pico quotes old poems and he obviously wants to believe japan embodies these poems, but he finds that japan is more complex than he thought. The main relationship(a somewhat romantic one) is with Sachiko a 30 year-old mother of two, but she is more of a medium to express how japan is. It's somewhat hard to understand what I'm saying unless you've read the book. Some past readers have accused Pico of thinking he knows the Japanese, while this is somewhat true i believe he more presents his opinions for your to analyze.And for the way the book is written it's a bit jumbled. I think this book is better describe as pages of his thoughts and experiences throughout his time in japan, it's not a travel book. I think there are only a select amount of people who would feel satisfied with this both, or at least appreciate it.If you can find it at a library pick it up and give it a quick read and if you like it go ahead and buy it."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"I was very disappointed by this book. Based on the reviews, I thought it would provide some insight on modern Japan and it's culture. Unfortunately, the only insight it does provide is how hard it is for a 'gaijin' to penetrate the Japanese culture enough to know about it. This book is more about the experience of foreigners in Japan. Be warned..."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"When I think of The Lady and the Monk, I can't think of one coherent theme in the book. It seems to be more about the incoherent ramblings of a Santa Barbra hippie than a treatise on travel or finding one's self. I feel dumber for having read this and I hope Mr. Iyer never writes anything again."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"I bought this book used last summer and filed it away on a bookshelf, and finally picked it up two days ago. Even though these days, I read through most books slowly, I was sucked into Iyer's Kyoto world, and plowed through the book in two very enjoyable sessions.I was baffled to read some of the criticisms readers at Amazon gave this book. I found the accusations that Iyer is condescending to be the most perplexing. I've read lots of travel writing, and have found that many travel writers spend most of their time analyzing their chosen destination with a God-like impersonal analysis of the place's foibles that certainly does often come across as arrogant or ignorant.What struck me about this book was how much Iyer does *not* do this. He certainly spends a lot of time analyzing and trying to figure out both Japan and the people he encounters there, but he is no more critical of others than he is of himself, no more critical of Japan than of his own culture(s). He does not watch from a distance, but participates in what he writes about, from interacting with 'The Lady' to dipping his foot into the waters of a monk's life, and exposes his own floundering. He criticizes not only that which he participates in, but also his own foibles and inability to realize the rigor and discipline of Zen, his own inability to understand Sachiko and give her what she needs and wants.I came away from the book seeing Sachiko *not* as someone who is helpless or hapless, but rather, as someone who, like all of us, struggles between dreams and duties. Yet unlike most of us, Sachiko taps into a well of deep inner strength and vision and breaks through the restrictions of her cultural conditioning to realize her dreams. I thought Sachiko came across as much stronger, with more grace and understanding, than Iyer, who often is reduced to clumsy assurances as he tries to fathom her rich inner world. Yet this is not to say that Iyer comes across poorly, but rather that he comes across as an honest and likable narrator unafraid to expose the personal hues and struggles of his journey.The analysis of Japan and the people he meets in which Pico engages is a usual feature of travel writing, and as always, his analysis may or may not be accurate. But unlike many travel writers, he exposes his own biases and inaccurate perceptions often by comparing his idealized visions of Japan to the idealized visions of others about other cultures. He clearly shows how his preferences shape his experience, instead of presenting snippets of literature or cultural observation as if they were gleaned from an impersonal textbook about Japan. This is a very personal experience, and I find Pico to be a very warm, likable, and human narrator, whose personal sense of magic and wonder fills this book and transports the reader."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"Subtitled &quot;Four Seasons in Kyoto&quot;, this 1992 book by the British travel writer, Pico Iyer, is more than just a book about a place. Mr. Iyer spent a year in Kyoto to learn about Zen as well as Japan. Along the way he met a very special woman, Sachiko, and learned more about the essence of being Japanese than he ever expected. I was particularly interested in this book because I have a wonderful Japanese daughter-in-law and have been to Japan myself. I remember the few days we spent in Kyoto with fond recollections and smiled at the author's vivid descriptions. I also found myself nodding in agreement at some of the discoveries he made about Sachiko and her way of thinking as I, too, have had my eyes opened in similar ways.Mr. Iyer has the ability to paint a complex portrait in words. I found myself sharing his discoveries, from his experiences in the temples to the very modern music clubs. The center of the book, however, is Sachiko. She's 30 years old, the mother of two children and married to a Japanese businessman who spends 18 or more hours a day at work. She speaks English with difficulty but has read a lot of classic literature and is also an aficionado of a wide variety of pop music icons. In spite of her traditional upbringing, she yearns for a larger life, beyond the confines of her home.Mr. Iyer becomes her friend and they do a lot of sightseeing together. She's free all day and so is he, which makes their friendship easy. Some of the most interesting scenes are when he tries to speak Japanese and she tries to speak English and misunderstandings follow, both because of the language itself and also because of different ways of thinking.I'm a romantic and fully expected their relationship to blossom into an intimate one, but Mr. Iyer is so evasive that even though they do become very close, he avoids those kinds of topics. Instead, he focuses on what he perceives to be her feelings and his growing understanding of her. It seems a little strange to me that only in the later part of the book did he drop a gentle hint that their relationship was a bit more than that of just friends. But even then, I never was sure.This is a great travelogue. I not only learned a lot but also recognized things I have come to understand about the Japanese character. There are long sections about literature, both Japanese and Western, which I found to be boring. And the relationship between Iyer and Sachiko left me annoyed. But for a unique picture of Kyoto and a deeper understanding of the cross-cultural differences between Japanese and Westerners, I do give it a definite recommendation."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"The title of this book is a bit misleading. Yes, Pico Iyer does live in a monastery for a few days but his main emphasis is an exploration of Kyoto, one of the holiest cities in Japan.The title comes from a Buddhist story about a beautiful woman who tempted a monk, much as Buddha was tempted by an evil god as he sat under the Bodhi tree searching for enlightenment.Pico is an essayist for Time magazine and he is far more interested in the somewhat schizophrenic nature of the Japanese people than he is in Buddhism. His main subject is a housewife named Sachiko who is married to a Japanese &quot;salary man,&quot; who works from six in the morning until eleven at night. His family life is an afterthought. Sachiko loves everything foreign from the Beatles to Mickey Mouse. She calls Pico a &quot;bird&quot; because he is free to wander all over the globe while she is a slave to her husband and two young children.According to Iyer, Japan is close to a utopian society and Kyoto is the cleanest city he's ever seen. Sachiko is a fascinating character. When she introduces Pico to her children she apologizes for their misbehavior although they are much more well-behaved than western children Pico has known.Pico and Sachiko's relationship is perplexing at first. She hints that she might want something more than a platonic relationship. He's wise enough to know that it's the dream of a romance, the romance she's seen in the movies, that she's after.There are some wonderful moments in THE LADY AND THE MONK: Sachiko's mangled English with the occasional Japanese word thrown in and the lack of articles; Iyer's description of cherry blossom time; the albino monk Pico meets when he stays at the temple; the Hanchu Tigers last game of the year when Randy Bass, their American homerun hitter, bows to the fans fifteen times. The fans are just as enthusiastic as they would be if this were a World Series team and not a team thirty-some games out of first.The main emphasis of the book, though, is Sachiko's story arc; we see her beginning to grow away from her salaryman husband, we see her trying to make her dreams become a reality, despite the censure of her mother and friends. We get the impression that the more Japanese women are exposed to the West the more Sachikos there will be."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"I have two responses to this well-written travel narrative. First, I greatly enjoyed Iyer's observations and thoughts about contemporary Japan. Even though the book was published in 1991, much of it still seems accurate to me, someone who has traveled to Japan three times. Iyer, is a very good travel writer, one who is neither acerbic in the manner of, say, Paul Theroux, nor prone to the gauzy romanticism one sometimes encounters in western responses to Japan (like Cathy Davidson's \\"Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji\\"). He is alert to subtleties of culture and behavior that most travelers would never notice. So that's what I liked about \\"The Lady and the Monk.\\"On the other hand, the account of his relationship with Sachiko, the Japanese woman who longs to break free from her constrained life by cultivating relationships with foreigners, does not wear as well over the almost two decades that divide his experiences from the present. It seems dated and (since it is interwoven throughout the text) ultimately a little tiresome. Iyer's decision to render Sachiko's awkward English as he heard it (as opposed to conveying what she was saying in standard English) works at first, but eventually has the effect of making her seem much less thoughtful than she probably was. Iyer's graceful prose and Sachiko's stumbles as she tries to express herself in English are set side by side, even though he probably, to her ear, sounded even worse in Japanese. This flaw makes it hard to see their relationship as one of equals; there is a teacher-student quality to their conversations that becomes irksome. (I think it is this rendering of language inequality that makes some readers see Iyer as condescending, even though I don't think he means to be.) Do read this book for its many good parts, which almost make up for too much Sachiko."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"There is no doubt that Pico Iyer is a masterful writer: his descriptions of Kyoto and Japan are breathtakingly gorgeous. He does have a tendency to ramble at times, but the passages that are good are worth slogging through the ones that drag.However, there are parts of this book that do not seem plausible. Never once does he get frustrated by the language barrier or long for a cheeseburger. (I lived in Japan for three years and can attest its only natural to feel homesick or lonely.) He spends his year in Japan in perfect harmony with everything around him, has no troubles with the shabby guesthouse he lives in or the woman that (he admits) uses him to fulfill her warped idea of romance. He is guilty of his own criticism of how the Japanese seem so innocent, so willing to look at the bright side all of the time.Furthermore his relationship with \\"Sachiko\\" seems almost unbelievable. (PS - why does he even bother to change the name when he dedicated the book to Hiroko on the first page?) How does this Eton, Oxford, and Harvard-educated world traveller (who loves dropping names about all the great authors he reads) manage to fall in love with a woman who hardly speaks his language and who's never been outside of Kyoto? He goes on and on about all the deep conversations they had, when really I don't see how it's possible. He paints Sachiko like the kind of girl people go to Japan for all the time: always agreeing, never arguing, always dressing up and buying presents. He looks down on all the guys who come to Japan to find a girl and yet never admits he did the same thing. Furthermore, their relationship is so painfully selfish and childish that I can't help but hate the guy at times; he talks about his \\"great\\" romance but never discusses the subsequent divorce, financial difficulty, toll on the children, etc. As far as I remember, he only played with the kids a handful of times, instead stealing away with his \\"lady\\" at all hours of the night. I'm asking myself the whole time I read this book, \\"Who's watching the children?!\\" I'm sure these two love each other and all (as they are still living together. Are they married?) but I just think his recollection of their relationship is a bit too melodramatic, too \\"magical\\" to be believed. It's too innocent, too, by Iyer's definition, \\"Japanese\\".As a work of fiction this book is stunning, but as a memoir, I feel it's a bit too farfetched. But regardless his prose really is a work of art."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"Travel narrative writing is built upon one big theme: the intersection between fantasy and reality in unfamiliar cultural settings, and for whatever reason, it seems that the battle between one side or another of that thematic divide rages most intensely in the writings on Japan coming from non-Japanese.It strikes me that it's always about the dream of Japan (and clutching that dream very tightly, lest it slip away permanently), or the desire to explode myths, or a need to explain business strategies to Western CEO's afraid of competition on the other side of the Pacific, or a guide to picking up Asian women, or something equally self-absorbed.In the case of Pico Iyer's rich THE LADY AND THE MONK, it's all about the dream, and perhaps the women as well. The book is non-fiction, but very stylized in the fashion of a novel, so any sort of journalistic \\"this is how it is\\" conceits are tossed out quickly, and Iyer builds from a simple premise that is - nonetheless - laden with potential: move to some mythic place (in his case, Kyoto) knowing none of the language and little of the culture, and see if you can get by for a year.Quickly it becomes apparent that Iyer is infatuated with the \\"dream\\" of Japan - the Japan mythologized by Roland Barthes in his inscrutable EMPIRE OF SIGNS, and Iyer's writing is similarly woozy and ethereal, which I suppose is inspired by his own conceptions of classical Japanese culture, or literature at least. It works, because Iyer's writing does have a certain rhythm, and the compressed time frame lends the book a structure, and though Iyer gains precious few serious insights about the place, he does write beautifully.The book as a whole does propose an indirect, intriguing question that will hang around long after you finish the book: if you are an outsider (in any culture), what's the value of the myths and dreams you might hold about a place? Erroneous though they may be, how might they also represent ways of easing into the flow of a place both real and imagined, filtering the unfamiliar through the somewhat familiar? What are the risks in not just seeing a place as it is and diving in? In this fascinating book, Japan becomes Iyer's tabula rasa, a thing upon which he projects any number of fantasies and poetic imaginings, and somehow he does manage to gradually slip into a somewhat less woozy view of the place.His cryptically rendered relationship with Sachiko is presented more poetically, which I think is approriate (though Iyer clearly is also reaching for Kawabata territory here, which he fails to achieve), and he sidesteps the moral implications of the relationship, which is perhaps ethically squirrely, but Japan has - at times - famously been a place where outsiders travel to get laid, so I don't think he violates anything any number of other writers (some far more smarmy about it) haven't also violated. And certain of his anecdotes: the shy Japanese man who makes a rather spontaneous pass at him, or the sad gaijin in hostess bars (you can almost see Iyer making a mental note: \\"Don't become THAT GUY.\\") are amusing and a little touching in the rendering, hitting upon some essentials that transcend cultural boundaries.An odd, and perhaps difficult book which is more literary than fact-fixated. Nonetheless, far greater than most other reviewers would seem to think.-David Alston"},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"I was fortunate enough to visit Kyoto for a week during a three-month internship in Japan two years ago and instantly fell in love with the city. The harmony between the ancient and the modern in Kyoto and Japan in general is both astounding and captivating, and it was with great sadness that I had to tear myself away and head back to my job.After returning to America, I bought this book and read it twice, without putting it down, it so brought me back to Kyoto and Japan. I've not read any of Iyer's other books, but this one was excellent. He conveys a definite emotion in his writing, and one that is quite suited to discussion of Japan I think. A sort of tragic interpretation of the events he experienced, which fits in very well with the Japanese psyche, where the greatest heros are the ones who come to tragic ends.The reviews here which note that Iyer paints with too broad a brush, so to speak, I feel are unfounded. I don't think it was ever meant to be an encompassing guide to Japan or any sort of critique of its dichotomy-filled society, though he does note with care all of them he encounters. Instead, it is simply one man's experience in Japan, take it or leave it. Sachiko is a real person he met, with real problems, and she went about solving them in a real way. I know Japanese women in similar situations, so to say they either don't exist is silly.I don't want to say too much about what happens, so I'll just finish by saying that I personally found this book very moving. I miss Japan a lot and I hope I can go back soon. Five stars easily."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"Having lived in Japan for seventeen years and visited Kyoto in all seasons, I think that Iyer glosses over much that is representative of Japan today. And too, he portrays Sachiko as a hapless housewife, one who cannot function on her own or who is an emotionally challenged adult. How well could Iyer really understand her or the culture since he had such a poor compre- hension of Nihongo? And too, if this is a true account of his life in Kyoto, then he has done a terrible wrong to Sachiko's children. Divorce in Japan still leaves a deep stain on the honor and social position of those involved. And children from a broken marriage face ostracism in later life when seeking employment or even a marriage partner of their own. Iyer ignores much reality as he plods along with his romantic notions and fascination with Gion beauties. The book reads like something gleaned from a reading list of publications about Japan. And all that stuff about 'Zen'! The average Japanese salaryman or housewife would scoff at all of his 'insight'. They devote most of their waking lives to being good corporate citizens and pay only lip service to temples and Buddhist tradition. And children can be brats in Japan, like everywhere else, watching hours of tv, playing video games, and reading manga. Iyer is a bit 'chotto' coy and sentimental."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"I just finished reading \\"The Lady and the Monk\\" for the second time. While I enjoyed the book, especially the accounts of his romance with Sachiko, I do agree to some of the criticisms leveled by reviewers her.First, there are parts that get really tedious, sometimes redundant. Sometimes I end up skimming pages because he goes into some long rant about a Zen poet or about the way Japanese are.Secondly, it kind of bothers me that he can pretend to know the \\"way the Japanese are\\" by knowing one Japanese lady very deeply, and knowing a handful of Japanese acquaintances on a surface level. I wish he had made the effort to befriend more Japanese people - he spends most of his time either with Sachiko or with other foreigners. He talked to one Japanese businessman the whole time, and the only reason for that was because the businessman was trying to recruit him to come to his Zen retreat. Because of these facts, I tend to distrust that he can truly pretend to understand how the Japanese are, as he seems to overgeneralize about the Japanese by stretching the experiences of a few people, mostly foreigners, over the whole country.For a \\"travel book\\" he does not do a lot of travelling, even within Kyoto, it seems. In fact, he never seems to wonder very far from one section of town. It should more accurately be categorized as a memoir, not a travel book - just because it is set in a foreign country does not necessarily make it travel literature. In fact, the book has trouble finding a center - once the romance with Sachiko evolves, the Zen and cultural soulseeking almost become distractions - sometimes I would find myself skipping parts that I felt were extraneous so I could continue the story of their romance.Regarding Iyer's attitude, I definitely feel that the condescension others have noted is present, mainly in the perpetual referencing of how well read and well educated he is, and how surprised he was that he could actually hold intellegent conversations about things that interest him with the \\"average\\" people of Japan. Although I have read many of the books and heard most of the music he constantly talks about, I felt like there was an unfair expectation that the reader can always follow whatever books or ideas he's talking about. Naturally, many won't be able to - perhaps he was pushing the reader to be more literarily knowledgeable or perhaps he didn't even think about this fact, but at times it comes off as condescension.I can relate to Iyer's criticism of many of the \\"gaijin\\" (foreigners) however - although I don't know if that too is an overgeneralization (I'm going to live in Japan in the fall, so I'll find out). What distinguishes Iyer's approach (at least, literarily) to women and Sachiko from many of the other foreign men in his book is that Iyer does not expect to be treated like a god and does not seem desperate to find a Japanese girlfriend (his relationship with Sachiko develops over time). It does seem incredibly pathetic that lonely, lost foreigners go there, desperately seeking either an exotic Japanese woman or an exotic foray into Buddhism. Iyer's accounts of Southeast Asia in \\"Video Night in Kathmandu\\" demonstrate the same there. While Iyer himself sometimes lapses into exoticism, he successfully avoids falling into the out-and-out crudeness of other foreigners (according to his account).These criticisms aside, if you take the book for what it is - a story of a romance across cultural and linguistic barriers (with sometimes distracting, sometimes enlightening forays into Japanese religion and arts), it's enjoyable, at times touching and definitely memorable. One reviewer noted that in helping Sachiko break free from her cultural bindings, Iyer assisted in the collapse of her family and, thus, the shunning of her by the Japanese. I definitely sympathize with Sachiko's husband, and Iyer seems to, as well (although there is a mention of \\"another woman\\" at one point). The problem was that Sachiko felt constrained and was never able to live her dreams, even before taking on the duties as wife and mother. If Iyer had not come along, perhaps she never would have, and, while the children certainly seem like they have the most to lose by this decision, realistically Iyer probably would make a better dad that her Japanese husband, as he actually would be around to see them and spend time with them sometimes. I heard that Iyer and Sachiko are still together, but I have been unable to confirm it. I would be interested in finding out what happened afterwards. All in all, I enjoyed it, but pay attention when you read it to some of the assumptions he makes."},{"Title":"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Library Edition)","review":"I first flipped through _The Lady and the Monk_ ten years ago in a bookstore, well before the era of Amazon and online reviews. I liked Iyer. The book made its way onto my list of books that I might someday buy. I finally bought it last week and read it, groaning all the way. My initial attraction to the book and his particular brand of travel writing seems to have had more to do with my status ten years ago as a study-abroad, graduate-student returnee than his skill as a travel writer. Iyer presents a wide-eyed, Byronic pastiche of his year in Kyoto, trotting out cultural stereotypes of the Japanese and everyone else. Yes, he goes briefly to some hostess bars, wangles his way into a teahouse with geisha, and views the cherry blossoms. But these are experiences that once could have in a much shorter trip.It was apparent almost from the start that a romantic relationship was evolving between him and Sachiko, but he remains coy about it in the narrative, and continuously comments on Sachiko's pathos-filled attempts to express herself in English. Sachiko makes many late-night booty calls to him at his guesthouse asking to see him and crying on his shoulder in the street in the moonlight and he still \\"cannot fathom what it all means\\"?! (He \\"cannot fathom\\" quite a bit during his year in Kyoto.) Representing Sachiko as he has does a disservice to her as a person. Now that I've finished the whole overwrought story, I \\"cannot fathom\\" that Iyer returned from a year abroad, fresh off an international tryst, to capitalize on his former lover's personality in such an analytical way, mocking her English and judging her choices as dictated by her culture, finally ending up with her in foreign hotels where \\"bodies speak without language.\\" I fail to see how Iyer is any different from the other Western men whom he mocks for traveling to Japan to find Japanese girlfriends.As the book went on (I hesitate to say \\"progressed\\"), I felt myself becoming as judgmental of him as he was with the people who entered and left his life. Iyer is introspective at the expense of seeing the culture around him. The book becomes more about his feelings about being in a relationship with Sachiko than about Kyoto, Japan, or Japanese culture. I prefer my travel writing more honest, insightful and engaging, along the lines of Bruce Chatwin, Patricia Storace, or, yes, Paul Theroux. Liza Dalby's _Geisha_ is a far better book about traditional Kyoto culture by someone with a steadier hand and a more studied eye. I almost - almost - want to go back and read _Falling Off the Map_ again to see if it too strikes me as myopically introspective. Really, save your time and money. Check your library before buying this. I should have, and saved myself from the feeling of obligation to finish it."},{"Title":"The Practical Astronomer's Deep-sky Companion","review":"This book is designed with the amateur astronomer in mind.

It does more than tell you the \\"what\\", it also tells you the \\"why\\" as well and is filled with sidebar tips and tricks on how to do it right the first time. Since that engine, I have now rebuilt two Ford 8N engines and am currently working on a 1939 9N - I still pull this book out constantly.I don't write reviews often - this book is worth getting the word out on. You simply will not be dissapointed acquiring this book for your referernce and will get much more than your monies worth."},{"Title":"How to Rebuild and Restore Farm Tractor Engines (Motorbooks Workshop)","review":"This book is the essential companion to your tractor manual for rebuilding your tractor engine.

I searched the internet high and low never found an affordable copy so I bought the e-book from Google for $10."},{"Title":"De Occulta Philosophia Libri Tres (Studies in the History of Christian Thought, Vol.48)","review":"This book should be at the top of the reading list for anyone interested in Western occultism or magic.The original Latin text of Agrippa's classic is presented along with critical apparatus clearly showing variant readings in the editions. Includes a great introduction (in English) with a detailed analysis of Agrippa's sources and as well as an insightful and in-depth analysis of Agrippa's extensive 1533 expansion and revision of the text. Complete with helpful bibliographies and indices.The only disappointment I had was the fact that this edition does not include Agrippa's lengthy recantation, which was included in the 1533 edition.This is one of the most expensive books I've ever bought, but worth the price, especially for those with a command of Renaissance Latin."},{"Title":"De Occulta Philosophia Libri Tres (Studies in the History of Christian Thought, Vol.48)","review":"If you don't know who Agrippa was, you shouldn't be reading this review, unless you're a librarian who's been asked to buy the volume. Do an author search for \\"Agrippa occult\\" and start there.Now, assuming that you know who Agrippa (1486-1535) was, and roughly what his Occult Philosophy was, let's talk about this volume.This is a scholarly critical edition. The copious annotations do not so much explain the text as tell you what Agrippa is quoting or referring to, so you can look up more texts. The introduction is functional, but not terribly helpful to the nonspecialist. On the other hand, when I wrote my book on Agrippa, this thing was a constant and trusty companion; boy am I ever glad I shelled out for this!Agrippa's book itself is obscure and difficult, but at the same time it is the seminal attempt to develop a philosophical framework for magic as a practice. If you just want to read the book, read it in English (buy the Llewellyn edition) unless your Latin is stunningly good. So if you don't already know the book well, you shouldn't be spending money on this.The editing is meticulous, including constant explications of Agrippa's many references and sources. There is a wonderful index and bibliography, making the volume exceptionally useful -- Agrippa himself is deliberately confusing and at times seems disorganized. On top of everything else, the editor has included angle braces and further notes so that we get a complete edition of the Juvenile Draft (1510) woven into the final edition (1531/33). I can't say enough good things about the edition.Every library with a serious early modern collection should have this. Brill's books are extremely expensive, of course, but they are permanent. The paper is acid-free, the binding is very toughly stitched, and so forth. If you shell out for this text, you will still have it a long time from now. If you are not in control of a library's budget, though, you'd better try to get your librarian to order this.In short, this is a volume for a library, a specialist, or a wealthy Latinist. If you are wealthy enough to afford this and just want a cool edition, bear in mind that you can sometimes find Agrippa's _Opera_ in early 17th C editions for about what this volume costs --- no critical material, of course, but pretty. If you have good reason to want a critical edition, though, this one is not likely to be superseded."},{"Title":"De Occulta Philosophia Libri Tres (Studies in the History of Christian Thought, Vol.48)","review":"Renaissance Scholarship needed such a critical edition of this work.

I began to understand how Sql is designed as only someone who had written it could. I still consider myself a beginner developer but I'm not a beginner with Sql anymore.The SQL-Xml exposition is a book of its own. Over 100 pages of the deepest, best info you could hope for.

I found it much far more informative and much deeper than Kalen Delaney's book - the only other one that comes close. It is a book unlike any other that I have read on Sql Server in that it is extremely deep - deeper than just about any technical book I think I have ever read - and extremely broad. Most books are one or the other, but this one really is both. Every chapter is a treasure chest of useful info. Several could be books unto themselves. The discussion of DTS for example is actually better than whole books on the subject. The User Mode Scheduler chapter is so deep I had to read it twice. The list could go on and on.One thing I really appreciate about the book is that the author includes a good section (Approximately the first 300 pages) on Windows insides and fundamental concepts. His reasoning for including this type of info in a Sql Server book is sound: because most Dba's do not have the grasp of Windows fundamentals they will need to understand the indepth writing on Sql Server that he offers in the subsequent chapters and because he doesn't want readers to have to read multiple other books just to understand his. The author writes about Sql Server from the perspective of a professional developer and wants to first make sure his readers understand Windows and networking and COM and etc. at that level so that they can follow the rest of the book. It would have been easier for him to have said, \\"Read XML 101 chapter 8 before you read this chapter of mine,\\" but he doesn't take the easy way out. Instead he covers everything you need to know to understand Sql insides in a single book.The author's writing on Windows insides goes beyond merely providing info. He seems to be trying to teach basic debugging and exploring skills. He claims to want to teach Dba's and readers how to explore Sql insides on their own - the assumption being that no one book could fully cover Sql's insides given how complex it is and things continue to change. That is an admirable goal though I do not know if the average Dba is up to the task. Irregardless if you really want to understand Sql and gain the tools to continue to explore it for years to come you could not ask for a better book to launch from.I regularly read Windows fundamentals books and can also report that the author's writing on Windows insides is more thorough than that by any other author. It is also done from the perspective of Sql Server. The exercises often feature the Sql Server.exe process for example. When an application is investigated from a Windows insides standpoint that application is Sql Server. This Windows insides part of the book is an indispensable piece and a real gem. It could (and should) be a book itself.Another thing I really like is that the author avoids repeating what you can find in other Sql insides books and whitepapers. Somewhere at the beginning, I think in the preface, he says that he avoided covering the storage engine because it was already covered well enough elsewhere. Delaney's book has full writing on the storage engine and this book doesn't try to replace that. For that reason I think they make a nice set. The author's book gets into query processor insides, memory insides, threading insides, and many, many others, but leaves the storage engine and some other pieces to the books and whitepapers that preceded it. I see the most indepth and expansive Sql insides coverage in this book that I have seen in any Sql book, but I also see where he avoided needlessly repeating what other people have already well covered.Like the other two Guru Guide books this book is extremely well written. I was often impressed with the author's knack for making rather complex topics easy to understand. Nowhere is this more evident than in the User Mode Scheduling chapter wherein he takes a subject that is obviously rather complex yet critical to understanding how Sql Server works and that AFAIK is not covered in any other book (certainly not in Delaney's) and reduces it down to something anyone can understand. He builds on the Windows insides discussion earlier in the book to explain very succinctly how Sql Server schedules work to be done and carries it out. For me this was worth the cost of admission alone.If I had to pick just one book to buy on Sql Server, this would be the one. I'd follow it up with Delaney's book and the author's other Guru Guide books."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Architecture and Internals","review":"Every time Ken comes out with a new Guru's Guide, I'm blown away with the new things I learn just from skimming it on the first day.

This book has those answers. I really wish I had it at the start of my project, but then I suppose I wouldn't have been able to appreciate the detail to which this book delves.It does start out with a good bit of Windows internals before getting to SQL Server internals, but only as needed to provide a solid foundation. Great tips and tools for doing your own SQL Server spelunking are supplied as well.For large scale fine tuning, this book is a must have."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Architecture and Internals","review":"Every SQL Svr library needs an internals-architecture book of some sort. You just need that. You can have books that are more how-to info for specific tasks or troubleshooting specific types of problems, but you need at least one that talks about how everything is put together. This book is the one. It is head and shoulders above anything else that is available on SQL Svr including Inside SQL Svr 7.0/2K.What do I like about this book? I'm glad you asked that question. It stresses the importance of understanding the technologies that have been used to build SQL Svr as much as knowing how those technologies affect our practical use of the product. So, for example, it discusses why you need to know how asynchronous I-O works in Windows then shows one practical example after another to illustrate. By the time you get done, you have a great feel for how and why SQL Svr uses asynchronous I-O. You know it much better than you would had you merely read, &quot;SQL Svr reads and writes data asynchronously.&quot; You know the subject the same way the developers of the product must know it.Another thing I like about the book is how well it flows and how easy to read it is. An great example of this the User Mode Scheduler chapter. In a relatively short number of pages, Henderson explains the nitty-gritty details of one of the most important components in the server. Before reading this book, I didn't even know UMS existed.One last thing I like about this book is the exceptional example code. I'm used to book example code normally not having much value outside the context of the book. But things like the VBODSOLE library, the DTS Package Guru tool, the DTSDIAG tool, the xp_array extended procedures, etc., all have value apart from this book. I'd be willing to bet that people would pay for the CD for this book separately if they had to. It is that valuable. One chapter after another shows some nifty tool or useful code sample that has numerous practical applications.Basically, there is something here for everyone. If you are a coder, you'll love this book. If you are a SQL Svr DBA or developer and actually want to know what you're doing - if you really want to know SQL Svr inside-out - look no further. You have found your book."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Architecture and Internals","review":"This book is getting rave reviews, but I'm not as sold on it as everyone else. There are four parts to the book, and the first part, the fundamentals, is over 400 pages of a 1000 page book. Four hundred pages dedicated to teaching programming basics like memory management, file I/O, network I/O, and other basics. These basics are taught outside of SQL server altogether. The author argues that they are required for an understanding of the internals, but I wonder if they could have been moved to the back, or explained in the context of digging into the internals.In addition there is some repeat coverage with Hendersons other two books. The coverage is still excellent, but one wonders why it needs to be there when people are buying all three books as a set.For a book on internals there are some chapters that are written still at a very high level. For example the chapter on XML, which while it is a solid chapter, doesn't drill down the way you would expect from a book with this title.There is some very valuable unique content in this volume. This is why I recommend it. Examples include the sections on the chapter on Data Transformation Services. But then there are some points, like the brief 'Pseudo techie tactics 101' which are funny, but add nothing and just as easily could have been on a website.Overall, a little unfocused, but still very valuable for those that make a living on SQL Server."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Architecture and Internals","review":"I have collected several SQL server books through the years.

Even Amazon's discount price is pretty steep. I already have the first two Gurus Guide books so I wondered if I might already have everything I need from this author. Boy was I wrong.I found the sheer amount of data in this book simply mind boggling. I believe it has more Sql Server info that any other book I have read. It goes beyond the first two Gurus Guide books and beyond every other Sql Server book I have by plumbing the depths of the internal design of Sql Server rather than being mainly focused on the practical use of it.I also find Henderson a good read. I read through this the first time in about two weeks. The book flows well and keeps you interested. I went back a second time and worked through all the exercises (there are many) and tried to answer the knowledge measure questions. These knowledge measure questions should be good preparation for the Microsoft certification exams.One of my favorite chapters is the Server Federations chapter. This one taught me to read textual query plans and helped me correct a couple of misconceptions I had about them. It is a short chapter, but it is definitely a good one."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Architecture and Internals","review":"Nearly a half of this book consists of a rather detailed (almost on the programming level) exposition of the Windows NT/2000 operating system. Please reread the previous phrase and make sure it registered: I didn't say MS SQL Server, I said the *operating system*. Imagine the two latest Richter books (for Win2K) with most code excised, plus the Solomon/Russinovich one combined: that will be the first half of Henderson's book. I'm not sure I understand the reason for all this information to be in there.The rest is good, no questions (although there's some overlap with his other (very good) TSQL books).I find such a structure extremely unusual, unnecessary, and, due to an absolutely exorbitant amount of redundancy in the general OS area--unsuitable for anyone with even a moderate exposure to Windows programming. It looks suspiciously like padding to me, and again, the amount of it is simply mind boggling; I've never seen anything like that before. Four-five hundred pages of padding? C'mon.Now, one man's padding is another's bible, OK, I suppose this may be a feature rather than flaw to some. But please be aware of this and choose accordingly. I won't pretend to be an ultimate judge here (as for myself, I didn't buy this book).Just to be fair in general, I'll add that Henderson is a knowledgeable guy and a good writer, which is a rare combination. So I'm not saying the book is bad: I would probably buy the second half of it (for half the price). And I'd easily give this second part four stars, maybe five.--------------I wrote the above on January 18, 2005. Now, a personal update: I did get this book for half price and I read it, and you know what? I'm not giving even the second part this book four stars -- in fact I'm bringing my rating further down. The book is incredibly fragmentary, as if it's a pile of scraps of whatever the author had -- including sometimes sizeable copy/paste from his other books (look at cursors); sometimes irrelevant material (what does XML have to do with the server architecture?) -- all bound together for some unknown reason. In addition to and beside from sporting the totally exasperating degree of redundancy in the first half of it, this book is very unsystematic and not really true to the title -- I have a feeling that after the somewhat deserved success of Henderson's first two books the publisher said, well, while success lasts lets issue something huge and expensive, so just make it real thick and we'll sell it for sixty bucks. There is, still, some curious information in this book but it's just too much effort to dig it out from beneath thick layers of redundant/irrelevant/disorganized stuff (for example, suddenly there appears the term \\"spid\\" -- good luck finding what it is: index, whatever, it's not there).2007 bottom line: so, after all, I do not recommend this book. Get MS Press's books: well-written, intelligently paced, and systematic, they cover _most_ of what _everyone_ needs. If you want esoterica, read Celko. I have three books by Henderson, I've used them for a couple of years by now, and they're sorta OK but nothing to write home about; maybe they were unique in 2000, I dont' know, but purely empirically there seems to somehow always be another source you can get all the same stuff from, better organized and presented (MS Press books like Delaney's, or even 2005 docs online). This is one of those rare cases where my opinion of a book worsened after using it for a good while, and I will no longer look for books by this author. I also feel very funny about the profusion of content-free positive reviews for this (and other) Henderson books. I know this sounds paranoid, but hell, some things are just impossible to ignore.Good luck."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Architecture and Internals","review":"The book is good but is becoming quite dated. For those using SQL Server 2005 it is a little disappointing because SQL Server architecture has changed so much. Its overall value is reduced by this."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Architecture and Internals","review":"I have Delaney's book and find this one hand's down better. The best part is all the trouble the author goes to in order to give us the foundation to understand the rest of the book. Why is this necessary? Why do we need to understand a bit about how Windows works in order to understand SQL? Because the level of Henderson's coverage is so much deeper than anything that has been done before in any other SQL book, it requires a signficant amount of foundational knowledge. Henderson could have left all this out and referred people to other books, but there would be two problems that I can see with that. First: he would be taking the easy way out, and anyone who has read the Guru books knows he never does that. Second: we wouldn't have his unique insights and instruction on these foundational topics. I have read Richter and Solomon and, quite franky, Henderson is a better read. The book has an allure to it that is difficult to explain. The writing is downwrite engaging and hard to put down at times.Something that distinguishes this book from Delaney's book and other SQL books is its programmer mentality. I have never seen as much code and code-based teaching in another book as I have seen in this one. There is almost none in Inside SQL, for example. If you pay the bills by building or maintaining software systems of one type or another (esp. DB systems) this is your book. I lost count of the number of languages, object models, and APIs Henderson brings to bear to teach how SQL works: C++, C, VB, C#, Transact SQL, Assembly, and several others. Regardless of your proclivities, I think you will find some of this relevant to what you do.The last thing I will say about this book is that I thoroughly enjoyed the essays at the end, esp. the Fish one. No one has ever said it better. It is wonderful to have a \\"real\\" writer in the SQL camp. I thoroughly enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Architecture and Internals","review":"500 pages of Win NT/2000 fundamentals in a SQL Server Architecture book.

I hadn't got far before I realised that a high level description of the architecture was not going to be included because, according to the author, it had been covered in a previous book. Not good enough and I am asking the publishers for my money back.Also, treatment of things like explanations of XML in a SQL Server Architecture book ?

This books stand out from the crowd. First 400 pages of the book talks about the windows OS, which crucial to understand SQL Server internals since the database engine lot of OS features.

It gives the user a good understanding of some of the basic windows concept that are so fundamental to SQL Server internal workings."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Architecture and Internals","review":".Ken's latest Guru's Guide is an important book for SQL Server Professionals who build or manage SQL Server systems.SQL Server is tightly integrated with Windows, so understanding how SQL Server uses Windows services is essential to managing it effectively. This book covers the important Windows / SQL Server topics in significant depth, exploring each one from both a pure Windows perspective and then how it relates to SQL Server.The first half of the book is dedicated to covering technical Windows concepts such as I/O, Memory, Thread scheduling, Synchronisation &amp; Sockets as well as covering how SQL Server uses each of these. The second half of the book explores various SQL Server features in the depth you'd expect one of Ken's Guru's Guides.This is not a beginners' book. It will feel at home on your shelf if you're reading books such as &quot;Inside SQL Server&quot; (another excellent SQL book) or &quot;Inside Windows&quot;, both MS Press. These are all technically deep references for SQL people which offer real answers to the problems &amp; issues we face in working with SQL Server &amp; Windows. Many other books simply skim the edges of the technical topics that this book covers in depth.If you're trying to learn how to write simple SQL statements, this is not the book for you.

Some of the chapters are likely to be considered too in-depth, but the book is loaded with so much info that you're sure to find something that makes it a worthwhile purchase. The material is presented well and the kiddy stuff is skipped so you're not wasting time flipping through material you've known for the last few years. I like the inclusion of the MS Debugger. The examples in the book have given me an introduction to it, and in time I expect that it will come in handy. In my years of reading SQL Server books, few have been as comprehensive as this one. It goes somewhat beyond Inside SQL Server, though I have not purchased that book since SQL 7. This is the type of book from which certification questions should be derived. It describes the nuances in using SQL Server and I've enjoyed reading several chapters of this book highlighting along the way. I consider it a better reference than SQL Server 2000 Resource Kit, and my only complaint is that it doesn't include other important subject areas such as security and hacking. Those areas are addressed in other references like SQL Server Security by Andrews, Litchfield, and Grindlay which I've got ready to read as soon as time permits."},{"Title":"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Architecture and Internals","review":"Microsoft's SQL Server does not have all the functionality of Oracle or IBM's databases. But Microsoft has put a huge amount of work into beefing it up, as shown in this book. Henderson has done far more than just write a straightforward guide to the query syntax. In fact, the latter is not the emphasis here. Rather, he explains how SQL Server integrates into the Microsoft operating system, for one thing. Like memory mapped files, WinSock and network connections, and how they relate to SQL Server. He provides a long discussion of its memory management; crucial if you are heavily loading up the database. With queries and table joins, you get help on how to optimise, based on knowledge of SQL Server's innards.At over 900 pages, the breadth might seem daunting. But it reflects the complexity and potential of SQL Server.Henderson also provides some nice extra touches. Each chapter ends in a quick list of review questions, to see if you have been paying attention. Plus, at the book's end, he has 2 essays. One is on the drivel that constitutes most [all?] management fads. The second is on pseudo experts in newsgroups. The entire book is worth it, just for these essays!

Forget it.The first whole third of the book is Win32 in a nutshell. It tells you about memory, processes, I/O and everything. But I already have my Richter dog-eared all right, I wouldn't need a reminder in a book on SQL Server.Then, about the SQL Server. Internals ? What a joke. The only internals that you would find are names of the DLLs where this or that SQL Server subsystem resides and a few hardcore debugger sessions to show you those DLLs actually get loaded. Uh-huh, thanks.Can you imagine a book on SQL Server internals which doesn't mention pages and/or extents ? In-depth description of different execution plans ? This is the one.What this book really is, is 20 chapters worth of overviews for more or less known SQL Server features. Average-to-good overviews of a less known features. Uhm, architecture, internals ? Nope - SQLXML, DTS, notification services, cursors, transactions. Take cursors - it says there are four types of cursors, you know, static, etc. and shows an SQL snippet for each. That's basically it. Take transactions - ACID, isolation levels and usage hints. Oh well, it could be worse...Difficult to say without reading other books by the same author (not that I have an urge any more), but it appears he has written a whole series of them. You find sentences like \\"In my other book...\\" all over the place. Just love it:[quote]I must confess that I was conflicted when I sat down to write this chapter. I wrestled with whether to update the SQLXML coverage in my last book, which was more focused on the practical application of SQLXML but which I felt really needed updating, or to write something completely new on just the architectural aspects of SQLXML, with little or no discussion of how to apply them in practice.

The vb.net code taking up a full chapter on notification services for example is a take of from the visual studio.net help files except the example code is not usable. Why the author chose his audience would better learn from something that can't be used is beyond me. The first chapter is nothing but the table of contents usually found in most books before chapter one. There is MASSIVE amounts of duplication from the first two books in here. If you don't mind having hundreds of pages of duplication from the first two books, it may be an ok book for you to learn basic concepts from but it doesn't teach any real world practices. Not in the sense of useful information for a developer working in SQL on production code. There are many other titles that don't spend 4 pages at the beginning of each chapter espousing the author's virtues and simple reasons for writing it this way or that. Each chapter being different from the other. One chapter will tell you that you must learn and just giving examples is a bad idea, other chapters will tell you that examples of usage are the way to go. The author is easily swayed in his ideology by those of persuasive pennings, as is evidenced by his changes in philosphy over the three books and the flip flop and contrary statements throughout the book anyone who reads closely will see time after time.Also some of the code loads at boot and spybot search and destroy picks up it immediately. I'm not sure why sequin needs a memory resident piece running at all times using up valuable resources. That is not acceptable from book code, esp. a query analyzer of dubious worth. The other code in this book is looked upon suspiciously by award winning security software. Anytime I find a macro or code written in this manner I'm very leary of allowing it to run simply because it may not be written well enough not to accidently trash my system.

Their journey was also an inward jouney, a self-revealing and self-healing journey. Best of all it was an absolutely fascinaing journey for the reader, whether a Chaucer fan or not."},{"Title":"Looking for Canterbury","review":"Looking for CanterburyReviewed by Randall Dean Marshall, MDDirector of Trauma Studies and ServicesNew York State Psychiatric InstituteAssociate Professor of Clinical PsychologyColumbia University College of Physicians and SurgeonsJason Marks has written an accurate and thoughtful memorial to the many Vietnam Veterans who continue to suffer from the hellishness of war, and the humiliation of their homecoming. His story could not be more serendipitously timely. He gives life to the great loneliness that veterans have felt in a civilian world and, more tragically, among the politically and bureaucratically fragmented subculture of Vietnam veterans since the war.He shows how the power of the past and the depth of shame that connects us to the loved and dead cannot be underestimated; in fact, if one's story is desperately in need of telling, the willful silencing of it can determine the course of one's life. The great gulf between what we expect of ourselves -- i.e., courage and heroism -- and what we actually do in the chaos of battle can become an emptiness that simple forgiveness or religious exoneration cannot fill. He shows how guilt can become the primary emotional connection between the living and the dead, and how difficult it is to find a more livable way of honoring the lost. But most importantly, Mr. Marks reminds us that great literature can play a profound, transformative, even lifesaving part in soothing human unhappiness that springs from the dissatisfaction that moral people feel with themselves.Acceptance of human frailty -- and Chaucer's genius was its portrayal -- can be mysteriously difficult, and profoundly liberating. The descending wisdom of the lost owl, at the end, speaks for itself.I was moved to contemplation of these universal questions -- especially since Spetember 11, 2001 -- by reading Looking for Canterbury."},{"Title":"Looking for Canterbury","review":"What do a New York City butcher, medieval poet Geoffrey Chaucer and the Vietnam War have in common? They all served as creative fodder for Jason Marks' powerful and imaginative new novel, Looking for Canterbury. In an impressive literary feat, Marks has successfully applied the premise of an Old English classic to a modern-day tale and produced one of the most brilliant and insightful books you will ever read.As Looking for Canterbury begins, Vietnam veteran Harry Baylor and six war-scarred friends have lost control of their lives. Tormented by emotional demons spawned by horrific experiences in Vietnam, they have battled for years to purge the visions that haunt them and move on with their lives. Conventional therapy hasn't worked and they're quickly realizing that their homegrown support group is proving futile as well. Their destinies seem clear; they will endure mental torture for the rest of their lives. That is unless Harry Baylor has anything to say about it.Armed with half his life savings to finance his plan, Baylor, an enthusiastic fan of Geoffrey Chaucer, proposes that the group recreate the story-telling journey detailed in the poet's Canterbury Tales in New York's Central Park, essentially transforming them from a troop of soldiers to a troupe of actors. The challenge for each of them is to tell a tale that will distract the others from their worries. The only rule: the stories can have nothing to do with Vietnam. Sounds easy, but it proves more difficult - and dangerous - than they had ever imagined. As the trip progresses, the group comes to the painful realization that the demons they hoped to leave behind have, in fact, come along to spoil the ride. The mental reprieve they desperately need is in jeopardy, but they're not giving up. They've got nothing to lose but the remains of their sanity.Looking for Canterbury takes readers on a thrilling, sometimes painful, adventure into the human psyche. Thanks to Marks' profound ability to engage readers in the lives of his characters, you find yourself experiencing first-hand the acute emotions that surface during their journey. Filled with expertly crafted hairpin turns, Looking for Canterbury keeps you wonderfully off balance. Within pages, you find yourself laughing at a humorous tale, shocked by an unexpected emotional breakdown, anxiously anticipating a character's complete disintegration, then laughing again as you're suddenly pulled back from the edge of emotional chaos. Just as Canterbury's characters, you will find yourself enjoying a leisurely stroll through the park basking in rich scenery and heartwarming comradery while simultaneously running a mental race against the subconscious at breakneck speed.With its complex characters, fascinating literary allusion, rich description and gripping psychological insight, Marks' Looking for Canterbury is a 21st century classic, one you won't want to miss."},{"Title":"Looking for Canterbury","review":"A unique idea to have a group of Nam vets seek their own Canterbury, complete with costumes, food and even personalities similar to Chaucer's pilgrims, the stories they tell of course differ.

Konstam is also correct in his assessment that Fair Oaks, the first major action in a series of battles that doomed the Union offensive, has not received anything like the attention of other battles like Gettysburg, Antietam or Shiloh. According to Konstam, the Confederate counterattack at Fair Oaks on 31 May 1862 - although unsuccessful - introduced doubt into McClellan's mind about his own offensive's chances for success and thus represented a psychological watershed, somewhat akin to the 1968 Tet Offensive in Vietnam. However much the author presents this argument, it is not clear that he proves his hypothesis about the battle's historical significance.Fair Oaks 1862 begins with a rather lengthy 8-page introduction on the origins of the campaign, followed by a campaign chronology. The 6-page section on opposing plans has two sections: campaign plans for each side and tactical battle plans for the Confederate counterattack. The 6-page section on opposing commanders covers the major army and corps level leaders on each side, with photographs of all individuals cited. The 7-page section on opposing armies is built around a detailed regimental-level order of battle, but it actually says little about the strengths and weaknesses of each force. It is also disappointing that the author does not provide details on how much cavalry or artillery each side had. The campaign narrative itself devotes 25 pages to the siege of Yorktown and the battle of Williamsburg, and 23 pages to the battle of Fair Oaks. The author provides five 2-D maps (the eastern theater in spring 1862; the Union landings in April 1862; Yorktown to Williamsburg; McClellan's advance to the Chickahominy; the Confederate advance), three 3-D maps (the battle of Williamsburg; the Confederate assault on 31 May 1862; the Union counterattack on 1 June 1862) and three excellent full color battle scenes (the Confederate withdrawal from Yorktown; the storming of Casey's redoubt; Confederate cavalry looting Tunstall's station). Readers should note the slight pro-Confederate bias in that all the battle scenes are primarily from the Confederate viewpoint. Also, the author's writing style in this volume is onerous, with many paragraphs over one page long and some over two pages in length.There is some significant bias evident in these pages, and it is clear that the author's sympathies are with the Confederates. Prior to the Peninsula campaign, Konstam describes the Union defeat at Ball's Bluff on 21 October 1861, in which he states that the Union brigade commanded by Colonel Edward Baker was &quot;destroyed&quot; and that &quot;Baker was killed...along with most of his men.&quot; Konstam uses this action to suggest the greater tactical prowess of Confederate troops but virtually ignores the fact that the Union unit was conducting a difficult river crossing. Furthermore, although the Union brigade suffered about 54% losses, only 49 troops out of 1,700 engaged were killed and Confederate casualties were nearly as large. Konstam is also somewhat disingenuous about the Battle of Williamsburg in stating that McClellan &quot;allowed Johnston [the Confederate commander] to slip away.&quot; Readers should note that the author does not mention casualties at Williamsburg - which were over 1,900 killed and wounded for the Union and over 1,200 for the Confederates - losses comparable to the battle of First Bull Run. Williamsburg was in fact, a successful delaying operation for the Confederates, but the heavy casualties indicate that the Union army did not let them slip away unscathed.Virtually the author's entire hypothesis about the campaign revolves around the psychology of McClellan and Konstam concludes that, &quot;the battle marked a turning point, as from that moment on, McClellan lost his nerve.&quot; Although Konstam criticizes McClellan's over-caution throughout the text, he is also quick to blame President Lincoln's retention of McDowell's command near Washington as undermining McClellan's determination to push on to Richmond. However, there is little to suggest that McClellan was ever really serious about smashing his way into Richmond, given his perennial search for reasons to waste time and the non-availability of McDowell's corps might have been a convenient excuse for grinding to a virtual halt within sight of Richmond. Konstam never raises the possibility that McClellan may never have been serious about storming Richmond and that his offensive may have been designed merely to give the Union a strong hand at the bargaining table; Konstam should have mentioned that two years later, McClellan ran for the presidency on a platform that called for a negotiated settlement to end the war. Whether or not McClellan was thinking along these lines in 1862, it is clear that he was not thinking along Lincoln's lines and in a republic where military commanders are subordinate to politicians, this is taboo. Given &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson's rampage in the Shenandoah Valley, Lincoln's decision to retain strong forces near the capital was prudent.If McClellan was truly committed to an offensive strategy, it is hard to see how a botched Confederate counterattack at Fair Oaks - which cost the rebels heavier losses - could have shaken him for his plan of action. Between 1 June and the start of the Seven Days fighting on 26 June, McClellan had almost four weeks in which he neither attacked or retreated - this was far more than indecision, since if he had truly lost his nerve as Konstam suggests, he should have ordered a retreat to defensible lines before Lee struck. Konstam's account also suggests that the Union army was tactically inferior to the Confederates, but the fact is that of the ten actions fought between April-July 1862 in the Peninsula the Confederates only achieved one tactical success (Gaine's Mill)."},{"Title":"Jem","review":"A dark satire, I suppose you would call this.

Scathing in its indictment of the US government and IMF for such advocations as denying AIDS drugs to third-world countries (unless sold at inflated prices no third world nation can afford) and demanding privatization of scarce water resources, as well as gauging how September 11 changed America and the world, The New Crusade is a sober, thoughtfully argued presentation not to be taken lightly and deserving of as wide a readership as possible.

It's because they hate our freedom - was the picture painted by the media and the US government. It was a nice, comfortable idea (this line from book). If you delve into this question a little further, you will soon realize, \\"they\\" probably don't care how you live inside your country, and they might actually care more about what the US government is doing outside the US. We obviously don't sympathize with the brutal and senseless actions of the fanatics that caused 9-11. However, the actions of the US government cannot be justified either. The bombings took a lot of innocent lives and will continue to do so for several years from starvation, disease and even unexploded bombs. War as we know is death for the people who live there. What's very bothering is that a lot of people believe that this war was and is justified. A lot of people believe the lives of children and innocent people are justified.If you want to get an idea as to why they hate us, and whether or not the war can be justified, this book will give you a great insight. The book also talks about how the war on terrorism is affecting our daily lives here, our future, and what we can do to help.

Others have already discussed the books strengths so I won't go into them here, but there is one problem I have with it.For all his research into the history of the United States' constant flaunting of international law, he fails to draw the logical conclusion from it: the United States will not obey any law that it does not want to. From the local to the international level, laws are only as good as they are enforceable; otherwise, they're just words on paper. To put it another way: political power grows from the barrel of a gun, and the US has the most and the biggest guns so there is little reason to believe, as Mahajan and others like Noam Chomsky do, that an international body can somehow compel the US to do anything. Before we start looking to the UN for solutions, we should see what it's track record has been when it comes to preventing or facilitating US militarism and we'll find that it consistently does the latter. Is that simply due to weak-spined political leaders? I don't believe so. It's because the US is such a cornerstone of international capitalism, that its role has to be preserved for the system to keep functioning, even at the short-term expense of other nations. What that implies for social justice movements is that we must be brutally honest about our country and its social-economic system, and I think any debate has to start with this premise.Despite that, I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good understanding of the US government's post-9/11 actions, both domestically and internationally.Addendum: for further confirmation of Mahajan's concerns about of domestic anti-Arab hysteria , see Jill Malter's review of this book on August 5, 2005. In it she says, among other things:\\"Sami al-Arian! For those of you who don't know who he is, he's on trial for having been the North American leader of Islamic Jihad, a notorious terrorist group that has claimed \\"credit\\" for attacks that have killed at least 100 people in Israel and the disputed West Bank territories. He's also accused of having played a crucial role in writing the Jihad's constitution, raising money for the Jihad, helping other Jihad leaders enter the United States, and planning an extensive espionage operation.If there were just one person the United States ought to have been firing from their position, arresting, and putting on trial, it might well have been al-Arian. He's not the right person to try to defend by claiming anti-Arab racism! He's not the right person to try to defend by implying that his only crime was that \\"in his youth\\" he made 'an intemperate speech.'\\"Notice how she points out that he's 'on trial' and 'accused' of certain activities in the first quoted parargraph above. Nothing proven yet. Then in the second paragraph she basically pronunces him guilty and says it was right for him to be treated the way he was.Here are some other facts: the unjust perscution of Al-Arian was exposed in a salon.com article on Jan. 19, 2002 - it's still online. He did work with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in the early 1990's but that was legal since the PIJ had not been put on the terrorist watch list until 1995. In 1996 the university itself investigated the charges and found no evidence to support the allegation that Al-Arian was involved in, or supported, terrorist activities. And in 2000, a judge addressed the charges and found there was \\"no evidence\\" that either of Al-Arian's groups were fronts for militant Palestinian terrorist groups.On December 6, 2005 he was found not guilty of funding terrorism at his Federal District Court trial in Tampa."},{"Title":"The New Crusade: America's War on Terrorism","review":"From year to year while amassing wealth and light-heartedly thinking that one can shut out world poverty and problems, the nation was forced to open its eyes to the atrocities of imperialism with the September 11 attacks. Mahajan's New Crusade speaks on U.S. imperialism and its effects on subordinate countries. From the blatant defiance of international law to impoverishing sanctions on Iraq, he touches on several subjects to explain the root of the 911 attacks and a prelude to potential Third World retaliation that he aptly labels the \\"blow back\\".Mahajan begins by explaining the role of the media as a propaganda machine, shifting public attention away from foreign policy and to justify war with Afghanistan. Weeks after 911, President Bush addressed the nation in his first speech by stating \\"America was targeted for attack because we're the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the world\\" (p 13). Mahajan adds that news anchors jumped on the \\"They hate us for our freedom\\" bandwagon to stir controversy. He quotes the omnipotent news anchor Dan Rather of CBS News as saying, \\"They hate us because they are losers. They see us as winners. And those who see themselves as losers sometimes develop a deep and abiding hatred for those they see who are winners\\"(p 13). An onslaught of like statements invoked a delusive sense of supremacy, arrogance and promoted prejudice that according to Mahajan, was designed to steer public attention from the motives of the attack.Virtually unknown to the public, Mahajan also mentions the initial agreement of the Taliban to extradite Osama Bin Laden to Pakistan where he would be tried by Islamic law provided substantial evidence was produced indicating involvement in the 911 attacks (p.21) and the refusal of the Bush camp to negotiate. Though The New Crusade was published in 2002 during the Afghan war, Mahajan accurately predicts the recent Iraq conflict stating that the country has been a target since the early nineties during the Gulf War. He writes about the illegal patrolling of British and American aircrafts over Iraq in no-fly zones (p 91), and the continuous police of Iraqi nuclear weapons while neighboring countries are allowed to freely stockpile arms.An additional slap in the face came with the 25% taken from Iraqi oil sales to repay Western oil companies for their \\"loss\\" during Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. These penalties hinder cash flow into the country, stifle local economy and place Iraqis at the mercy of a Saddam ruled, Western funded governmentBesides from some slight personal disagreements, specifically Mahajans' view of racial prejudice towards Arabs following the attack (p 71-75), the book is well written and gives excellent facts about U.S. foreign policy and offers a non-conventional view of the US and its relation to the rest of the world. It points out the flaws of the United States: arrogance and its refusal to follow international law (Mahajan notes $17 billion to owed Nicaragua for civilian bombing as ordered by the World Court in 1986 has yet to be paid). Information provided needed for a government, community and most importantly an individual self-assessment. In order to establish global harmony we must first evaluate ourselves, recognizing weaknesses and creating solutions to overcome them. This cannot be successful if we (as a nation or individual) are not aware of our actions or purposely choose to ignore how they impact others. America should be more socially conscious of the evil that it produces if not for the sake of morality for the sake of karma. - V. Jennette-Evans"},{"Title":"The New Crusade: America's War on Terrorism","review":"If you've ordered this book and read it, then you've taken the first step to freeing your mind from all the garbage the media suffocates us with. And if you swallow these eye-opening books like I do then I earnestly recommed anything by Noam Chomsky, as well as these two books, which will no doubt enlighten you about the Bush administration and the war in Iraq: (1) War Plan Iraq: Ten Reasons Against War with Iraq (Milan Rai); and (2) STUPID WHITE MEN (Michale Moore). And if you love a good laugh, here's a satire on Bush and the media: The little samba boy (Jay Singh). The truth is out there."},{"Title":"The New Crusade: America's War on Terrorism","review":"ountry, without evidence to his guilt presented. And, according to the London Daily Telegraph, the Taliban had agreed to extradite Bin Laden to Pakistan where he would be tried within the framework of Islamic law before an international tribuanal, which would decide to try him themselves or extradite him to the U.S. Apparently General Musharaff scuttled the deal, obviously under U.S. pressure. The author notes that the U.S. demanded that the Taliban open all \\"terrorist training camps\\" to U.S. inspection and the Taliban must hand over everyone in the vaguely defined \\"terrorist support structure\\" of Al Qaida. No sovereign state could accept these demands; thus the bar was set so high for the Taliban that war was inevitable. The author says that this war is simply about terrorising third world countries who refuse U.S. demands. Getting Bin Laden is a goal but it is really further down the list. The author points out that the threat of bombing and then the bombing itself caused the creation of about a million internal refugees within Afghanistan, severely exacerbating the humanitarian crises in that country. The threat of bombing and then the bombing forced aid agencies in the country to suspend their work most of the time. He quotes a Christian Aid official as saying that the humanitarian crises during the bombing was not related to the Taliban blocking the relief efforts but the U.S. bombing. He points out that with seven million people desperately needing food in the midst of the bombing, the U.S. government had to cover its tracks a bit. This was done by dropping 37,000 food packets on the country, ridiculous not just for the small number compared to the actual needy, but, as was denounced by the aid agencies, it is very difficult to distribute food to the needy that way. Aid agencies argued that it was perniscious that humanitarian aid was being dropped with bombs. The author points out that the U.S. really didn't block aid distribution after the Taliban fell; they just really didn't do anything to help that distibution, whatever the rhetoric. The author notes that the heroic efforts of the World Food Program averted widespread starvation for a few months last December. The WFP said that the danger of widespread famine was over but other agencies said it was only not a danger for a few months. The speculates that tens of thousands of people at minimum died because of the cutoff aid caused by the threat of bombing then the bombing from September to December 2001. This in adition to the probably 4,000 people who died from the bombs themselves or who accidently picked up a cluster bomb, which were strikingly resembled the yellow food and medicine packets that the U.S. was dropping as part of its sham humanitarian operations. The U.S. packets with medicine had instruction for dispensing written in English for a nation of people, the vast majority of whom can't read their own language.The author notes that a hundred people were dying a day in January at the camp of Maslakh near Herat and that there was still numerous reports of inability to access isolated villages cut off by snow. Those villagers of course, were surviving by eating bread made of grass. The author notes that the amount of banditry and lawlessness, particularly harming aid distribution, vastly increased with the Northern alliance takeover of the country. And the author notes that the Northern Alliance barbarians, though including a few women in their government-- greatly impressing Western intellectuals-- instituted a harsh farm of Sharia (Islamic law) law and a judge announced that adulterers would still be stoned but with smaller ones than the Taliban used.The author says some other interesting things. He refers to the furor about the CIA being \\"restricted\\" from doing business with terrorists, by the Church committe of the 70's, the law passed in 1995 requring CIA agents to get permission from headquarters to business with human rights violators and so on. He notes that the CIA managed to fund its largest operation ever in the 80's supporting the Al Qaida-types in the 80's in Afghanistan. He quotes Carter's National security advisor Zbygniew Brzesinski as as saying that the United States had been covertly funding the fundamentalist fanatics in Afghanistan, trying to provoke the Russians, at least six months before the Russians invaded in December 1979. He notes that it dosen't look very smart to give even more power to an organization, the CIA, that created, funded, armed and trained these \\"Afghan Arabs\\" organizations like Al Qaida and then left them to be set loose on the world. He points out that the CIA was able to fund very well the terrorist contras in Nicaragua. And he quotes the CIA spokesman as saying under the 1995 rule, agents have been rarely refused requests to work with various thugs.He discusses other matters like the U.S. forcing the shutdown of the Hawala money transfer affiliate in Somalia, on the grounds of its suspected ties to Al Qaida, though no actual evidence has been found of it (U.S. government assertions don't count). The author speculates about the closure of the prime way of getting money into Somalia will lead or has led to the deaths of many thousands of people. He notes that the U.S. \\"humanitarian mission\\" in Somalia back in 1992-93 was actually intended to secure a foothold in a strategically important and mineral rich area. It had been undertaken after most of the famine was over. After funding the Somali dictator Mohammed Siad Barre, overthrown in 1991, whose bloody rule was largely responsible for bringing the famine about, the U.S. managed to kill 7,000 to 10,000 people during this intervention. Nobody remembers or even knows about that but they remember the American servicemen killed."},{"Title":"The New Crusade: America's War on Terrorism","review":"Amazingly clear, Mahajan's book considers topics like our freedom, our security, the media's tactics and influence, analysis of polling data, the relationship of race to our government's activities, humanitarianism, and likely new directions in military activities. Ending on an optimistic outlook, in just 150 pages Mahajan demonstrates his ability to provide sourced facts, relevant history, and crystal-clear logic in explaining the complex topic of our response to terrorism.This book should be required reading in American high schools and colleges, for both its exemplary writing style and its content combined with an explained logic."},{"Title":"The New Crusade: America's War on Terrorism","review":"Excellent review of the issues whether or not one agrees 100%. It is unfortunate that the reviews are all positive because it means those who SHOULD read it wallow in books and opinions that support their own biases. No right wing or JDL reviewers here. No pompous Bennett or bigot Pipes. Should be assigned to all members of Congress (with a quiz) before they debate Iraq too. (But now freshmen get sessions with Rush Limbaugh rather than Harvard's school of government that better reflects the intellectual standards of the Right and of Bush.) The mainstream Press, and members of Congress fear truth - or even different opinion - unless subsidized by voting blocks and paid for by the beneficiaries of Bush tax reform. ('Making the world safe for Billionaires' is the order of the day, not truth, justice, or democracy - not even civil rights.)"},{"Title":"The New Crusade: America's War on Terrorism","review":"At a time like this, when government propaganda is forced down our throats, Mahajan offers a devastating critique of U.S. foreign policy. He shreds the facade behind the \\"war on terrorism.\\" He shows the hypocrisy of the vicious attacks on the people of Afghanistan under the guise of freedom. As he points out, the Bush government planned an invasion of Afghanistan prior to 9-11 . Why?- well, let's see- OIL.If more of the media had Mahajan's cynicism toward the government, the American people might know the real story behind the \\"war on terrorism.\\" I await his forthcoming book on the invasion of Iraq.My only complaint is that he goes on side issues, like affirmative action, which have nothing to do with the subject. Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars."},{"Title":"The New Crusade: America's War on Terrorism","review":"Is there a risk that following the events of September 11, 2001, the United States may be overreacting, or acting in an improper or counterproductive manner? Of course. We need some thoughtful, objective, and constructive criticism. And some good advice. But this book doesn't provide it.I'll mention just a couple of areas where I think the book disqualifies itself from being helpful. The first is in the discussion of a racist American backlash against innocent Arab Americans. And a backlash against dissent from American policies. That's something that I do not take lightly. And what this book says will, in my opinion, make matters worse. Mahajan says \\"the backlash against dissent got so bad that even one tenured professor lost his job because of it.\\"Um, who lost his job?Sami al-Arian! For those of you who don't know who he is, he's on trial for having been the North American leader of Islamic Jihad, a notorious terrorist group that has claimed \\"credit\\" for attacks that have killed at least 100 people in Israel and the disputed West Bank territories. He's also accused of having played a crucial role in writing the Jihad's constitution, raising money for the Jihad, helping other Jihad leaders enter the United States, and planning an extensive espionage operation.If there were just one person the United States ought to have been firing from their position, arresting, and putting on trial, it might well have been al-Arian. He's not the right person to try to defend by claiming anti-Arab racism! He's not the right person to try to defend by implying that his only crime was that \\"in his youth\\" he made \\"an intemperate speech.\\"Well, let's see how this book deals with the Levant. The author says that the Oslo process was about the Arabs \\"bargaining away part of their internationally recognized rights to the whole of the occupied territories.\\" Unfortunately for him, there is no such right to all of the disputed West Bank. Nor is there even a right to ethnically cleanse all Jews (or Arabs) who might wind up on the \\"wrong\\" side of the Israeli border.You can give constructive advice on how to deal with terrorism. Or you can support terrorism and taunt its victims. But you can't do both. And this book is defending the bad guys."},{"Title":"The New Crusade: America's War on Terrorism","review":"Rahul Mahajan seems to think that in a world of international terrorism, rogue, criminal nations with WMDs, an irrational fear of globalism and a tremendous amount of religious extremism that the United States is the enemy of all nations and the root of all evil.I found Mr. Mahajan's arguments incomplete, mixed with inaccurate information or out of context. This book, in my own view, is mostly unsupported opinion and 'spun' viewpoint."},{"Title":"The New Crusade: America's War on Terrorism","review":"This is a book that need to be read twice. It sounds plausible and well researched especially to someone that feels confused about the Iraqi developments (someone like myself). But closer attention to the barrage of facts show them to be a clever arrangement of half truths arranged to buttress a preconceived notion which is 'intellectually correct'.Americans are very sensitive about their sense of fairness. It is sad to see Authors like these take advantage of the innate naivete of well meaning readers.Take for example the chapters on myths about ourselves.Whatever the point (racism, free-speech etc) the US is far ahead of every decent sized country.

For the most part I skimmed the book and focused on the times when Barrons was present.

I've read the entire Highlander series about three times. The character development, the plots, the romance, the uniqueness of all her Highlander books drew me in from the very beginning. Not so much Darkfever. It took me over a week to finish it which is rare, I usually finish her books in a day, two at the most. There was virtually zero character development, unless referring to an \\"unseelie\\" and then there is all kinds of details, which I could care less really, what the Gray Man actually does and looks like. I disliked the fact this book was billed as romance. I dislike the fact that we are supposed to believe a girl in throes of grief for her murdered sister had enough forethought to pack her girly nailpolish and adorable, \\"pretty\\" silver and gold sandals and cute little matching twin sets and skirts. What.Ever. I can suspend reality only so much, and this book truly tested my limits. What really disturbed me was the gratuitous sex scenes that bordered on rape that were thrown in strictly because it's expected. I hope this Darkfever series is on the fast track so she can get to writing her outstanding Highlander novels once again. So many wonderful romance writers have jumped ship and left historicals and romance novels behind to pursue other genres. It's a shame Karen has done the same."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"It seems that all of my authors in the \\"got to buy immediately\\" category have been failing me on their most recent efforts.

This title could have been condensed to a couple of chapters prefacing this tangent to KMM's series. In reading Darkfever, I did something I would never have thought possible with a KMM book.

I don't plan to read anything else in the series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"After waiting so very long for Ms. Moning's book, I was extremely disappointed. I found myself skipping pages looking for something as exciting as her Highlander series.There was no development of sexual tension or romance between the heroine and the hero.

Based on the descriptions and some of the comments on Goodreads, I was expecting the typical urban fantasy heroine and a brooding, mysterious guy wearing a duster. I fought reading this series for awhile. I didn't think it would interest me and I would be bored, but feel obligated to plow through all the books b/c I had to know how it ends. I also held off on starting the series until the final book came out b/c I absolutely despise cliffhanger endings just as much as I do love triangles. So a few chapters in, I realized I incorrectly judged this book based on a few one paragraph summaries.I like Mac. She's normal, relatable and wants to pee in her pants at the thought of \\"saving the world.\\" I like that realism in an unreal world. Quote: \\"It was one heck of a tall order for a short-order bartender. I would have snorted if I hadn't been on the uncomfortable verge of peeing my pants with fear for the past half hour.\\" The book is a little dark, but not oppressively so. Barrons is almost unlikeable, but I won't write him off just yet. After all, he DID paint her nails at the end of the book. I gave it a 3.5 because some parts dragged for me. Again, it's the whole world/character building handicap of book ones. Anyways, I like the series enough to be excited about reading book 2."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Someone recommended this to me, but it was just really slow. And considering how upset Mac was I thought it was odd that I couldn't feel any of her upset. I dont know. Maybe it was me. It seemed like it should have been a good story, but I just didnt connect."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I want to start off with the positives since if affected my rating of the book more: First off, the storyline was amazing. It was incredibly interesting and I didn't find a single dull moment. Second, the creatures. Moning's sidhe-seers and fae are so unique from any other book I've read. It was refreshing and a lot of fun to experience something new. Lastly, the world Moning created. I could picture everything and that is really important to immersing yourself in a book. Honestly, I would read the whole series just to experience the world in these books.On the other hand I have two major complaints; I didn't like either of the main characters and the way the book was written irritated me. To start off, let me just say that I feel Mac will eventually grow on me but I was expecting a hugely different person when I began reading. I expecting a kick-butt chick who'd be witty and humorous (yeah, yeah ie any heroine from other urban fantasy books). Mac... isn't really any of these things. Things meant to be funny just seemed whiny. I'm completely okay with her incompetence, I think it's fun to see her grow but even at the end of the book she's willing to give up. Next up, Barrons. What an jerk! I don't get anyone's attraction to him at this point. Okay, so he was marginally likable by the end of the book but I can't forget all of the nasty things he's done leading up to that. Am I just spoiled because I've read so many books that have insanely amazing male leads? I'm not asking for perfection, I'd just like one or two redeeming qualities. And now for the styling of the book: I don't like having the narrator spoil the end of the book for me or really any other parts of the books. Mac was constantly telling us \\"I didn't know it then but...\\" and fill in some major plot point there that ruins a scene several chapters later.All that said, I did enjoy the book. It didn't live up to my expectations but I will continue reading the series because it is still worth it. I hope Mac and Barrons at least become less of a problem for me, I really want to like them."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Confession: I only read this book because it was FREE. I had never read anything from or about this author before. It suckered me right in and left me on a cliffhanger. Great marketing scheme.

I'm just not one of those that can wait for the next book when a book ends (or should I say NOT ends) on a cliffhanger. When the final book was released, I started by rereading this book. The main character is annoying. The rest of the characters are mysteriously aggravating as well. It was like watching the 1st season of Lost, I had more questions than answers. Thankfully this series eventually did wrap up the questions. With twists and turns the whole way. I liked that I wasn't able to figure things out before I was supposed to. I liked not knowing the good guys from the bad. I only gave it 4 stars because the books must be read in order and you have to read the whole series to completion.

She searches for who is responsible for killing her sister and heads to Dublin. Ends up getting abused by Barons then abused some more by V'Lane and these men are potential love interests. I loved the book store Barrons owns and the decription of it. The book is set up for you must read book 2 to get any answers and even then after book 2 you get more questions. Some love this, I enjoyed it a little but got frustrated. I'm sure lots of fans would disagree with me and everyones entitled to their own opinion, but beware if you start this series you'll need to read the rest of the series to get any closure and mostly the other books in the fever series gave me a headache.

But, other books kept jumping out at me. I'm glad I finally picked it up. It's a very interesting start to a series I think I will really enjoy.If it weren't for the sexual aspect of this book, it could be borderline YA. MacKayla is only 24, and still has some late teen tendencies. She's young, naive, and somewhat unfocused. She's content to go through life for the moment, although you get the feeling she's on the brink of being forced to grow up. And then here sister is murdered, and she feels like she's the only one who can solve the case. It's amazing how fast she recognizes her own shortcomings in actually accomplishing this task. It's also amazing how fast she gets in over her head. But, I liked her. She had a mouth, without being vulgar. And she knew what she wanted.The world of the Fae is different in this one. It's much more dark and gruesome. Mainly because the few books I have read, don't focus so much on the Unseelie. Vlane was interesting. His story line alone is what pushed this book into adult paranormal (if not down right erotica for his short appearances in this book). Maybe that's what made me think we would eventually get some release for the obvious sexual tension between Mac and Jericho (not to mention the cover of the book).But, why everything was there for a great book, it just felt a little slow to me. And there was just something missing (I can't put my finger on it).

Ms. Moning seems to be a talented writer. (This is the 1st book of hers I've read.)

It was funny in spots and It was well written."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"moning is known as a romance author, and that's part of the reason I put this book off, though it was a freebie amazon kindle promo - I had to be in the mood for something a little trashy. this, however, was completely not that book: sex in this world can be deadly, and there's no quick flirtation before the tumble in the sheets for this girl.MacKayla is a green-off-the-turnip-truck southern belle, with no more pressing concern than what shade of pink she's going to do her nails. she gets the phone call that her studying-abroad sister has been killed, and ultimately heads to Dublin herself when she thinks the police have closed the case too soon. Mac stumbles into the horrific world of the fae - inhuman predatory monsters - when she discovers she's one of the (un)lucky few that can see through their glamour to the true evil beneath.what's good about this book is simultaneously what's bad about this book. the heroine is, quite literally, TSTL (that's \\"too stupid to live\\" for those of you unfamiliar with standard paranormal romance tropes): she blunders in way over her head several times, necessitating rescue in one manner or another, and hearing her prattle on about revlon iceberrry pink polish became annoying quickly. that being said, it was refreshing to have a main character that was an actual real person, not an instant super-badass, not someone who blithely accepts a whole new supernatural world in an eyeblink. all of the main characters are complexly flawed, leaving no one obvious to root for as the knight in shining armor, but leaving everything intriguingly mysterious. it doesn't end with a cliffhanger, though none of the major plot points are tied up.in short, the whole book feels like an extended prologue to the series. it's written in a future-tense first person, as though Mac is reading you her journal a year or two after the fact, giving you glimpses into the stronger, harder woman she will become. as long as that promise of character development comes through, and this intro remains the weakest in the series, the rest will be well worth getting into."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Don't let the 4 stars fool you...I am addicted to this series like a good drug. I feel powerless to stop reading it...really. (A book a night...but who's counting?) I would have never pegged myself to like an Urban Fantasy book much less a whole series. This book definitely is setting the bar high for the rest I might decide to try. Love the fast paced storyline with all of the characters shrouded in mystery. I'm on book 4 and I still cannot figure out the good from the bad.

Sleep with a light on!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Interesting read. It started slow, but it had enough mystery to keep me reading.Warning, there might be some spoilers!My god, the heroine was soooo annoying, more times than not, I wanted to strangle her. She was 22 but I can't help but imagine her as a 16 year old, with a pigtails, with lollipop in her mouth, wearing pink clothes, with pink nails and toenails. Stroking her hair \\"oh, they are so shiny and so beautiful, and feels so silky, and I just love my 'juicy purse, and my favorite color is pink'\\" I sh** you not, that's what she Said! I never wanted to strangle someone as much as I wanted to strangle her.I could not understand why author would choose such a shallow and superficial character for the book. At that moment I was seriously considering putting the book down, because she annoyed me more time than not. Until...Until she met Jericho Barron. He brought a nice balance to the story. I was glad to find out that Barron and I were on the same page when it came to certain things, he did the strangling for me (literally :)). I like the fact that I never knew where I had him. Was he a good guy or a bad guy? I'm still not sure, but it's ok. I'm hoping to find out in the nex book.I like the fact that the book wasn't predictable. The author dropped few hints along the way, you could guess that there is more to the words that were spoken and you still couldn't put the finger on it what it was. Like every time Mac asked him a question about who he was, he would answer, but his answers just raised more question and made me more suspicious.As the story progressed I was happy to se Mac grow out of the \\"I-love-pink, unicorns and rainbows\\" personality. I guess she realized that when the sh** hits the fan, pink toenails can only take you so far :). I actually started to like her towards the end.My only problem was the lack of romance, I would have loved to see some. Her constantly... Uhm... Masturbating in public didn't do it for me :). I also didn't like the way she quoted her mother, it sounded a bit immature.All and all, it was a good book and I will be reading the next one in the series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"You need to read all five books together. It's one long story with cliffhanger endings at the end of each book. There are slow parts and repetition in the last three books, but it's still an entertaining story.I can't believe how many times I made notes of interesting conversations, ideas, and things that made me chuckle. I loved the scene where Mac and Barrons had an angry conversation with their eyes (page 230). What I liked best about the book was the relationship. They didn't like each other but they had something the other needed which forced them to be together. I enjoyed watching them keep secrets and lie to each other. I frequently don't like lying when it doesn't fit the character. Here it fits and is entertaining. There is no romance or sex in this book (other than two brief scenes - not with Barrons). Don't read this if you're looking for romance, but there is some romance in the last two books. Read this if you want a good suspense story with great relationship tension.I like the idea that Mac is a contemporary woman from a small town in Georgia. She travels to Ireland and finds inhuman creatures who glamour themselves to appear human. They kill and hurt humans. Mac can see through their glamour. She can see their true form. I enjoyed identifying with Mac. I like the contemporary-here-today-among-us element.READERS WHO DID NOT LIKE THIS:I noticed several reviewers did not like the heroine and claimed she was stupid. I'm quick to anger when a smart heroine does something stupid to move the plot. But I did not see that here. Mac is not doing the smartest and most logical things, but I felt her thinking fit her character. I see her as Reese Witherspoon in the movie Legally Blonde. She's the Barbie doll type, into clothes and fashion. She lives with her parents, works part-time as a bartender, enjoys an easy-lazy-no-stress life, and she's happy. She never needed to be smart or fight. Now she is thrown into a world of death and survival. Her initial reaction is to not accept what she is seeing. She becomes smart and strong in later books. Her changes are a good part of the story.ABOUT THE AUTHOR:I was unhappy with the author's first two books in the Highlander series. One main character hurt and rejected the other throughout the book with inaccurate assumptions, lying, and stupidity. They weren't good stories - for me. I decided not to read any more of this author. Then a Goodreads friend talked me into trying the Fever series. (Thank you Madame X!!!!)UNDESIRABLE THINGS FOR ME THAT ARE OK IN THIS SERIES:I'm intrigued that several things are going against it, but I still liked it. 1. I prefer third person; this is first person. 2. Urban fantasy is not my first choice genre. 3. Cliffhanger endings at the end of each book. 4. The author changed! I didn't think an author could change so much. This feels like a different author from the Highlander series.DATA:Narrative mode: 1st person Mac. Story length: 347 pages. Swearing language: strong. Sexual language: moderate/strong. Number of sex scenes: 2 . Setting: current day Georgia and Ireland. Copyright: 2006. Genre: urban fantasy.THE SERIES:The five books in order are Darkfever, Bloodfever, Faefever, Dreamfever, and Shadowfever. Book 6 is Iced. It starts a new series with Dani as the heroine."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I am not writing much!

First time I read a book focused solely on fairies.I couldn't put it down and I loved Mac regardless of her bimbo apareance.So I think it's safe to say this first installment is just an introduction to the series. We really don't know what's going on. We just know Mac's sister was killed and she wants to find out the person responsible for it.In the quest she learns that fairies exist and she encounters a mysterious man who ends up helping her, well they end up helping each other.This man is Jericho, and holy cow! He is hot! Like super hot! In a sort of black dagger brotherhood, immortals after dark, kind of way. I just can't get over how hot he is. And even though we didn't learn much about him I am totally hooked.At the end of the book she finally finds the missing piece to solve the mystery but it slipped away. Now we also know there is so much more than just the murder of her sister and fairies. Theres also a doomsday in the midst.Now, I want to go back to Jericho. Why did he send hot glances her way? Why did he kiss her at the end? And why, oh why, did he paint her nails? That was totally adorable.I want more Jericho Barrons please!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"While not as fascinating as her Highlander Books I still enjoyed reading Darkfever and think the next book will be even better because the ground work has been lain and Mac should begin to evolve and get over her girlie girlie ways since she now understands there are things that go bump in the night and monsters do exist and they will kill you if given the opportunity.Barrons didn't appeal to me at all for the biggest part of the book. I actually fingered him to be an ass and full of himself but towards the end I began to realize this was just what Mac needed him to be because she was so soft and feminine and surely going to get herself killed before she ever realized what was going on. In short she was naive and child-like. He had to harden her up.Still bit confused on the bookstore clerk, Fiona. Is she one of Barrons lovers or just a dear friend? At some points she acted sort of jealous towards Mac and then in the next instance she was worried over her safety?"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I didnt think i would like the main character, and thats still out. but shes starting to get interesting. im not much of a pink fan anyways, lol. hopefully this will stay a good series! on to the next one!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I love this series. I read 3-5 books a week and it takes a lot for one to distinguish itself from the others.

The writing is casual and by no means extraordinary, but what shines in this book is the plot. Moning has created a rich world with a mythology I can't wait to learn more about in the following volumes."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have to say that I have read a couple of Moning's romance books, and I would NOT classify this series as a romance. This book/series is SO MUCH MORE. Others have touched on plot, characters, etc, so I won't go over that again.I'm gonna be honest and say I didn't really enjoy the Highlander romance books Moning wrote. They are typical romance, if you are into that, which I am not.But I think Moning found her stride when she made the Fever world. Stepping out of the romance-box, she has created an entire fantasy world within reality--for adults!! I personally enjoy many of the fantasy-type books (that suggest hidden aspects in reality, such as super-natural creatures, the world of Fairy, hidden powers, etc)that are written for young adults. Moning has managed to create such a world while avoiding being cheesy or totally unbelievable.I greatly enjoy the tension/relationship between MacKayla and Barrons, and her interaction with other characters. Her personal journey and growth are believable. There is just the right amount of romantic sub-plot and no cringe-worthy sex scenes found in most novels that fall into the romance genre. I have read this series 4 times, and will probably re-read it every year. I look forward to more books set in this world.Overall, I think with this series, Moning's genius began to flex, and she did an amazing job creating a world that I am always sad to leave at the end of the books."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"MacKayla Lane lives a good life in a small town, like an oridanry woman, or so she believes. When her older sister is murdered in Dublin without a single clue to her death other then a cryptic message she leaves on MacKayla's phone before she dies, Mac is forced to travel to Ireland in hopes of finding her sister's killer.Where has this book been up to this point of my life?! I have heard so much good about it, that I finally had to cave in. I ended up chewing the book up everytime I opened it's pages. I love paranormal, but this, this was a different kind of paranormal and it's story line and take on the Fae world is a refreshing breath of air.Okay, I will admit. I was not really attached to MacKayla, honestly she was a little too barbie for me, too colorful. She did grow slightly on me through the book, because she kind of grows and progresses, but she is not my most favorite character. The thing that I did like about her, that despite I had to read about nail polish, and rainbowed colored clothes that she wears - she stuck to her guts and to what she believed. Granted, jumping into things had gotten her in trouble a couple of times but here is where Barrons comes in.I loved Barrons, I think he is the only character that made me keep reading this book. Aside from the fact that I found the story line and the concept absolutely fantastic. His dark and mysterious and finds himself basically babysitting MacKayla while she is on the rampage in Dublin because at first she has a hard time believing Barrons about what she is, and who the unseelie are - and well, the fact that they could kill her. Literally, there were times in the book where she had me cringing my teeth grumbling 'stupid'.Oh and then there is Vlane, an alpha Fae who makes sex addictive to female human's that had found his way into MacKayla's life as well as she journey's head first blinded into the unknown. In order to discover the secrets of her life and a mysterious book that everyone wants their hands on.

The local Dublin police can't find a suspect, and end up moving the case to the unsolved cases group. Mac wants to know the truth about her sister's murder, armed with a voice mail from before her sister died she sets out on a journey that will change her life forever.Mac arrives in Dublin staying at a bed and breakfast just down the way from her sister's apartment as well as where her sister was found murdered. Her first night she finds herself in a pub seeing her first fey a beautiful man who is sucking the life from a woman but at second glace she can see who he really is a grey leprous monster. She's warned by an old woman to get away before she draws attention to herself, and betrays her own kind. Mac flees back to her room for the night but ventures out again in search of answers learning nothing new from the police because the detective on sister's case is on off. She wanders the streets for some time stumbling into a bookstore where she finds more then she bargained for.The bookstores owner Jericho Barrons is dark mysterious and knows more then he's letting on but he also is the only who can help Mac on her journey. Her sister left her a message to find the Sinsar Dubh before he can get a hold of it so now Mac is on a mission to find it. Thankfully Mac isn't your normal human and she has a few gifts of her own in her bag of tricks. Armed with the knowledge that she can kill the fey and she has to save the humans she sets out to find her sisters killer as well as the Sinsar Dubh.I purchased Darkfever years ago but I've never gotten around to reading it. I thought it sounded really interesting but it kept getting pushed to the back corner, then last week I decided it was time to read it for the Dark Fantasy shelf in the bingo game I'm part of. It was so much better than I expected I wish I'd started the series all those years ago because now I'm hooked and can't wait to read the rest of them. I really liked Mac as a character she's just so sweet and innocent not you're typical kick ass-heroine but she has so much potential to grow as a character which I really like. I found Mac easy to relate to, her character reminds me of a girl next door type, she's pretty but she's not a stuck up girl which I really liked makes her more real. I found the book very well written, the characters are well developed, and the story flows smoothly. I really liked the concept of the story, the whole world creation is great and it's a action packed story that I had a hard time putting down I just really loved Mac as a character."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"The writing in these books rivals literary fiction, but it's fantasy so all the better. The story is great and I was a fan only a few pages into this first book. I love the twist that fairies are bad in this series and I'm totally in love with Barrons. The character development and world building are done amazingly well. Pretty much one of the best books / series out there for fantasy readers!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"When her sister is murdered, leaving a single clue to her death-a cryptic message on Mac's cell phone-Mac journeys to Ireland in search of answers. The quest to find her sister's killer draws her into a shadowy realm where nothing is as it seems, where good and evil wear the same treacherously seductive mask. She is soon faced with an even greater challenge: staying alive long enough to learn how to handle a power she had no idea she possessed-a gift that allows her to see beyond the world of man, into the dangerous realm of the Fae....I can't remember on whose shelf I saw this on, or perhaps it was on an ad but it was definitely on Goodreads and I'm always game for an exciting paranormal/urban fantasy novel, this one didn't disappoint.Mackayla \\"Mac\\" Lane didn't know what was coming to her just hours after setting foot in Dublin, Ireland, where she hoped to put some life into the murder investigation of her sister, Alina, who was studying abroad. Her pretty world fell apart and what remained of her little happy family was left devastated after learning of her unexplainable gruesome death. Mac had found a message left by her sister, a recording of Alina's last words that made no sense to her at all, something about a book she must find at any cost before \\"they\\" find it, whoever \\"they\\" are. This was something new and she wasn't just going to cry over everything and give up hope like her parents had.The police refused to follow up on a cold case with not a single lead - the message gave them nothing to work on so it was deemed insufficient - leaving Mac even more frustrated. It wasn't long after weird stuff began happening; she begins to see grotesque monsters, her first was sucking the vitality and beauty of a woman oblivious to the decaying hideous monstrosity, she's now seeing things no one else could and was quickly coming to the conclusion that she was going insane. Oh, she'd be wishing she was.After she got lost in some wasteland part of the city, where the shadows aren't what they seem to be, she stumbled her way with relief to \\"Barrons Books and Baubles\\" a bookstore that was run by the mysterious, off the charts handsome (as I like to think) and lethal Jericho Barrons who enlightened Mac about the secret world unseen by mundane humans and all the creepy crawlies that live amongst them beneath the glamour they cast to blend in. She also learned that she was a Sidhe-seer, a person that fae magic can't work on, able to see past their disguises. Mac and Jericho did not get off to a peachy start but they'd be needing each other soon enough and they didn't have to like it.Jericho is also searching for this book Alina had mentioned, the Sinsar Dubh, a long lost powerful relic of the dark fae, the Unseelies, along with everyone else even the supposedly good fae, the Seelies. This book holds immense power so it's a no brainer why anyone wouldn't want it.I don't want to give away anything else but let me tell you that it was a heck of a ride. I read this book in less than a day if you add up all the hours. I like the writing style, it was engaging, to me it conveying Mac's thoughts, feelings and reactions clearly and I certainly approved of the little touches that made her sound like an actual person. The characters are interesting enough and I find Moning's world very intriguing though probably as I had found Kate Daniels', but it was worth the read. While blazing through, I felt the darkness oozing out from the streets of Dublin through the pages (or in my case my computer screen) and into me and I just love it when a book affects me so much that I feel apart of it's cast of characters, like I'm wading through the stream of emotions that our protagonist is splashing through.Speaking of whom, I've read reviews describing Mac as being spoiled, whiny, stubborn and unpractical. Well, she is all girly girly and into pink so much that normally would force me into a major gagging session and before picking up Darkfever I was expecting some nausea knowing that I'll be walking around in her head. Fortunately for both Mac and I, I'm open minded. I wouldn't be all kinds of harsh on her if I were you. She grew up in a safe environment, she was naturally drawn to things pretty and shiny. The fact that she's blond might get people to think that Mac's just another \\"dumb blond\\", she is who she is and that's that. What she is is a good person who needs a reality check. But then again, we sure as hell can still judge a person but that is unwise especially when we don't know them.Mac gradually develops into a more ... what to say ... street-minded/street-wise person, she even contrasted herself in the latter portion of the book. Actually I'm quite glad she even cared to juxtapose at all. It shows me that she's aware of her metamorphosis, one that she was forced by circumstance to partake in. Though I do wish she'd shut up about what her favourite nail polish is and to complete it was her narrative of what she wore. Oh, the pwetty (misspelled intentionally) things! Meh. Thankfully, she eased up on that as her character progressed, Mac understands the necessity of her choice in apparel but she doesn't appreciate this change because it doesn't reflect who she is. She doesn't want to be someone she's not and I give her respect points for that. Mac herself is changing so naturally her previous preferences will also evolve. I will inform you that she's still into pink.Oh, how I would just love to gush about the strikingly stunning beautiful Jericho Barrons, but I won't because I'll just embarrass myself and people possibly will come to think that I'm a middle aged housewife wishing to be swept away by an unnaturally handsome, non-existent Irishman (no offense to you married middle-aged housewives). I concede that the latter part might be true. If my father comes across this review, I've said enough for him to review the books I buy. That would be a dark day if he discovered certain books. Ahem.Mac calls him Barrons throughout this book and this might be due to her reflexive dislike to the man and probably he has this aura of dangerousness about him, I wouldn't be too hasty to be on a first name basis with a guy I don't like at all too, nor one that I'm not sure who's entirely human. Yes, if you Darkfever it seems hard to believe Jericho ( as I prefer to call him) is 100% human, actually I don't think he's human at all.I think this is long enough of a review and I hope it's done its part to encourage you to get yourself a copy and sample it with a relish. To finish off I'd like to say it's nice to see Mac's development in this first book of the series and not till one or two books later. Jericho is still a mystery so as a rule he's still where we found him; undecipherable - for now, that is. I enjoyed their banter and the way they react to each other. Mac didn't instantly fall heads over pink heals over him like many heroine do but she's attracted to him, to her mild annoyance, and he didn't pursue her attention ... well not in a man-meets-sexy-lady kind of way, it's refreshing. I liked the little snippets of wise words Mac shared. Really, she isn't just a pretty face with a sunny personality.Get it. Read it. Get hooked. Don't misjudge blonds."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was a little worried when I read such phrases as TMI and NOT! Luckily, this made more sense the further I read.

The storylines are great, the steamy sex scenes are better than any of the wanna be Grey series books (in my humble opinion). More relasitc for us ladies who like normal romantic and loving sexual encounters, not \\"let me hurt you\\" kind of stuff.Anyway, love these books and my favs are the Highlander series. The Fever series is very good too, but I like that the Higlander series can stand alone (don't have to wait for a sequal) yet brings characters back from book to book and you can find out what's happened to them later on in thier lives.You will love these books! Warning though - there are some pretty steamy secitons. :-)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is a very intriguing dark fantasy. I normally don't like books written in first person and I tend to dislike a series that is based on the same character. I was at first very doubtful about this book due to comments by reviewers regarding Mac and her being a girlie girl that likes the word \\"pretty\\" too much, links pink too much and sounds/seems like an immature teenager. On the contrary, Mac may have started out that way, but only in the very beginning. As soon as she finds out about her sister's death, Mac slowly changes from that naive, immature girl. Her character develops in slow degrees and I really have to give kudos to the author, I found Mac's reactions to what she finds in Dublin is very realistic.The book is a great introduction to this series and the characters of the story. Like many other fans, I love Barron's character and cannot wait to see how his relationship develops with Mac. V'lane is really a secondary character in this book, although there's somewhat of a lust triangle between the Mac, Barrons and V'lane. He is no where near as interesting or mysterious as Barrons' character. Their chemistry and tension is amazing from the very beginning. I love their interactions.The pacing, world building and writing are very good. There's plenty of action and plenty of things going on.This is my first KMM book and she does not disappoint."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I wasn't sure about this series because I don't read very many books that deal directly with mythical creatures that are not also paranormal. This was a rather fun, if a tiny bit dark in some places, read and I think people who already love this genre would do well to read this book. I know I'm going to read the whole series definitely after having read this book. The only thing I didn't like about it was not a part of the book itself exactly. The formatting of this book doesn't have the chapter demarcations at the bottom of the Kindle screen as I would have preferred. I already bought the second book in the series and I'm glad to say that it does include them. The characters in this book are very intense, but still believeable, aside from the literal impossibilities, but that adds to the fun. I could say this book is about having new experiences, but also about learning to watch what you do when confronted with that new experience and finding help when it's required. I won't bore you with a plot summary as other reviewers are fond of doing that. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is into this genre. I've seen the ratings list of the numbers of people who gave this book which numbers of stars, but I don't agree that it is worth less than 5 for what it is now. I don't think this book tries to be anything other than what it is, an adventure full of fun with a bit of excitement and learning along the way."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I usually don't read romance novels in the paranormal/fantasy genre, but this had had some good reviews and I caught it on sale really cheap.

Rarely have I read a novel where I just HAD to go get the next one in the series (not since Harry Potter) immediately. This had me hooked good."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Refreshingly Intriguing!I'm dedicating this review to my daughter Heather, she loves this series and has been waiting for me to read this series since 2010. I can't believe I waited this long to read this first book. You were right my lovely daughter, I did enjoy this book. LOLWow! Totally not what I was expecting in a paranormal book. With great insight to the Fae World between the Seelie and the UnSeelie, the reader learns of the evil that exist between the two courts.To me it seemed the UnSeelie Court is the worst due to the horrifying creatures associated with it, I think I prefer the Seelie court with the beautiful and sexy Seelie like V'Lane that get you all turned on that you have your clothes off before you know it and so wanton for a good banging that you'd probably screw anything in sight (there is mild erotica due to nature of sexual description Mac experienced 2 flames out of 5 flames) - LOL verses being with an UnSeelie like the Grey man that glamours his true hideous form and sucks your essence and beauty that eventually kills you.I didn't know what to think of Mac (Sidhee Seer) in the beginning mainly because she is so young like in her early 20's and very immature but by the end of the book after going through all the hell I saw her maturity grow and began to respect her as she sought revenge for her sister and was kick ass in the ending.Now when it came to Jerico Barrons (?), what an ass! However, I kind of warmed up to him in the end when he saved Mac's life. I still cant wait to find out what he really is though. I like the connection that he and Mac have started and you can tell that even though they find each other a nuisance that they are really attracted to each other and I hope that their relationship builds into something more romantic.The ending left me hanging with many questions and now I have to read the second book so for readers out there, this is not a stand alone book. My questions are, did the Lord Master really kill Mac's sister, will Mac & Barrons find the Sinsar Dubh, and will there be romance in this book?So thank you my sweet daughter for getting me to read this wonderful book, now I'm off to read Bloodfever because of the new addiction.Great Read!

I am the type of reader who will determine if I will finish the book in the first chapter or two. This book had me from the start. I read the first book in a day or two and bought the second read it in equal time and then the third. I was like a junkie who couldn't get my fix fast enough. I think for the week I was preoccupied with reading these books that my husband thought he was a bachelor. When I finished the 3rd book in the series I went to the author's website to see when the next installment was coming out. I ACTUALLY had to wait a month for the latest release to come out and it killed me!!!!! I ate that book up in world record pace. So now I am having withdrawls because the last installment won't come out for another year!!!Of course this type of story is not everyone's cup of tea, but for me I am a big FAN of the FEVER series! Don't get me wrong I'm not going out and buying a t-shirt that says, \\" Team Mac\\" on it or \\" Team Barrons\\", but I won't make fun of people who do."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Fantasy publishers have it right - offer the first book of a series for free on Kindle and get you hooked. And Darkfever sure did it for me - I ended up buying the next three in the series, and can't wait for the fifth and last book. I enjoyed the characters, the story line and the fact that it wasn't quite as stereotypical (girl meets boy, falls in love, falls in bed) as most plot lines go or the cover would have you believe.Darkfever is enjoyable, well written and got me hooked on a new author."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I came to this series via KMM's time travel romances and wasn't quite sure what to expect from this new series. I thoroughly enjoyed this first book and can't wait to move on to the second. I liked how she ties in some of the Fae elements (the Hallows for one) that we learned about in her Highlander series. Makes it interesting for those of us that have read all of her books!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"The plot is discussed thoroughly in other reviews so I won't plow that same ground again. First the good: I really liked the world she creates, and I find her version of the fae interesting. I also liked the Irish setting and the idea that certain neighborhoods seem to drop off the map and be forgotten when infected by the baddies. There is not much romance in this book, although foreshadowing suggests there may be more in subsequent books.I had several suspension-of-disbelief problems with the book. I found the heroine too shallow, dumb and weak to really respect and could not really believe that she could hold her own with the antagonists. I thought she should have easily solved some of the problems that confronted her but which left her completely stumped. Also, I didn't find the male anti-hero budding love interest to be very believable. He seemed unnecessarily mysterious. And in any case, since he needed her help in a big way, she could easily have demanded more information from him. Maybe it's not fair to complain about suspension-of-disbelief issues in a supernatural thriller, but it did dampen my enjoyment.Despite these flaws, I did enjoy the book and I'm going to read the next one."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"not usually a reader of this genre yet it involved me immediately and engrossed me entirely."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"It surpirsed me how good this was.

Cant wait to read the rest of the series and found out."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"The first few pages were overwhelming and confusing, but I pushed forward and am glad that I did. The writing is very intelligent and intriguing. I'm very pleased with the series so far (I'm finishing the 2nd book) and can't wait for the rest!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"For not having a sex scene in the entire first 3 books, they are some of the most 'electrically right before you kiss for the first time' reading I've found in ages."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"MacKayla Lane is a twenty-two year old southern belle from a tiny Georgia town. She's got the perfect parents, the perfect sister, the perfect life - and as you'll hear OFTEN - the perfect plethora of pastels and pinks in wardrobe, accessories, and nail polish. Then comes the phone call that utterly destroys that pretty, magnolia-scented bubble. In the aftermath of her sister's brutal slaying, MacKayla (Mac) embarks on a quest for vengeance and justice, determination and steely grief her constant companions...well, those and all the ultra-hip and heavy-on-the-pink accessories she can drag along with her.God, she's annoying. I mean seriously, thoroughly, bang-my-head-against-the-wall-at-her-insipidness annoying. With an almost pathological need to explain every wardrobe choice (not to mention how great she thinks she looks in each and every one) and all the waxing philosophic on the names of nail polish colors, Mac is the single most superficial, shallow, inane, and self-absorbed princess I've ever read as a lead character.Trust me, that alone would usually be enough to completely strip me of any desire to continue this book, let alone get invested in the series, and yes - that's not the only fly in the ointment that is Darkfever - but there IS a lot I liked here (just about everything NOT MacKayla), and it's enough to make me stick with the five-book Fever series despite a lead character who has this to say: \\"I've always liked museums. I should probably pretend it's because I'm so erudite and scholarly and love to learn, but the truth is I just love shiny, pretty things...\\"Yes, that sound you're hearing is my head impacting the wall. Again. Though admittedly, points to the twit for stellar vocabulary. And that's actually when I started to notice things beyond my annoyance - the first being, in Mac's defense, she's led a VERY sheltered life - and we're only STARTING to find out how, why, and that there really is a reason for that through this first book. And in truth, she's naive, she believes in happy endings and DOESN'T believe in things that go bump in the night (or better yet, Things That Can Eat You), and she's FAR too interested in gauzy pastels for me to EVER think her normal, yet she's NOT stupid.Ignorant of the full scope and breadth of just how bad her life's gone to the dogs (or Sidhe in this case), but not stupid. And as this book is told from her point of view, looking back at the happenstances of a year ago, the reader knows almost immediately that what Mac has had to become (I'm assuming we'll see that development continue through the series) resembles not at all what she is as she first steps foot in Ireland to find out who killed her sister. The way it's done is a device I don't particularly enjoy reading - too much foreshadowing and endless comments about what's GOING to happen and not enough seeing it unfold AS it's happening - but the world that's being created by the author and the characters that are introduced around Mac are intriguing to say the very least. There is nice depth in the world building, and the magical mythos of Irish history is itself almost tertiary character that adds a unique flavor and tone. I just really wish Mac had been toned down (A LOT) after the author impressed on us (see also: beat us over the head again and again) that she would mature and get with the program eventually. It would've made it a better read without losing the point.I'll stick this series out, I think, because I've just got to find out what Barrons really is and I'm very interested to see what V'Lane's got up his...er...sleeve. This particular installment in the series gets a 3.5 from me for that very reason."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"DarkFever is a really great read. This book was so well written that I read it in only one weekend, and it was so difficult to put down. I kept wanting to know what Mac was going to do next. It was a free kindle download that was a great read. I am now hooked on the series.Dark Fever is about Mackayla \\"Mac\\" whose sister is murdered while attending school in Ireland. Mac listens to a message that her sister leaves for her four hours before she dies. In the message Mac must find an important book. Mac leaves for Ireland and begins to uncover a whole new world that she did not know exists prior to leaving her small Georgia town of Ashford.The writer really does a great job describing the characters and pulling the storyline together. I didn't experience one dull moment while reading this book. It seems like the writer really enjoyed telling this story."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I really enjoyed this book - I read it in two evenings, and I love a book I can't put down. I'm not going to go into much more detail because I'd only be repeating what many others have said well.My only complaint is the handful of instances in which one of the main characters (Barrows, an uber-masculine, demi-god-type man) - occasionally talks like the main character (a modern-day, Southern belle). I'm sorry, but I can't see Barrows in all his manly glory saying, \\"I could lie to you a million ways to Sunday.\\" or \\"...and would have continued swimmingly without you.\\" (page 302) It just seems a little amateurish to make slips like that and not catch them before publishing.That being said, I give it 4 stars because I like the plot, the characters and imaginative concepts. I have hope that the writing will mature as I read the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"For those of you starting out in this series, keep reading. I admit I was not too impressed with the first book. But I found it entertaining enough to continue reading. The second book gets better. The third even better. Fortunately, I had all five books to read in a row, so the cliffhangers were not problem for me to absorb. In fact, I was pleased to end a volume wanting more. The fifth and last book is by far the best - you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"DarkfeverBy Karen Marie MorningRating: a strong PG-13Spoiler Alert: a little, but no detailsCoffee Bean Rating: 4.5/5 (I really want to give it a 5!)Finished a fun, fast, and exciting book. Darkfever by Karen Marie Morning. A friend of mine gave it (along with the 2nd and 3rd in the series) to me a LONG time ago, but I never got around to reading it until now. I picked it up and finished it in a few days (which is impressive for me right now since it's 350 pages and I really had to look under couch cushions and behind doors to find time to read it). I read the last page today, halfway through my lunch and was very upset to find that the remaining 10 or so pages were just flyleafs (or is it like the leaves on a tree and is \`flyleaves'?) and other \\"non-Mac related\\" writings. I plan on zipping home and promptly grabbing the next one off my shelf and starting that one. I have a strong feeling that I'll be starting the third one by Monday. Some books just do that to me (City of Bones series, Sookie Stackhouse, Hunger Games, and Fever series just to name a few).Onto the review!MacKayla (Mac for short) Lane just found out that her sister, while studying abroad in Ireland, has been murdered in a cruel and horrible way. Against her parents' pleas, she quits college (she's 22) and goes to Ireland and demand that the police reopen her sister's case and solve the murder. And if they don't, then by golly, she's gonna do it for them (and without breaking one of her perfectly pink nails). She ends up getting a disturbing and cryptic message from her sister via voicemail just hours before she was killed. Trying to seek answers to the clues she was given, she asks the wrong man for help about a book, Jericho Barrons. Turns out, he's looking for it too, and doesn't think she should be.Well, that just causes Mac to dig in her heels and try harder (like she says, \`pride is her special little problem'). Things happen and cause Mac and Barrons to partner up, although reluctantly. There's so much tension and unacknowledged attraction between them that neither of them sees, or at least will admit to. But I saw it!! And I was soooo hoping that something would happen between them. I knew they were destined for each other the moment they met (but I'm not going to tell you what happens. But I will say this, I am both pleased and very, very not-pleased with how Morning grants my wish).While trying to track down her sister's killer and find the book that will help her do it, Mac is plunged into a world she had no idea existed with fae, and vampires and all manner of creepers in the shadows. All with a man she still knows nothing about or what his true intentions are. With her and with the book.Morning tells the story from Mac's pov and does it with sass and humor that made me instantly connect and fall in love with our heroine. Morning is witty and funny, created multiple forms and types of tension with masterful skill that had me turning the page under my desk at work (just kidding, of course. Or am I? Mwahaha). A warning in advance: I looked on the spine of the book to find out what genre it was and read, Romance. Hmmm...while there were scenes not intended for the faint at heart (which may or may not include me) this was by no means a typical \\"romance/bodice ripper\\" type book. But, I'll admit here and now, I was rooting the entire way through the book for Barrons and Mac to kiss. :)[...]"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Great start for the series. I am looking forward to the sequels. Moning spins a nice tale - a little slow in the beginning, but then she is building characters. Greast Read!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I started with Darkfever and was addicted to the whole series by the end of the first chapter. I was fortunate enough to start the first book just as the last one,Shadowfever, was being released, because there were a TON of cliffhangers that just get more intense towards the end. This review is really more about the series, and less about this one book, because I don't think you'll be able to stop once you've started.MacKayla Lane starts off as an average, slightly-spoiled, but very likable young woman. Through the series, she goes through enormous trials and meets new and fascinating characters that fall in every space between the measures of good and evil. Her partner in crime (literally), Jericho Barrons, tends to remain in Mac's mistrust throughout most of the series, and shows his loyalty in strange and unconventional ways that attract the reader enough (against all reason, sometimes) to WANT to trust him, too. Much of the story revolves around this constant back-and-forth in their intriguing relationship, made even more volatile with the addition of V'lane, a Fae who also finds Mac attractive and useful to his cause.The rest of the plot finds Mac struggling to find out 1) who killed her sister, 2) who she is, and who she is becoming, 3) the history behind The Book that Barrons and V'lane are chasing for very different reasons. (A note: I'm always intrigued when the author creates unique and complex mythology within his/her own story.) Moning's skill in pulling all of these elements together in such a balanced and fascinating way is truly astounding, especially considering the level of darkness that runs throughout the series - just the right mix of Eros and Thanatos, as Moning might say.Now that I've finished the books, they are in a coveted spot on my bookshelf and in danger of being reread so often the bindings could become highly creased."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"It's been a while since a book hooked me on the first page, and this one sure did! This story is wonderful. I won't go into the plot because you can read that in the book's description. I'll just say that I fell in love with the characters, the plot, everything. And even though I was not prepared for the \\"steamier\\" scenes, they were exciting, not trashy. I look forward to reading the entire series and moving on to more Karen Moning books. I am very impressed with this series and author."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"A friend bought me this book over a year ago and the cover art never really spoke to me. Well I just had surgery and was ready to start a new series while recoving. I started the book yesterday and finished it this afternoon! A great read! Took me a few chapters to become fully invested but once the main character, Mac, starting embracing her power I was smitten with the story, mesmerized by the characters, and on the edge of my seat to see what happens next! I've just ordered the remaining in the series and cant wait til it ships here!! Highly recommended for those who love a good butt kicking fantasy with weird twists and brief indulgences of the erotic type ;)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I usually make a habit of reading at least three bad reviews, and three good, and decide then if I should read the book or not.I'm really, REALLY, glad I bought and read this book. This whole series in fact.I'm not into spoilers, or quoting lines from the story, so I will leave it at this: It is more than a revenge story, and it's not at all a romance, although there are tons of situations and opportunities in which the write could have taken it in that direciton. It doesn't drop you into the middle of a fictional state of mankind, and doesn't broadside you so much that you feel there's too many details coming from too many angles. It starts out normal enough, and slowly (not too slowly) builds up and eases you into the world of Karen Marie Monings making. And that world is fabulous! Hair-raising and scary while simultaneously being humourus and attractive.I highly recommend this book, this series, to anyone. It's just a great escape =)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I got to check out this series when this book was free for the Kindle for a little while. The first book was engaging enough to keep me going, and each book got better. This is not like her Highlander series, which is basically a series of free-standing romance novels. It's much more urban fantasy, with a first-person point of view, and one long, complicated story told throughout the 5 books. The characters are interesting and complex. The themes are powerful. You get to watch Mac grow and evolve, from a shallow, spoiled 20-something, into a powerful woman. I loved this series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"What I Loved: This is going to sound odd but this book was nothing like I expected. The story is interestingly twisty and while I could understand what was going on, I never could get ahead of the story. I really enjoyed that aspect of not knowing was coming. Mac is a strong female lead but not overbearingly so. She makes mistakes, she is scared, and she seems very much like a 22 yr old thrown into a situation that she had very little control over. At first when she was described as a 22 yr old barbie looking type of gal, I was set to hate her. By midway through the book, I was rooting for her.What I Liked: Mac and Jericho's very complicated sarcastic relationship. Jericho is still a character that I am warming up too as I can't quite figure out exactly how he fits in with everything. I don't know if I trust him or not. That being said he was great to read. Vlane wasn't in the story enough but his effect on Mac was astonishing *blush*.Complaints: None that I won't address in the Audio ReviewAudio specific review: The narrator took some getting used too. She made Mac sound older and Jericho sound very grouchy. As I got used to her reading though, I noticed that the pacing was fantastic and the nuances were dead on. So stick with it past the first couple of chapters, you will get used to the voice and tone she uses.Why I gave it a 4: I would listen/read this book again. This is a great launch to the series and can't wait to read the next one.Who I would recommend it too: This is an Urban Fantasy novel through and through. There isn't an HEA but you kind of get the idea that someone that has been introduced might be her HEA. I think PNR readers will like it too because of the paranormal aspect.[...]"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I enjoyed this book very much!

I will be purchasing the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I can't tell you how much I loved this book...quick paced, you'll find it hard to put down. It's dark, entertaining, scarey and Jericho will begin to haunt you into trying to figure out just what he is. I find the heroine endearing. She is young and naive...but she has balls leaving her safe little world to persue her sister's killer in a foreign land. You gotta admire her courage and her journey. This book is the tip of the iceberg and introduces us to a world so terrifying you'll be chilled to the bone. As someone who has read four of the series I got to tell you that Mac evolves and grows up into a kicka-s character you've got to admire..and her relationship with the mysterious Jericho is hot, frustrating and will have you obsessing about in blogs all over the internet!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I really enjoyed this book, and was compelled to buy the next two.

With the tragic death of her beloved sister, MacKayla is practically thrown into a world unimaginable to her. Bound and determined to get answers and find the one responsible for her sister's death, she is way over her head traveling to Dublin, Ireland where her world explodes!Her only ally is Jericho Barrons, or is he? She soon finds out that she is the most powerful Sidhe-seer, one that can see the Seelie ( the light) and the Unseelie (the Dark) of the Fae realm. She can also sense the Fae objects especially the Dark Book which everyone seems to be after. Barrons uses MacKayla's Sidhe-seer abilities to hunt these objects as well as the infamous Book, the Sinsar Dubh. MacKayla agrees to help Barrons in exchange for information and to help her find who she truely is.V'lane is a death-by-sex Seelie Fae who is also very interested in MacKayla and wants her to get the Sinsar Dubh for him or should I say for the Seelie queen. She is so confused on who to trust just learning of herself and still trying to solve the murder of her sister not to mention keeping herself alive long enough to accomplish what needs to be done, her whole world is in a tail spin!There really is so much more to the story, learning about the fae world and why it is so important to find the Sinsar Dubh, but I can't very well spoil it! I downloaded this as a freebie and I can say it is an easy read and worth the download! I have since downloaded the the other 3 books and have enjoyed them just as much.I have to say Karen Marie Moning keeps you guessing and once you think you may have an answer or two she completely stumps you and your back to square one, guessing again! Barrons, Barrons, Barrons! Very handsome, built, sexy, and mysterious. I found myself thinking, just throw him down and take him to wanting to kick his head in! I still have not figured his character out. Is he the good guy or the bad guy?MacKayla's character is very snobby and immature. I wished she would have broken all her nails so she wouldn't have to worry about getting her hands on that discontinued pink polish. Her character really needs to toughen up. She suppose to save the world or be the destruction of it!I agree with the other reviews regarding reading all the books when they come out. I read all 4 back to back and now I am left with a huge cliffhanger from book 4, waiting for the fifth book! Moning promises to wrap everything up in Book 5 as this will be the last in the series.Series in Order;Darkfever, Book 1Bloodfever (Fever Series, Book 2)Faefever, Book 3Dreamfever, Book 4Shadowfever Book 5 - soon to be released!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book is a real page-turner! It is a fantasy that some will think outlandish, but Moning does a great job of introducing it and making her character as incredulous about it as most of us would be if presented the same situation. This first installment of the \\"Fever\\" series lacks romance, but there is some tension building between the heroin and her mentor. This book is a quick, delightful read and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I normally don't read romance but I thought what the hell. I sure am glad I read this one. I wouldn't classify it as romance though. I kept me on my toes. I enjoyed it and plan on reading the whole series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"When I first bought this book I was expecting another story along the lines of Moning's \\"Highlander\\" books. What I found was an enthralling urban fantasy that sucked me in and left me hanging.The Fever books are NOT a series, they are a true serial, something you don't find very often. The driving plot extends through all three books, so you won't find any resolution in this book, only questions.In this installment, MacKayla, or Mac, is dealing with the shock of her sister's death. Determined to find answers, she travels to Ireland and finds herself thrust into a strange world.I love that this book constantly raises questions without offering easy answers, and that the answers, once found, come with questions of their own. We get a real feel for Mac and how she is forced to transform herself from and average American party-girl to a tough woman who is able to fight for her life.While this is not a romance, there is tension between Mac and her one ally, Barrons. He is, at once, her only hope and possibly her greatest enemy. Despite the antagonistic nature of their tenative relationship there is a small thread of attraction between them. Even so, this is no romance and should not be misconstrued as one.I highly recommend this book and this three book serial to fans of Moning as well as anyone who loves urban fantasy. It is intense with plenty of action and a storyline that will make the reader question everything that happens from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I read all of KMM's Highlander series and enjoyed most of them (some were better than others). Having appreciated KMM's writing style in that series, I bought this one before reading any reviews. It is a quick read and I and really \\"got into\\" the story. It has sort of a Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1st season) feel to it. Mac, the herione, is just learning what she is up against when she visits Dublin to find out more about her sister's murder.Mac is young, immature, and totally unaware of her supernatural gift/curse. The author does a good job portraying Mac's youthful zeal and impulsiveness. She is sort of a girlie girl (Barbie doll). The story-line gained my interest immediately. Jericho, her protector (or nemesis ?), is a real mystery man and there were only little glimpses into his life. We learn about him as Mac learns about him. Her first challenge will be whether to trust him or not.The book ended much too quickly for me and I wasn't aware it had such a cliff-hanger ending. I'm looking forward to reading the next in the series, but I'm not a big fan of cliff-hangers."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I really enjoyed this book! I got it free for my new Kindle and for some reason, was reluctant to start it, but I'm so glad I did. It is a really dark take on the topic of fae/fairies. I'm not going to bother with a synopsis because it's easy to find plenty of those online. I'll just say that I loved it. It's definitely not YA (incase you were wondering) -- there are some pretty intense sexual encounters. Apparently Karen Marie Moning was a romance author before trying out her hand in the paranormal genre, but I've never read any of those. I'm sure that experience helps her out in these books though. There is also quite a bit of swearing, if you're sensitive to that. The main character, Mac (MacKayla Lane) is a little annoying to me, mostly just because when the story begins she is basically a Barbie doll. Her favorite colors are rainbow pastels and she has long blonde hair. She's always talking about her clothes and how they're pink and peach and gold and how her legs are so tan. Blah, blah, blah. It's seriously annoying. However, it is definitely worth getting past. The concept of the story is really great and I think the character development is coming. I'm already in the third book now, so I would recommend to anyone to keep going!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I can't wait until the movie comes out. This is a great series. I am a Barrons Fan! It is quite a read and each book ends in a cliff hanger. Which only makes you want to get the next one ASAP!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"When I first started reading Darkfever I waited throughout the whole first three chapters to stop and have to say to myself again that this was just another one of those boring, over zealous, and so badly written novels that it takes true patience and and some major concentration to finish....I was very wrong. The book took me through a loop and keep me reading until the early morning hours. I loved Mac's need to find the killer who murdered her sister. She travels all the way to Ireland, determined to find out who and why. The stories fast paced, with curve balls and side steps at every turn. And Barrons, never have I wanted to get so close to a character yet at the same time run as fast as I could the other way. If anyone should come across this series, take the time and a few extra dollars and buy the complete series because once your done with the first book you won't be able to stand a few short minutes to start the next."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Where do I start. I have read every single book she has written. I started with the Fever series and moved on to the highland series. When I start one of her books I can't stop reading till I have finished the entire book it is worse then Godiva (less calories) :)If you love suspense, mystery, magic and a bit of spice then her books are the best by far. I don't want to spoil the story line for anyone so I say this if you have a iPad get a sample; if you have a library borrow and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"It's been a while since I read an adult urban fantasy book. I choose this series in particular because I have heard nothing but praise about this book and I thought it was time.The final verdict? I loved it. The story get you all wrapped in it from the very beginning, I do have to admit that at first is a little slow but I think that is necessary because once Mrs. Moning take you into his Fey world, you gotta pay attention to every detail because eventually everything would click together in some point of the book or in the others books coming.What make this book so good to me was Mackayla, she was the combination of Elle Woods (Legally Blonde) with Buffy the vampire Slayer but in her early days. She was an everyday girl with a high sense of fashion but she had spunk and not to mention a lot of courage because not anyone would have flown to a different continent to find out about their twin sister murder. She had to make a 360 change in her life and with all the complications it could bring she does it without thinking. The other good thing about Mackayla is that evolves, into a stronger and more independent person of course with the help of Barons (going there in just a few words more) and her survivor instincts kicks making her more stronger through all the book. I have to give kudos to Mrs. Moning for giving us a kick ass heroine but with a good heart and of course a very high fashion style.So then comes Jerricho Barons, the warrior, taker, user and another few adjectives I could use to describe him. At first I was kind piss off at him for being an ass with her but at first he just want her not to get into trouble but as soon as he realize of her \\"ability\\" then his force to take her under his care and at first he user her for his own purpose but in the end he little by little warm at her and we to read a few sexuals moments between this two and of course it comes the biggest mistery of the book, who and what the hell is Barons? Mrs. Moning gives nothing away.And of course I can't forget to mention the Seelies who are the beautiful ones but the ones that can makes you sex slave which bring us to Vlane, the sexy Fey Prince, who \\"needs\\" Mac and of course make her have very sexy and hillarious moments and then are the Unseelies who are the ugliest one but they are dangerous and are being released and controlled by the real antagonist of the story the Lord Master. Which also you don't get much information about just to know that it was the person that it was involved in the murder of Mac's sister and of course everybody have ulter motives and hidden agenda with Mac and believe me that's not a good thing.Like a mention before Mrs. Moning is a really gifted author because she submerges you in the Dublin Fey world and even though is fantasy book she makes a wonderful job describing the human personality. Her writing is elegant, very descriptive and also natural.This is a kick ass beginning for the series even with a slow start but very strong ending and of course I already devour the second book (review coming soon). Mrs. Moning has become one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I think I must have sucked this whole series through a straw. It was that delicious. As a bonus for romance lovers, this series had a delectable cast of male characters that were just enough of the good stuff without distracting from the story. For those more focused on the action, this world was most definitely exciting and colorful. I woke up and read before work, I read while I brushed my teeth, washed my hands, in between calls (I'm a phone rep), and before after n during meals. The characters were vibrant. The danger had my heart pumping. When Mac felt pain, it was excruciating for me. When she did the happy dance, I danced with her. When she was frustrated, I ground my teeth and forgot it was just a story. The plot kept me buying the next story and the next and the next. I was so sad when it ended, but it ended well. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a little of everything: mystery, suspense, action, love, fantasy, and up to date world culture. You just can't get much better than this. Hi-5 to the author and everyone that helped make this series happen. Thank you."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"So over the weekend I found myself completely in the thrall of Moning's Fever series. It's not every day I run into a series earns a solid place on my \\"Favorites\\" list, but this series earned itself an unequivocal place of honor. It may even make my top 10 favorite series of all time list. It's a series I can see re-reading many, many times.This is actually a review of the whole series (no spoilers, I promise). Since I held off on reading this series for so long because of the first few chapters of the first book, I thought I'd put in a good word in hopes of giving anyone still on the fence about reading it the courge to dive in. You won't regret it - I promise. :D This series is FANTASTIC!Here's a list of the books:DarkfeverBloodfeverFaefeverDreamfeverShadowfeverBasic storyline involves the Fae must like so many other urban fantasy book these days. But it's a darker version of the Fae we find in this series. It's them on our turf, invading our world.What sets this series apart from many of its urban fantasy counterparts it the complexity, epic scope, and unpredictability of the story. It's a many layered story - the first book starts with a mystery that turns into an epic world altering adventure as the story moves on. It's party post-apocalyptic adventure, part mystery, part romance, part suspense. It defies genre stereo types. The story is rich, dark, and unpredictable. There are plots within plots throughout the whole story. Just when I thought I had part of the story figured out, I found out my theories were wrong. But I never felt like the author was over complicating things and her truths when she revealed them never disappointed. She just kept me guessing up to the very end - and that in and of itself is a noteworthy accomplishment as it can be pretty hard to surprise me.The characters are very likeable. I'd actually looked at this series earlier, but decided not to read it because the sample chapters from the first part of the first book made it seem like main character MacKeyla, is a glorified fashion hungry, pink obsessed Barbie doll. I pegged her as a silly girly girl from those chapters (which is not my cup of tea at all). You might be inclined to do the same thing, but I encourage you - read on. You'll fall in love with Mac, I promise. She's strong, kind, determined, but reasonable (I dislike the common urban fantasy theme of bull headed spunky heroines that constantly make silly mistakes because they are too stubborn to see reason - Mac lacks that folly). She also is powerful in her own right but not invincible. One of the biggest themes present in this series is a strong admonishment to not judge a based on a person's words or appearance - but judge them based on their actions. Mac becomes an amazing character - actually she always was one, I just had a hard time getting passed her pretty pink nails, and cute shoes. The side characters are fantastic too - Barrons being a personal favorite, Dani, V'Lane, Christian - I liked them all.Sadly romance is not a major theme in this story - it's present (and yummie), but takes back seat in the face of the world altering events occurring in the rest of the story. Even though it doesn't take center stage, the I found I really enjoyed the romance elements of the story. This author tends to create sort of strong, exceedingly mysterious, possessive, alpha male types. Normally too much alpha throws me off, but it really worked in this story and I found myself suitably swoony. I found it interesting that I sort of fell in love with the males of this story slowly, right along with Mac, and for the same reasons. I wasn't so sure about some of them in the beginning, but their actions won me over (there's that theme again).I'd read a some Amazon reviews that warned that the first book started off a bit slow and was a bit weaker prose wise than the rest of the series, but I actually really enjoyed the first book, the series just kept getting better the farther I read. I had such a hard time putting any of the books down - I'd read until I fell asleep, and then pick up again the next day. The story from start to finish was amazing, and the end was completely satisfying. All loose ends were tied up beautifully.Another thing I appreciated about the series is the wisdom present in it, and the moral quandaries the story raises. There's the aforementioned lesson about judging based on actions not words that's a constant theme. But there's also an ever present question of right and wrong, good and evil, black and white. The lines aren't so clearly drawn here, and you as the reader have to sort of puzzle through and make your own judgments right along with Mac.Okay, so I think I've gushed enough. I highly recommended series! I'd say even a must read for the urban fantasy genre."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"It's taken me awhile to catch up with this author but I'm certainly glad I did. I hope the rest of the series is as great as Book #1."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was wondering around the book store trying to find a good book, to many to choose from, but then,.. This one caught my eye. I picked it up and read the back of it to give me an idea what it was about, \\" a possible maybe\\" I thought.Well, turns out it was the winner, so to speak. When I finally got a chance to read it on that Sunday,..Nothing else got done at my house that day. I could not put that book down, I absolutely was wrapped in the book!! I have read some of the reviews afterwards, and I have to say to me, Mac, was a great character, an you have to remember, she is 21. I thought her character, was spot on for her thought process at that age, and her intelligence, was quick to come to light. I personally can not wait to get back to the store to pick up the rest of the series, I have a kindle, but this is a series, I plan to loan out to my friends and family. If you didn't like this book, well, I can't understand why, I absolutely loved it. It keeps to turning page after page, just to see what is going to happen next. To the Author, Karen Moning, I am glad this \\"showed up\\" on your door step."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This author really knows how to suck you into her stories! I read half of book one and was immediately connected with the main character and her story. I downloaded the following books immediately and couldn't get enough of this series! Great novel and fantastic read! Hope to see the main character again in another novel of hers!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"It isn't often you read something that surprises you. I didn't want to like the main heroine because personality types like her's often annoy me like crazy. The girl is vain, more interested in her wardrobe than the reality of the world, and gets a wake up call. Throughout the whole series, not just this book, you see this girl transform from mundane to extraordinary in unexpected and surprising ways. I won't bother summing up the book or recapping the highlights because others have already done so. But I truthfully have to say I love it when an author doesn't baby their pet characters. These characters are beautifully flawed. They are so much so (flawed that is) that they become real to me. There hasn't been a book five in a series I've anticipated more than I have the last one in this series coming out the 18th of Jan. It's on pre-order and I never do that.Read this series. It's fabulous. In fact, I only read it because it was on so many top fantasy lists on this site. In fact its on a lot of all time favorites lists everywhere. I see why now after reading all four. Thank you so much for the wonderful story, the surprise twists and turns, and all the favor and color you've thrust into the pages of this series.Absolutely A+ and a beautiful long remembered loving read."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I read this because it was recommended to me on Amazon. Boy am I glad it was. I am hooked and immediately bought the next book. Loved that too. I'm sure I will love the whole series.I was drawn into the world that Moning created and felt like I had a vested interest in the main characters. I kept reading and reading and could barely put the Kindle down. Then, just as things got incredibly exciting the book ended. Lucky for me, the next book was already written and available on Kindle so I could pick up where I left off. I feel sorry for those who read this when it was first released and had to wait to continue the journey.Get this book, fasten your seatbelt, hold on tight, and enjoy the ride!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I couldn't sleep one night and stared at my TBR pile. Darkfever has such a pretty cover that I decided to go for it. Thank god I bought this with book two! I haven't been able to put these books down. My cats have to start crawling on me and my husband has to put his arm around me, I'm that swept away. The writing, pacing and plot twists are addictive!Now on to Mac. Moning obviously wrote book one about a young woman having to grow up fast. She's a completely different person in book two. Don't lose faith in her, she grows a lot and it takes her a while to learn about this world.As for Jericho, he's the most intriguing character, I want more scenes with him! There's obviously some kind of history with him and V'lane. I wasn't sure whether to like V'lane or not, or even what his story was about. Guess I'll find out in future books! :)I'd like to add that it is refreshing to read a book that doesn't need a hookup or a happy ending/relationship/marriage."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I loved this book! I'm almost embarassed that I got it for free, because it is definately worth [...] bucks. The heroine Mackayla reminds me of buffy the vampire slayer without the corny valley girl slang. The anti-hero hero Jerrico is smokin hot! yeah, He might be an ass, but he's there for Mac when she needs him the most. Run don't walk to get this book."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I think I've read all of Moning's books, so I was excited to read this book, even though she said it is not a romance. It definitely is NOT a romance, but it sure does sizzle. Mac (main character) tells her story in past tense and she is reliving it for us. If you like Karen Marie Moning's books for their wit and imagery, you will like this book... just don't expect romance (at least not in this part of the series)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"You know what it is like to be so captivated by a book and the characters in it that when the book ends you are sad that there aren't anymore chapters? That is how I felt after reading this book. The author has a magical writing style that draws you in so subtley that within a few pages you are completely invested into what is happening. I tore through the pages so quickly that I was surprised that I had reached the end!I literally did not want to put the book down, so I flipped back through the pages trying to \\"re-live\\" some of the events. What I found on my second read through was a new appreciation for just how sublte this author is. She tossed away foreshadowing bits of information that I completely missed on my race to finish - and discovering them made me LOL!I have recommended this book to friends and family, both male and female, of ages from teen to retired. They have all loved it as much as I have and eagerly await the next installment in the series. Now I recommend to you, read the first chapter and see for yourself just how enthralling this author is! Happy reading =)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I started Darkfever, it was something different for KMM and something different for myself. Wow, I'm so glad that I decided to read it because Darkfever is the first book in the most compelling and enthralling series I've ever read!I don't get the MacKayla hate, she's a 20something year old girl who prior to her sister dying didn't have a care in the world, I know people like her! It's great watching the evolution of MacKayla Lane in the hands of such a talented story teller.If you haven't read Darkfever yet now is the perfect time to start! All five books in the Fever series are out so there is no wait time between books. Turn off your phone, computer and tv and jump into KMM's Fever World. It will take you on an incredible ride!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I've heard more than one person say they can tell whether they will like a book if it hooks them from the beginning. I can tell you that if I subscribed to that notion, I would have missed out on one of the best series I've ever read. \\"Darkfever\\" didn't hook me from the start. In fact, I thought about putting it down a couple of times at the beginning. The story is about a 22 year-old blonde Georgia peach, who lives with her mom and dad. She likes pink and happy music. She grates on me. But having read the entire book and those after it, I see that we had to meet Mac when she is this way. We had to see who she WAS before we can truly appreciate the metamorphosis she undergoes.Mac's sister, Alina, was an exchange student in Ireland, when she was brutally killed. The police give up on her case quickly, prompting Mac to fly across the ocean. She only intends to push the cops to keep investigating. But she is drawn into the intrigue that was responsible for her sister's death. Mac's only clue about what happened to Alina is a voicemail she left hours before she died. She tells Mac that she has to find the Sinsar Dubh... and that sets Mac on a quest to find out what that is and how to find it.On the streets of Ireland, Mac begins to see things she can't believe are real... hideous monsters in the guise of human beings. And one night she finds herself in an abandoned neighborhood, surrounded by a sense of dread. She barely makes it out, to a well-lit bookstore, called Barrons Books & Baubles. The man inside, Jericho Barrons, is a sexy, enigmatic man who is larger than life and somewhat foreboding. When she asks him about the Sinsar Dubh, which turns out to be a powerful book, it sets off a series of interactions that lead them into a partnership. Barrons explains to Mac that she is a Sidhe-Seer... someone who can see the Fae and sense their sacred objects, the book being one of them. Barrons has been looking for the book too, for reasons he doesn't explain. They team up to find it.Barrons is very hard to read. Mac's descriptions of him show they are clearly attracted to each other. But there is something about him that is not entirely human. He's somehow more. He's also very tight-lipped about who/what he is and what his ultimate plans are. There is way too much going on to plot it all out, but I can say Mac learns things about herself that change her entire view of her life; she learns what her sister was doing in Ireland and who she was doing it with; and she learns that all Fae do not wear the face of a monster.This is not a romance, despite Karen Marie Moning's great work with her Highlander books. There is no sex to be found. But you could definitely make a case that there is something brewing between Barrons and Mac. Their interactions are complex and confusing (to Mac and to the readers.) And they become even more so as the books progress.It took me awhile to get into this book. But as the series continues... you fall deeper and deeper into this dark world. The most important thing I can tell you is this: if you plan to read this series, do not begin without having all 5 books in front of you. Start with Darkfever and read them one after another. Each book ends with a cliffhanger, and you'll kick yourself if you don't have the next book ready and waiting. The wait betweenDreamfever: The Fever SeriesandShadowfevernearly killed me.4 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book was very entertaining and creates a wonderful fae world within our world. I was surprised this was in the romance section, because though there are very sexually charged moments, this came off more as a mystery/supernatural novel about a girl looking for her sister's supernatural killer. That being said, I still enjoyed it and was turning the page to see what she was going to come across next."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"With only months to go until the 5th and final book in the Fever Series is released, I've had to look back over the progression of MacKayla Lane. While she starts out as pretty and pink and so very naive, she is no longer that way by even book 3 (FaeFever). Some will go from the highlander series expecting Mac to be similar to Gwen, Chloe, Gabby, or any of the other Highlander Heroine's. Mac ends up as so much more, having to accept a reality beyond what even those other Heroines had to accept (and two of them are married to time traveling Druids). There is not just one Hero in Mac's world. There is dark and brooding Barrons; the ever presumptuous Fae V'layne, and a few others along the way. This is not a romance, anyone looking for it to be one will be sorely disappointed.Even Karen herself was worried about writing Mac's story when she saw pretty pink Mac. But after knowing Black Mac, the journey has so been worthwhile.Karen makes Mac's journey memorable, and the supporting cast will keep you on your toes wondering what their hidden agendas are and what's going on behind the scenes that we don't see. This set will not be for everyone, but don't be so quick to judge the whole set on the way Mac is presented in DarkFever. If you do, you're missing out on a hellofa story."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is the first book in the five book Fever series by Moning. The fifth book \\"Shadowfever (Mackayla Lane)\\" is scheduled to release in January of 2011. I enjoyed this first book in the series, although you can tell the purpose of this book is mainly to introduce us to Mac and the world she's been thrust in to.MacKayla Lane, Mac to her friends, is your typical southern belle Barbie-doll type. She loves shopping, scoping out hot guys, and dressing in pink. Then she finds out that her sister, who is studying abroad in Dublin, has been brutally murdered. With the Dublin police poised to set aside the case for lack of evidence, Mac decides to travel out to Dublin and do some investigating of her own. She finds out that she barely knew what her sister was really up to in Dublin; her sister had gotten involved something dark and deadly. Now Mac is being drawn into the darkness too. Mac finds out she is a Null, a very rare type of Fae Seer....and unfortunately Fae don't like Nulls. Now with most of paranormal Dublin out to kill her Mac will need the assistance of the dark and dangerous Jericho Barrons if she is going to survive long enough to hunt down her sister's killer. So good-bye pink high heels and hello black sneakers...Mac's got some Fae to kill.If you like Buffy the Vampire Slayer you will enjoy this book. It really has that same type of vibe going on; pretty blond fashion obsessed girl finds out that she is destined to fight evil dark bad things. Mac comes off as a bit ditsy, fluffy, and naive in the beginning on the book; but as the story continues we start to see a tough core of bravery and stubbornness. Barron is everything you could hope for in a hero; tough, complex, mysterious, seriously bad-ass, and of course gorgeous.Moning does a great job of writing a well-rounded novel. The surrounding descriptions are very good, so you can easily picture the surroundings. The characters are complex and interesting, with many shades of grey to their personalities. The action scenes are well done too. Of course, time is taken to describe Mac's colorful outfits, which soothes the fashionista in me. The world-building is creative, fantastic, and very engaging. There is definitely some dark humor throughout the book, which lightens things up and keeps them from getting too dark.The story was hard to put down and made for a quick read. There is a lot of mystery to be solved and this mystery really keeps you turning pages. This book does wrap up the main storyline of Mac finding her sister's killer, but it doesn't resolve it. In fact you are left with a pretty big cliffhanger. I think if I had read this book when it was first released I would be pissed at how the story ends. Luckily I have the next three books already, so I don't have to wait to continue the story. My recommendation would be to buy the second book with the first one so that you don't have to wait to find out what happens.I was a bit leery about reading a series of books written by a prominent romance author. I shouldn't have worried though...this book is not a romance it is a great dark urban fantasy. All in all it is a pretty dark story with lots of creepy gross evil Fae. It is definitely a read for a mature audience; there are a couple almost rape scenes and some sexual situations as well as quite a bit of swearing.Overall I thought this was a strong urban fantasy and I really enjoyed it. It didn't absolutely blow me away, like Ilona Andrew'sMagic Bites (Kate Daniels, Book 1)series did or Faith Hunter'sSkinwalker (Jane Yellowrock, Book 1)series did, but it was engaging and interesting. This book was very much an introduction book and I have a feeling that the story will grow in complexity and interest with the next book in the series,Bloodfever: The Fever Series (A Mackayla Lane Novel)."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I nearly didn't finish this book, but worked through it because a friend had recommended it highly. I am SO GLAD I did. Our protagonist comes off as immensely shallow, self-centered, whiny, and unlikable, and it nearly ruined it for me. But, for those of you who are thinking of stopping- don't! Keep reading! Not only does MacKayla have an \\"awakening\\" of sorts in this book, but we get introduced to one of the most intriguing characters I've ever read about- Jericho Barrons. And, oh, is JZB worth it.This first in series sets us up well for the rest of the books, introduces our important characters, and shoves us face-first into the world of the Fae. It also sets so many of us up for the Jericho vs. V'Lane debates and even gave me a chuckle with the various OPI nail colors (some of which I own!) that Mac talks about throughout the book. My review is probably a bit tainted because I've read and adored the rest of the series, but I encourage you to pick it up and follow through- the book is great and the rest are even better."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I am no expert on urban fantasy and will not waste any time on analyzing the quality of writing of this genre book, I am just going to say that Darkfever's standard mix of ass-kicking heroine/amusing cast of secondary characters/lore/mystery/paranormal hunks worked for me.MacKayla Lane is a 22-year old blonde southern belle/bartender/part-time student who peacefully lives with her parents in a small Georgia town. Mac's life is turned upside down when she learns her older sister Alina is brutally murdered in Dublin, Ireland. The search for the murderer is fruitless and after uncovering Alina's last cryptic voice message, Mac decides to go to Ireland and try to push the murder investigation in the right direction. In Dublin MacKayla immediately finds herself thrown into a world of Faery and learns she has a powerful connection to this world...The first thing that drew me to this book was the narrator - MacKayla. My last couple of attempts to explore the genre of urban fantasy were unsuccessful mainly because I couldn't stomach the protagonists. After enduring wimpy and boring Mercy Thompson (Moon Called) and perpetually gloomy and defiant Kate Daniels (Magic Bites), reading MacKayla's \\"voice\\" was a relief. She is not particularly smart or strong, but there is a certain lightness about her, and the fact that Mac is not traumatized by some past events is a breath of fresh air too. So many UF heroines, almost as a rule, are some kind of recovering victims. Luckily, Mac isn't one of them.The lore and the setting are enjoyable too. Karen Marie Moning builds her fairy world on Irish lore and I think succeeds in it. Her fae are interesting, with their various abilities to feed on humans' beauty, to make their unwitting victims sexually aroused, etc.What might turn off some readers is:1) This book doesn't have a conclusive ending. Darkfever is simply a first chapter in Moning's 5-part story whose major conflict will be resolved in the last book - Shadowfever - out December 2010. Only a few story threads are wrapped up in this installment.2) Lack of romance. It doesn't mean there are no hotties to swoon over however (mysterious Jericho Barrons and ruthless Fae prince Vlane are both irresistibly alluring), but at this point Mac is with neither of these guys.Overall, I enjoyed this book quite a bit. It was fast-paced, filled with entertaining characters and interesting lore. I will definitely read at least the next book in the series - Bloodfever."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I adore some nice, juicy urban fantasy here and there, Kim Harrison being my absolute favorite, so this was a pleasant way to spend my day, despite some bumps in the road it was a pleasant journey, one that I'm really looking forward to revisiting in the next four books. The story revolves around MacKayla Lane who is happily enjoying the summer and it's warm rays, lounging by the pool, listening to her ipod and not having a worry in the world, all that ends when the news of her sister's death shudders everyone's peace. Alina has been murdered in Ireland where she was studying, and Mac is obsessed with her last phone call, where she leaves her a distressing message that hooks Mac into her sisters mysterious world on the other side of the globe. So the young MacKayla flies to Ireland, she brings her charm and wit and a sense of humor and total disregard for safety with her, her lack of belief in the realm of magic puts her on a dangerous new path, one that will change her life forever. The clues to her sister's death are nothing like she has ever seen before. Her entanglement with Jericho Barrons turns her life upside down, basically ending her past habits that are no longer safe or acceptable. Together they steal some rare artifacts and make more enemies than imaginable. Mac's life wasn't all filled with magic, and battles, she went to cafes, had tea and coffee, downloaded the latest itunes and enjoyed a warm evening here and there. It added warmth and a glow to the character, making me a bigger fan, Mac was on a journey after an object that her sister died for, a dark mysterious book that had all the bad guys in the area sharpening their teeth and claws for. It was fun watching this total girl run around with a mysterious man who was on a mission to find the book for his personal library.The constant reference to \\"dark, carnal heat\\" that the few male creatures possessed in this book was a bit annoying and cheesy, too much life a romance novel for the fuzzy place in some female's heart. I appreciate the sensual tension in books as much as anyone else but this was really a bit silly, I wish it was a bit harder and less romance novel like, but overall I had a blast reading it and I can't wait to read the next few books, I all ready have the second and third and I'm anticipating diving back into Karen Moning's enticing world of fast cars, two faced men and fun old artifacts that can do some serious damage. This world she created seems broad, I'm happy that there will be five books total to this series, when something is good we want more right, so why are people complaining that they have to read on is beyond me. I'm enjoying this ride no matter where it takes me, after all I'm the guest in the authors head, the least I can do is sit back and let her tell the story.- Kasia S."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have read all 4 books in this series, and can absolutely swear to you that you won't be dissapointed!

Otherwise I probably wouldn't have read it. Urban Fantasy is not really my favorite genre. Also, somehow I've managed not to read any of Moning's books. So given all that, Darkfever was a wonderful surprise. The story sucked me right in and was a quick, fun, interesting read. The young (only 22), humorous, and determined heroine, Mac journeys into the dangerous and bewildering world of Fae who are starting to take over Dublin. In an effort to discover who murdered her much loved sister, Mac teams up with the mysterious, not very nice but full of valuable information (which he may or may not share with the poor girl) Jericho Barrons. Mac struggles with whether she can trust Jericho who doesn't go out of his way to reassure her. Nonetheless, he is her best bet for survival and finding her sister's murderer. Meanwhile, Mac's newly discovered psychic skills are extremely useful to Jericho.Moning does a great job of creating the creepy, frightening Fae and the powers they have over humans. Mac is a well-rounded character who comes into her own under enormous pressure and danger. Jericho is an intriguing hero who keeps Mac and the reader guessing as far as his motivations, ambitions and abilities.I have only one quibble. I started to get annoyed by the frequent portentous comments such as \\"I didn't realize then but...\\" \\"I later came to see...\\" \\"If only I had know how true his warning was.\\" But the ominous references to future events also fit in the 1st person narrative and the unfolding story, so it really is a small quibble.All in all, this free 1st book has drawn me into the series as well as introduced me to a talented author to read.

Great alpha men - heros or villians? Not always sure what side they are on. I am fascinated with this series and I am waiting on the edge of my seat for the next book."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I read this book because I heard it's similar to Richelle Mead's Dark Swan series. I really didn't like this book....Mac (the main character) is incredibly annoying and not relatable at all. She is this superficial blonde valley girl who is obsessed with pink and she finds herself in Ireland trying to solve the murder of her sister. This girl is a total failure in life but thinks she is smart enough to solve a murder? Seriously COME ON...And the book leaves you with a cliffhanger and lot of questions. So basically you feel like you just wasted couple of hours reading a book only to find yourself frustrated.So why 3 stars? Well after reading the other reviews and because I'm weak for cliffhangers...I read the next book and thankfully Mac grows up more and then I ended up reading the 3rd book and that was the turning point. This series becomes highly addictive after the 3rd book and you will fall in love with it by the end.So if you are going to read this book...just be prepared to not like it and then make sure you keep reading till the 3rd book because its almost worth it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is book 1 of a 5 book series with cool covers. The book is written from the first, historical point of view of a shallow and annoying 22 year old pretty blonde girl (as we are repeatedly reminded). Everytime something exciting happens, the author writes, \\"Looking back now, I don't know why I walked down that dark alley\\", or \\"Later on, I would understand the meaning of that\\"...So there's little excitement because there's all this commentary from the future.So a 22 year old shallow blonde girl goes to Ireland to investigate her sister's murder, knows no one, heeds no advice, and only gets involved in dark, dangerous things. She sees the hideous Unseelie (which I felt bad about, as I am a Merry Gentry fan), and the one Seelie prince who makes her take her clothes off and play with herself in public, she's so aroused by him.The heroine was incredibly annoying. Unlike the heroines of Charlaine Harris and MaryJanice Davidson's books (who are also young and blonde and pretty), this heroine has absolutely no charm. She comes off as spoiled, self-absorbed, rude and annoying.The hero, Barrons, is mean and dark. They have no chemistry. She's an annoying thorn, and he keeps her as a tool to find precious items.The plot is pretty good, a bit scary for a paranormal book, but not that well written (as the heroine, the hero, and the odd scenes with the Seelie prince keep on interfering with my enjoyment of the story).I will not be buying anymore of this series. Maybe the author made the heroine so annoying to contrast her with her later, more experienced and wise self, but after hundreds of pages of toughing it out, I've had enough of the heroine's first person, historical commentary."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I didn't know it was a series, so it was quite a shock to be left in the middle of everything...no answers to all the questions the book laid out. I was not a happy reader."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Be prepared - this is the first in a 5 book series. I thought it lacked the spark and sparkle of previous books. This book struck me as much more paranormal than historical fun. It left way too many things up in the air - like basic character development. We still know next to nothing about one of the main characters - something that left me feeling jipped and flat. I felt like someone had grabbed the book out of my hands when I was only halfway through reading it and refused to give it back. When I read these, I'll wait until they are all out in paperback."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book was too much about the story and not enough about romance. I like romances in which the story is a reason for the characters to be together. The thing that makes a great romantic story is the moments that the characters come together. I want to like the female and fall in love with the male. I did like the female but the male was one dimensional. I don't even know if I liked him or not. I guess it does not matter since this was not a romance. Since it was not a romance it should have been in the pure sci-fi section. At least then I would not expect romance. But usually most stories have some romance. See Knootz's Lightning. It is a horror/action book but the root of the story is a romance.I did however like the fight scene near the end. You could feel what she was thinking and it was an emotional experience. I love it when the females in sci-fi books discover powers and abilities beyond expected. However, the sex scenes would have been my worst nightmare instead of the fantasy that I expected.The main reason that I would not have bought this book was because it did not wrap up the story. I do not like series as a rule, but I can tolerate them if each book can stand on its own. Had I known that it was worse than a series: that it just stopped the way that Lord of the Ring did, I would have never read it. At least there was a reason for Lord of the Ring doing that. This writer must have felt that she was out of ideas and wanted to drag this on.However, I do still like this writer and hope that she will not drag the same story line out for five books. I never want to see the same character as lead character in more than one book except maybe the rare horror book such as Anne Rice. In a romance I only want to see that character fall in love once and only want to see him or her as supporting characters if they show up in another story line."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"First disappointment came when I realized by page three the book was going to be in the first person with only one perspective. Personally, find this style not conducive to the romantic genre... which should have clued me in because it wasn't a romance book at all. It is a \\"who-done-it\\" and not a very good one at that. I know this book is part of larger storyline within a series, but I still think each book within a series should be able to stand on its own... and this one doesn't."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I picked up this book looking for something that wasn't there at all. I thought this would be an interesting combination of two of my favorite genres, fantasy and romance. At no time at all did the main character have any sort of relations with any other character...not even a true friendship. The story was just okay. I have read books written for teenagers which had more depth and were more interesting than this book. I will never read one of her 'so-called' romances again."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"No offense, but this book was not interesting at all. I started reading diligently for the first 70 pages, but then it started getting really boring. I skimmed through and found only a dumb blond (who becomes a sexaholic whenever that other fae thing shows up) running around with some guy name Jericho (which reminds me of a bad reality show). Yeah, they're searching for some book.great. But that's about all I got from it. It's not so much there's no romance because I do read genres other than romance, but it just doesn't give her books about the Fae (such as Adam Black) any justice. It's blah. But, I love Love love her other books because at least the ongoing story of abhoeal and the unseelie made sense. Now I'm all thrown off and confused. PLEASE STOP USING BLOND CHARACTERS ITS GETTING OLLLLLLLLLDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"While I was browsing around at the library, I noticed that this book had an, ahem, interesting cover and the summary seemed interesting too, so I decided to check it out. How glad I am that I just got it from the library and didn't buy it.Instead of being a romance like the cover suggested, this book is more like an adventure/mystery book. An extremely bad adventure/mystery book. It's about the heroine trying to find out who killed her sister, but I couldn't bother caring, as I found her completely boring. The book gets so wrapped up in its fae plot that I found it didn't develop her at all and left a big cliffhanger ending. Even worse, this book didn't even contain what I was looking for."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"When I was offered the chance to review DARKFEVER, I immediately accepted. I've heard so many good things about this series. I've heard it straddles urban fantasy and paranormal romance. I've heard it features a strong and likable protagonist as well as a rich world full of mythological beings, yet set in present-day Ireland. All of which things served to pique my interest. This was my first Karen Marie Moning book and I had high hopes for it as it is the first in a series of four books so far. The fifth and next installment--Shadowfever--will be published early next year. As a longtime series reader, I like coming into an already established set every now and again. It goes a little ways toward balancing out all the others you've got lined up and are waiting impatiently for.MacKayla \\"Mac\\" Lane is Southern belle through and through. Born and bred in Georgia, she and her big sister Alina followed their mother's proper example. But while Alina was always the studious straight laced daughter, Mac was the laid back one. Dropping out of college after a couple of semesters, she takes a job tending bar in a local pub and working on her tan in the off hours. Then the world comes crashing down around her. Her sister Alina is murdered while on study abroad in Dublin. And it isn't your run-of-the-mill mugging gone wrong. Alina's body was literally torn apart and the Dublin police have all but closed the case for lack of evidence. Sick of watching her parents sink further and further into depression and grief, Mac hops a plane to Ireland determined to make the police see reason and reopen her sister's case until the culprit is caught and brought to justice. Just before her death, Alina left a hysterical and cryptic message on Mac's phone and it is that fragment of a clue that pushes Mac deeper into the Dublin underground than she thought possible. And it is there that she discovers the fairy tales she read as a child--the things that go bump in the night--aren't so made up after all.Essentially, DARKFEVER reads like Sookie Stackhouse-lite. Mac is blond and beautiful like Sookie. She likes nice things and she's smarter than people take her for. But she doesn't possess quite the depth of the telepathic barmaid from Bon Temps. I wanted to like her, but her cluelessness and lack of spark began to wear on me after awhile. I appreciated the Dublin setting with the rain and the fog, the endless pubs and the warm, cozy bookstores popping up out of nowhere. But the world itself never leaped off the page at me. Similarly, the Celtic mythology and the various factions of fae are right up my alley, but . . . I don't know. Some vibrant element was missing and my interest palled and eventually stalled out. The glossed over writing and characterization left me with only vague impressions of who, what, and where. The dark and deceptive Jericho Barrons who Mac encounters shortly after arriving in Dublin, and with whom she is repeatedly thrown together to find the object her sister was looking for, clearly works for many readers. But I found him unlikable and callous, any redeeming qualities failing to materialize in time for my affections to be engaged. I think I would have appreciated a little more backbone and a little less pink lip gloss from Mac and a little less chauvinistic manhandling and a little more complexity from Jericho. Or at least a stronger connection between the two to keep me going. I like that there is no precipitous romance in this first book, but as these two are the pillars on which the book rests, I needed to at least believe in some reason why they would be friends. And I just didn't. Overall, I finished DARKFEVER lukewarm at best and, with so many options out there, I will not be continuing on with the series.Reading Order: DARKFEVER,Bloodfever,Faefever,Dreamfever, andShadowfever"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"What started as a story that could have been a mildy entertaining read, turned out to be a dissapointment bordering on the insulting.For all the research the author must have done in order to give decent descriptions of places in Dublin and use of the Irish language, she completely lost me at her first dialogue of the main character with an Irish character. Irish people do not speak like that. I quote:\\"Evenin' t'ye, m'dear,\\" the desk clerk said cheerfully. (wait for it...wait for it....) \\"Opin you 'ave reserves, a'sure ye'll be needin' 'em such a foine night th'season.\\"If you can't do an accent right, don't do it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I am a huge fan KMM. I have read all of her books, and this series, with this particular style of writing is definitely not her best. The story premise has a lot of potential (that's why I just bought the second book), but the writing does not compare with her earlier Highlander series. I know, because I have just started to re-read the first one, Beyond a Highland Mist. That writing was captivating and beautifully done. This style is difficult keep interested in. The main character is positively annoying and grated on my nerves. If it wasn't for the basic story line of good and evil Fae, and the very interesting and sexy character of Jericho Barrons, I think I would have simply abandoned this book long before I finished it. It was definitely a challenge to finish, But since I did see it through, and the next one is a continuation of the cliffhanger, I've decided to hang in there and read the second one. KMM if you are reading this, please, please, please write the next one- Fae Fever-in the style that you truly excel in. Go back to your original writing.. George, from Dead Like Me does not work well in this kind of story."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"MacKayla (Mac) Lane tends bar, thinks about college (some day), works on her perfect tan, and enjoys being blond, beautiful, and virtually Barbie. But when her sister is murdered while an exchange student in Dublin Ireland, and the local police are unable to make progress, Mac decides she needs to do something. That something consists of ignorning her parents' advice and flying to Dublin in an effort to get the police to re-open the case. Somehow or other, Mac intends to find her sister's killer.Dublin is strange to a young woman who's only been outside her small Georgia town for a few (essential) shopping trips to Atlanta. The bar scene is super-active, but Mac is shocked to see beings that appear sometimes as beautiful people and simultaneously as horrible monsters. The monsters are devouring people, swallowing their beauty, or simply promising to give them so much sex it ultimately kills them. When she openly stares, a stranger calls her a strange Irish name and demands that she not give herself away. By luck or fate, though Mac's search brings her to a strange bookstore in the midst of a dead and deserted part of the city. Its owner, handsome but dangerous Gabriel Barrons, knows about the monsters. After first demanding that Mac run for her life, he abruptly switches tactics and demands that she join him to prevent the Unseelie from destroying the world.Mac can't decide whether Barrons is on her side, her enemy, or (which seems most likely) on a side that's completely his own. But he is interested in the one clue that her sister left--and the two form a grudging partnership. Their partnership takes them into some of the most dangerous places in Dublin--including a possible vampire's den and a gangster hangout.Author Karen Marie Moning writes a compelling paranormal adventure. Barrons is a wonderfully mysterious hero--dark, dangerous, and keeping secrets that just might be deadly. Mac begins as a complete ditz, more interested in her nail polish than in the possibility that all humanity is threatened, but grows as a character without really loosing that ditzy charm. Moning offers a take on the Seelie Courts that is darker than most modern fiction and I found this a refreshing difference.DARKFEVER is clearly the beginning of a series and neither the romance nor the danger was brought to conclusion, but my interests were definitely engaged and I found this a hard book to put down. I'll definitely look for the next book in this series, and am happy to recommend DARKFEVER for those who enjoy paranormal romance and truly dangerous alpha heroes."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I listened to the unabridged audio edition of Dark fever, and I must say I'm impressed. The narrator did an excellent job bringing the likes of Mac and Jericho to life. Her southern accent was very well done and quite appealing to me.The plot is an interesting story, set around a murder mystery. The heroine is a young Naive woman who travels to Ireland to find her sister's killer. Instead she discover that she has an unexpected ability: the ability to see fey, fairy beings and to stop \\"Freeze\\" them.Mac also meets a mysterious man who works at a bookstore.Strangely, while I loved the plot (It reminds me of the Merry Gentry series), I didn't like the two main characters. Mac is an irksome girly-girl who despite the masculine nickname, is about as prissy as you can get. I got bored hearing how the perfect, beautiful heroine can eat what she wants due to her great metabolism. (Meh). I'd prefer the heroine to be more flawed and less perfect. Someone I can relate to. Mac's flawlessness was a chore. Plus I don't care for the masculine nicknames on female characters.I also didn't care for Jericho. I'm not sure if he is intended to be the hero, but I found him to be an abusive jerk. I'm not a big fan of aggressively alpha a**holes but Jericho suits the bill. I really wanted to see him taken down a peg of two, and I hated the way he manhandles Mac. At one point he picks her up and holds her against the wall, bruising her. This is supposed to be appealing? yuck.I did enjoy the fae lore. The various creatures Mac encounters on her quest are interesting. I felt a bit disenchanted by Mac/Jericho. I saw no real chemistry there, and would like to see them hook up with other people. Also, I really like the world-building Moning has created, the characters and setting was very sensual and descriptive. I hope future books aren't set all in Ireland, 'tho. One of the interesting things about Urban Fantasy is that the Fae could be anywhere."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I bought this book with a lot of trepidation because I knew that this was not a romance and I was not sure I was going to like Karen's books without it.I was extremely happy to be proven wrong. I LOVED the book. The characters are human (or not) depending on who we are talking about. You find yourself so drawn into the story and worrying about the heroine and wondering how you could help her (with what WE know as the readers of the other Karen books). I found myself screaming at the herine not to do this or to do that. To me that is the mark of a great story and a great story teller. I can NOT wait for the next installment."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Wow! I didn't think anything could top Moning's Highlander series, but now I know she's been keeping the good stuff for last. Know the world that's been the background of her Highlander books? It's the foreground of the new series. We finally get to learn more about Adam's race, the Seelie and the Unseelie. Mac is an amazing character, one I could totally relate to. Jericho is a gorgeous enigma and V'lane, well, he's downright terrifying with all that sex appeal, which is what I think Moning intended. As far as waiting for the next book, sure I wish I had it now, but I wish I had the next Harry Potter now too. Don't let the negative reviews fool you. The characters are complex, the plot rips you along and I think it's Moning's best work yet."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Karen has to be my favorite author. I love all the books in her series. I was so excited when I found out about this release. I pre-ordered it on Amazon and counted the months to the release.The book was very suspenseful and well written. It carried on the story line started in previous books, which was nice. It was nice being able to get a different version of the story line from someone other than the MacKeltars (although I love the Mackeltars!!!).Where this book disappoints is that it is not a romance novel and I love romance novels. And I am not talking about sex scenes, which there aren't any. That isn't what makes a book a romance novel for me. The characters never seem to connect on any meaningful level for me. They are using each other to survive and get through, so for me it is more an action novel, which is fine if you want to read a supernatural action novel.The heroine is OK, nothing great there. I doubt we would be friends in real life (unlike Gwen or Chloe from previous books). Barrons, the \\"hero?\\", is too self centered. Which is normally fine, if the hero redeems himself throughout the book. I never really felt he did.If this story and the characters are carried on into the next book, I hope that we see the characters develop a little faster. I, personally, don't want to read several books to get to the growth that usually occurs in one novel. Just not me.I will definitely buy the next book, but with less enthusiasm as before."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I knew from KMM's website that Darkfever was the start of a new series and that many of the elements that characterized her other romance titles would be missing from this book. I think that preparation helped me enjoy what was, in my opinion, a fast-paced and intriguing read that has me totally hooked. I'm really looking forward to the next installment in the series and seeing what else KMM has up her story-telling sleeve.Twenty-two year old MacKayla Lane's life changes the day she gets the call informing her that her older sister Alina has been murdered in Dublin. After she receives a mysterious voicemail message from her sister, left on the day she died, Mac -- in a fit of impulse and determination -- takes off for Ireland to find her sister's murderer. From her first day in Dublin, however, things begin to spiral out of control and Mac finds herself immersed in a situation that is as unexpected as it is unbelievable. Partnered with the mysterious Jerricho Barrons, who promises to keep Mac alive as long as she's willing to help him, Mac finds herself running for her life from Unseelie bad guys who know she is a sidhe-seer and will gladly kill her for that offense alone. To stop the \\"Lord Master\\" of the Unseelie Fae from unleashing his race upon unsuspecting mankind, Mac and Jerricho must seek out the powerful Fae Hallows and the evil Sinsar Dubh.Easier said than done.I very much enjoyed the fast pace of this novel and the fresh interpretation of Fae mythology. The moment I saw the words \\"Seelie\\" and \\"Unseelie\\", I cringed, fearing that I'd see a rehash of Laurell K. Hamilton's Merry Gentry series. But Moning's angle was her own -- and no sex scenes were harmed during the writing of this book! KMM, author of the well-known Highlander romance novels, promises that the romance and sex scenes will come in future books, but I have to say that I didn't miss them here. Darkfever, refreshingly UNLIKE the Merry Gentry series, was more plot than porn, and while the book left a lot of loose ends waiting to be tied off in future books, I was intrigued rather than frustrated by all the unanswered questions.I had two minor quibbles about this book. The first relates to Mac. Short, sexily-curved, and sassy-mouthed, with long blond hair and green eyes, Mac is highly reminiscent of Moning's other heroines. Also like Moning's other heroines, she's smart and capable and not lacking in courage, even if she does regularly rush in where angels fear to tread. Still, the familiarity irked me a bit. I would have appreciated a different sort of heroine for this different sort of book. My other quibble is with the mysterious Jerricho Barrons. After the first book, all we really know of him is that he's wealthy, abrasive, and arrogant. He asks questions and demands answers, but offers none in return. Who is he? WHAT is he? I suppose that for the pacing of the series, we know all that we need to know of him at this point. In fact, his mysteriousness may be one of the biggest factors in keeping me reading, for I'm well and truly hooked on him now. But at the same time I guess I wanted just a little bit more, because by the time the book ended, I still wasn't sure he could be trusted.If you're interested in Fae mythology and willing to step outside the box Moning built with her other novels, you may enjoy this one quite a bit. I sure did!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I love KMM's Highlander Series, and I think I'm going to love this new series as well! It's completely different and frankly, refreshing written in first person. I like the characters she has selected for this series, and it will be interesting to watch them develop over the 5 books planned. For romance-diehards, this book is not for you. It's a mystery/crime novel more than anything, and is set in modern-day. It has the fantasy elements Ms. Moning is known for, and is definitely not a period piece. There is no tidied-up ending - actually, there is no ending. So beware if you were expecting something along her Highlander Series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":".....she has never let us down before with her yummy highlanders, and she doesn't this time either! This will be a romance series eventually, but if you take into account that this book covers only the first couple of months after Mac's sister dies, romance RIGHT NOW would be a disservice to these characters! I read the book in one sitting, and was irritated when it ended ONLY because there was no more to read! This looks like it will be a great series and I CANNOT WAIT until the next one comes out. Give it a chance...don't be turned away by these bad reviews."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I expected to enjoy this book because I have really enjoyed the author's more recent novels. WHat I found is that it reads very much like a Janet Evanovich novel, an author I know Moning admires because she has mentioned Janet in this book and the previous one. The book is written in the first person with zippy dialogue, like an Evanovich novel.That said, the plot is all Moning with Fae intrigue. I think its a good idea to read her earlier books first so that you understand the Fae realm and have an idea about why the fabric of the two worlds (Fae and human)may have come undone (as a result of the Keltar family).I finished the book really wanting to read more. It seems obvious that MacKayla and Barrons will get together eventually and I don't mind waiting for it. (After all, in the Stephanie Plum series by Evanovich, the two lead characters didn't get together until book 4.) In the absense of sex between the two main characters, the long looks and sexual Faes keep up the heat. I liked that a bunch!Enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I should begin by saying that KMM is, by far, my favorite author. This book is a huge departure from her usual writing style. The plot does relate (in a roundabout way) to her highlander series. It is written in the first person (not her usual style), which I found to be distracting.The main character, Mac, is terribly annoying. I suspect the author intentionally made her vain and immature so that we, the readers, can watch her evolve over the course of the series. I think the secondary characters would have been far more interesting if they weren't limited by the first-person point of view.While I did enjoy this book's fast-paced plot, I really hope the author hasn't completely abandoned her romance writing career. I'll read at least one more in this series to see if it's any better than Dark Fever. If not, I'll just have to wait and see if she returns to the romance genre.Bottom line: Great Sci-Fi book. Romance?...Not exactly"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I've read all of Karen Monings books. I can see where some readers may be distressed at her new book because it does not align with the structure of her previous books - a very sexy, happily ever after storyline encompassed in one book.However, I'm glad to see that she strayed from the ordinary because you can only write so many books with the same formula. I think that this was a good starting point of what's to come, it was darker and the heroine (though a bit ditzy at times) has potential. This is definitely worth the read and I can't wait until the next book."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Wow! I am away on business and picked up my book at a local bookstore. I devoured it in one night and just closed the cover.However, before I did, I shouted out (in the lobby!!) OH, that is just not right! I hate that it ended and is leaving me waiting, wanting more. This book was a wonderful building block for the story to come. I cant wait to peel the petals back on this whole plot. This is not a departure from her usual style--It is wonderful and new.

Hurry Hurry Karen.Kathleen"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Picked up this book a few days ago and WOW really enjoyed it. I didn't really care about the romance factor especially at the end when Jericho and Mac have readched a new level in their relationship. Started off fast and didn't end they're. Mac's sister Alina is suddenly murdered and Mac rushes to Ireland to find the murderer not knowing what awaits her. Jericho Barrnes suddenly appears and becomes a big Pain in her life. I highly recommend this book even low on the romance scale, because if you read book the romance is still they're. Can't wait to Bloodfever now,so many unanswered questions. Highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I'm not normally a fan of first person stories. Karen proved that it can be done extremely well.I've seen some complaints about the lack of sex in this book. If there had been, it would have been gratuitous at best. I appreciate that she doesn't insult my intelligence by just throwing it in there. She's taking the time to craft her story, and oh boy, what a story it's turning out to be. I'm smart enough to figure out it's a series, and I'm much happier for it. That means more and more (at least 4 more) of this particular story.It is obvious that she has researched and plotted this series well. You're not led by the nose to see everything that's going on. There are a lot of questions raised in the opening book, and I'm having a blast trying to figure out what they all can mean."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Expect to enjoy this for it's humor and quick pace. I loved the action. Even knowing there won't be real romance. Even knowing this will be an entire series based on MacKayla O'Connor (all straight from this horse's mouth?/1st person-narrative overhaul!). I DID like it. So, why do I feel like Mac coming around on the museum floor surrounded by onlookers, half naked and dripping with anticipation of -- something that just didn't happen?? There is a lot she left out. Not just the sex. It's everything that goes into knowing that there will be intimacy. Here, there's not even a ? of it. Nothings gonna happen, and you know it.It's as if the author said, get your kicks somewhere else while I tell ya about my Ipod. Her few attempts at sexuality reminded me of things Nicole Richie would say; or a 15 year old boy."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I'll give this book a three, a solid three- but a three none the less. Now, when I bought the book I was fully aware of the genre-shift in progress but I was unprepared for the extent of the shift. One move at a time, please? Simultanious shifts in Genre and person are too much for one book.My quibbles with the book are few and none are really fatal flaws. First the attempt at realism makes the protag irritating. This maybe so that she can grow into something we actually want to read about, but right now she fights the book too much. If the main character is refusing to play along it becomes difficult to invest in the story. This may be an artifact of the first person narrative-- We could just be to much in one person's head for a paranormal romance setting, which thrive on the unknown.My other concern is the V'lane character and his scenes of questionable taste. I always thought of the Highlander novels as tasteful romances with minimal squicky sex. It's one of the reasons I like the author. No more panting panty shots, please?"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I do not want to say I didn't like the book at all since I enjoy Karen's writing so much, but I was so disappointed. I am afraid \\"fever\\" is one series I will not be reading unless I find the books in a second hand store. I didn't find out anymore about the story at the end of the book then I did in the first few chapters. Mac sees fae objects and feas (good and bad). Jericho Barrins is either a good guy or the devil in disguise. Mac's sister is still dead and we don't know who killed her or where her journal is. I always pre-order all of Karen's books, but when the price is $20.00 per book I expect a complete story not a very long prologue. . Karen states this is the first of 5 books about the same story plot, $120 is way out of my budget for 5 incomplete stories."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This has been edited, didn't feel right about my original review:I've read everything KMM's ever written. Some I've reread. That rarely happens these days. But when I saw she was writing a new series I was a little apprehensive. Something new? Not romance? NO SEX!! She wouldn't be continuing with the MacKelters? I wasn't at all sure about this. But finally I bought Darkfever and read it. It wasn't bad. It wasn't great either but I'm not reading literary fiction here. First my complaints (I always have complaints):In her other books KMM uses the same heroine over and over again. I can't even tell you which book Chloe was in and which one Gwen was in and I can't remember the names of any of the others. But I got the heroes down pat - in romance, I think that's the point but I'm not 100 percent sure. Mac was actually a little more defined than the others believe it or not. I just didn't see her heading to Ireland alone - with a friend maybe but not alone. Unless she had a past history of running away from home or a juvie record - that would have ROCKED! Come on, she was pretty cool about going into pubs alone for a Barbie knock off. But in romance a heroine with a record isn't cool - too bad. She could still have been TSTL - another requirement in romance, I think. The pink was a little irritating. And blonde! I guess they do have more fun.The story started dragging a bit somewhere around the time the cars were introduced. Come on, Karen, write a hero with an environemental conscious - I'll bet there are electric Porsches out there. The Black and White Mansion was almost like a black and white hole. I almost put the book down at that point. Thank god for the vampire! He really picked things up. I'd like to see him more.So I liked the vampire. I started liking Jerricho more as I read. He started out kind of repulsive - the word 'Carnal' doesn't seem to work for me. I think he's going to end up being the romantic interest for Mac but I kind of like him better as a twisted, dark mentor. The fae were pretty well drawn I thought. I could see the grey man and the many-mouthed thing pretty well. Her descriptions of Dublin were excellent. I could see the city as Mac did. Of course, I have my own memory of a hotel room in London decades ago to compare with her little hotel room. The lore was fascinating. The description of dark zone was wonderfully vivid. The lord master could have used more build up. I'm glad the people who died did; I didn't like them and they contributed nothing to the story. So after a rocky start the story picked up and improved. Mac rose to the challenges that were set before her.I honestly do think this book was a near miss for me but fortunately KMM has a lot of credibility with me. I can name a few authors that don't. She's come through for me on all of her other books and I have every reason to believe this series will only improve. And I've got to say I think it's very funny that the most common complaints I've seen here about this series is the lack of sex. She does write some good ones.I will read the rest of the series. Maybe I'll wait for the paperback version - but I'm already getting kind of itchy for Bloodfever.Sure hope she brings in some Mackelters though. I would thing they're about to go stir crazy sitting in the castle with those cardboard blondes. Go Daegus!! Go Drustan!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I loved the 1st book in the fever series! It's different than the highlanders books.Not quite a love story yet. I still couldn't stop reading!! I so wish she could write faster!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I LOVED IT! Man, the Prologue gets your attention, and the first chapter just sucks you right in. I stopped reading this only while driving or to sleep. I couldn't put the book down. I love reading Karen's books, and she is by far one of my favorite writers for Historical Romance books.MAC is this down to earth, totally her generation, type of girl. Life is bliss, no real cares in the world...the kind of kids we, of the previous generation (or generations), would like to knock on the head with something really hard, probably out of jealousy (tanning by a pool, living off the parents, not REALLY working or getting an education), and Yell --- Get A Life Barbie!Well MAC did. Now she's knee deep in it. I'm only sorry that I have to wait until October to read the next part of her life...and Barrons'. Looks to be quite interesting. I also hope some of the future 4 books engage some familiar people from the past that come to help out; particularly Druids."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Once again Karen Moning has hooked me. As with the Highlander series, I was sucked in from almost the first sentence. Her characters are always well put together, and you can always identify with the heroine in some way. At the very least, you cheer her on. Mac has just lost her sister, and basically her innocence. It's endearing the way she admits to her \\"fairy tale\\" sort of life, and her expectations. She's coming to terms with her nature, and heredity and Barrons is just the one to do it.Moning has a way with her characters that has you feeling what they feel, laughing when they laugh, and crying when they are crying or should be crying."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Karen's book 2 in the series continues to chronicle Mac's journey into the ever changing world of the Fae. Karen continues to perfect the writing genre as she details Mac's life...you will find yourself smiling as you recognize a few favored characters, and the ending is perfect! This book will leave you wanting Faefever sooner than it's slated release date, but remembering that Karen's health comes first and the release date will give her time to write AND take care of herself.Thank you Karen for this series and for all your other books!!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Unimpressed is being nice actually. I understand having flawed characters. In fact, most of my favorite characters in literature are the really flawed ones. But in her attempt to make her charactets \\"flawed\\" the author just made them flat. The story seemed forced. The interactions between Mac and Barrons were superficial. The idea of bad faeries breaking into our world was great. Its a shame the author was unable to write it well."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Moning always gets a lot of positive kudos on the Amazon forums, so when Darkfever was offered free on Kindle, I thought why not try one of her novels.Unfortunately this doesn't seem to be a good book to start reading Moning. I gather it is book one of a five book series. However, there wasn't much in this book that made me want to read the next four. The heroine seemed weak and at least for me not very likeable as she seems very immature. The hero on the other hand seems rather aggressive and too strong for the heroine. They don't seem to have much chemistry or much in common emotionally.The end of the book leads you to the next book in the series. I guess since this is my first Moning book, I would not recommend it for others reading this author for the first time. It might have been better to start with one of her better known Highlander books."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"As a writer myself, I became so engrossed in this story, I couldn't put it down, which kept me away from my own work. Loved the first person voice, I use it myself and it's not as easy as it might seem, so when it's done well, it works like a charm.I liked it so much, I'll pay the price for hardback when the next one comes out. It took me less than 24 hours to finish the book and yearn for the next one."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I must first say that I have only read a couple Moning books and I enjoyed this one a lot. I liked the fact that unlike Laurell K. Hamilton (who sucks)she did not throw sex in there for the sake of sex. My biggest criticism of Hamilton is that sometimes the story gets lost in all the sex for the sake of sex stuff. And the only reason that I am comparing is that they both discuss the Fae, Unseelie and Seelie. Moning was refreshing in that for once folks, an author is building a story. For those who think that Jericho is not romantic, I think they are going to be surprised as the story evolves. I love Jericho in that he is an enigma. We aren't sure what he is, but believe me, when he and Mac finally get together they are going to be something.Now, on to the review. At first you think the story is simple...girl goes to Dublin to find out who killed her sister. But as the story unfolds, you find that there is more than meets the eye. Yes, Mac finds that the world that she has left in Georgia is larger than she ever imagined, and that her sister had gotten in above her head. But what I liked the most was how Moning, took a girl, who in the opening of the book was sunning by the pool in a bikini, to the woman that we see at the end, killing Unseelie Fae. I liked the evolution of the character and the way the story is told, in flashbacks. No matter what, Mac is determined to find the truth and save the world (maybe) by locating a very bad book. Now, Jericho who I think is trying a little too hard to act like he doesn't like our fearless heroine, is looked for the same book and would like to use Mac as a \\"bloodhound\\" of sorts (she can sense things).As Mac realizes that there are things that go bump in the night (vampires, gray men, and things with multiple mouths that feed on women), she prepares for the ultimate battle between good and evil.I can't wait for the other Fever novels to be released. I think they will be worth the wait. I can wait on the sex, if the story is good and I know that it will eventually come when it should."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Ms. Moning has done it again; darkfever is awesome. Mac is so for real that you just get sucked into her downward spin in Dublin.It is lovely how the threads that were alluded to in the prior books are pulled into this one. Lucan and his collection in London; The Queen of the Fae and I do believe a disposed high council member that was made human(immortal Highlander-Darroc). I am ready for the next installment-BLOODFEVER.keep up the writing as usual you are awesome."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"MacKayla Lane is stunned when she is informed that her sister Alina was murdered in Ireland. When Mac concludes that the Dublin police seem uninterested or incapable of solving the homicide, she flies from Ashford, Georgia to Ireland. Her plan is to light a fire under the cops or if that fails investigate on her own.However, Mac is further stunned when Alina leaves her with a odd cell phone message on top of her sudden ability to see creatures that do not exist outside of mythology, fantasy or horror tales. Jericho Barrons insists Mac is a sidhe seer who has the uncanny skill to see fairy and other supernatural species. He needs her to find the stolen Sinsar Dubh, a tome that can be used to open the gates between dimensions. Mac agrees on the condition he helps her find out who killed her sibling and why.DARKFEVER is an excellent twenty-first century fantasy that brings to life paranormal species and elements in a modern day context. The story line starts off as a seemingly straightforward mystery, but quickly turns into a romp on the wild side as Mac and her mysterious Jericho partner try to locate the dark tome and uncover who killed her sister. Karen Marie Moning provides a terific thriller starring an intrpied heroine who already could see the Fae, but has to adapt to much more good and evil in a vast universe filled strange and wonderous things.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Dark fever is a great beginning to what I hope will be another long series from this author. The abandoned neighborhood is a really cool idea taht I can't wait to explore more with Moning as the series progresses. the authors descriptions are vivid enough that the not-yet-made movie is already running through mind in full detail. With elements of a detective novel, a paranormal story and a thriller all wrapped up in one, I recommend this book to all readers."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"After reading the whole Highlander series of novels--(And I have read them all--several will always be favorites) -- I was expecting romance and a challenging plot--I got the challenging plot--but I wasn't expecting a mystery/thriller with nothing more then foreplay by imagination and a little old kiss--not even really decribed at the end....Yes, I was disappointed! I didn't buy this book because I was looking for a mystery/thriller---I would have enjoyed it anyway if it had smacked even a little of romance.....I will be leery of the next publication. . . unfortunately Ms. Moning has moved on to a sphere of entertainment I'm not overly interested in.Why the cover--with two naked people on it--when these two never got naked at all...Why wasn't the genre of this book stated openly on the cover--instead the reviews on the back were all about romance...it made for a very misleading sales pitch for this book..and I find THAT very disturbing."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"After reading Darkfever, I immediately purchased the rest of the series! Karen Moning has created characters that live with you long after you put the books down. I have read every book she has published to date. She has become one of my favorite authors and I am proud to call myself one of her Moning Maniacs."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Usually I stay away from faerie books because they always turn out to be cruel. At least it seems that way. Yeah, I know other mythical beings can be malevolent...but there's just something about faeries that creep me out. However, I thought this book was really interesting and I read it fairly quickly. This is not to say it's not dark, because it is. It's just really compelling.Mac's older sister Alina is brutally murdered while attending college in Ireland, but with lack of evidence and witnesses the Dublin police turn it over to the unsolved division after only twenty-one days. Spurred by a veiled message left to her cell phone Mac goes to Ireland to try to motivate them to continue the investigation. It turns out both Alina and Mac shared the same gift and are sidhe-seer's who can see through Fae glamour and sense objects of power. Jericho Barrons bookstore owner, and collector of rare things is in search for these objects of power. Mac agrees to help him in hopes it will lead to her sister's killer.It's a huge whodunit, and Mac acts like Barbie. She's really immature and can get pretty annoying when she refuses to see what's right in front of her. I can't say by the end of the book that she's grown, but I can say in the overall picture (having read the series) she grows and is determined to survive in this whole new world. Barrons is not charming at all. In fact he broods all over the place and is offish to everyone. He comes off as heartless and patronizing, but he's like this huge riddle that's begging to be solved. That's part of the intrigue of the book. Who is he, and why are we still putting up with him?One thing I majorly hate are cliffhangers...this series is full of them (five books,)like irritating cliffhangers in the middle of an important scene kind. This series reads like one huge book with breaks. The good thing is the series is finished now so as long as you have all the books nearby your good. The books get better, and I admit this first one is a bit weak, but you have to start there. My friend was telling me that it's interesting how we can get embarrassed from reading certain books even when reading is a private experience. That's sort of how I felt reading the Fever series, mostly the last book can be a bit risqu&eacute; so if you don't feel comfortable reading immodest scenes then don't start the series at all. It was the last book in this series that made me cry so much though. I was that involved with what I was reading. In the end I'm glad I read them, maybe you will be too."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Moning has become one of my favorite authors! She is right up there with Laurell K. Hamilton, J.R. Ward and Charlaine Harris!Moning takes us into a world of the Seelie and Unseelie and the quest for the Sinsar Dubh. MacKayla Lane's sister has been murdered in Ireland. Mac feels the police aren't doing their job so she flies to Dublin in hopes of finding the killer. She discovers more then she could ever bargain for. Not only is she and her sister adopted but that she is a sidhe-seer. After stumbling upon a store called Barrons Books and Baubles, she learns about her new life. Jericho Barrons is the one that is going to teach her. Barrons has been searching for the Sinsar Dubh for ages. Now that he knows Mac can sense any sidhe relic, his job has just gotten easier...or has it. The chemistry just kills me every time these two are in the same room!!Mac wants to deny what she is now. She just wants to go back to her pink bubble where everything is normal. Unfortunately that isn't going to be possible. Even the prince of the Tuatha De Danaan, V'lane wants her help. The scenes where she meets V'lane are WOW. I probably wouldn't have had her control!Underneath the whole story is the story of a family coming to grips with a tragedy. When Mac calls home to check in she finds that her father has started drinking and her mother will never come to the phone. It is really heartbreaking.Fantastic fantasy! Love the characters and the world that Moning has created. The endings leaves you wanting more. I had to go out and buy the next two books!

I enjoyed the world the author built, and the overall plot is great. Characterization was well-done, too. I didn't personally like Mac's immaturity and shallowness, but the author did a good job portraying her as a vain, coddled, young socialite twenty-something. She did mature some through this book, but I hope she matures even more in the future. I usually prefer more focus on relationships in my books, but Mac isn't ready for that yet, and it wouldn't have played well. Hopefully that'll also improve in future books.

Like, wow.---Later That Day, After My Brain Has Had Time to RecuperateSee the \\"Seriously. Like, wow\\" comment above, in the first section? Yeah. That's what this book was like. The book was a constant action-and-drama-fest. People rip on MacKayla \\"Lane\\" all the time, but I don't see what's so wrong with her. I mean, besides all the Barbie-type mannerisms and hair flips and unwillingness to use dye, she's actually quite a kick-ass chick. (Please pardon my French.) For me, she's totally likeable and non-stereotypical (I mean, maybe I'm biased, since I played with Barbies when I was five. [Yeah. Deal with it.]), and I loved her heroism and the immediate revenge-factor after her sister's mysterious and cryptic death. All of the characters were likeable, really, including the Mr. Mysterious Jericho Barrons (whom I adored, really, but didn't see the OMG-death-from-attraction factor). I was a little thrown off by how seemingly important V'lane was in the summary, but in the book, he only showed up twice (or maybe three times; the middle-ish of the book is a little hazy).The Ireland setting was described well, as was her hometown (her backyard, especially), and I felt like her sister would've been a great person if I'd have known her while she was alive. Maybe a lot like Mac, but still a good person.(And, seriously. The name. Mac? I'd personally go by Kayla if MacKayla was my name.

They grab you and pull you into a world that nobody wants to be in, but can't leave at the same time. I picked up the 1st four books in the series at once. I am a huge fan of Fae Novels, however, it is difficult to find adult ones (most are directed to teens). As a little girl (like age 5-6), I wanted my dad to read me true fae lore not the fairy book magic glitter books. Book one - I started reading on a Thursday night June 30th at 11:00pm; Read through the night without even realizing it until my dog came to get me for our morning walk. Walked the dog and finished reading Book 1 by 9:00am Fri morning. Book 2, I decided I would take my time, but ended up reading it in two different reading sessions. Book 3 was another all nighter. And I am currently reading book 4, which so far is proving to be my favorite. I was up until 1:00am this morning - Friday one week later (July 8) from when I originally picked up the books. I thought I would wait until the final book - Shawdowfever came out in soft back (Aug 30), but just ordered it as I doubt I can wait an entire month. I enjoy the concept that what you see is only the surface. I think most people see and hear what they want to see and hear, but beneath the surface of our rainbow colored lives there is much darkness and danger."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"The story is written perfectly. Characters are very believable. Can't wait to read the rest of the series. So looking forward to it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I really like science fiction, but some of the longer more difficult books just don't hold my attention, and quite frankly I don't have time to commit to long tomes. So I really liked this small easy to read book. I read it on a day off and found it entertaining. I was a little annoyed that this book has no ending and requires you purchase the next book to get any resolution. I think that is a bit of a fail, and a touch lazy. . .but not enough so to turn me off completely from the series. The character has an \\"Elle Woods\\" feel, which could be annoying, but her concern for her family does redeem her a bit. Overall it is a fun and quick read with an interesting paranormal turn."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was surprised in a good way with this 1st installment of this series. I thought that it was fresh, witty, scary @ times, & completely off the wall.I like the world building in this and character set up. There isn't alot of places in this one where the story drags. Which sometimes when u are reading in 1st person & dealing with world building happens alot. So I was happy that wasn't the case with this book. Because I was just anxious to find out as much as I could about what Mac was experiencing or stumbling upon, I did find that I would get impatient & a little irritated with her flash backs in the middle of a scene when it felt like something was about to be revealed... Ergo the 3 star rating.V'lane.. I do not like this dude! Ugh. He irked me with the power he has and the \\"compromising\\" positions he would put or leave Mac in.Barrons.. Don't know what to say about this guy. He's mysterious, sexy, intelligent, & a complete arrogant a**! But he can & will surprise u @ times in this one. I really like how things concerning he & Mac has not taken the predictable course when it comes to this type of genre. This book leaves alot of questions 2 be answered & only makes me eager to know more about this world & the people in it. U will definitely become invested in these characters I promise. I recommend this read."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"MacKayla, also known as Mac, starts out as just a typical blonde 22 year old in this book. She's flighty and a little shallow, and loves the color pink, her only worry in the world is what she wants to wear that day. Everything changes when she gets the worst phone call of her life, the one that tells her that her sister, Alina, has been brutally murdered in Dublin. When she finds out the police have stopped investigating Alina's death, Mac sets out to find the killer herself. She quickly gets in way over her head when she runs into the mysterious Barrons and finds out she can see the Fae, a very rare talent. The Fae do not like to be seen, so Mac must learn everything she can from Barrons quickly if she is to have any hope of survival.While she still has a ways to go, Mac did come a long way towards growing up and character growth. She was raised in a very sheltered life, and when she is thrown into this \\"new\\" one, it really showed. However, after much protesting, she finally started to realize that she couldn't just hide her head in the sand anymore. She is very important to the fate of humanity. I think with some time she will truly become a force to be reckoned with. Even at her most flightiness in the beginning, some of her inner strength showed considering only someone with a solid constitution would be able to fly across the ocean to a strange country to track down a murderer. Yes, this idea is a little foolish, but requires strength none the less.I loved Jericho Barren's character. He is a gruff, opinionated, very masculine character. He does everything he can to get rid of Mac in the beginning, but when she gets too deep he takes her under his wing. He insists its not for altruist purposes, that he only is helping her because she can be of use to him. However, every so often he shows a slight softness under that gruff armor. I have a feeling a love interest is brewing between the two. I think the two would work well as they would balance each other out, with Mac softening him, and he would toughen her up some.This book was really good, while mostly a world building book as it did take a while for anything to really happen. However, I didn't mind the initial slowness of the book, as Mac really needed things thrown at her slowly to give her a chance to grow up a little each time. It ended on a cliff hanger, while frustrating, makes me very eager to read the next installment. This book was a little dark, with no real romance, but there seems to be a definite potential in the future for that. It is a very good first installment in a series, and I cannot wait to see what more is in store for Mac."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This was one of my first forays into urban-fantasy-romance. I actually think the first book in the series is the weakest but I was interested enough to keep reading the rest and now I am HOOKED. Mac's character in this book is weak BUT I can appreciate the transformation she goes through and in the latter books she is presented as a more serious and less annoying character.BUT the real reason to read this series? JERICHO BARRONS. His character and one-liners are what keep me hooked. He is the perefct dark alpha male fantasy with a healthy dose of sarcastic wit. If you prefer sexy blonds keep reading for V'lane.There are a few weaknesses in the first book which thankfully go away. These are:1) Mac constantly thinking of herself as pretty. I get that you have long tanned legs. Get over it. This self-centered commentary basically stopped by Book 2.2) Fashion disaster!! What modern day 22 year old goes around wearing yellow linen suits or full length rainbow frothy skirts? Thankfully Ms. Moning stops the Mac fashion show from Book 2 forward."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Tastes are so subjective, the value of them can be questionable. That's the dilemma I faced with Darkfever. Okay... let's just get to it. Darkfever wasn't my kind of read. What's interesting is I can see why a lot of other people would like it for the very same reasons I didn't.Let's start with the main character, Mac. She reminded me a lot of Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse. In fact, I wouldn't even be surprised if the two were related. Southern bells, blond, perky cute, and both prone to getting into situations most would avoid. Although, I do believe Mac is a wee less intelligent than Sookie. All-in-all, the Mac/Sookie persona isn't bad. I admit to being a Sookie follower, even if I think she's too stupid to live at times. But really, one Sookie is enough for me. Despite the subtle differences, I just couldn't get into the Mac girl. *Subjective dislike*Barrons, on the other hand, I liked him. I guess, liked isn't the exact word. It's not like I'm fond of him as a person. I'd certainly never befriend him. HOWEVER, the character added a unique flare. Is he good? Is he bad? Just who is this guy? I liked the mystery of Barrons, but would have liked to have learned something significant about him by the end of the story.Okay... some weird turnoffs for me.I'm not into fashion. Here's where my husband had to remind me tastes are subjective. Lots of women are big into the glamor, makeup, clothes, and accessories. The main reason I wear clothing is so others won't be embarrassed. Some days you can catch me gardening in a nightgown or bathrobe. I don't think I've worn eye shadow since my wedding day, and even then it was so light folks probably didn't notice. Mac focused A LOT on fashion. As for me, I could care less what funky name her nail polish had or what shade of pink her hair bow was. Frankly, I got tired of reading about her attire and accessories and found myself skipping over paragraphs of description, given in a laundry-list style, to get to the meat of the story. *Subjective dislike*Then we had the Fae, which is a huge part of the story. Okay, without the Fae, there would be no story. I discovered after reading the Iron King by Julie Kawaga that I wasn't a fan of the Seelie and Unseelie courts. I like my faeries to be like Tinkerbell... not human-sized beings of royalty. This is where the importance of reading blurbs come into play. Still, I'd heard of Ms. Moning and had wanted to read her works for awhile. So the Fae might not have been a big enough discouragement to have avoided this novel. *Subjective dislike*Even before I realized this was a Fae novel, I remember thinking this might not be my read, even as early as page 8. You might wonder why I kept reading, because I had contemplated shelving it. I remembered the slow start of Unearthly and how much I loved that novel once I hit around page 40-60. So many people boasted about the Darkfever series, I pushed onward, thinking it might be a funky start.Well, it wasn't. The writing style wasn't to my preference. It was rather rambly. Before you mention Ramblings of an Amateur Author, keep in mind I'm a hypocrite. I do things I don't always enjoy in others. Rambling-yeah... not so fond of listening to others do it. Told from the first person point of view, Mac loved to ramble. I could almost get over that, except she ruined the story in other ways also.The way this was written was as if Mac was telling me, the reader, what had happened during her adventure in Dublin. I've started books written with sentences like you'd never imagined life would be so tough, but I've never warmed up to the style (*Subjective dislike). Mac took it one step further with foretelling at the end of most scenes and sometimes in the middle, which made an otherwise okay storyline too predictable for words, and frankly, rather anticlimactic.Here's an example by what I mean. I'm all excited about an upcoming fight. I can feel my heart pick up speed in anticipation. Yeah... I get that into books. My eyes are glued to the page. Mac reveals her plan, and I'm like oh yeah! Let's do this thing. I'm tensed, and then she narrates:\\"It could have worked that way, it should have worked that way, but I made one critical error.\\"At that moment, I put the book down and contemplate tearing it in half. Why in the world did she ruin the surprise? If anything ruined the book, it was stuff like that in every single scene. Seriously. I'd be hard pressed to find a scene without that kind of foretelling. What's wrong with slamming a reader with the unexpected when it happens.Story also hopped back and forth between time rather just telling it in a linear fashion. I hated that. I thought a matter was settled and was ready to move on, since we had. Then she popped back to the time directly after two scenes ago and filled in a gap. Why not just fill in the information so the gap was never there to begin with? *More subjective dislikes*Finally, the tense wasn't consistent. Others might not notice or care, for me the switches between past and present tense were jarring. Yeah... I'm all over the place in this post with tense.... but remember... hypocrite here.So Darkfever wasn't for me, and I'm certainly not ragging on it. This novel/series has received a lot of praise, and I'm sure for good reason. If you're into the Fae, fashion, and Southern bell-like heroines, you might really dig this work.I did have a favorite passage. Perhaps it's because I'm as morbid as Mac.\\"Don't accuse me of being morbid when I'm merely the product of a culture that buries the bones of the ones they love in pretty, manicured flower gardens so they can keep them nearby and go talk to them whenever they feel troubled or depressed. That's morbid. Not to mention bizarre. Dogs bury bones, too.\\"One other thing, if you're looking for a story with a finite ending, this isn't it. Darkfever is only the beginning and very open-ended."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Can't recommend anyone start this series. Books are installments, not stand-alone stories and get more depressing and unsatisfactory as it drags out. Two male leads are domineering and abusive, if you're into that, rape theme runs thru first three books (so far) and heroine starts as a weak sort of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (minus campy humor and interesting friends) and gets darker and more pathetic. This book just kind of sets the scene without resolving anything, and isn't much fun. The 'ick' factor increases in subsequent books. Really disappointing for fans of this author."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"After not reading fiction for about 20 years this was recommended to me and reawakened my love of reading so much have been reading ever since. Its the first of a series told over five books so don't expect the answers at the end of each book. Luckily all five are now available so the cliff hangers are easier to bear.The characters develop over the course of each book. You get to see Mac grow from a 22 year old carefree color me pink girl to a saviour of the world vision in black, and although the journey is arduous and life threatening at times its well worth hanging on for the ride of your life.Often found in the romance section this is certainly not your usual romance so don't expect hearts and flowers but does have a romantic thread evolving throughout the series.Looking forward to more books in the Fever WorldBloodfever: The Fever Series (A Mackayla Lane Novel)Faefever: The Fever SeriesDreamfever: The Fever SeriesShadowfever"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have read all 5 of the fever Series and enjoyed every single word on every single page. Enjoyed them so much that I read the Highlander series too.I originally downloaded the book for free on the Kindle and started reading with no preconception...because really how could a FREE book be THAT good. I was more than pleasantly surprised. I loved the contrast of Mac's innocent pink hued view of life smacking against Barrons' hard edged black world. I loved her for her innocence and desire to keep her world full of color even though she was being pushed on all sides by sorrow and grief to make her world dark. Mac 1.0 (as she calls herself) IS overprotected and spoiled, but it is from that point that she is able to grow-up. Mac is forced into an ever more dangerous existence where she has to learn to rely on the one person she fears to trust fully. With each book in the series Mac's world crashes a little more and she is forced to recreate herself in response to the situations around her.These books are a journey thru Hell and back. The reader is just as confused as the characters and that is part of what makes these books terrific. They are an edge of your seat roller coaster ride where new discoveries and dangers are around every corner. Just like Mac's bookstore these books have it all... humor, romance, mystery, fantasy and adventure. It was a terrific adventure that I'm sorry to see end. But one I know I will visit again in the future."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Love this series!

As the first installment of the Fever series it contained all genres of literature in my opinion.

I live in Roswell (GA), so what a trip to see the Mac was from Georgia and to read some down home slang. It always thrills me to find an author who can write some good books, with a heroine who kicks &#34;petunia&#34;, and by luck there are several in a series that I can read and get caught up to and then be miserable like everyone else waiting on the next one to come out. Love it!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I loved this book! What an exciting and mysterious world Ms Moning brings you into with this book! This is not a typical paranormal romance. It is a murder mystery that has paranormal /urban fantasy and okay, a little sexual tension! It is the first in a five book series about MaKayla Lane, a young Southern woman who is enjoying her \\"simple\\" life until her world crashes down with the death of her sister. During her search for answers, she uncovers a world she never knew existed. The more she unravels, the more she gets drawn into this dangerous world- that includes some dangerous men. As she tries to find answers about who to trust and who killed her sister, she also is finding out answers about herself. Typically, I always figure out \\"who did it\\" well before an author spills the beans. Not this story, I didn't have a clue when I finished it as to who did it....Kudos to the author for writing a non-typical story and keeping me on the edge of my seat!...

The heroine of the book is a silly little thing at the beginning, but she grows up fast after her sister is murdered and she travels to Ireland to try to get the police to keep investigating. While there, she discovers that she is one of the few humans who can see faeries, which are actually aliens from another dimension with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men (OK, I'm getting too supermannish here!). She teams up with a mystery man named Jerico who helps her realize her powers and learn about how she can use them to fight the icky critters that betrayed and killed her sister. The romantic tension between her and Jericho is nice, but never comes to fruition, thus saving the book from degenerating into a paranormal romance (shudder, ick, yuck!).

High point of the book--Jericho trying to paint Mac's fingernails after all the action and crazyness towards the end is over.

It's a little slow and sometimes very confusing with all the creatures and rare terms everywhere. Also, it's written in first person, something I usually don't enjoy very much.The main problem I had with the book is the heroine. I couldn't stand her!! She's immature, dumb, irritating, too pink... She really got into my nerves, and I don't buy that she's young and was very sheltered. I'm young too (23), and I couldn't identify with her in anything.At least she matures a little as the story progresses, but I was too annoyed with her to care.The hero, Jericho Barrons, is more interesting, although he is very stereotypical in the sort of dark-sexy-mysterious way. It seemed to me that I'd read him in countless romances, but at least he has potential.The last problem I had is that the book doesn't have an end. It feels more like the first chapters of a story than a book of its own, which is very frustrating. I think it would be better to wait for all the sequels and read them in order, and from paperbacks or the library. That's what I'm probably going to do."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I read Darkfever because I had heard many great things about this series. The latest installment, Shadowfever, which is book 5, was receiving so much attention in many of the book groups/clubs that I participate in. There were people literally counting down the minutes to when their pre-orders kicked in to download. I figured if so many people were on the edge of their seats in anticipation of it, then I had to give it a look-see.So I went out of line in my \\"to be read\\" book list and downloaded the 1st of Karen Marie Moning's Fever series expecting brilliant things. I was not disappointed in the least. As a matter of fact, I became an addict. The world created by Karen was so well developed with mystery and intrigue that I could not wait to get to the next page. And when I wasn't able to read, I was constantly thinking about it, pining for that moment that I'd be able to pick it back up and enter this world again.There was nothing I did not like in this book. The plot was fantastic. MacKayla Lane, a simple bartender who's only real worry is that her favorite color nail polish will be discontinued is thrown into a world that she never could have imagined when she finds out her sister, and in most respects, her best friend is murdered while studying abroad in Ireland. After listening to a message that her sister left her before she died telling her that she had been betrayed and that their lives were not as they seemed, Mac sets out to find her sister's killer. What she finds in Dublin is beyond her wildest dreams. Not only does she encounter monsters that shouldn't even exist, but she also uncovers that she is not who she thought she was.The characters were superbly written. While Mac seemed to be so nave at times, she made up for it with her determination and heart. Best of all, she had my favorite feature, wittiness. I love a great witty character and Mac was sometimes downright, laugh-out-loud funny.The supernatural characters were very well described. I could picture the grotesque monsters that Mac encountered and found myself cringing at the sight. What I did not cringe at was Jericho Barrons. Ahhh, the infamous Mr. Barrons. This has to be my favorite male lead character. He is so mysterious and sexy. Just when you think he is cold as ice and shows no emotion, he lets us see that little sign of HOTNESS. I don't know exactly what it is about this man (or whatever he may be), but he had me at hello. And will probably continue to have me for the rest of the series. Hell, probably after the series is long over. Well, am I right, ladies?I anticipate that this series will be one of my best reads of 2011 and I highly recommend those of you that enjoy urban fantasy/paranormal reads with a bit of sexy steamy to top it all off, to check it out if you haven't already. Me, I'm off to read the next installment, Bloodfever, as soon as I can get my hands on it.Note: I do not recommend this book to younger readers, as there is adult sexual content in it.Have you read the Fever series yet? Tell me what you think. Do the books get better? Which is your favorite? Who's your favorite character?

However, since I loved her Highlanders, there was no way I would miss out on the new series by her. I read the little blurb on the dust jacket of DarkFever and was hooked. I brought the book home and started reading...6 hours later I had finished DarkFever and the long wait for the next book began. I decided that I would have to read it again, because of the many questions I kept asking myself about various parts in the story. Never have I been so caught-up with characters as I seemed to be with Mac and Jericho. On my next read of the book, I kept finding little things that I had missed the first time. I started taking cliff-notes on this book and was eagerly awaiting the next installment. I figure I have read DarkFever and the next 3 books at least 10 times and still find little things that I have missed along the way. Karen has a way of drawing you into the story and then you just can't let it go. I have watched Mac change from a fluffy little southern girl with no real purpose in life, into a person that I envision being someone I would like to know and have a vested interest her story.

I bought this not knowing KMM had said this series wouldn't be the romance series of the Highlanders. It does, however paralell the Highlanders.

Mac's sister has been murdered and she goes to Ireland only to learn there's more to life the pink nail polish, and accessorizing an outfit. If you are expecting romance, look elsewhere, but do give it a chance. I am not disappointed in this book since I now know what the series is supposed to be.

I read it because it was recommended by readers who liked the Outlander Series (by Diana Gabaldon), but this is not in the same ball park as that series. Not even the same sport. I am rarely moved enough to write a review, but I was so under-whelmed by this book I just had to. It is so far-fetched (yes, I know it's fantasy, but really?), has no redeeming characters....even the protagonist is such a \\"pretty\\" nuisance, you will find yourself cheering when she breaks one of her manicured pink nails. And the death-by-sex fae characters are hilarious.

My first impression from reading the back is that this was going to be a great new series for me to pick up. Unfortunately I was wrong.I was annoyed that the main character never grew a back bone. This first book should have defined the character and where the characters personality was going. By the end of the book I was so sick of the main character I just stopped reading. I stopped caring about what happened to her sister or Barron. A person cannot go from small town, never had anything bad happen to them to big city half way across the world surrounded by death and not get over pink ice nail polish that match silver sandals.

I sincerely hope the Chronicles of Mac is a finished project and the next book comes out - in six months or so?Otherwise I won't survive the wait. Nope .... Rather I really wait and when the chronicles are written and finished I dive in and have a binge. Around 2011 or so as one other reader calculated.Other than that I kinda like Legally Blond turned Lara Croft kind of heroine \\"Mac\\" Mac-Kayla and Jericho Barrons really has potential .... the Vlane - death sex Fae Alien - character and his encounters with Mac where shere ridiculous, odd and a sorry excuse for sensuous elements in the book.How will I survive the wait -Does anyone know when the next is out?If it is not soon I am very sorry to have waisted a lot of money on a hardcover - could have waited for the PB before the next HC is out - or maybe dear publisher forget all about the HC releases .... maybe when the series is finished readers like to celebrate and add the HC collection - Now I don't really feel generous for the next installment.The pages have only 31 lines per page - compared with her Spell of a Highlanders 35 lines per page - which also adds to the feeling a little less text for a lot of money."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I am such a fan of Karen Marie Moning.

The heroine is chatty, informative and really, really boring. I get the impression that KMM was trying for something as cute as Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels and as edgy as Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake, but the result is dreadful! To make matters worse, Nothing is resolved, the romantic \\"sparks\\" are almost non-existent, and this book is only a set up for the next one.

Pool lounging & occasional classes by day & bar tending at night have afforded her that luxury. While living at home still, she does have greater aspirations for her life. They may not be as high as those of her currently-studying-in-Ireland sister Alina, but Mac can hold her own. Her sun kissed world is shattered though when the Irish police call to inform Mac & her currently-on-an-extended-vacation parents that Alina has been murdered.At first Mac, like any caring soul, is blinded by grief, though that doesn't last long. When she finally receives a perplexing & mysterious voicemail from her sister the day she died. This settles Mac's mind to travel to Ireland & help the police hunt down Alina's killer. Fortunately while living at home she has been able to save up quite a little nest egg & will make it on her own. Despite the police labeling this a \\"no leads\\" case (meaning they have no evidence, witness, or even a suspect), Mac is determined to see justice brought forth on Alina's behalf. At first Mac spends a lot of time orienting herself, analyzing just how far her money will get her & what she needs to do to accomplish her goal; but weird things keep happening to her. She seems to suffer from double-visions as well as having a knack for getting in trouble with little old Irish ladies. They keep telling her not to give herself away & to have some survival instincts.It's not until she meets Jericho Barrons that she realizes just what she is supposed to be surviving. Barrons reluctantly ushers her into a world of fae, magic, & danger. A long-standing member of this society, Barrons really just wants to use Mac to further his own pursuits & thwart those who in competition with him. When Mac finally relinquishes her death grip on everything she has held to be true. There really are things that go bump in the night... and she has to fight with them to get the justice that Alina deserves.This was a captivating read! I was sold from the very beginning, not just for the characters, but for the writing as well. Karen Moning has a way with words that really allows the reader to develop their own sense of place & purpose. She does not spell every little thing out for you, but she'll give you just enough to allow you to formulate your own understanding. That being said, Mac & Barrons are such demanding characters! Their interactions are much along the same lines of some other great \\"partnerships\\" I could list (Booth & Bones, Mulder & Scully, etc) & really display their personalities in an amusing light.The story itself was equal parts fascinating & frightening. There was enough gaiety to help counterbalance the fae doom & gloom. Rest assured that these are NOT your average fae. They are meaner than many that I have encountered in books recently & that probably has to do with the fact that the cute, helpful fae are few & far between. The \\"worst\\" part is that there is a sexual element to these fae that I haven't really seen addressed even in the adult realm. Think about what happens when you ask a fae for a favor & the consequences that brings & you're along the same lines. Maybe I just haven't read enough. Also, the descriptions of these creatures sent shivers down my spine & really made me feel the same things as the main character. If that's not a resounding endorsement for quality writing, then I don't know what to tell you."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Reviewed at Another Look Book ReviewsI've got to do this review before I start the next book BlOODFEVER. I don't want to confuse the story lines at all.I have two friends that are die hard fans for this \\"Fever\\" series by Moning. I do love a good series and particularly love when a series is well underway. That way I can read the books back to back uninterrupted. So the \\"Fever\\" series is perfect in that respect. I was pretty confident I was going to like all the books so I just went ahead and purchased them all.I have to say that I enjoyed the first book DARKFEVER but I didn't LOVE it. I think that this series must get better and better with each book. I am guessing that once I invest more into the characters I will be obsessed as everyone else. I can feel the pull.Lets talk about the characters for a bit. I really like MacKayla Lane. She kinda reminds me of me. Okay so not the beautiful, blonde, skinny part but more the wanting to paint the world in colours, loving her nails polished and just being a girlie girl. Yet at the same time, stubborn and refusing to believe what is happening to her even though it is right in front of her eyes. She is also brave as she walked into the Dark Zone. Okay, maybe I wouldn't have done that. My heart was breaking for the devastation she felt with her sister's murder. (That's not a spoiler because it happens practically on the first few pages.)Jericho Barrons is a very mysterious character indeed. I can't quite put my finger on him. Yes he is masculine, rich and down right handsome but I can't figure him out. I kinda felt like that author Moning didn't quite know what to do with him yet. There really wasn't a draw to him. *ducks from flying objects from the Barrons lovers* Okay come on! Admit it. You didn't love him first book did you? Really?V'lane - okay there is a character I want to learn more about. Super curious. I can't wait to read more about his role as Prince and his special powers.What was really missing from DARKFEVER for me was a sexual sort of chemistry between MacKayla and Barrons. Aside of admiration for each other's bodies I wouldn't even say there is a friendship there yet. It's like they could barely stand each other yet alone trust each other. However if the author was just doing a stand alone book, that lack of chemistry would have failed miserably for me. BUT (a big BUT here) since this is a series, it turns out to be a genius move by the author Moning because there is potential there and a faithful book reader loves angsty potential in characters. Barrons and Mac have a huge following so I'm all game to dive right into BLOODFEVER book 2.Now let me move away from the characters and focus on the story. That I LOVED. It was beyond interesting and I stayed up until I finished DARKFEVER. I would say that DARKFEVER is an excellent \\"set up\\" book. It was perfect for having the readers commit to this Fae & human world. I loved that Moning didn't just try and jam all of the DARKFEVER history into a few crammed chapters and confuse the heck out of me. I am glad she is taking her time with the character development and the set up of the different artifacts, villains and pending war.So out the gate, I'm going to give DARKFEVER a strong 4 hearts with the anticipation that the other books will jump to the 5 heart rating.

I picked up this book because I've heard a lot of positive buzz around the blogosphere for this series. I wanted to see for myself what all the fuss was about. I'm happy to report back that I really liked this first book. What I like most about it was it was not like I thought it would be. It was a lot darker. The story centers around Mac. Mac travels to Ireland after the brutal murder of her sister. The police have closed the case and Mac travels to the emerald island to change their mind. Mac's love and devotion towards her sister is heart breaking. Mac starts asking questions and seeing things that don't make any sense. Mac learns that she has a special ability to see Fae. As cool as that might sound it's anything but. You see the fairies in this story are nothing like Tinker Bell. The Fairies in this story are cruel and dangerous. However Mac stays on course to find out the truth behind her sisters death. Along the way she meets the tall, dark and mysterious stranger, Jericho Barrons. When Barrons hears her in a public place asking about things she shouldn't be asking about it sets him off. On top of that Barrons finds out that she can see Fae. He plans to use that to his advantage. I love Mac. She's a girly girl who is not afraid to kick a little butt. She is a strong female character but not in the obvious sense. I love her quirky sense of humor and her swear words. I was not so crazy about Jericho Barrons character in the beginning. He is too much of a jerk. However as the story progresses Karen Marie Moning lets us see a more relaxed side of Barrons.Overall I thought this story was great. It was not as I expected but it was more. I love the ancient myths and legends used in Darkfever. It is dark, enigmatic and formidable. I've got the fever! I definitely will continue reading this series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I am so mad at myself for waiting sooo long to start this series. Darkfever was beyond an amazingly thrilling read. I loved the world Moning created, I felt like I was right there besides Mac and Barrons living in their world.This book surprised me, despite all the rave reviews I kept hearing about this series in general I kept putting it off since i'm not really into the whole \\"fae\\" thing. Well that was the case until now.Mac is a favorite of mine. She was your typical girly girl which I did find odd in an urban fantasy read, but her character develops throughout the book and while not completely losing her love for pink or pretty girly clothes she does turn into one bad ass chick. Even when she was depicted as just the girly girl I still found her to be a strong character, and the reason being she had no problems traveling thousands of miles to avenge her sisters killer.There is also Jericho Barrons. I freaking love his character although he is still a complete mystery. Can't wait to get to know more about him as I continue the series.I did enjoy Mac and Barrons interaction with each other, no love at first sight they downright can't stand each other. There really is no romance at all in Darkfever. I'm not even sure if there is going to be a \\"Mac & Barrons,\\" I'm just assuming based off of the sexual tension between the two.Overall one of the best Paranormal Urban Fantasy books I've read."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"My sister highly recommended this author/series to me. When I noticed that the Highlander series came first, I read it first. I thoroughly enjoyed it, although some of its books are SUPER good and some just GOOD. I approached this series cautiously, as I much prefer romance/historical romance to dark paranormal stories. For me, this book was just okay. While understanding Mac's motivation and determination to find justice for her sister, she seemed unduly reckless and impulsive much of the time. I came away with the feeling that blind luck saved her much of the time because she so often showed such poor judgment. That being said, I will read further into the series to see if I come to like it better and if I come to agree with my sister's high recommendation of the series. The first book in the Highlander series was just okay for me, but the rest I really enjoyed, so maybe this series will improve also. I just hope that a romance does develop along the way between Barrons and Mac. I also hope that the author does not abandon her Highlander series. There were some secondary characters in some of those books that I would like to see get a book of their own."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I did not want this book initially. The dark mysterious man is named Jericho Barrons for goodness sake!! It just seemed too cliche, like a dime store romance. But it was free or .99 and I couldn't find anything else so I bought it and I'm glad I did. I loved this book! It just sucked me right in! It really has it all, action, adventure, suspense, and some romance, but the good kind :). I finished it and immediately bought the rest of the series and have enjoyed every one."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"The first half of this book is spent introducing characters and setting up the storyline, so it is a little slow. However, I think that is perfectly normal in the first book of a series. The second half more than makes up for the lack of action in the beginning. I've also read the 2nd book in the series (Bloodfever) and can say that the momentum continues through the second book. So truly, it is only the setup that seems a little slow.I'd never read a paranormal novel that was specifically written about Irish folklore before this one, so I found this book very unique and interesting as a result. It is well written, descriptive, and moves at a very agreeable pace after the story gets going. It was not predictable at all, which makes it even better in my opinion. The author does a great job of only releasing tiny little portions of secrets at a time rather than one big release of info. The readers are not privy to any more info than the main character Mac, which will keep you searching for answers as much as she is.The main characther in the book in MacKayla Lane, predominantly known as Mac throughout the series. Mac lives a relatively normal life until the day her older sister is found murdered in Ireland. Frustrated with the lack of results from the Irish Police in finding her sister's killer, Mac jumps on a plane and heads to Dublin to hunt down the killer herself.Ireland proves to be a place of awakening for Mac. While there, she not only discovers that her sister was much different from the person she knew, but she also discovers that she has a rare ability to see both the human and Fae worlds. Having this vision makes her a sidhe-seer, and also makes her a target for those in the Fae world who wish to secretly infiltrate the human world.While searching for the killer, Mac meets the mysterious owner of Barron's Books and Baubles named Jericho Barrons. Mac quickly develops a love-hate relationship with Barrons because she is both drawn to his strength and frustrated by his secretive nature. She doesn't know who she can trust in this strange land, but eventually connects herself to Barrons only because he can provide her with a safe place to live and because he knows more about her plight than she could discover on her own.Barrons provides Mac with protection In trade for her sidhe-seer services and ability to sense Fae artifacts. He has his own motives of course, but despite the distrust between them, Mac and Barrons work together.I really don't have any significant criticisms about this book. If I were to get nit-picky, I could really only come up with one. The main character Mac is a bartender from a small town who cares very little for school and has only a few classes at a community college under her belt. However, she uses vocabulary words like plebian, erudite, raison d'etre, anachronistic, sepulchre and genuflecting..... It was just a tiny bit hard to believe that this particular character would use words like this based on her personal history. I have friends with post-grad degrees from Ivy league colleges who don't use words like this in normal conversation.With that said, I'm enjoying these vocab additions now after reading 2 of Karen Marie Moning's books. I like that the author is not dumbing-down her own vocabulary in her writing. It's almost like a scattering of little mental challenges for the reader, keeping us on our toes. Every time I come across a new word that is unexpected, it now makes me smile. There was one word in the 2nd book (I'm not admitting to which one) that I had to look up in the dictionary. How clever Ms. Moning, thanks for the lesson.I haven't quite figured out where the title of this series comes from. I don't believe I've seen the word fever used in either of the books I've read, except for the titles of course. I find that interesting and wonder if that is a mystery that will be explained further in later booksRecommended for fans of Paranormal Fiction/Romance. There is not a clear romance yet, but the stage has been set for a potential relationship between Mac and Barrons."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This first book in the Fever series is a bit action-intense, with a lot of basic information the reader needs to really grasp the world created by Moning. Rather than really try to sort it out, I just kept reading, hoping that sooner or later I'd get the main idea behind the \\"Fae\\" world and who was good and bad. That might have been too simple of an approach, seeing as most of the characters could have been good and bad for all we knew. It's that limbo as readers that left me nervous for McKayla throughout much of the book. Jericho Barrons, the guy who takes her in, is described as some type of massive male Adonis, built to protect and defend, brooding and sulking in a very manly fashion. The thing is, in this first installment, there is little you feel you know about him, and therefore never feel certain whether he is there to help McKayla or not.McKayla is a quick character to get a grasp on, but I often felt like she was in so much danger from the start, that I didn't really have a chance to like her or not. Okay, so she's our main character and I don't want to see her die at the hands of some shadow-like creature or crazy demon, but other than that, I don't know that I get her yet. Jericho is just the brooding male figure in the story so far, and the other peripheral characters all blend in the background of what is a fast-moving story.My thought is that this first book must be meant to give the reader a good understanding of the Fae world that Moning has set up. This isn't a book I'd skip to move on to later installments, as I'm already part way into the second book and can see how lost you'd be without the first. The action is crazy at times, scary at times, and even a little sad at times, but really all intriguing. I'm one to usually get annoyed or bored with drawn out fight scenes or Paranormals galore, but these books have me intrigued and I'm going to keep reading them. They definitely have their own unique premise on the Paranormal world!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I like this author, so I picked up this book to read without reading any reviews. I wish I had not done that....First off, this is a series book. And one problem with series books is that they abruptly end and leave you hanging for months (or years, or even forever in the case of a book I read a long time ago that the author never got back to.) This book REALLY leaves you hanging. Generally, with these books, I wait till ALL the books are out before starting. That way I know the author actually finished them and I don't have a repeat of the event mentioned above. Second, it is really hard to get back into a story after months and years without the characters in your mind.For those of you expecting a romance, there is one blooming, but it is subtle and it probably will come out later, but it isn't here now. For those who like a good paranormal story, it is good, just not fully developed because of the series thing. I hope the next book is good, but to be honest, if the characters are not with me at the time of release, I may not buy it. And I will never buy another book by this author without checking reviews first. Thanks everyone else for your postings. I appreciate all of you taking the time. It really helps."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I don't know what book the other reviewers read--obviously notDarkfever. The book I read was the first in what promises to be oneof the most incredible paranormal series out there. Mac is in no wayimmature. Does she like pink? Yes. Does she like fashion? Yes. Doesthis make a woman immature? No. Mac is a typical 22 year old womanthat has never suffered any tragedy in her life. All that changes whenher sister dies, and so does Mac. I LOVED her character and found hermature beyond her years. She's a go-getter, determined to solve hersister's murder, and willing to walk straight into hell to do it.Immature would have been jumping some guys bones in the middle of herproblems like a tstl romance heroine. Moning crafts a fascinatingyoung woman who will no doubt over the course of the series, grow intoan even more fascinating, kick-butt heroine.As far as leaving us hanging? Duh. It's part of a series. Why would anauthor that's writing a series wrap everything up in the first book?It sounds to me like a lot of people are pissed off because theywanted to read more. That hardly makes a book bad. In my opinion, itmakes a book awesome! When I got to the end, if I'd had the next 4books, I wouldn't have stopped reading until the last word, and itsounds like most of the negative reviewers would have too. Get overit! Authors don't have to keep writing the same thing over and over.They have the right to move into a new direction and I think Moninghas done it brilliantly. I LOVED this BOOK and can't wait forBloodfever in August!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"MacKayla Lane's life is turned upside down when her sister, a student sutdying abroad, is murdered. Unsatisfied with the outcome of the police investigation she goes to Dublin, Ireland to try and get answers.Ok, I can see the majority of the reviewers love this book. To each his own. Overall I thought the book had a lot of potential, but was lost in the muddle of the childish, annoying, shallow lead female character MacKayla (Mac) Lane. Sorry, but this girl came off as a bubble-headed idiot. Much of this book is devoted to Mac's internal dialogue that was overwhelmingly confined to her apperance (wardrobe/hair/nails). I was inundated with multiple references to her \\"pretty blond hair\\", her \\"pretty pink nails\\", and her \\"pretty pink clothes\\". Her entire being seemed to revolve around her being pretty. And, this book (and I suspect the entire series) would have been better told from more than just Mac's point of view.The male lead character, Jerico Barrons, may well be very interesting, but other than his interactions with Mac I have very little sense of him as a strong character. Another reason this story would have been better served being told from more than one point of view.In 304 pages I was given very little actual story. To be specific the story advanced very little from page 1 to page 304. A good portion of the book was repeated dialogue from Mac that had been established earlier in the story. Pages 1-16 and 268-304 pretty much tell the story.I believe this is a five book series. However, in this first installment not one of the important questions raised through out the book was answered. I have read other series' with on-going storylines and this is the first where the author declined to give closure to even one plot point in the very first book. What exactly would be my motivation for purchasing the second book?The book could have been so much better with very little effort."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I love this new fae world.

There are passages that just make me pause and think of how well it explains some things in my life. So very beautiful. Now, here I just finished re-reading the first book in the Fever series. How well she develops an immature, protected Makayla into a more rounded person through trauma and having to face heavy, horrible responsibilities. How well she brings a world weary, sophisticated Barrons around and how he works with \\"Mac\\" without taking advantage of her youth, because it is very apparent, though there is a gross age difference between the two, they are made for each other. Once she grows up some. Look for the slow passages around the adventure scenes, there are gems there. And you gotta love the wordless conversations the two have. It would be easy to pass off the plot devices as just implausible gibberish, but Ms. Moning makes it way more than that and more human as well."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"You MUST READ THIS BOOK!!!!

She dropped her cell phone in the pool earlier in the week which leads to the house phone ringing from Ireland to inform her that her sister, Alina, was found murdered. Their parents were away on a cruise so Mac was left to identify her body once it arrived in Georgia where the Lane's live.Distraut with grief, seeking answers MacKayla decides to go to Ireland and figure out what the police can't seem to do. What happened to Alina?Mac's first night there she rents a room, goes to a pub for dinner and sees a fae. She doesn't realize what it was and nearly gave herself away by staring at it when an old lady starts knocking her in her head telling her to stop staring and go somewhere else and die.Mac does some investigating the next day at Alina's campus, gets lost in Dublin, and strays into a bookstore, the best bookstore she's ever been in, to call a cab. Before going in she swears she's seen the shadows move. The bookstore is called Barrons Books and Baubles. The owner is a dark, sexy man named Jericho Barrons.Through the rest of the book Mac discovers that she is a sidhe-seer; she can see and sense the fae and fae objects. Barrons takes her under his care, lets her move into the bookstore, trains her to use her senses while using her as an OOP (Object of Power). The steal the Spear from a mobster. She meets a Seelie death-by-sex Fae Prince named V'lane, who wants Mac to work with him to find the BOOK! The book is the object of the entire book. Everyone wants it.

I am keeping my fingers crossed that this will get better or that I will at lest have some closure and Mac is severed from this series forever."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book was just great. I read it in almost one sitting! Some of the best writing and story line I've read in a long time. The main characters are very interesting. The heroine, Mac (or Ms. Lane as Barrons calls her) is a joy - seemingly frivolous at times but then incredibly brave when needed and ALWAYS highly intelligent. (Very refreshing). I love that Barrons is so frustratingly mysterious and aloof (well, most of the time). The chemistry is great - only hints now and then, but very special - Karen Marie Moning's writing here is carefully balanced - doesn't reveal too much, but just enough to tempt you and make you wonder (really fun to read). The villians are extremely nasty/evil/ect., but still very very interesting. The paranormal descriptions and action are wonderful. This book is a true keeper. Highly recommended. Can't wait for the next installment!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I can't decide if I liked this book or not. Part of me felt like it was a let down because unlike any other series I've read (and there have been many) the conflict doesn't get resolved at the end of book one. The story is going, it's starting to heat up and BAM \\"This is the end of book one.\\"What. the. hell.Mac as a character is slightly annoying as well, I think that's in part because I'm comparing her to other female characters and they are all strong women already into Scottish history. This character is different from all of them, not only is she not immersed in this world in any way, but she's a lot girlier than past characters too. Which don't get me wrong, girly is fine, but when I'm trying to read about Faes and magic and sidhe-seers...I don't want to be interrupted so the main character can repaint her fingernails.The fact that there's no romance in the first book didn't exactly have me at hello either. I am interested in V'Lane and Jericho Barrons...I wouldn't recommend buying this book until more of the series comes out, because it was a let down the way that the first book just ended abruptly."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book is clearly part of a multi-part story. It leaves you hanging - if you get to the end. It reads like Valley girl meets super stud but without any sex or pasion.

The author and publisher are clearly into ripping off readers with this one."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Good book by good author.

I have read all four books so far and all of them have come up short. I have bought each one in hopes that she will stop stringing us along. Only to be dissapointed over and over again. I wanted to love these books. She has a great Idea and she has memorable characters. She is a good writer. But, These books did not need to be five books long. You keep reading in hopes that she will answer your questions but you finish each book with no answers, only more questions. Its obvious the author and the publishers are stringing us along purposly to make more money. which is even more obvious with the release of a soundtrack. Why would a book need a sound-track other than to make more money? And what happend to pages 279 to 310? Really? Who does that? Chapter twenty ends and jumps to the end of chapter twentythree. I have literally read hundreds of books and never have I seen this happen. What happend? were we actually going to get the answers that we have been waiting for since book ONE and they realized that if they gave us the answers now we wouldn't bother with book five? I cant help but feel taken advantage of. I will not be buying book five. I have wasted enough money on this series already."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"After blessing the fates for finding Moning's Highlander Series, I avoided reading this series b/c of the 31/2 star rating-- I didn't want to be disappointed in an author I've learned to love.After reading the first two books (I got them simultaneously after reading other frustrated readers' reviews at the cliffhangers or inaction or growth of characters and relationships), I must be honest and say that, as of yet, this series doesn't hold a candle to the Highlander Series. But what the reader should take into consideration is that fact that each Highlander book was pretty much the beginning and conclusion to the assigned heroine and hero; this Fever Series (which I'm hearing is supposed to be five books) features the same heroine throughout the entire thing. So you have to read the books like episodes; and expect cliffhangers.While eloquently written in typical Moning fashion; I did, however, find myself skipping throughout extra, in-depth details throughout both books. While she obviously thoroughly researched for this book, which I appreciated, it was a bit much in sections.I warn all Moning fans NOT to listen to the audio of these books first. I made the sad attempt; and was horrified to hear the 22 yr old heroine sounding like a 60 yr. old southern grandma (almost the equivalence of the \\"Oracle\\" from the \\"Matrix\\"). But the absolute worst was the male character. Personally I find it quite difficult to imagine a sexy male character/hero when the vocalist made him sound like Bilbo Baggins. I got to disc 3, and couldn't listen anymore. It says something about how much I respect this author that I even picked up the books after listening to the horrific audio.I have faith in Moning, however, that this series as whole will probably be great; but I agree with other readers that maybe I should've waited until the entire series was finished before starting it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I've been eyeing this book for quite some time..not willing to buy it at the hardcover price and when it went to paperback I still felt it wasn't worth investing the time. Time is a precious commodity for me. Being on a long flight is what did it for me. Let me start with the positives: I like the 1st person aspect of the book. I like getting in the head of the heroine a bit more. That's one of my nits with romance books that the women seem so shallow. Here Mac seems like a full bodied character with tons of personality. She does a good job with fleshing her out. I was ok going along with the story..I'm a sci/fi/fantasy fan which is what drew me to the book. Negatives: too many loose ends, mysteries not yet revealed but hinted at. I don't mid the mysteries but it really seems drawn out for sake of getting the reader primed for the second book. Maybe I just don't feeling duped into buying the second book to see how it plays out. I would have like some sort of conclusion. I didn't get it so two stars."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Why hurry to the romance? When I'm reading books, I enjoy the leading up to the good stuff. Usualy, if the two main characters fall in love early in the book, it gets boring with the same lovey-dovey stuff going on every page. I'd rather read a whole book that has no romance and then read the next with more of it and then the ones after that with even more romance than before. Building up the romance in 5 books is way better than summing it all up in one book. I like to go back and read my books over. With this series, I can read all 5 books and not get bored with the same level of romance going on through all 5. Plus, I read the sneak peek to the next book, and it seemed pretty exciting. You can read it on Karen Moning's website on the latest newsletter. Anyway, if you don't like to read a lot, then one book that speeds up the romance might be enough for you. But for us possessed readers, we love the suspense, gives us more pages to read. Karen probably doesn't want to spoil the story with a quick romance. Give her a chance, she's going to make it hot, she always does. ;)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Ok, like everyone else, i was a bit skeptical about Dark Fever, because she said point blank that it wasnt like her other books,which i loved loved loved. However, i found the book wonderful, true there is no romance, or sex, but i was so completely drawn in to Dublin, and the things that Mac was experiencing. I know this book cant really be called a romance, in comparison to her other books, but i dont see how other readers didnt enjoy it. I found the book to be well written, mesmerizing and i was completely sucked in.Like the other reviewer said \\"Its not a romance novel YET\\" I personally think that when Jericho and Mac get together its going to be hot, and i will be patiently waiting for that to happen.

I mean, I mark my calendars with her book release dates, just to be first in line when they come out. I buy her books in hardcover, because I can't wait on paperback release. But this latest book, Darkfever, has left me very disappointed. I was assuming this would be a romance. It was NOT. The story wasn't bad (I could have done without the first person point of view). But I am a romance novel collector and reader. Once I made it through 3/4 of the book, I finally had to accept that romance just wasn't happening. I was so let down, it felt as if a good friend had played a nasty trick on me. Again, the story seems to be a great paranormal mystery or thriller, I'll just have to pass on the remainder of the series(I must have my romance fix).

After that i knew i had to read all her work. She is one of the few writers that makes romance worth reading because she writes in a way that draws the reader in with researched details and true humor. i have read all her previous work so i was highly anticipating this book. i knew it was going to be a series however there are ways to write series and yet have a solid closing. Her previous books were sort of like series yet they stood alone. The first person narrative style also made it shallow. It is hard to project series of connected events from one person view. The depth and richness of delving into the mind Barron, Lord Master, the sex Fae and etc that are critical to grounding the reader, were missing. This caused some readers to feel annoyance instead of appreciation for the MAC's mind. In addition, the book could have definatly been longer if the story is going to take five series. Can you imagine the diappointment i felt when i realize i that milking and savoring this book for days will not be possible because it is so short? On the positive, it provides more details about the Fae world that any KMM fan would enjoy and the characters are more realistic. Mac is like any 22 year old girl from the south,plus the two main characters didn't just fall in love and start humping on site. They are going through the process of building a rapport that would be expected in reality. This i think is the true romance of this series. Can you imagine when they will finally kiss? Please KMM if you are gonna pull a cliffhanger stunt at least shorten the time between the series to like 5 or 6 months.

I don't usually leave reviews but I just had to let others know how bad this was!!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I picked up Darkfever not knowing anything about it specifically, but because I have read several books by this author and loved them. Be warned, this book is not in the same genre as her previous books. She builds on the Fae theme, but this book is not an historical romance with great characters, an interesting story and laced with humor. It is a dark book full of evil characters and a story that isn't so great. I didn't connect with any of the main characters (Mac irritated me) and was shocked to find a book filled with vampires, monsters and violence. I don't read those kind of books for a reason, I don't like them and I certainly didn't like this one."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I just loved Karen's Time travel series, but when I started to read her new series, I was VERY disapointed!She is such a good writer, but her new series is, well, not good....I wish she would return to the writing she does best..."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I'm actually kind of fascinated over how in the world any author could have found a character like \\"Mac\\" fascinating enough to write about. I was too annoyed with her to be fascinated. One more mention of a pastel color, or the word \\"petunia,\\" and I would have thrown up. Seriously.Jericho didn't fare any better in my estimation. Another extremely annoying character. I felt nothing for either of these people and don't wish to continue their story in the hope that I might someday understand why the author was fascinated with them.Sorry, Karen....love your other stuff...and this one could have been fascinating. Parts of it were interesting and had potential for me. I just hated your characters."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I'm really not sure how to review this book. I wish I had read the reviews here before purchasing it. First of all, this is hands down, no kidding, not ambiguous at all, NOT A ROMANCE NOVEL!!!! It may develop into a romance series, but it has NO ROMANCE WHATSOEVER in it as yet. Okay, I take that back, the heroine gets chills once when the ostensible hero puts his arm around her - and she maybe once wonders what it would be like to kiss him. There's also a sexy fairy who makes women want him so bad they strip off their clothes immediately and start panting. That actually had some potential, despite how lame it sounds. But seriously, aside from that, nothing. And really, I don't just mean there was no sex in the novel - I do mean, there was no romance at all. The relationship that builds between the hero and heroine is not a romantic one. It's interesting, but it is not (yet, at least) romantic.I am REALLY REALLY ANGRY with the publishing company for marketing this as a romance. SHAME ON THEM, the should have known better.Aside from that, however, it actually is a decent book - despite my still livid anger from being TRICKED into buying this book by a soulless corporation who probably doesn't give a rat's behind that I'm in graduate school and only had enough time to read one \\"pleasure\\" book before finals and reasearch and papers consumed my life for the next several months and instead of the romance novel I was hoping for, I got this. But despite all that, hey, she's Karen Moning - she's a great author.So, if you're looking for a good paranormal, go for it. If you're looking for romance, skip it. Or maybe just wait till the next one in the series comes out and then read them together (if the series is actually going to go in the romance direction)."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I just finished the last page and I loved it. I hate buying hardcovers (can't fit them in a purse), but I know I'm going to get Bloodfever as soon as it comes out. It felt like this book was a mix between a \\"normal\\" Moning story and one of Charlaine Harris' Sookie books. Full of suspense, a little desire (wanted or not), and good inner dialogue from the main character. Definitely a page turner."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I loved this book. I thought it was a follow up to the other highlander books, but it is a different storyline, but along the same path. Well worth the money!!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I'm a big fan of Moning's books. I love her stories and characters and often re-read her books. That said, when I first saw the synopsis of this book last year I refused to read it. I didn't want to read a book in an ongoing series where there is no happily ever after at the end of the first book. I definitely didn't want to read a romance written in first person narrative. I've read other romances set in first person narrative and found them less than enjoyable.After nearly a year I finally decided to read \\"Darkfever\\" and approached it like I'd never read a romance or any of Moning's previous work (and didn't see the cover art which has nothing to do with the story). I admit that against my will I like the book and will continue to read the series.Other fans have commented that Mac is immature. Yes she is. She has five books to grow through. If she started out as an \\"alpha\\" heroine, she'd have no character arc and no development. She needs to start out in a place we're not used to. Sometimes our heroines too easily accept the crazy situations they are placed in. As unhappy as we might be to admit it, Mac is much closer to the truth in how an average young woman her age would act. Mac's character provides drama because she is absolutely unaware of the danger. Even as fans, we are unable to anticipate all the new dangers that are introduced.In addition to being a fan of Moning's books, I'm also a \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" fan and I enjoyed the movie \\"Legally Blonde.\\" There is something immensely satisfying about a tiny, blonde girl (who is perceived by others as shallow and not too smart) kicking some serious butt. There is humor in contrasting two sides of these types of characters: the seemingly superficial, ultra fashion conscious and the smart, intuitive fighter. If you like Buffy or Elle, you'll enjoy reading about Mac.Take a chance on this book. It's worth it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I'm not going to write a book review I'm only going to write what I thought of it. I read the entire series. Once I got started I didn't want to put it down. The story is a little out of the ordinary which is refreshing to find. Moning has a great imagination and her writing flows seamlessly. There are some sexual scenes in the later books but the story is not based on sex, that can sometimes become repetitious. Her characters are well developed, the story does not leave you hanging as long as plan on reading all five. I would recommend this to anyone that likes mystery and fantasy. I will probably read this again someday."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"If you haven't caught the fever yet you need to get over to Barrons Books and Baubles and get busy! There are five books in this series... Darkfever, Bloodfever, Faefever, Dreamfever and Shadowfever. I plowed through all of these books in a week and could not put them down. Very creative characters and lots of room for growth with this story. I do hope Karen Moning continues to build on this story line because you are definitely left wondering what the heck is going to happen now??!! I like this series mostly because the romance does take a back seat to the action. There is romance but it occurs at its rightful time and place. The build up to the eventual coming together of Mac and Jericho was great. Fantastic series and highly recommend! And if you don't like the series then you can just &#34;kiss my petunia&#34;... :)(less)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I love Ms Moning's Highlander Series. This is very different. It's not a typical romance where you know all will work out in the end. Some would say that makes it more realistic. The characters have real problems, doubts, and insecurities. I think it makes them more relatable. If you are looking for happy endings I would read no further but if you want a book that will immerse you in the nitty gritty this series is for you."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Well.. the book could have more potential. I enjoy a good Fae story as the next fantasy lover but it had traits of other books that didn't rub me well. First, Mac was the twin of Sookie Stackhouse from the Charlene Harris cult. I really had a hard time relating to her in all her girly-ness. Second, Jericho Barren needs to stop calling her \\"Ms. Lane\\" in every sentence he says. Third, it bugged me when some of the Unseelie Fae were given stupid names like \\"Rhino-boys\\" It's something right out of the Yasmine Galenorn D'Artigo Sister series which were cheesy as hell. If these beings are so ancient, why can't they have a name I probably won't be able to pronounce like the other Fea creatures of higher rank? I'll probably order the next book in the series just out of curiosity's sake."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I liked the individual book but I found that it was a little hard to get into. I also thought the series puttered out and lost my interest around the third book."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book series continues to surprise. This series is on of the best. I love the writing style of Karen Mining from the highland series to this one."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I can not believe it took me this long to start this series! I had heard good things about it but kept putting it on the back burner. I absolutely LOVE the way KMM tells a story! It's nice to see a character like Mac grow and even though she fights it sometimes you can really tell she is not going to turn her back on humanity. Every damn time Barrons or V'lane show up my breath catches... Damn KMM don't I have enough imaginary boyfriends on my plate? Why did you have to make em so delicious? I have been hopelessly drawn into her world and, like Mac, don't think leaving is an option (not that I would WANT to with characters like V'lane and Barrons running around...) I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I decided to take the plunge and begin reading the hyped Fever series. After finishing the first installment, there's no turning back for me! I anticipate devouring this series rather quickly. There's a lot of character development and world building in this novel, which is to be expected from the first book of a series. Darkfever opened up a whole new universe for me and I can only see the story getting better from here!Mac's story starts out as a life of entitlement. I had my doubts about her as the main character from the get-go. She's your typical airhead blonde who's main concern is choosing what shade of pink to wear on any given day. That soon changes though as she's bombarded with one life shattering revelation after another. Her whole world is turned upside down. At first, she digs in her heels and resists her new reality but eventually comes to the realization that there's no going back. Mac changes and grows by leaps and bounds in this novel and it's only the beginning. I have a feeling she'll continue to evolve throughout this series. I also got a kick out of the contrasts between her rainbow persona and the dark world she finds herself in.Karen Marie Moning has a real talent for world building! Countless Fae types, terminology and lore are covered without being overpowering. I read this book in one day, but for slower readers there's a handy glossary in case you get lost. The author also stays true to existing Irish folklore so if you're already knowledgeable on the subject the learning curve is lessened immensely. I enjoyed rediscovering Fae that I was already familiar with.Barrons is Mac's unwilling ally and a fascinating character. They both try to avoid each other like the plague at first but finally realize that they need each other and are partners for the long haul. Jericho is opinionated, mysterious and all man. He had me drooling for most of the story, definitely a good sign! After finishing this book, I still haven't entirely figured him out. I'm looking forward to learning more in the next installment. Barrons fluctuates between being the good guy and the bad guy. The jury is still out on the final verdict.There's not much romance or steamy goodness to be had in Darkfever but I'm betting that will change in the next books. The death-by-sex-faes are a good indication of that! From the brief encounters Mac has with Vlane, I gather there's to be some mind-blowing carnal action further in this series. One can only hope!I was pleasantly surprised by this novel. I wasn't expecting something so detailed yet easy to grasp. The author's choice of a 22 year old blonde as the main character left me feeling apprehensive at first but Mac quickly won me over. This book is not only a great story but is also a fun walk through Irish lore, which I've always been fascinated by. I'm regretting postponing reading the Fever series until now. I will not be making the same mistake with Bloodfever! I'm already missing Barrons!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have read the entire series and it was awesome. I was given the first book by a friend it was not what I usually read but it was great. If you read this series you will love it. It keeps you guessing through out the books. After I finished the first book I could not wait to read the next. All the characters in the books are great and there are many of them. I hope you enjoy the series. I do not know how Karen Marie Moning kept up with all the characters but she did a great job writing these books. I hope you enjoy them. Happy Reading"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I read this first book and have been stuck on the series ever since. New and refreshing storyline. Nicely written. Really pulls you into the world Moning created."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I really really liked this whole series. They are quick reads in that you have to finish them and finish them fast! Ms. Moning has introduced a world within a world and one that humans know nothing about. Makayla or Mac as she goes by has led a pretty simple life in a small town in Georgia. Her older sister goes to Dublin to study. While there she is horribly murdered. Mac goes to Dublin to find out answers as to who killed her sister and why. Weird things start happening pretty quickly. She meets a man named Jericho Barron who is very arrogant and definitely knows what is going on. Love interest for Mac? Most definitely. A man that will drive her nuts- also most definitely. But there is lots more going on in this book then a paranormal romance. There is mystery and intrigue and of course lots of things that go bump in the night-literally. I was really glad that I didn't have to wait for the next books as that would have been just too hard. That is how good the books are. Definitely need to read them in order because they are not stand alone books."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I just finished This book, and I am excited to read the rest of the series.

Mac is bound and determined to find the murderer, since the police have closed the case.She flys to Ireland, where all the fun begins. This book is a nonstop mystery, from the events that took place, to the characters involved. You are on a journey right along with our heroine, trying to put all the clues together, not knowing who is her ally, and who isn't. I absolutley loved the unfolding and events in this story, full of supernatural beings, and fae folklore. Found it to be one of those, \\"I have to finish this book, regardless of the hour of night' books.I am so glad that I started this book, with 5 already being published in the series, because the book doesn't actually end with this one.

I finished the first book yesterday and can't wait to start the 2nd!! It was very well written, flowed nicely, exciting and intriguing.....and I loved the 2 main characters! Definitely recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"First off, I absolutely adore this series. Barrons (our main man) is dark and dangerous but has a sexual pull thats hard to resist as you read on. Though there are a lot of cliff hangers, they are worth the wait, trust me. If your just starting the series, I have a bit of advice, start with the Highlander series. Each of the highlander books goes over a different couple, but most of them come back in the fever series for a bit to lend a hand so it means more if you actually get their family references. Currently, Karen is working on her Dani series, Iced just came out on Oct. 30, 2012 and is about Mac's (main character of the fever series) \\"sidekick\\". A term used loosely since Dani is 14 and refers to herself as a superhero all the time. (back to fever series talk) The sexual tention between Mac and Barrons is high but no sex between any of the main characters occurs until a good number of books into the series (won't say which one, can't ruin the suprise ;)) all in all, a fantastic read that has Drama, Mystery, Suspence, Violence, Action, and of course, Romance (though not the run of the mill guy gives girl chocolate kind). The nifty thing about Mac is that yes, she does start of as a small town girl that cares way to much about her looks, but as the books advance, so does she. As the books progress, she refers to herself as \\"mac 1.0\\" and so on as she recognises the changes in herself. Pretty in pink could easily get her killed but she has to keep in touch with what makes her Mac if she wants to find her sisters killer and keep her sanity in tact. Catch the fever and you won't be sorry, this is by far my favorite series of all time."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I needed something different, with a little paranormal twist. picked this series off a goodreads list and read through the whole series in a week!

I'm liking \\"Mac\\" (Makayla) a whole lot more as she transgresses from the annoying southern pink princess into a deeper & richer character (enough already with the nail polish!) Though the books are found in the Romance section, they could easily be found in the Adult Fantasy genre. I'm a true fantasy buff, so these books greatly appealed to me. Karen Moning does a wonderful job delving into Fae Lore.

I never really thought about reading a series that is about Faes. This book was suggested to me and I decided to buy it just to try it out. After the first chapter I was hooked.

I read this book in a couple of days, and couldn't wait to start the next one, \\"Bloodfever\\" (which also proved to be a one-day read) -- I'm eagerly awaiting the third book in this series!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"So, if by some happenstance you are not aware that this book isn't really a romance, let me enlighten you. It's marketed as a romance and the author normally writes romance--but just because it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck does not mean it is a duck. Having said that, I can now talk about what an awesomely entertaining piece of fantasy this was.The Plot:Mac travels to Ireland in search of her dead sister's killer. She starts to see some very bizarre and unexplainable things. On her quest she stumbled across Jericho Barrons, wealthy and very unlikely ally, who explains to her that what she is seeing are the Fae--some sort of alien? alternate dimension?--group of magical beings that have recently begun to spill from their own world into the human world. Mac starts to believe that the Fae had a hand in her sisters untimely death, and wonders if she is next.What Was Good About It:If we view this as a fantasy, we have to admit that style-wise it's pretty typical. Girl who's lived normal life encounters not normal things--right. But Moning does it with a certain grace and humor that keeps it from getting overly predictable. The use of mythology is intensely interesting. In addition, I found Mac to be not only likable but easy to relate to--if at times somewhat irritating.It Lost a Star Because:There is a lot of exposition in this book, typical of any first in a series. It can get a bit dull--although in my opinion the dull points were blessedly brief.I have mixed feelings about the first person telling of the story. In a lot of ways it works for this particular story because you can get right into Mac's head. But overall I file it as a negative because it can be maddeningly frustrating and contributes to the aforementioned dullness.And yes, one does need to be aware that this is one of the least romantic books you'll see on the romance shelf. But in the end, it is a wonderfully entertaining and fun read, obviously setting up for an epic adventure of a series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"There's been a constant flood of paranormal books in the market that it is sometimes a struggle navigating your way around hoping you don't end up with a disappointment. It was while rummaging through the shelves of Barnes and Noble that I saw the first two books in Karen Marie Moning's Fever series. I thought I might as well get acquainted with this author. It turned out to be a good decision, indeed. The prologue itself was a sign of the excitement and suspense to come. The main character, MacKayla Lane, gives us a brief background on the Fae and how she ended up knee-deep in supernatural terror. She narrates back to the day when her perfect rainbow world comes crumbling down after receiving a shocking phone call from the Irish Garda: her beloved sister is savagely murdered. With no leads for the police to investigate, it seems that Alina Lane is simply another girl who meets her untimely death in a foreign land. But when MacKayla hears Alina's last message on her phone, Mac knows that the answer to solving her sister's death lies across the seas. It is with sheer determination and limited funds that Mac finds herself in Ireland realizing that she is in way over her head.Barely having acquainted herself to the Emerald Isle, Mac sees something freaky at the local pub in which a guy appears too beautiful to be human, or perhaps he isn't at all? She is then accosted by an old lady who thinks she's from the O'Connor clan and who tells her to either honor her bloodline or go die somewhere else. Then an innocent question about the elusive Sinsar Dubh ends up with her being under the protection of the enigmatic Jericho Barrons. Or is she really? Could her mysterious host and alleged protector have more to do with her sister's death? And what's the deal with V'lane, alpha Fae to the max? Beware of Fae bearing gifts for this prince gives new meaning to the words death-by-sex.Reading the story from MacKayla's point of view allows us to delve deeper into her mind and feel her fears and bewilderment. We follow the voyage of this fun-loving Southern Belle who will leave her colorful world behind - yes, she adores pink - for a world of inexplicable madness where one book rules them all and whoever gets their hands on it holds the fate of both human and Fae. Freaky...DARKFEVER is not your usual vampire or werewolf-filled urban fantasy, filled instead with Faery creatures that you can gorge on. Indeed, there are so many of those otherworldly creatures to feast on that, upon reaching the last pages, I knew for certain that the fever will persist as the saga of MacKayla Lane continues inBloodfever."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Karen Marie Moning has outdone herself with this series. Once I started Darkfever, I couldn't put it down. It has all the elements a reader enjoys such as humor, intrigue, a hint at romance, and of course the dark mysteries that make you want more. I can't wait to start BloodFever. The only hold back on this series is having to wait until the other book comes out."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I read this entire series and the only bad thing about it was that it ended.

I didn't think much when I came across it but I picked it up and quickly devoured this book, luckily all books were published and was able to read them one after the next. It's such a beautiful story with the awesome, lovable Mac and the dark and steamy Barrons. If you love Romance, adventures, paranormal, fantasy pick it up now and have all the books ready because you'll want them on hand when you finish each one. I can not wait to read them all over again."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Now I finally realized Karen Marie Moning is on the New York Times Bestseller List! She is one of those authors that just blow you away with their writing that you come back hungry for more and more. I have to say that this was my very first Adult Urban Fantasy Series and my all-time favorite. Karen throws us in a world of that I would love to explore to the fullest. Mackayla Lane has just lost her sister in Dublin. She flies to Dublin, Ireland to investigate her sisters murder, but the police has dropped her sister's case. When she arrives she finds out that everything is not as it seems and her world will change forever.Darkfever centers on fae, but not those sweet innocent fae like Tinkerbell, but fae to their darkest, even more darker than you can possibly imagine. The last message from Mackayla's sister was about the Sinsar-Dubh and how Mackalya must find it at all costs, that is when she encounters Jerricho Barrons, he is a total ass, but one of those bad-ass guys you just want all to yourself. Barrons helps Mackayla on her quest in his own way.At first it took me a little bit to really get into this book, and when I did I could not stop reading. I had become addicted to the FEVER! Mackayla Lane is described as the pretty barbie doll, but she is a lot tougher than people give her credit for, through the book Mackayla becomes one of the strongest heroines that I have ever seen in action and she fights for what she believes in. I truly believe by the end of the series that she will become someone both physically and mentally strong.Jerricho Barrons. Oh, my love. I love this guy. At the beginning of the book, I admit he was a complete ass and he is very intimidating at times, but I love him! He is tough, knowledgeable, arrogant, rude, and all the above, but by the end of the novel I truly believe that there is another side to this man than we realize. He is such a mystery that I NEED to know more about this guy. And when I say mysetery I mean it in a way that will drive you crazy. Barrons is after the Sinsar-Dubh and makes that very clear, but what will he do with it when he gets his hands on the book? The both need each other for their own agendas.We also have V'lane, our Fae Prince. His top priority is his queen , but V'lane and his queen need Mackayla to find the Sinsar-Dubh also. I don't really know what to think of V'lane as of yet, he seems like one of them that don't really care for Mackalyla until he gets what he wants. We didn't get much of V'lane, but I hope to find out more of his characters in the next book. Darkfever has a formidable cast of characters that you can't help but love and want to learn more about their pasts, what kind of power are they capable of, and what exactly their agendas are.So basically Darkfever is one of those series I can say why hadn't I read this book sooner? And yes, when of those series where I read each book back to back without stopping because I became addicted to the series. Darkfever has twists and turns that will leave you breathless and craving for the next book in the series. I am looking forward for book 2, Bloodfever and hope that it is even better than Darkfever!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I picked this up when it was a free kindle download, figuring that despite the book's lineage (first non-romance from a romance (bodice ripper) author) that it didn't cost me anything, so nothing risked.I got pulled into the premise and the world despite my reservations. The writing's nothing that'll be referenced decades hence, but it's clear, it has a strong voice in the narrator/main character, and it's engaging. At the end of the day, what more do we really need from our fiction?The only down side to this is the ending that lacks only \\"to be continued\\" to be the book version of the season ending cliffhanger that the evening soaps used to have. The fact that the story isn't really contained, but sprawls across five books is a little irritating, but I'll still be picking up book two to see what else is really going on in this story's world."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"OMG I love this series. I can't believe I have waited so long to read this. Karen Moning has an incredible talent for bringing rich, interesting incredible characters to life. You will not put this book down until you have read the very last sentence.This is the story of Mackala Lane, a spoiled beautiful little Barbie who loses her heart when her sister is murdered while away at school in Dublin, Ireland. Mac, much to the dismay of her parents, travels to Ireland to get to the bottom of what happened to her sister. Mac's character evolves so incredibly after she meets Jericho Barrons, a mysterious and sexy man that just oozes danger, who helps her discover who she is, gives her a home and teaches her how to protect herself from the Unseelie monsters that lurk in the shadows. All throughout this series you are left wondering what Mac is constantly asking, \\"What the hell is Jericho Barrons?\\" He is obviously more than human, but it's a constant mystery throughout the series. He is not your typical hero, he is charming, but he can also be a total bastard or as Mac would put it a \\"Constant Jackass,\\" but he is the most fascinating character I have ever read about. I just can't get enough of this guy. Mac works for Jericho and is helping him find the Sinsar Dubh, a powerful book of Dark Magic that Jericho and everyone else in town wants in a bad way, including Mac as it was her sister's last wish. Mac also meets V'lane who is a Seelie Prince and a Death by Sex Fae. He is dangerous and sexual and oh so hot, but he can't hold a candle to Jericho IMO. He wants the book too and wants to use Mac to get it.There is quite a bit of danger, a lot of humor and oh so sexy banter between Mac and Jericho. This series is hot and addicting and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Darkfever started out a little slow but then picked up the pace. Mac and Barrons make an intriguing grouping of characters and Dublin as a backdrop makes for an interesting read. The series gets better and better with each book. The Fever series won't blow you away, but it will entertain you for hours."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"that I kept reading and the 2nd and 3rd book in the series are even better!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was looking for some mindless quick reading and ended up finding a book series that sucked me in. Hey it is fiction, but some of the story line was seriously hokey, but it kept me coming back for more. The end was not done as well as it could have been done. Overall if you like paranormal fiction this is a decent read, I will certainly be checking out the next book to see if the story line improves but honestly as far as paranormals I have read go, this one ranks right there with the rest of them. I give it a 4."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Okay, so the main character is Mac. She is a 22 year old girl who has just had her world turned upside down. Lounging by the pool anxiously awaiting the day her sister returns, she gets the call that her beloved sister Alina has been murdered 4,000 miles away in Ireland. The contrast of where Mac is from (Georgia) to where she ends up (Dublin, Ireland) is enough of a shock for anyone. On top of that her world goes kaboom when she meets Jericho and finds out that not only is she a sidhe-seer but a Null. The story begins to start and then stops as you wait for the next installment.I liked the characters and overall wittiness of the book. What I didn't like would be when Mac would do something or learn something new it was often followed by: \\"Later I would learn...\\" I got so tired of that line that I would skip a paragraph if it so much as hinted to having hte words in it. I also didn't like that there was obvious chemistry between Jericho and Mac but NOTHING not even kinship really blossomed there. Oh well, who knows, maybe in the next one? There are tons of openness on where this story could go. I am intrigued enough to snatch up the next one and read it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The first chapters were kind of iffy, and I could not really relate to the main character, but once the story gets going it is quite an interesting read. The storyline was original and intriguing, and soon I found it impossible to put this book down. I finished it in two days and although I wasn't prepared for the \\"to be continued\\" ending I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"When Mac's sister is murdered, she decides to head out to Ireland to track down the killer herself. However, when she gets there she has no idea what she just stepped into. She spent her whole life not knowing what she is, a sidhe-seer, one who can see the fae. Oh and not just any sidhe-seer this action barbie is a Null, which means that she can freeze the fae with a touch. So when she comes across Barrons who just happens to be looking for a book that only a sidhe-seer can find, he decides to put up with her pink painted nails and her brightly colored Barbie clothes in order to get his hands on the book.I really couldn't handle Mac at first. She walks around with a juicy purse and pastels... and she is blonde! Not that I have a thing against blondes but the description of her takes me back to my childhood when I would play Barbies. However, you have to push through her naivety and superficial ways in the beginning because by the end of the book you start to see her get serious a little. I still think there is a lot more growing left for her but at least it is a start.Barrons... where do I start with him. He is dark, mysterious and can be quite overpowering. You would think that would be bad but some reason it works for him. He is as Alpha as it can get. For the second he is introduced into the story her screams predator. He threatens Mac and even choked her but for some reason, I didn't hate him because it suits him. He knows the danger that the world is in with the releasing of all the unseelie fae and he isn't about to let some pampered American come bouncing in and screwing up everything. I mean, if the world was about to end as we know it, wouldn't you get a little hyped up over things and want to smack dumb people upside their heads? Heck, there isn't the danger of Unseelie Fae over running the earth and I still want to hit some of the stupid people I come across.I think my favorite thing about this book besides Barrons is the world and character building. Moning put a great deal of detail in her story to paint the reader a picture of everything that she has created. You understand the reasoning behind what makes the characters tick and even though I sometimes have a hard time envisioning creatures outside the box, I was able to picture the Gray Man with no problem."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"What a page turner! A friend suggested I read this series and I am so glad I did. This is a great book, tons of characters that are at the very beginning of their development. A great story & a page turner. I truly can't stop reading these books. Can't wait for book #2."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"The Fever Series is is multilayered in every sense. The world that Karen Moning has created has different levels of reality which Mac struggles to understand until the very last book. The story is also multilayered in that it is a highly entertaining and highly addictive fun story, but it is also psychological, philosophical, and political at the same time. You wouldn't guess that it had so much depth at first blush. Mac can sometimes appear shallow and dwell on things that anyone at her age would. For example, she can't decide whether she should let go of her \\"Rainbow Girl\\" persona. I think this story could have been an epic to outdo all of the other paranormal fiction stories if it had toned down some of the surface value reflections. The best part of the Fever Series is the incredibly creative world and stunning visual imagery. It honestly feels as if you are having a waking dream while reading it. My favorite books are probably some of the later ones. I can't tell which was which at this point because they were all so addictive that I read one right after the other in an exhausting marathon. It's that addictive!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Let my preface this by saying I am an avid reader of fantasy fiction; I finished Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter series in 2 months! Loved them all. When I first read some of the reviews for this series I was kind of shocked at the wonderful reviews it had gotten, being as I had never heard of them or the author before... I am SOOOO glad that I bought this book, it is truly wonderful. The first person narrative is spot on; you really get a sense of who Mac is and everything that she is going through- pain/heartache/depression/revenge/anger/lust/happiness... it's all here!!! I'm now on the 3rd book and can I just tell you how in love with Jericho Barrons I am?! AHHHH... I have a problem with falling for fictional men. The thing I love the most about this book is that, although it is about the Fae Seelie/Unseelie Courts, etc... It seems so real. The author has really done her homework in regards to old Irish and Gaelic folklore including the Tuatha De Danann (This is real stuff, folks!) and a lot of the Fae themselves... Her description of Dublin is so detailed, you can almost feel the cobblestone below your feet as you follow Mac around in her city of foreboding apocalypse and lustful endeavors with Barrons and V'lane... Not to mention the cryptic, almost silence of the lambs sections where you're thinking-- WOW, I was not expecting anything like this! This book can get creepy, keep the lights on, not step into shadows kind of reading. The kind that I love! It is my suggestion that you purchase this entire series, you will be SO happy you did!!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Awesome series, original and captivating. A new type of heroine battling a mysterious enemy and battling her personal demons while trying to save our world. Had me glued to the pages well into the night!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I LOVED this novel. It was exciting, totally imaginative, and captured my attention like none other. If you're looking for something sexy and adventurous this is the series for you. The plot is exciting and keeps you interested. The characters are enthralling, esp Mac you feel like you ARE Mac. It's not a difficult read at all, it's perfect for long plane flights and reading at the beach. Its a great escape!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I can't tell you how much I loved this series. I just finished reading it for the third time,and will most defiantly read it again. Karen Moning is a fantastic story teller, she grabs you and whisks you away into a fantasy world. I recommend this series to everybody. Can't wait for \\"Iced\\" to come out this fall"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"As I first started reading Darkfever by Karen Marie Moning it seemed to me to be a simple mystery/suspense book with simple characters and simple themes. Makayla Lane was an ordinary young woman, wealthy and a bit bored. She was annoying, to put it bluntly.After she receives a message that her sister who was studying abroad has been murdered in Dublin she goes to Dublin to try to find out what had happened to her sister.Once she gets to Dublin and starts asking questions the pace of the book begins to rev up. Things are not what they seemed. Paranormal fantasy becomes apart of the mystery and suspense of the story. None of the characters are what they seem.I found this to be an awesome book and part of a five-book series that never disappoints. It is entralling! I had a hard time putting these books down, wanting to read through the entire series in as few sittings as possible.I highly recommend this book to everyone who enjoys paranormal fantasy stories with suspense who are over the age of about fifteen years old."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"One of five books and just won't want it to end! Everyone I've recommended has loved this series as well and has continued to spread the fever.Can't wait for the next book Into the Dreaming, a spin off from the fever!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This was my first foray into dark urban fantasy, and anything written by Ms. Moning. I will say that I bought the entire Feverseries on a whim based soley on the backcover synopsis, and a few of the reviews I read. Without going into lengthy detail concerning the plot, here are the pros and cons I found with Darkfever.Pros:1. The world builing in phenomenal, and richly described. I felt as if there was a dark and seedy reality that counterbalanced the 'normal' everyday Dublin.2. The plot and overall mystery of the novel kept me up all hours, hunting for clues and trying to piece them together with Mac.3. Jericho Z. Barrons, I do not think that I have ever come across a character in fiction (books, television, or films) that had me loving to hate him and just loving him altogether. He is dangerous, snarky, handsome, and a complete puzzle that I wanted to solve. Just as a side note, if this ever gets made into a movie, I pictured JZB as Clive Owens (yum).4. Mac, I loved that she was not perfect, she was just an ordinary girl faced with a terrible tragedy.Cons:1. The first person point-of-view, did turn me off, well scratch that, Mac's point-of-view turned me off for 2/3 of the book. I do not need to know every minute detail of what you are wearing and what you look like. Other than Mac describing herself endlessly and her woe-is-me mindset, I enjoyed connecting with Mac as a stranger in a strange land, trying to understand her heritage.2. Mac, to be honest I thought to myself, what did I just get my self into and thought of returning the entire series. Mac, well I will say she is a character that readers will either love or hate. It might be because this series is told from the perspective of Mac, but for me she came off as childish, naive, and self involved. I will be honest and say that she grated on my nerves for the better part of this book.Yes, Alina was murdered but it is not all about YOU. Cry a river, build and bridge and get over it! I don't want to come off as if I lack compassion and empathy, I fully understand what is it like to lose a family member tragically, but to beat a dead horse, practically every other paragraph got annoying. The reader understands that you are greiving and your reasons for travelling to Ireland, you do not have to remind us every five seconds.I know this sounds as if I hate Mac, I don't, somewhere along the line her character clicked for me, and became less irritating, and more relatable. I think it had more to do with Barrons and then anything else, but I did see a maturing of Mac towards the end of the book.Overall, I did not regret my rash decision to buy this book or the series on a whim. I completed the entire Feverseries in about a month (reviews for books 2-5 to follow,) and felt a bit of a sadness at having come to the end of the series. However, I would recommend to potential readers to pick up Darkefever first before deciding to continue with the series, as quite a few readers loathed the main character Mac. As I stated, she is a type of character that a person with either love or hate, and without spoiling the series I will say that her character grows and transforms through the series, into someone whose story I cared about."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I read the entire series, and I gotta say- fantastic. Fantastic plot, fantastic character development, fantastic writing, and fantastic originality. I am a voracious reader of the urban fantasy/paranormal romance genre and books in general so when I say the story is completely original and different from every other urban fantasy series, I have some experience to go by. I really, REALLY didn't want this series to end (although the author ended it beautifully). In fact, I would LOVE to see the author begin another series that centers on the stories of Jericho's men.I can't say enough how awesome it was to see a fully formed character grow and evolve throughout the series. Not only that, but it was SO refreshing to read a book in which the love interest is not the cliched gorgeous, perfect-in-every-way mate. Life isn't always like that, and I loved that the author didn't go down that route with Mac and Jericho's romance.Really, REALLY loved this series. And I really, REALLY hope the author does a series on Jericho's men."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I loved the first book in the Fever series!! The only thing that would have made this book better is if some areas had been edited a little more; to avoid the superfluous paragraphs here and there with Mac's repetitive thoughts. Otherwise the story is thrilling and hints at a romance. Barrons and Mac's interactions were comical and sassy, leaving you wanting more; I found myself wondering if the tension between the two of them would lead to something as I read quickly through this book. I would suggest reading all of the books one after the other as they are quick reads and since each book really melts into the next. You will defimitely feel like this book leaves an open ending so having the next book available is a good idea."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I first had the sample, read it and deleted it!

So i f You though you did not like Barbie Mac she will evolve! Give her a try these are my new fav series!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"If you like the Sookie series, you're going to love the Fever series. It's more grown up that Twilight and better written. It sucks you in and you do not want to put a book down!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"The whole series is just a huge cliffhanger. If I could send myself a message in the past, I would warn myself not to start reading it.I loved it for so many reasons: finally the older-than-life-on-earth characters act and speak according to their age (and makes the heroes of a lot of poplar series seem juvenile). I didn't mind the initial pinkness of the heroine - she was fun, and the story from her perspective was gripping and smartly told. This is one of those authors whose shopping list I would enjoy reading so, from this point of view, this book was such a treat!And the fact that she doesn't draw the line between good and evil. Even the bad ones have motivations that lead me to think I could have done the same. I love this in a book!But then comes Barrons. There are a lot of entries on the popular romance blogs about people who, after reading the series, can't take him out of their minds, can't find anything that can cure them from the addiction he creates. I subscribe. It's like a drug and at the end you don't receive the antidote. Not only the end of this book (which, honestly, in it's content it's like the first two chapters of a normal one), but the whole 5.An then are the cliffhangers: the lack of satisfaction they provide - instead of a happy-ending you're left wanting more. And the last book, that delivers thousands of other questions. I never had a love/hate relationship but this book is close to it.One more thing: if you're looking for hot scenes from her romance novels, there are none for you here.Sometimes I feel like giving it one star and write a message to the author to go find another job. This tease is not fair. Other times I admit that the other two series I couldn't get out of are Lord of the Rings and Dune - and I'm glad to live in the same time as Karen Moning. As I said, love&hate.; And hope."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"A friend introduced me to this series and I fell in love immediately. My husband and children missed me for a few days while I read the first 4 books. I would start reading when I woke up and wouldn't stop til I could no longer hold my eyes open, then start over the next day. I anxiously awaited the 5th and final book for the series for over a year, and it felt like an eternity. Right after Shadowfever, the 5th book, was released, the author, Karen, had a book signing and discussion where she answered questions the fans had about the series in Atlanta, which I was able to attend. She was the sweetest person. Then soon after that a group of fans had a lunch together and she showed up. She was more than happy to sign the books for those who hadn't had the chance to make it a signing. She stuck around for a while and socialized, we got have pictures with her. It was really nice and personal. Karen has always taken a personal interest in her fans. This series keeps you on edge the entire time. There isn't a dull moment. Now I am awaiting her next series. The first book is supposed to be released hopefully some time next year and I cannot wait!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Just finished Shadowfever, book 5 in the Fever series, and felt compelled to come back to address new readers of book 1. Don't stop here. Get books 2-5. Read them one right after the other. Pay attention because the devil is, in fact, in the details. And enjoy, enjoy, enjoy.According to her website, KMM resisted writing this series. Urban Fantasy. Not really her thing. Why depart from her deliciously successful romances? Turns out it most definitely IS her thing. This is not simply UF. It is also a complete banquet of mystery, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, and, of course, romance. Get it, read it, feast on it.

I am an avid reader and this series by far is my absolute favorite!!! Can't say enough about how much I LOVE the series and it's characters. You will definately end up reading this more than once.What I love most about this series is that the author had the entire series finished in her head before she started writing book one. It made all the books just fit.Thank you Karen for letting me into your amazing world!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"So well written they made me wonder how I dare to call myself an author. So sensual they leave you breathless and tingly all over, especially Book 5 - Shadow Fever.I recommend you read or listen to them in order to get the full effect."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book is great, I've just finished reading the series. (all five books). I will say that the first book Darkfever is probably the most annoying and the slowest out of all of the books in the series, but i say that out of love because it was captivating enough to keep me reading, and it got better and better. I loved the second book better than the first, i loved the third book better than the second, etc. An unfolding masterpiece.This series is a page turner and can be read by people (like me) that don't typically even identify with romance or science fiction/fantasy. I will say that this is the most compelling, best written, and most beautifully crafted of anything that I've read and the first series that I've finished. It has no \\"slow moments.\\" It the series keeps you on edge 'till the end."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Let me start out by saying I've been reading romance novels for ever 10 years now. I'm always on the the hunt for a new exciting story/author. I was delighted to to find both of these in darkfever. To say this story is simply a romance would be wrong. It's a mystery, thriller, suspense with a healthy dash of romance. All of this adds up to a wonderful story. Tried of reading romance novels with predictable endings? This is what you've been waiting for. Darkfever in a nutshell is the story of Mac and her journey to avenge her sister. This story does contain a lot of paranormal elements, however it does not overpower the plot. You find yourself caring for the characters and falling in love with them. Ms. Moning does such a good job, that you don't care if they're human/fae/devel, you root for them anyway. I loved them this book. There are five books in this series. There are cliffhangers at the end but it makes you actively think about the story and it only adds to the fun. Honestely what book have you read and you're still thinking about weeks/months later?? Trust me, challenge yourself if this is not your usual 'cup of tea'. Pick up this book, take a chance, you will NOT regret it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"...and then it stopped. Literally.I knew going in that this was a five book series, in her blog Ms. Moning warned us of that fact. I did not realize this would be a classic cliffhanger with a \\"tune in next time...\\" last page. If this is the kind of thing that bugs you, as much as it does me, I suggest you wait until all five books are published before you start. In the past the author has taken up to a year or more between books, so it could be a long wait.Back to our story - as much as was there, in any event. A young college student is murdered in Ireland. The local police are stumped, the family is devastated. A cryptic message from the victim is left on the voice mail of the younger sister's cell phone, and she comes to Ireland to try and find out what happened. The Dark Fae look to be responsible, and our characters need to deal with it. The story twists, turns, starts to come into focus - and then the cliffhanger.The characters are... okay, awful. The heroine, sister of the murder victim, is supposedly a twenty-two year old sidhe-seer, and most of the time comes across like a twelve year old Junior Miss Pageant winner. She uses the word \\"pretty\\" a lot (you will learn to hate the word). She has pretty little tanned legs, pretty blond hair, pretty skin, pretty clothes, pretty little shoes, and (my personal bugaboo) pretty Ice Princess Pink Blush nail polish on her pretty little fingers and toes. Nave and immature doesn't begin to describe MacKayla. We are expected to believe she is a product of her pretty little small town, and over protective background. Not buying it. If you are from a small town, and I am, you will be insulted by the inference. About the time MacKayla starts to mature to about a thirteen year old personality, here comes that cliffhanger.Our hero, Barron (I think he's the hero, the jury's still out), is dark, brooding, ultra masculine, handsome, rich, patronizing, and somewhat brutal. At first he tries to get rid of MacKayla by physical intimidation, then decides to use her untrained Sidhe-Seer talents to help him fight the Unseelie Sidhe and find their \\"Dark Book\\". After awhile, Barron starts to feel some gentler emotions toward MacKayla - and then the cliffhanger.There is no actual sex in the book, but, be warned, there are some rather brutal almost rape encounters with MacKayla and the Fae. Because MacKayla is so very young and immature mentally, these scenes seem even more horrific than usual.(Note to the author: If and when, sometime in the next four books, this turns into a romance between the two main characters, which I suspect it will, I sincerely hope you have MacKayla mature a whole lot, or Barron is going to come across as a rather creepy pedophile. At that point, you will lose me as a reader. Some lines can't be crossed.)Three stars because -Actually, I don't know why. Two are too few and I did finish the book in an evening. Four stars are too generous for a mere chapter in an incomplete story with characters that are less than stellar. I will be reading the next book in the series because...... oh, hell. because it's a cliffhanger, and I'm weak."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is one of my all time favorite Urban Fantasy series. I have a thing for faeries, whether they are good or bad faeries, I don't care bring them on! Moning, in her wonderful MacKayla Lane series, has created a world both entirely creepy and wonderfully compelling. She blends bare bones human emotion with fantastical and horrifying creatures. Her creations, Mac & Barrons are one of the most resonating characters that I have had the pleasure of reading. If you haven't partaken of this series...what is holding you back?REVIEW: MacKayla Lane's ordinary world is suddenly thrust into the extraordinary with one phone call. A cryptic voice mail left by her sister right before she dies changes Mac's life forever. Desperate to find answers to her sister's murder and figure out the odd message, Mac journeys to Ireland. Immediately she realizes that something is not quite what it seems.As her own life becomes threatened and creatures from her nightmares take shape into reality, Mac is thrust into the path of Jericho Barrons, another mystery. Not quite sure whether he is there to help or hinder, Mac must align herself with someone, because she can't do this on her own. The problem, Barrons has one focus and Mac seems like the ticket to that conclusion: Find the Sinsar Dubh - the object that will control both the mortal world and the world of the Fae. Just what will he use it for?A very intricate plot with twists and turns that left me breathless. I rooted for Mac every step of the way and as she got deeper and deeper the intrigue only worsened. The relationships Mac had with all her side characters were so in depth that I felt I knew them all personally. A well constructed novel, by far - with excellent dialogue that made me feel like I was a part of the conversation. The characters are so well structured and 4 dimensional that I would swear they are actually real. On top of the depth of the characters the range of human emotions and morality that is touched upon in the novel resonates as real real real. Moning has gift...and that gift is understanding human nature and weaving it into her stories. You aren't just entertained, you are schooled. Once again, a must read.RECOMMENDATIONS: Adults only, has some R rated themes. This is an urban fantasy novel, with any romantic hinting, just that - a hint. Fans of Richelle Mead's Succubus or Eugenie series should enjoy."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Ok, this book should come with a warning! Or maybe it's already out there and I just didn't pick it up. Have you ever read the previous books of Karen Moning and expect the same? Well, forget it! Longing for delicious dark Fae or Highlander as a hero? Dig up your magnifying glass. Do you want romance, passion and plundering bodies? Give the snooze button another hit! For Karen Moning turns into another direction and yet you read an original Moning all the way!!Mackayla is an average 22 year old with normal wants and needs, but with one phone call her life takes a dramatic turn. Her sister and best friend Alina was murdered in Ireland and she leaves Mackayla a message which doesn't make sense. It doesn't take long for Mac to decide to go to Ireland and figure out what her sister tried to tell her.In Ireland the police isn't helping her very much, friends and professors at the trinity college also don't remember much and what they do remember doesn't sound like Alina at all. At night she goes into a pub for dinner and she sees a gorgeous man enter, staring at him she suddenly sees a flash of something else. Then there's an weird old lady telling her not to reveal their kind. She must be tired for she just doesn't understand. The next day Mac wants to research the meaning of the word: Shi-Sadu, for Alina mentioned it in her message.If it's faith or something else Mac finds a bookstore and Jericho Barrons, who obviously knows something but isn't willing to reveal anything... two can play that game so Mac isn't answering his questions either. Mac isn't getting anywhere with her research and it's frustrating, but be careful what you wish for.....With this first book in the fever series Karen Moning takes us further into the realm of Unseelie, Seelie and the Tuath&eacute; de Danaan. From the very first page I wandered into Mackayla's world, feeling her emotions, despair, grief, but also her determination to find that what destroyed her sisters light. With every page the suspense is building up, question's rise with Mac as she enters a world and you hope that she finds her answers. V'Lane and Barrons make me want more. V'Lane as a death-by-sex Fae ( God I love that expression of Mac) makes a woman throb for everything a male body has to offer ( and how can Karen Moning do this to us!! I wanted plundering wild passion, hungry devouring bodies as only she can write it. She puts us on a diet and ladies, I'm starving!) and Barrons, he's so mysterious about who he is and Karen Moning gives us just a few hints of information, talk about torture!!!All my comments on this book is given with a wink because with her unique and rich writing style Karen Moning gives us a Fantasy/Suspense novel of world class and although I missed the romance aspect a little bit she fills it up with an amazing fast paced story, an incredible heroine and a quest of mega proportion's in a world that's just not the same anymore.I've closed the book that leaves me wanting for more as the ending seems like it's just the beginning.courtesy of realmsonourbookshelves"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Quick & Dirty: Suspense, intrigue, and danger make this a gripping page-turner.Opening Sentence: My philosophy is pretty simple - any day nobody's trying to kill me is a good day in my book.Excerpt: Chapter 1The Review:MacKayla \\"Mac\\" Lane lives a very carefree life. With seemingly no future, Mac cruises aimlessly through life focusing on her perfect manicure, pedicure and golden tan. Her self-absorbed world comes crashing down when her sister, Alina, is murdered in Dublin, Ireland. Hitting a dead end and having no clues to go on, the local authorities close Alina's murder case. Against her better judgment and her parents' advice, Mac heads to Ireland to get answers and follow the one lead that she does have - a voicemail from her sister hours before she is murdered.The danger begins from the moment Mac arrives in Dublin. Braving dark and derelict streets, Mac stumbles upon Barrons Books & Baubles. There, she meets the dangerous and mysterious Jericho Barrons. Eventually, they set out on a quest to find the Sinsar Dubh, the powerful Dark Book.It took me some time to warm up to Mac. I started out thinking that she would be a weak an ineffectual urban fantasy heroine. Having never left her small hometown of Ashford, Georgia, I didn't think she would realistically be able to survive the mean and supernatural streets of Dublin. While on her journey, Mac discovers a lot about herself. She's a Sidhe-seer, which gives her the ability to see through faerie glamours, and she has other talents as well. Mac turns out to be more than a hapless southern belle. Despite being out of her element and being exposed to things she never imagined could be real, Mac rises to the challenge. She's tough, smart and ultimately a very likable character.Jericho Barrons is still very much a mystery. He's powerful, dark, sexy, and very secretive. It's apparent that there's more to him than meets the eye, but it's hard to tell if this poses a real danger to Mac. Whatever the big reveal is, I'm sure it's going to be worth the wait. The attraction between him and Mac sizzles. I can't wait to see the dynamics of their relationship in the next installment.The world of Darkfever is atmospheric, chilling and seductive. I couldn't seem to escape that air of danger and evil always lurking in the shadows. The world-building is simply fantastic. I really like the mythology and Ms. Moning has certainly laid the foundation for what promises to be intriguing supernatural politics, and a deadly power struggle. The faeries in this book are completely terrifying. The Unseelie fey are essentially what Nosferatu are to vampires. Not-so-pretty and vicious killers. The Seelie fey are of the \\"beautiful people\\" variety. Still deadly in their own right, they're sensual and seductive.Overall, Darkfever is a wonderfully fulfilling read. This is a great beginning to what promises to be a thrilling series. The writing style is excellent. The characterization is outstanding. Its mythology is deftly woven with the supernatural, and has a delightfully deadly world that kept me captivated until the last page.Notable Scene:I opened my mouth to scream, but he clamped a hand over it. He banded an arm beneath my breasts so tightly that I couldn't inflate my lungs to breathe. His body was far more powerful beneath that fine suit than I ever would have guessed, like reinforced steel. In that instant, I understood that the open door had been nothing more than a mocking concession, a placebo he'd fed me that I'd swallowed whole. Anytime he wanted, he could have snapped my neck and I wouldn't have gotten off a single scream. Or he could simply have suffocated me, as he was doing now. His strength was astonishing, immense. And he was only using a small fraction of it. I could feel the restraint in his body; he was being very, very careful with me.The Fever Series:1. Darkfever2. Bloodfever3. Faefever4. Dreamfever5.

It doesn't. There is something engaging about this story that I can't quite put my finger on. It throbs with menace and mystery and is fraught with fae lore; yet, it retains a sense of reality that I have never before encountered in previous Urban Fantasy books/series. This book felt real. It's addictive and engaging, filled with grit, humor, lust, grief, mystery and mayhem.Darkfever tells the story of MacKayla Lane, a silly, 22 year old bartender/ part time student/ full time underachiever. Her reality doesn't extend beyond fashion, music, the color pink and her family. Mac lives a sheltered, small minded and simple existence in Ashford, GA where southern manners reign and fairies do not exist. All it takes is one fateful call to turn Mac's existence topsy turvy. Mac's sister, Alina, has been murdered while studying abroad in Dublin. With no leads and no suspects, the investigative team has closed the case. Reeling from the loss, Mac's parents become despondent, withdrawing into themselves. Mac can't begin to mend the shattered pieces of her life until Alina's murderer has been brought to justice. However, in order for Mac to fill the emotional void within her, she must travel to the abyss.While I enjoyed this story very much, I had to knock a star for the character that is Mac. She's shallow, incredibly girly, her manners are much too \\"nice\\" and she is WAY too perky. She and I would never be friends; nonetheless, I respected her. The girl's got grit, albeit that grit comes armed in pastel skirts, juicy couture purses, strappy sandals and ice berry pink nail polish. She also contains strong sense of self awareness in addition to the thoughts and motivations of others, leading me to think she isn't as obtuse as she initially appears. I grit my teeth a time or two in response to her reactions, although, I found them suiting to her character and realistic to the human condition. Thankfully, Mac developed throughout the story, and I expect that development will continue throughout the remainder of the series. She also has an intriguing co-star in Barron's. He remains shrouded in mystery, but like all good mysteries, you want to unwrap him, figuratively and literally.All in all, I was entranced by the world that Moning has created for these characters. Darkfever wrecked havoc on my mind. I woke up tangled in my sheets, as I dreamt of this bizarre world where fae roam the night and hotties like Jericho Barrons are on the prowl. Can't wait to start Bloodfever!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Review courtesy of [...]What do I want in an urban fantasy? A strong, likable protagonist with an as yet unrealized magical potential, a richly layered paranormal world, a well matched love interest who holds their own, and the promise of a multi-book meta-narrative. DARKFEVER has all that and more.Mackayla \\"Mac\\" Lane is a near perfect UF heroine, and she befriended me immediately. As is a Sidhe-seer, Mac is someone who can see past the disguises, or glamours, that the fey use to hide in our world. Tenacious in pursuit of her sister's killer, Mac is thorough and smart. Yes, she's a bit cocky, which she glosses over with more than a hint of old fashioned Southern charm, but she's also resilient and quick on her feet. The first time she truly spots a fey and is in danger of being discovered, it's her quick thinking and cool under pressure that save her life.Speaking of the fey, in DARKFEVER they are divided into two courts. The fey from the Unseelie court are the stuff of nightmares: grotesque hulking monsters who can suck the life out of humans with a touch. The fey from the Seelie court are the stuff of fantasies: breathtakingly beautiful beings whose very presence can send a human into an all-consuming erotic frenzy.And this is Karen Marie Moning, so you know to expect romance, but it's far from conventional. The enigmatic Barrons is Mac's unwilling teacher/protector. He is harsh and demanding, bordering on cruel through out DARKFEVER, and yet, there are flashes of something more, mere glimpses of a different man beneath the brusque demeanor. The slow, smoldering attraction that builds between these too was palpable.Overall, DARKFEVER is a near perfect urban fantasy (and yes, it is more urban fantasy than paranormal romance). A chilling mystery, a darkly seductive enigmatic love interest with questionable character, in a terrifying yet alluring world full of both scary and seductive fey. I am dying to devour the other books in the Fever series and be devoured in return.Sexual Content: References to sex. References to masturbation. Two scenes of graphic sensuality."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I basically picked up this book becasue all of my book resources recommend this series as a standout. I am not ready to agree to that yet but I did like this book and I will read the rest of the series.Our heroine Mac has received flack online for being 'too stupid to live' or too involved with make up and fashion. I didn't find her too stupid at all. Any mistakes she made could have been made by anyone thrust into this crazy new world. Mac goes to Dublin to investigate her sister's murder and learns what she believes led to her sister's death...both of the sisters can see the fae. Somehow the dark and evil fae are coming into our world in larger numbers. One of them, or something involved with them, has killed Mac's sister.Mac does go on sometimes about make up and such. Its not a lot compared to some paranormal chick lit on shelves now, but for this type of book it did stand out. maybe it will be toned down as the series progresses.I like the character of Barrons. The man is rude and mean but I was never sure if he was all good or all bad. That kept him entertaining. I also like Moning's writing. I wasn't fond of the idea of the relics and the quest for them. I personally usually find that type of story tedious. The plot could get old with this fast.Moning does a great job of ending the story in a way that isn't frusterating but still leaves things open and the reader wanting answers. As long as the rest of the books in this series are at least this good they should be worth reading."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Karen is back! She took her time, paced the book well, it felt GREAT to be reading a book from her again that I REALLY enjoyed!I am glad that she took into account that we are not stupid people who will be slaves to an overused formula...however successful.My problems with her last two books was that the story was forced and plagued by scenes that were far too explicit for characters I desperately wanted to be \\"in love\\" not \\"in lust\\" with each other.I am not even sure this is a romance novel...at least not yet. The main characters are plagued with obstacles that make romance at this time impossible...But I do like where it is going and the anticipation is spectacular. At the conclusion of the book I am left with tons of questions and I am absolutely going to buy the next in the series. (Even if the bits with V'lane were treading the slippery slope of tastefulness...its briefness made them easier to tolerate.)I guess in the end if Moning can remember that her previous books were about falling in love and then the great sex will just happen naturally as the story and plot evolves it won't be offensive."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Karen Marie Moning is a world-building, story-telling genius! Her FEVER series consists of 5 books: Darkfever, Bloodfever, Faefever, Dreamfever and Shadowfever. The first book sets the stage for the most incredible, wild roller coaster between good and evil, human and fae, life and death, damnation and salvation, ruin and redemption. MacKayla Lane starts her journey as a pampered, pink-loving, 20-something Southern blonde, who travels to Ireland to investigate her sister's murder. When she arrives, she learns that she and her sister were born to an ancient line of women called sidhe-seers, who see and battle fae. She walks a tightrope of alliances with druids, fae (good and evil), local law enforcement and other sidhe-seers, and discovers her dark-side in the process. Will she be able to help keep the walls up between Earth and Fairy? Will she learn to embrace the darkness? Read the series and learn!I am not the kind of person to write a review, unless I believe something is over-the-top excellent. I have recommended the FEVER series to MANY friends and colleagues, and to a person, they all become as addicted to the storyline as I have! Well, maybe not - I own the whole series in both hard cover and paperback now. :-) I've read the whole series twice, and I'm sure I'll read it again in the near future! I promise you, you will NOT be disappointed with your purchase! Just make sure you read them all in order, as the tension - and Mac's knowledge - increase throughout each. You're lucky - you can read the whole series of books back-to-back. I waited with baited breath for the release of each one as it was released!Enjoy! And stay to the lights!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Book one of five. Much to Karen Moning's distress, this series has been labeled as romance. It is not. This is a paranormal book/series with characters who evolve as events progress. This is my favorite series by far. Main character does not start out in leather, killing everything with ease and uber powers. She starts out as a barbie from the South who's sister is murdered while attending school in Ireland. There will be romance, but not till book five :) Which comes out in Jan 2011!!! Wonderful community of fellow Moning Maniac book lovers on Karen's website. Wondering what something means? [...] If you love the emotional attachment, to either love or hate a character, this is a must read!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I know nothing about the author's other works. I see most of the author's fans are female. I don't read romance novels much. I walked into reading Darkfever with no expectations. It's a good book. Complaints about Mac are misplaced. She's cute and also sexy. Her first-person narrative voice is appealing. She's a woman who finds herself going through a well-developed and dangerous urban fantasy world. Whether she's lounging by the pool, getting spooked, disbelieving her eyes, melting from alien charisma, or battling, she's plausible all the way. Sure, her concerns are shallow but that's the point. She's a fish out of water. She's used to hanging by the pool and listening to tunes, tending bar, dancing . . . but she's got to save the world - or at least Dublin. There's a lot of clever invention here. The use of Dublin is effective as well.It's a fun book. The heroine is often in peril, but her ultimate survival never feels in doubt. Her sister is dead, and she cries a river for her, but the clever and effective author doesn't reach a sort of deep and authentic, throbbing pain. Fun's good. Drama without really wrenching pain is fine. You'll definitely keep turning the pages to follow Mac's adventure. Also, the developing relationship with her partner in crime adds another element of suspense. All-in-all it's an accomplished and fun work.One of my favorite urban fantasy books is Scent of Shadows. If you like Mac, you'll like Scent of Shadows as well. There's a passion to the writing in Scent of Shadows, and a depth of emotion in it, that transcends the urban fantasy genre. Another great book that is filled with passion is the mystery \\"The Wounded Man.\\" Both \\"Scent of Shadows\\" and \\"The Wounded Man\\" are able to connect to some sort of subterranean source of shocking emotion, turning each of those novels into compelling works. I read them both pretty long ago, and I've read tons of Kindle books since then, but they stay with me. Don't get me wrong, they're genre novels and not high-brow literature. Yet they are steeped in real emotional contact between the reader and the characters. Darkfever isn't infused with that level of passion even when dealing with the erotic fae or the grief of loss. A certain emotional distance remains in the book despite the first-person narrative. It's terrifically inventive. It's writing is accomplished, and it's full of intriguing concepts. Also, the situation is rife with drama and action. It's good."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Give me fever in the morning and fever all through the night! The Fever Series! Love KMM's style. Incredible characters, great plot, lots of action. I can't believe my luck that I did not hear about this series until this month thus missing the frustration with the cliffhangers and the long wait between books. I read all 4 and only have less than 2 months for the final story. I like this series so much that I will do a first ever event and buy a hardback new release. Loved this series so much that I actually visited the discussion boards for the first time and now I have a new list of authors I want to read. Thanks Amazon for this service. Thanks KMM for the entertainment!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Mackayla Lane goes to Ireland to find her sister's murderer. She ends up living in a bookstore with Jericho Barrons, helping him find a powerful book. To make matters worse, she confronted by a \\"death-by-sex\\" Fae, Vlane, who adds humiliation to her emotional ride abroad.I loved this book. It had everything: action, mystery, paranormal, and even a little bit of romance...a little bit....more like a hint of a possible romance. There were moments that had me laughing out loud. The contrast between Mac and Barrons made their relationship much more interesting to read. The bickering that went on between the two of them was hilarious. I just wish that the hint of romance would have turned into something more. Hopefully in the following books, their relationship will grow.The action was thrilling and suspenseful. I read the book in one day-I couldn't stop reading. I absolutely LOVED it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"(This review was originally posted at VampireBookClub.net)I have heard friends, Goodreads pals and fellow bloggers opine on the wonders of Karen Marie Moning's Fever series and how the Barrons character will make any woman weak in the knees. Then I was advised to wait to start the series until November, so I wouldn't die in anticipation of the final book's release (Shadowfever comes out in January). So, let's just say I went into this one with very high expectations.And, early on, I didn't get the big deal. But I kept reading Darkfever, and before I knew it I was roped into Moning's witty writing and engaging characters. I get it. (Though, the way people talk about Barrons I expected romance in the first book -- there is none. He's just really insanely alpha and sexy.)In this urban fantasy page-turner, we meet MacKayla. She's heading to Ireland from Georgia because her sister -- who had been studying abroad -- was murdered and the Dublin police aren't doing a damn thing. Her plan is to find evidence to get them to open the case. She is determined to find her sister's killer. Unfortunately, all she has to go on is a cryptic voicemail mentioning a phrase she doesn't understand and a whole lot of panic.What follows is her decent into the world of the fae. Not the pretty faeries of Disney movies, but cruel beings who think themselves better than humans. Mac is a sidhe seer, or one who can see though faery glamour, only she doesn't understand it. This is where the brusque Jericho Barrons comes in. He'll teach her about the fae, if she'll help him in his own mission.And she's going to need his help, not only to find her sister's murder, but to stay alive. Dark faeries are escaping an Unseelie prison and arriving in Dublin. People are dying and her sister may just have been the latest casualty.The wry tone of our protagonist keeps the dark fantasy in Darkfever from weighing on the reader. With constant danger, overwhelming new experiences and a bold \`other' world, it is near impossible to put Darkfever down once you're acquainted with MacKayla.(And, yes, I plan to devour the whole Fever series before January. I can already see why it's so addictive.)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I absolutely LOVE this series!!!

I love the female main character and I absolutely think that the male characters are awesome as well. At the beginning of this first volume you don't know what to expect of the argument but it becomes better and better. An absolute page turn over. I couldn't stop reading all the series and I've preordered the next and last one. Another must read."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I grabbed the Kindle version of this book. I have to say it was very well written. I like the flow, and main character is likable and believable. I would be happy to give this book 5 stars and buy the rest of the series except I did not care for the scenes between Mac and the \\"death by sex\\" Fae. I can only assume there will be more like that in future books. Its a shame to because if those scenes were cut from the story it would not hurt the story at all, would not have even been missed. Reading on the authors web site tells me she plans more of that in future, so I will move on.This is my first book I have read by this author, so I assume this is typical for her.Again, her writing is great, and it is a great tale, so if you do not mind being in the mid of a young girl as she deals with a \\"death by sex\\" Fae, then you might really enjoy these books."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book sets the stage for a really amazing story. I started this novel and almost didn't move on to the next, because, as many people have noted, the main character seems like a spoiled brat. It's intentionally that you don't really like her in the beginning, because she turns into a more developed interesting character as the series continues. Part of the draw of this book is seeing the transformation or all the characters: how circumstance changes them and how they affect each other. I have to applaud Karen Moning for this story because everything in it is intentional and it eventually comes full circle. So even if you don't like this book, try the next one, and by the third you will be completely sucked into this world and emotionally invested in the characters."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I just finished this whole series. I was enthrawled chapter after chapter and could not pyut it down. Mac and Jerrico's relationship sometimes wants to make you pull your hair and infuriates you.

I didn't even realize she wrote romance novels or I wouldn't have ordered it. I love supernatural mysteries. I read as many books as I can find about vampires, weres, and the Fae. The book came up on a recommendation and I ordered Dark Fever. I enjoyed the book. It was a different look at the Fae. It takes place in Ireland so it's something different and fun. I liked Barrons, I thought that he would reveal himself as a vampire, but that didn't happen. He has vampire behaviors, only showing up at night, very strong, lots of knowledge that comes with time and experience. He was a mystery and I wanted more information about his character but the book isn't very revealing. I wasn't crazy about Mac, I don't like the Barbie Doll pink finger nails blonde bimbo thing she has going on. I am hoping she matures in the next book. She is lazy and seems more concerned with her appearance and seems pretty sure she is gorgeous. Her outfit or nail color doesn't improve the book at all. I do really hope she gets a reality slap in the next book. I would recommend this book to a friend. I am hoping the next book in the series is better. I was surprised at the ending which is a cliff hanger. It just makes it seem like the book stopped so you can buy the second one to finish reading."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I don't really know how to feel about this book. I liked the setting and hated the characters. I gave it three stars because, despite everything, I want to read the sequel.What I liked:* One thing: the world building. I like Dublin and Ireland, so I could relate to the feeling of magic you get in a lot of places. I also liked the concept of the Dark Zone. It took me a while, but slowly I got interested in the Fae world.* Jericho Barrons' ambiguity. The fact I still don't know where he stands makes me want to read the following book.What I didn't like:* The prologue put me off, it seemed useless, it didn't grab my attention. It read like an attempt at being sophisticated, but it seemed just patched up at the beginning of the book, with no real information. A prologue shoud be a teaser, or should partake the reader of information one will keep in mind constantly, but it was just annoying.* The main character, Mac. Was she so shallow because she was young? Usually the death of a person you love should make you grow up. Nothing. She said many times how the death of her sister affected her, but she never showed it, not once. Why is she always paying attention to what she's wearing, her I-don't-want-to-change-the-world-but-decorate-it attitude really made me grit my teeth.*** spoilerish***And then I just couldn't believe that Mac/Barbie could fight like Uma Thurman in a Quentin Tarantino's movie. There's no hint in the whole book she had this in her.* I don't like heroes who behave like jerks, but I understand and condone Barrons' behaviour, she was stupid and annoying most of the time. He acts misterious, he is misterious, but he's so flat... Well, maybe the problem is Mac, because we are reading the story through her eyes. He's gorgeous, strong and I think he's also cultivated, he should be perfect, but at the beginning of the book he manhandles her a couple of times, and though I would have done the same thing with someone like Mac, it was too much. I hope I'll like him better later."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is a great series, can't wait for the last one to come out in Jan. 2011, if you haven't read this series and you like supernatural, scifi, paranormal romances, then you'll love this one."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I picked this book up when it was a free download on the Kindle. I don't typically read romance novels so I was not familiar with the author's other work. Maybe based on what other reviewers have written...that's a good thing. I got the book because I was intrigued by the paranormal aspect and not by the hint of romance. It does seem obvious that the two main characters will eventually develop a romantic interest in each other but the fact that didn't happen in this first book didn't bother me at all. I loved the fact that this book set the story up for the rest of the series. I didn't see it as a problem the book didn't \\"wrap up nicely\\" as most books set out to be a series from the beginning don't do that. They typically \\"wrap up nicely\\" when authors aren't planning to continue the story and then do so as a result of sales. This storyline is obviously meant to be an in-depth exploration of how Mac changes over time and adopts to her new role as sidhe-seer. This book did have a lot of new terms (at least for me) but there is a helpful glossary at the end of the book, taken from Mac's journal...so we learn as she learns. Because it is written from Mac's perspective, we are often left in the shadows as to what is really going on and I enjoyed that here. If you are someone who needs to know all the motivations of all the characters up front, you will be left disappointed and confused with this book. Yes, I agree with other reviewers about Mac's whiny surface level behavior at the beginning. It does seem a bit of a stretch--however I think it's meant to contrast with the amount of growth she undertakes while in Ireland. All in all, I thought it was a great beginning to a story and have already purchased the next book in the series. I am looking forward to see how Mac's story continues and to (I assume) the eventual romance with Jericho."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed this series. So far, I have read the first 2 books, and am currently reading the 3rd book. I would highly recommend this series to those who like action, mystery, a little romance, and magic. To me, this series would be comparable to the House of Night series and City of Glass series - if you liked those books, you will like this series. I can't wait to keep reading!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Too many people have already mentioned how the main character, Mac, was a shallow, annoying, immature and whinny girl. I don't need to repeat them here. Everyone also knows how those books pretty much end in a mid sentence so you need to buy the next book to know what happened; therefore, I am not going to bash them again.However, there is something pretty annoying to me that I haven't seen many people complaining was the descriptions of those characters.Just to be sure, I am not a romance novel reader and have never read her Highlander series.Picture this: The main character, Mac, loves wearing pink color everything, love golden lace-up saddles, and love to wear the colors of the rainbow. Now picture this: all main male characters are 6'3\\", dark tanned, (gold, colors of honey), long hair down to their waist line, chiseled jaws and tight jeans/leather pants. At one point, she even described one \\"hot\\" guy was a \\"Fabio\\".Now, how many people in the audience under the age of 40 know who Fabio is? (OK, you, you and you.)How many people in her 20's think Fabio is hot? (Anybody?)I appreciate the author's effort to get trendy by mentioning iPod, MP3, (and later in book 3, Nine Inch Nails), however, her taste in fashion and men really betrayed her real age. It's absolutely fine to like people who look like they just walked off the set of an 80's cheesy movie. However, as a first person perspective view of a 21st century 22 year old girl, this is just down right bizarre.On the plus side, this is a page turner. I personally want my answers and I want to know what happens to those characters. I just wish I didn't have to skip a few lines every time Mac puts on her dress (Seriously? Every time in graphic details about her pink dress and golden accessories? Add a head band and we are back in the 80's) or when she runs into a tall, dark, and handsome man. (Tall, dark, muscular and long hair? I can't keep the WWE wrestlers out of my mental picture.)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Had I known what I was getting into with the Fever series, I would have waited until all 5 books were finished.

The books in the fever series do not follow this, they are a single story, organized into 5 separate books or as Ms. Moning calls them \\"installments\\", each with a cliffhanger that leaves you feeling empty -- albeit wanting more, if only to know how the story ends. To me the series feels more like a made for SyFy TV miniseries that should be aired over the course of weeks, not years. It is a little unfair to fans to have to pay complete novel prices for the books, but not get a complete story in any of them. I was pulled in and now must wait until the final installment is published in January 2011 to get to the end of the story, and believe me, it's too long to wait.Still having said this, the \\"installments\\" are seductive, page-turning thrillers. The story pulls you in, like an addiction, and once you are hooked, you devour each book, raging from one \\"fix\\" to another. Problem is now, I'm going through painful withdrawal. Of course I'll read the final installment, but I am not sure I will invest this type of energy in anymore of Ms. Moning's incomplete works -- at least not until they are complete. It's just too frustating.After January 18, 2011 when the final installment is scheduled to be released, I highly recommend the series as long as you are committed to reading (and paying for) all 5 installments. Before January 18th, begin this series at your own risk!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I read this book when i foumd it on the free list for my Kindle....I had to buy the rest of the books and am now waiting for the next book to come out. Impatiently waiting!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Darkfever is a catalyst.It brings about a change in more ways than one. For starters, as a spinoff from Karen Marie Moning's Highlander series about timetraveling romance between Highlanders, the Fever series is a five book storyline that isn't a traditional romance. It's Urban Fantasy. There are no defined heroes (or are there?). It also is start of Mac's journey. Pink, ignorant, and without a care in the world...Mac 1.0 isn't the most exciting main character. Give the story a few chapters. Many readers will agree with me when I say don't give up on the story, get to chapter 3 or 4. Let yourself meet Jericho Barrons when Mac visits Barrons Books and Baubles for the first time and you may find yourself hooked. Also, as far as catalysts go, in regards to the 5 book journey...Mac's arrival in Dublin may be one of the biggest catalysts of all. If you want to know why, read the book.One of the most noteworthy aspects of this series is how dynamic of a character MacKayla Lane is. Each book she progresses. The Mac you meet in chapter 1 is not the same girl when you leave her at the end of chapter 54 of Shadowfever.If you are ready to take a chance, enjoy an escape into a dark fantastical world, epic characters consisting of good guys that do some bad things and bad guys that surprise you constantly...you'll love the fever series. Pick up Darkfever. You never know if you like something until you give it a chance. Every single person I have suggested this book to has loved it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"--original--The only thing keeping me from giving this a 5 star is that the five books should have been published as one. Every book so far ends practically mid-sentence, definitely mid-thought/action, worse than Lord of the Rings. I read all four books in one week, and yes, I have a day job.These are crunchy snack food: tasty; light reading; and based in a good mythology. Though I am as desperate for the two main characters to finally come together, I appreciate the author's attempt to make this a fantasy novel (A Novel, not 5) rather than a romance.The first book was a little hard for me to get into, never having been or known a perky, pink-laced woman-child. But as her eyes are opened, fairly literally, to the world at large, we start to wonder what else is out there, and how Barrons fits in.And how we wish he'd fit in. Admit it, if there was a rent-a-barrons site this author would never have to write another thing to be set for life... after \\"book\\" 5, that is.I will definitely be re-reading all of these just before ordering the 5th installment. Because I can.--edit--So, after re-reading these books, I realized what happened. I was so addicted and unable to put them down that I sped through them. This isn't a novella. I just devoured it like one. So, I'm now obligated to give it 5 stars. Well-written and thoroughly engaging. My deepest apologies to the author for loving it so much that I thought they were too short. I just NEED more! ;)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I am a fan of Vampire-lit and this came up as a suggested reading from Amazon. As a free Kindle download, this was hard to pass up.In general I thing Moning nailed the main character's naivet&eacute; and selfish silliness. At first, I found it annoying that Mac was immature and lacked depth, but as the story is told first person, I chalked it up to \\"keeping in character.\\" Her story was more of an average girl with untaped extraordinary powers. I was more interested in the locale and mysterious Jericho, the male lead. Not much was revealed about Jericho-- lots of unanswered questions, but there is something very interesting and compelling about him. The story started off slow, but midway through, became face paced and interesting. I could have used a little more explanation of the non-human characters, those were odd and needed a little more detail. In fact, overall, the whole story could have used a little more depth. More than anything, I see that this book laid the foundation for a series of interesting encounters and plot lines, perhaps even a little romance (but at the end of our tale, heat was still lacking)."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This isn't my usual genre, but it's hard to put this book into a genre. It has elements of sci-fi, paranormal, adventure and a little romance.What I like best about the book is the writing. This gal has talent. Well done, tight and concise in character development, dialogue, and action.What I didn't like is the fact that this book doesn't end, it's not a stand alone, but a continuation that lasts for 5 books. Having said that, I'll still continue the series because I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I originally downloaded this book because it was a freebie, thinking I wasn't out anything if it wasn't any good.

The 4th book in the series comes out in a little over a week, and I'm hoping that it is available for Kindle right away - very anxious to read it! :)If you like a paranormal adventure, with some mystery thrown in, this is a good book for you. Not a whole lot of romance, but there are definitely sparks between the main characters and I'm hoping to see them develop into more in the next books!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Finally, an interesting mystery, and a great fae book: two things that I have been looking for for awhile. In this murder mystery a 22 year old named Mac is thrown into bad situation after bad situation. Mac's sister is killed and she goes to Dublin to find out more about the murder. From the first day she arrives, she experiences nothing but trouble. An old woman attacks her for no reason, she starts stripping in the middle of the street, pieces of paper make her nauseous, and those are just a few of Mac's troubles. She is guided by a not so friendly book store owner on a journey to find her sister's killer and to possibly save the world.Although Mac's interest in pink nail polish and clothes is a bit annoying, it is obvious that the trials she goes through in this book help her mature a bit (though maybe not enough to not wear the nail polish). I can't wait to find out more about the fae, the bookstore owner, and Mac. This was a great start to what I think will be a great series!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Darkfever is a hugely enjoyable book with an engaging heroine, MacKayla Lane, who recounts the way in which her life changed irrevocably following a telephone call from Dublin to say that her sister had been murdered. Mac, as the narrator, is looking back to events which happened over a year ago so we occasionally are told things that she didn't know at the time as we follow her travelling from her small town in Georgia to Dublin to try and find out more about Alina's death.Mac's investigations seem hopeless and yet she perseveres but her attention is soon taken by some very strange events - an odd woman accosting her, a strange vision of a handsome man turning into an evil monster, and some unusual shadows. When Mac meets Jericho Barrons, rich owner of a bookstore right next to a strangely dark and empty part of the city, she is forced to face up to some unwelcome new truths - that Mac has skills as a Sidhe-seer and that her life is in danger.Mac and Barrons team up in order to search for an ancient book that Alina was pursuing in order to try to defeat the Unseelies who are flooding into Dublin. However Mac is given little information with which to work, Barrons being master of cryptic conversation, and her own mission to find Alina's killer is still important to her.The writing style of this book is excellent with Mac, as narrator, a very amusing character whose take on the world can be great fun, even as she's facing evil and dark things worse than she's ever considered. Her descriptions of some of the Unseelie are very amusing and yet her sense of fear as her world falls apart is also very well written. Although billed as a romance there's almost no romance in this story but it is clearly the beginning of a series and there are some hints as to the romantic direction into which it will go. The only real drawback of this book is that it doesn't reach any kind of a resolution, it just sets the reader on the path of Darkfever's world and makes the next book obligatory reading. This book feels rather like scene-setting for the major battle which one assumes will come in a future book.

As we all know vampires, werewolves, and witches have come and gone time and time again. Well Karen(writer) takes fantasy to a whole new direction. The word fairy is NOTHING like we all believe in our world. This book is dark, magical, DIFFerent, lust, anger, murder, passion, basically not your average romance novel. Incredible story line but the books are cliffhangers which leave you either losing sleep =) or impatient for the final book to come out in january 2011.A girl atteming to avenge her sisters death goes on a journey much more intense and gets much more than she bargained for in ireland.

This first book of the Fever series is so good, I know I will be reading everyone of the books while everything around me will be falling apart...Hehehehehehe!!. What surprises me, is why this not been a actual TV series.I feel so bad for all the people who started on this book from day 1, having to wait for all the sequels....man, do I know how that feels. I read Caroline Hansons book Love is Darkness, and had to wait for the 2nd, which was only within a month or so after I read the 1st book. I finished the 2nd and I am frustrated to have to wait for the 3rd. I'm so happy I found this series. Great job Karen Moning!! Wonderful story teller. I will be going to start on Bloodfever now :) Will be giving my review when I'm done."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Karen Marie weaves a paranormal gem that transports your mind into another world. This book is mostly paranormal with a very, very slight hint of romance. It's about fairies or \\"fae\\" being evil and coming to our world through a magical portal. \\"Mac\\" the main character travels to Berlin to find her sisters killer & discovers she is a very valuable player in the war against the fae. Mac meets a mysterious & handsome man named \\"Barons\\" in the process and although she learns to need him, she can't shake the feeling of not fully trusting him.The story is great & magical for true lovers of paranormal books. However, the romance is lacking.... severely. I think the romance should pick up in the next FIVE books.... if I make it that far in the series. The thing I didn't like was that the author had a tendency to add to much filler in places. She would go on and on about Macs fingernail polish or her personal thoughts to the point where I would skip paragraphs or pages at times and miss nothing of substance. I will read the next book \\"Bloodfever\\" but if there is not more romance or she adds too much filler again, I am done with this series.If you liked this book check out the \\"Jolie Wilkins\\" series by H.P.

She meets some interesting, but dangerous, people and some of them might not be altogether human. Before her sister died, she leaves Mac a very cryptic message on her cell phone voice mail. Because of that message, Mac feels compelled to travel to Ireland and solve the mystery surrounding her sister's murder.I could only feel medium Milk Chocolate warmth for this book. Have you ever watched a horror movie where the dumb chick is being stalked by some killer monster dude and she comes across a room where the lights are out? Everyone sits in their seat and says \`don't go into the room!' but she does anyway .... That is the type of character Mac is. Over and over again. Until the end when she magically turns into a ninja.I know this is the first book in the series so there was a lot of character and world building going on in this book to set up the series, so I will be a little lenient. This book is not a PNR. There was no romance in this book and there is no one in this book to be romantic about. You cannot count the seduction Fae, Vlane, because his type of play is equivalent to date rape. (Theater person yells: Git your clothes on Ethel!)There is something very mysterious about Barrens and we never do discover what that is. He is barely tolerant of Mac, yet she keeps returning to him. Although the end of the book has them sitting all soft and cozy together, he is barely civil to her most of the time and has admitted that he just wants her around for what she can do for him. Yet, here is Mac, starting to get all mushy, feely toward him. (Theater person yells: Get away from him you idiot!)The Narration ReviewThis was the second book I listened to that was narrated by Joyce Bean. The first wasAll The Pretty Girls (Taylor Jackson), by J.T. Ellison. Her narration for this novel was completely different from the crime novel and I wouldn't have realized it was the same narrator.

I think this is just because I am coming off a few books where the lead is a strong and confident female. I know she has been thrown into a world she didn't know about and didn't want to know about but you are knee deep now, buck up! Too many times she would refer to her 'old life' of bartending, fashion magazines, sunbathing, clothes, her long blood hair or her pink nails. She is just very superficial. Even toward the end when she finally kicked ass she thinks about her three broken nails and after she was applying her new coat of nail polish. I hope she is over the little lamb lost act in the next book and has finally accepted what she is and what she needs to do.There is so much to learn about Barrons and I have a feeling I am going to enjoying finding those things out..."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I read this book as it was the selection from my Kindle Shelf post. In the beginning, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it or not. It seemed like a lot was going on and I was getting confused. However, I persevered and I am glad that I did. As the pieces slowly came together, I was intrigued and wanted to keep reading. It was a quick read after that.There are a lot of things that were going on that I don't want to give away, but were the best part of the book. I guess what I can say is that as you read, don't get discouraged with all that is going on. The pieces of the puzzle are not as cleanly put together and so getting through the rough areas can be tough.I did like Patrick and Darina, the main characters. Patrick holds a lot of secrets and some he did not know himself. However, Darina's people also hold a lot of secrets as well, and as these are revealed this is when the story comes alive. The author has created some great characters besides Patrick and Darina, the two young boys grabbed my heart strings.I loved the paranormal action going on. This is what I think the other books are hinged on. This book definitely leaves you hanging. Several things have not been resolved, in fact several avenues are left unfulfilled. I am intrigued enough to want to continue on with the series.What to Read Next?If you enjoyed this but want less confusion, try Julie Garwood's The Secret. Definitely very similar in feel."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Different from what I normally read, but I couldn't put the book down!!!I can't wait to tear through the other ones."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was a bit wary about reading this book because of some of the bad reviews. My disappointment at the short length of the book was mostly because I wasn't ready for the story to end. I really enjoyed it. Many reviewers are complaining about the main character Mac and her less than stellar characteristics. I think that most of them must have forgotten that precarious age of young adulthood that I believe Moning captured very well. Everything about the character makes sense to me. Her lack of ambition is due to the comfortable, loving existence that was so prevalent in her life before her sister's death. What surprised me most about her character was her ability to not succumb to the Faerie Prince V'lane! I am older, hence a little wiser than I was in my early twenties, but not so self-indulgent to forget how I was at that age and Mac embodies many of those characteristics. I am not proud of once being naive or more concerned with my clothes or even my lack of ambition at that age, but perhaps it is because I also come from a loving and comfortable home environment that I can so readily identify with her. I think she is a great character and I am looking forward to her maturing with the guidance of the enigmatic Barrons. My one complaint is that the story could have been longer or the book could have been distributed as a paperback rather than hardcover. But I suspect that complaint resides more with the publisher's decision rather than Ms. Moning. I am looking forward to continued adventures with Mac and Barrons. Despite the limited sexuality that is uncharacteristic of Ms. Moning's earlier work, I give kudos to the author for branching out into the urban paranormal genre that has been previously paved by Kelley Armstrong, LKH, Kim Harrison, Charlaine Harris, et al. I think what is jarring about this character is she has no sense of her own supernatural abilities as you would find in the main characters of those other urban fantasy books. Mac has just begun learning about who she is and what she is able to do and so the reader also has this learning curve to struggle against. Mac reminds me a bit of Stephanie Plum when she rushes into things without thinking them through and again I think that characterizes her youth very well. Overall, I really enjoyed the book and would recommend reading it. I am looking forward to the other installments and like one reviewer said, I hope we don't have to wait to long for it. But since I am not a writer and not governed by a muse or publishers, I suppose I'll wait as long as I must."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Darkfever is a brilliant read, and officially bumped my addiction to Karen Moning's books from acute to terminally ill. I can't get the characters and events of Darkfever out of my head, and it's been a week since I've put the book down. It's taken a mammoth effort to not pick it up again and read it over, and then do the same with her previous books right away. The world that Moning has created blows everything else out of the water with her perfectly concocted world of reality, mythology, and heart-pounding suspense. Everything in her previous novels is incorporated into this series and raises a plethora of new questions--and makes me want to dig deeper and further outside the box. If it takes five or more years to get to the end of the story, so be it. I want quality vs. quantity--and I got my money's worth and so much more.The story provoked a multitude of emotions, especially as we felt firsthand the heartbreak that Mac experienced at the death of her sister and the discovery of who--and what--she is. She is funny and clever, and the way she describes Jericho's reactions to her is priceless. The first person point of view added so much to the story, as the descriptions were written so that I could put myself in Mac's place and actually see them happen. There is so much mystery in the story that having it told from Mac's perspective only adds to it--and leaves me needing more!!!And the million dollar question: what exactly is Jericho? I so can't wait to find that out! I've never met such an enigmatically intriguing character, and I must have more. He just out of reach at this time, but he's gradually warming up and I just know I'm going to need a box of Kleenex nearby when Mac tears down the barriers he's erected. As the story progresses, we get little glimpses of him that warm the heart.Their Happily Ever After will be one that I will be sticking around for."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I tend to agree with many of the negative reviews that I've seen for this book. A girlfriend of mine, and long-time member of my book club, recommended the Fever series to me and compared it to Twilight (a series that we both enjoyed). Although I don't think that the Twilight books are particularly well written, I found the story to be engaging and I enjoyed the character development. Other than the fact that there is a supernatural element in both series, I don't find any other parallels. The characters in Darkfever are undeveloped and not particularly likable, I don't care for the fact that the book ends abruptly (though I was forewarned by other reviews so I expected it), and certain elements of the story - the death-by-sex Fae and the uncomfortable scenes that arise from the main female protagonist's encounters with him being at the top of my list - feel forced and just plain bizarre. All of that being said, the book was a fast read and I think that the overall concept for the book is interesting so I am giving it two stars. While I bought a used copy of this first book off of Amazon, I will be getting the rest of my copies from the library and giving my copy of Darkfever away. If you are thinking about checking this out for some light reading - though the themes are certainly not light - I would recommend that you also venture out to your local library.Update: As I mentioned in my initial review, I checked out the remaining books in the Fever series from the library and I'm pleased to say that I really enjoyed books 2, 3, and 4 (and am looking forward to the final book later this year). They still have cliffhanger endings (though more artfully executed than in the first book), I did tire of reading our heroine's cutesy curse words, and the sexual element can be over the top, but the characters were much better developed and more likable - or more interesting at least. Although I'm leaving my rating of this book at just two stars, I would recommend that you read it anyway because the subsequent books in the series are worth your time if you enjoy the fantasy genre."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Darkfever is a tantalizing introduction to a seamy underworld centered in Dublin, Ireland. Mackayla Lane, a 22-year old Southern Belle, goes to Dublin to try to find answers about Alina's (her older sister) murder. She is sucked into the Fae world, just as Alina was. Mac seems to be somewhat more fortunate than Alina in that she has attracted two very powerful allies, V'Lane (a Seelie Prince) and Jericho Z. Barrons (a ???). Mac is shallow and blissfully ignorant, but she is quickly (and rudely) awakened to the danger the world is in.Despite the author's beginnings as a romance novelist, this is NOT a romance. This is a gritty fantasy fiction with a bit of lust thrown in.Darkfever is the first installment of the Fever saga. I have now read the first three, and I regret doing so before all five installments have been published. There is one storyline. It's a huge saga, of that there is no doubt. But, it is one story, despite being serialized. (Think of your favorite long book, then imagine it being chopped into five parts, each sold separately, a year or so apart. Yeah.)I had written a similar caution in my review for Faefever, but realized that potential readers should be forewarned before even starting the series. As much as I am enjoying the series, I doubt it will end up being worth the nearly $100 I will have paid for it.So, my recommendation to potential readers is to wait until all five books have been released, then borrow them from your local public library. At that point, decide for yourself if this saga is worth buying."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"MacKayla Lane is a bright, colorful, and overall happy girl.Her sister is murdered in Ireland, the only clue left to her is a strange message on her cellphone, the same cellphone she had dropped in the pool. Mac feels guilty that she had missed her sister's last call she'd ever make.She decides to go to Ireland to avenge her sister and to find out answers. What Mac finds in Ireland is that she sees things she has never seen before, monsters who prey on human flesh and more. Mac is thrown outside of her pretty world into a horrid one where she has to be constantly on guard in order to survive. Mac meets Jericho Barrons, a man who seems to be looking for the same thing she is; a book called the Sinsar Dubh. Mac is on a mission and she has to win.Dark Fever will keep you up all night reading.You feel like you are on the adventure wth Mac everystep of the way.Moning does a great job with the Fever series, the novels aren't all about sex and romance. If anything they are more about mystery and adventure. She blends in so many good aspects to make a good story.How scary would it be to be in Mac's place? Your sister dies in Ireland and all of a sudden you can see monsters all around you? Wow.I'd have to say Mac is a strong character.She changes a lot in the book, necessary developments,and Moning does excellant work in bringing this about. The books are not confusing and everything happens in chronological order.Dark fever left me waiting desperately for Blood Fever to come out. I HAD to know what happens to Mac. Moning is an author you want see good things from for the rest of your life. Her books leave you wanting more and more! I want to cry everytime I get to the last chapter because I dont want the book to end because its that good."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I found this book to be an ok read. I found Mac the main character to annoying and shallow, way to obsessed with her appearance. The detailed descriptions of Mac clothes and appearance were way over done. When I read a book I really don't care if a character's outfit matches her pink manicure and pedicure. Maybe in the next books the author won't be as descriptive. I don't find the main characters likable and the story dragged. But I did finish it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I didn't order this book when it first came out because the reviews from reviewers like me did not sound good. But last week I found this book at a sale for 2 bucks and bought it. Was I wrong to listen to the first reviewers? Yes! Yes! Yes! This is an awesome start to a wonderful series. There is very little romance in the first two books so maybe that is why the reviewers were abit hard on the novel. However, I love it.Mackayla Lane is searching for her sister, who has disappeared. The last message she got was very confusing and she knows something terrible happened. When her sister's body was found it was terribly ripped and torn. Traveling to Ireland against her parents wishes she follows in her sister's footsteps and discovers that she is one of a unique few people who can see the fae. She meets a mysterious man in a book shop and from there she falls deeper and deeper into the mystery of the Fae.Jericho Barrens owns the book store but he is much more than a shop keeper. Mac can't figure him out and she is leery of him for more than one reason. He seems to know alot about what is going on and somehow she knows he is involved deeply in the mystery.Togather they are searching for Fae artifacts, Mac has the power to recognize anything made by the Fae. The Fae are dangerous and deadly, only with the help of a man she hardly trusts can Mac find her way around and try to discover what happened to her sister.I loved it and bought BLOODFEVER right away, the next one FAEFEVER comes out in September. Do not miss this series. It is outstanding in the genre."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is a fun book. No, it's not a romance. No, it's not a \\"young adult\\" book. It's a book about a young adult coming to terms with life in a chaotic and challenging situation. Which makes it a *story.* Duh. In any case, I don't know why people whine about what other people write.I liked that the lead character was a 20-something Georgia peach -- clueless, aimless, and fearless because she didn't know any better. It made the juxtoposition of the dark characters that much more interesting.I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"If you are a fan of Ms. Moning's books because of the Celtic mysticism, you will love this book. If, however, you are looking for a sizzling romance, you may be disappointed. This book is different from previous books in Ms. Moning's immortal highlander series in that it is written in the first person. The story, a murder mystery, unfolds as seen through the eyes of the victim's sister. Some of the Fae concepts introduced in Ms. Moning's previous books are seen here together with an abundance of new dark Fae characters and concepts. After finishing this book I found myself looking over my shoulder when out jogging alone at night."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I can hardly wait for the next book. I have so many questions, but I know Karen Moning will come through with all the answers. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves Karen Moning writings. This book was not like her other books, but I already knew it would be a little different. I still enjoyed the story line."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I've been trying to find a better author then Laurell K. Hamilton's fairy series. I have found it! Karen has created characters that I feel emotions to and none of them on this book have sex on every other page. She has a wonderful plot and characters with different views. This series has a mixture of mystery, fantasy, and a little bit of romance. I'm sure there will be more later in these books. If you adore later novels of Laurell K. Hamilton, you may not enjoy this book. The only bad thing I found about Darkfever is the fact that it's 1 of 5 books, I believe, and the ending to this book was very abrupt. I do plan on reading the next one and hope you find her as entertaing as I did."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was really nervous about gettingt this book. The reviews were very mixed. Some loved it others hated it. Me I read romance period (historical, suspense, modern. Everyone from J.E. (Stephanie Plum) to Johanna Lindsey, Mary Balough, Christine Skye, Kay Hooper, Linda Howard etc and more recently C. Feehan(the mutant stuff only). I usually dont get into the really weird stuff such as vampires. A little paranormal is fine.Two weeks ago I stumbled onto K. Moning at the library. I quickly reserved all the books of hers they had. Her books can be read alone, in order or whatever. They are wonderful. They do reference other books but you can get it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I am a Major Moning FAN. I have every book & story she ever wrote and read them all more than I want to admit. What Happened??? First, I feel taken advantage of - HardBack, Big Bucks and a major disappointment in the story.The kindest thing I have to write (in frustration but still hoping for better) is that maybe her romance & marriage dulled her edge a bit for just this book? Had it been a paperback I would feel less used. I do not have lots of disposable income for hardbacks. Frankly, I am very wary to shell out for another hardback.The elements of her style are there, they remain undeveloped, the reader unfulfilled. In truth, there is an edge you want to glide along and then a repetitive \\"chase scene\\" mentality frustrates the reader. How many times are we sneaking off somewhere to see the critters? Too many not-quite-developed scenarios. Way too much time on Unseelie descriptions. The action is slow, it insults the reader - there was not a move by any character that I did not anticipate. That is not characteristic of Moning. The characters' interactions are stilted, they do not mesh, yet I do want to learn more about them, assuming they will - her characters always have before. It should have happened in THIS book! And I am not buying five hardbacks to have something fleshed out for me. Each book, at this price should stand alone and make you wait breathlessly for the next and the next.... The paperbacks did!Why, with so much to criticize do I still have hope? Because there are several elements from several of her former books showing up in this one that are probably going to be fun when pulled together. (HINT: Tua De Sword) And this is the only Moning book out of many that had no ZIP and almost no substance - so the zip and substance have got to be in the next four.My advice: Skip this one, check out the next one before you buy, but I think in the long run she'll be Back!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I purchased this book because I have enjoyed reading this author. I was terribly disappointed in Darkfever. First it moved so slowly with little action and pages of boring exposition. It lacked romance and even the attempt at the beginnings of lust were flat. I found myself scanning the pages hoping for something better. When the book ended without resolving even one mystery, I was horrified. What a waste of my time. Also what a shameless ploy to sell books. If I want to know more I can by the next book which happens to be a more expensive hardcover. I can tell you I am not pre-ordering that volume. Also in reading the author's question and answer section I see that the story of Mac won't end in the next book. I have no problem with a continuing character. In fact I like it but each book must have some resolution or the buyer must be warned that this is only part one of a continuing story not book one of a continuing series. If I could I would be asking for my money back"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I love to get \\"get lost\\" in Karen Monings' stories. I was very disappointed in this latest book written in the first person which for me was boring and caused me to dislike Mac.....ALOT. Then there's the very misleading cover illustration considering there is nothing romantic here at all. The way it ended ticked me off ....making you want to run out and purchase the next in the series. The word \\"greed\\" POPS up boldly in my mind !!!! Hugely disappointedSheila Anne"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book was neither thrilling nor romantic in any way. \\"Ms. Lane\\" is a bubble headed annoying protagonist and I prayed for her demise many times. I can only hope that the plethora of foreshadowing in this opening series will eventually lead to something, but alas, I will not be reading another Fever book to find out. I feel the $1.99 I paid was $2.00 too much. I generally devour 300 pages in less than a day, but I choked on this book for 3 days, hoping something good would come of it. The writing is so superficial and terribly redundant. My husband asked while I was reading if it was a roller coaster & I told him it wasn't even a merry-go-round. Bottom line...skip it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"A wonderful series of books and storytellers filled with fantasies.However, the lead character, Mac, is without doubt the most irritatingand insulting of any character in any fiction.

However, if a story line is going to continue with cliff hangers at the end of each of the books, there should be a warning in bold print on the front page about the ongoing story line!!! Five books before we receive the answers to questions asked in the first book is ridiculous!!! I have quit reading other authors who tried this tact to get their books sold. I hate to think I will have to give up Ms. Moning, but I will if this is how she plans to write in the future."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"So I have actually been listening to this as a podcast, which I am entirely grateful for, because truthfully it's just not a story worth paying for. If you're interested, check it out at the library. Whatever you do don't buy the audiobook! The reader is the same in both the audiobook and the podcast, and while she does well coming across as a an empty headed teen girl, she sounds like Sm&eacute;agol (from lord of the rings) when she's attempting male voices."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book was fantastic I read this book In one day that Is to tell you It was good.Who In their right mind don't love this book,sorry to say this but something Is wrong with them.It was well written you did not have to go back In the book to explain anything for you It was all there plain for your understanding that Is why I give this book a five star rate."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"It took me pretty much an afternoon to read this book. I must say it is much better than the last two books by this author and I am happy that its not the same old boring time travel oversexed formula we expected.The story is interesting, but also very short and I can agree with some of the other reveiwers - I hate the cliffhanger at the end and at $13 a pop, I feel somewhat cheated.I was not impressed by Mac, the whole blonde, beautiful, innocent thing I didn't really buy. I liked the character of Barrons loved the whole \\"fae\\" world/underworld, so it made the reading bearable.I'm not so sure I will purchase the next chapter in Mac's story but I would like to see what happens next."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"One of the things I really look forward to is the arrival of a new KMM novel. But, I am afraid I have to agree with some of the reviewers that this one is a stinker. KMM writes some of the best heroes in the business and Jericho was one but he had no romance!! Nothing for him to do!!! Mac was sort of iffy for me. She was okay but I really wish this had been a straight romance. The only romance in it was Mac and the lusty fairy. I didn't like that. You have someone like Jericho Barrons around and nothing for him?I didn't like this book--I borrowed it from the library. This is the first KMM book that I didn't buy and put on my keeper shelf. Until she goes back to her basics, I will be visiting the library when she has something new out. And I won't hurry.BTW, the cover was a stinker,too."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I totally hated the main charactor- MacKayla....her arrogance was only superceded by her stupidity!!! She goes to a strange country, totally ignores warnings; is rude and so busy 'cracking wise' she invariably gets innocent people hurt and killed!! This could have been a good book if the writer were not so intent in trying to write like Laurell K. Hamilton! I read both the 1st and 2nd book (unfortunately I had purchased them at the same time) and they just left me more upset with the heroine than ever...I won't bother to read the 3rd book as frankly, I don't care what happens to her! I hope Barrons sees the light and lets her just die! what a waste of time! Oh and Mac ~ Barrons is a vampire for goodness sake, couldn't you figure that out already? Anyone want to buy my copies? $5.00 a piece! Still new with perfect dust covers!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Gosh, it just seems like im destined to be the cynical reviewer in all things paranormal. Anyway lets get to the gist of it.Problem number one: The characters in this book are sooo bad. Seriously. The heroine is this southern girl who just loves to wear pink and have matching nail polish and who is so whiney and self-absorbed, that i really just wanted to throw the book down and give up after the firt 100 page of it. For thoes of you who hated the Dependent-Bella as much as i did, don't pick this book up. (also the damn discription of her clothes goes on forever. Who cares! Get on with the story already)Problem number two: Unoriginal. How many times am i going to have to read about characters going completley stubid and acting like damn mating animals in heat?Problem number three: The plot (mixed with the horrible cast of characters) is is simply at a stand still for most of the book. The plot is (i think) centered on the heroine traveling to Ierland to solve the murder of her sister (another terrible character) with absoluley no experience what so ever. Oh, before i forget they both discover there something more than just some simple human while they're there. Do i even need to say how bored i am with that happening in paranormal?For your own sake, if you do decide to read this book against my judgement, don't buy it.You'll only want your money back."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Great book. I have read all her series. I can't wait for her next book"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Sexy covers, great copy, but it's the inside that's lacking. While some of Moning's alpha males are worthy of the page, for some reason this writeris either incapable of, or unwilling to write an intelligent heroine - the current heroine, MacKayla, is a study in stupidity with her \\"barbie doll\\" looks who is forever mesmerized by her nail polish, hair, pop language, etc. The first Moning novel I read \\"Kiss of the Highlander\\", Gwen, the heroine, was the same type of female character as in Darkfever, and least you don't believe me, I quote:\\"Gwen peered at Bert through her Jennifer Aniston fringed bangs, expensively beveled to attract her own Brad Pitt\\".\\"Perhaps before quiting (cigarettes) she should have waited until she'd found her cherry picker, she mused\\". (Numerous mentions of \\"her cherry picker\\" when she looks at Drustan - the character is a virgin)\\".\\"After discovering she couldn't check into her room at the inn until after four o'clock, and firm in her resolve to not march into the nearest shop and buy a pack of what's that word-she-wasn't-saying-anymore.....\\" (cigarettes)\\".\\"Gwen stared: \\"There's no way that's part of you. You must have gotten a sock or ..something.....stuck. (she's looking at Drustan's nether regions while he tries on jeans)\\".Later Moning insults us again when we discover Gwen's actually a respected \\"scientist\\"! Now, no one likes to put someone down, but if you can believe that, you can believe anything. If Moning can write good alpha males, what happens with the women?Here's some of my favorite recommendations for good reading - some better than others, but usually all a good read.*****Judith Mc Naught's - \\"A Kingdom of Dreams\\" -While it's a bit overwritten, and would have been better if edited down somewhat, there's something about Royce Westmoreland that gets under your skin in the same way the character Maximus (Russell Crow) did in \\"The Gladiator\\". He's smart, savvy, a feared warrior, but also one with honor, integrity, gentleness, humor, and a conscience. Of all the books listed here and the many I've read that aren't, \\"A Kingdom of Dreams\\" remains one of my favorites.Keep in mind, reading \\"A Kingdom of Dreams\\", Mary Stewart's books, and Elizabeth Vaughan's \\"Warprize\\", \\"Warsworn\\", and \\"Warlord\\" are some of the best and spoils you for some of the others listed.*****Mary Stewart's fine, fine, Arthurian Books - \\"The Crystal Cave\\" - \\"The Hollow Hills\\" - \\"The Last Enchantment\\" - \\"The Wicked Day\\" -*****Elizabeth Vaughan's \\"Warprize\\", \\"Warsworn\\", and \\"Warlord\\" -Tina St. John's - \\"Lady of Valor\\" - Heart of the Flame\\" -Kresley Cole's MacCarrick Trilogy -Strong Alpha Males:\\"If You Dare\\" - \\"If You Desire\\" - \\"If You Deceive\\" -Susan Carroll's well-written \\"Dark Queen Trilogy\\": - book 1 -\\"The Dark Queen\\" - book 2 \\"The Courtesan\\" and book 3 \\"The Silver Rose\\" -Monica McCarty's - Highlander Untamed - Highlander Unmasked -Betina Krahn's - \\"The Princess & The Barbarian\\" - \\"The Husband Test\\" -Jen Holling's - \\"My Wicked Highlander\\"-Karyn Monk's - \\"Once a Warrior\\" - \\"The Rose and the Warrior\\"Julie Garwood's - \\"The Prize\\" - \\"The Bride\\" - \\"Ransom\\" - \\"The Secret\\" -Sara Bennett's - \\"The Lily and The Sword\\" -For Viking Warriors check out - Josie Litton's:\\"Dream of Me\\" - \\"Believe in Me\\" - \\"Come Back to Me\\" -Amanda Scott's - \\"Highland Princess\\" -Arnette Lamb's - \\"The Chieftain\\" - \\"Highland Rouge\\"Hannah Howell's - \\"Highland Bride\\" -Jen Holling's - \\"My Wicked Highlander\\" - \\"My Devilish Scotsman\\" -Karen Monk's - \\"Once a Warrior\\" - \\"The Witch & The Warrior\\" -Madeline Hunter's - \\"By Possession\\" -Margaret Moore's - \\"The Unwilling Bride\\" - \\"Lord of Dunkeathe\\" -\\"The Overlords Bride\\" -Marsha Canham's - \\"The Pride of Lions\\" -Mary Reed McCall's -\\"The Maiden Warrior\\" - \\"Secret Vows\\"-Penelope Williamson's - \\"Keeper of the Dream\\" -Rebecca Hagan Lee's - \\"A Hint of Heather\\" -Shelly Thacker's - \\"His Forbidden Touch\\" -Shana Abe's - \\"Intimate Enemies\\" -Sophia Johnson - \\"Risk Everything\\" -Tamara Leigh's - \\"Blackheart\\" -Philippa Gregory - \\"The Other Boelyn Girl\\" - Historical TudorsOn my \\"Authors to Avoid\\" List:Karen Marie Moning - Connie Mason - Sue Ellen Welfonder - Johanna Lindsey - Dawn Thompson - Teresa Mederios - Sabrina Jeffries - Tanya Anne Crosby - Mercedes Lackey.-"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Let's be honest, Dark Fever was not what I expected. Where's the romance? What happened to two people falling in love and enjoying meaningful lust in the midst of a little conflict. Dark Fever was filled with lust with out any emotional ties. To me lust without romance is simply porn. I was really disapponted. In fact,it reminded me of the time the powers that be decided to change coke into new coke. If the rest of the series is anything like the first - I'll pass. I think I'll just console myself with the well read highlander series and wait until Karen decides to pull out her original formula again. What a royal let down!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"While I enjoyed the book, I kept waiting for the romance to start and even though you can see the possibilities it never happened. This is nothing like her other books. That is not a bad thing, but if you buy this as I did expecting the same type of story line you will be confused as I.I am glad Ms. Moning cleared this up in her note to readers above. I am not sure I will continue only because I can't stand to be left hanging after every book, and that is what it sounds like will happen. If that won't bother you I am sure you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Just finished the first book in this series, as it was a free offering. I've been very pleased with new authors before (Timothy Hallinan's series) and not so pleased with others. I enjoy campy, quirky writing style at times, what I call \\"mind candy\\", such as Laurel K. Hamilton's series (at least the first nine or so) and am not a snob about literature as some can be. But I truly was astounded at how many very high marks this book gets, along with the moniker \\"#1 Bestselling Author...\\" on various publishing lists! It's style reminds me of a high school creative writing assignment that had to be finished in two days, with inconsistent characters (Barrons often uses Mac's own speaking style), overused phrases (\\"pretty this, pretty that\\") and unconvincing plot points. I love to lose myself in books, regardless of the content, and I only found myself chastising the immature phrasings. There are moments of intrigue that start to hold, such as the search for the O'Bannion's home in the sewers, but then it dissolves into prattle. For the fans of the series, forgive me, this is my own opinion, but I just don't see what all the fuss is about this pretty little series!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I haven't read romance novels since I was a teenager, when my grandmother lent me a mystery collection that included the gothic romances of Victoria Holt. That said, I am guessing that the dark, dangerous, enigmatic man whom the heroine fears but who is really in love with her is a romance novel convention. Ditto for the occasionally explicit sexual reactions of the heroine. None of it kept me from enjoying the dark fantasy elements of the story, which is set in Dublin, a city I had visited just a few weeks before reading Darkfever. I finished the novel in a few sittings. It was pleasant entertainment of the cotton-candy variety."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Karen Marie Moning's books has NEVER failed me before, but NOW it has!The first person plott leaves you guessing what the heck is going on & what everyone else is thinking. Mac is awfully chatty, not neccessarily a bad thing, but in this case, distracting & off subject at times. The sex scenes are all about lust with no romance, making them cheap & distastefull.I ordered this book presale, w/o really knowing what the plott was & now I wished I had waited till I could have gotten it from a used book store.I normally don't read first person but it was JMM book(need I say more). My opinion dramatically changed after reading this book. There is not much romance to it & the ending left me pretty dissatisfied. Not dissaisfied as in I going to buy the next book to find out what the heck is going on but dissatisfied as in I am pissed at how this plott is going & probably won't buy one of her books new - either going to the library or used book store.Nora Roberts usually have her series within a month apart & KMM's books has a history of taking a while to produce so not only do we lose the feel of the story but also the interest. My advice, buy one of her older books (preferably 'Spell of a Highlander') if you haven't read it already. I guess you could be brave & read the next in series but I wouldn't recommend it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have to agree with many of the other reviewers on the character (or lack thereof) of the 'heroine', Mac.This book is a stream-of-consciousness rambling for the Twitter generation. Every vapid thought this girl has comes swarming onto the page, often more than once. I also agree with the reviewer who said Mac encompasses the worst of Bella and Sookie. Despite Sookie's endless self-absorption and the irrelevant \\"what I am wearing today\\", I do enjoy the Stackhouse books for a fast, fun, fantasy read. I managed the first 2 Twilights before giving up on Bella as a mindless idiot with no self-will (although at least she did not endlessly describe her outfits and how gorgeous she was). But Mac! Mac is the shallowest, most irritating protagonist ever and I do hope, really do hope, that she does NOT become the role model for any young girl.I got about a third of the way through and gave up on this with a sigh of relief. I only stuck it out that long because the concept seemed interesting and I hoped it would better. It didn't.Despite some one-star reviewers saying they liked the Highlander series, based on this awful effort I am not inclined to try any more of Ms Moning's other books."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I really enjoyed the book, really I did!

Just my humble opinion."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I loved this start to a new way of looking at Ms. Moning's universe. Personally, I like it when we get to know a character over a longer period AND when all the loose ends aren't tied up into a \\"happily ever after\\" in 350 pages. The book had mystery without answers obviously staring you in the face. Her best work so far! I look forward to the next installment."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Having read all 5 books of this series, which I now regret even though I got them all from the library, I will save anyone in the future from wasting their time. Don't read this series. She will drag you through 5 books of repetitive drivel that leads no where. The first two books are interesting enough to get you hooked and then the last three just ramble around in circles. She throws in a shocking gang rape and then continue to bring it up as if it was supposed to be some kind of character building experience for the main character. By the ending you will see there was no reason to even have it in the book and it was that point that changed the story's credibility and went downhill from there. That alone is a good enough reason not to read these books, but the rest of the storyline is all over the map and never comes together nor does it build to any finale. Boredom will set in after book two, and you will wonder why you are bothering to continue. By the end of the series, you will be so bored you just don't care anymore, which will come in handy since the ending doesn't end or resolve anything. The main character in the book is no hero and she is just as whiney and clueless at the end as she is at the beginning.There are plenty of decent authors out there that can write books that are worth reading. This author isn't one of them. I will never waste my time on her again."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is well written, but an absolutely miserable series.

The authors style of writing and turns of phrase and very readable. I really liked the way she worded some of her descriptions as well. And her Mythos was awesome and thought out. However, I have to wonder if it would have been a better story if Mac had died and Alina were in her place. *sigh* I'm not a pink fan as it is, but I dislike it even more after having read this. and how many times a day can one paint their nails? And, uh, you're going 4000 miles from home and you're packing HOW many polishes? Seriously, I found her so annoying I was hoping Barrons would just snap her neck and be done with it. Had SOMETHING been tied up I probably wouldn't have found the cliffhanger so annoying but as it was nothing was made very clear so I was left feeling cold. I probably won't be picking up any of the rest of the series unless I catch it at a very bargain price."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I read this book, but had to struggle through it. I agree with another reviewer - how dumb can a heroine be. Come on - no one is that clueless except in the movies. It makes one wonder what the author really thinks about women - obviously not much. The heroine is stupid, careless, and an idiot, and I don't believe anyone would really act the way she did. I was really disappointed in this latest book, and I don't think I'm going to read any more of the series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend, I picked it up expecting a great mystery/romance story. Once I started reading I was annoyed with the main character immediately with her love for pink-everything was pink. Once they introduced Barrons-who I am expecting at some point to be her love interest-I was hoping the story would get better, but it didn't. He refers to her as Ms. Lane (her last name) every other sentence, after a while he started to annoy me as well. I will read the next book in hopes of seeing why so many people love this series. I just wasn't impressed with the first book, I hope my view of this series changes because I really did want to like it. I gave it 3 stars because it wasn't terrible and I was able get through the book and didn't just put it down without getting to the ending."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Despite my aversion to reading Urban Fantasy and first person narrative, I love stories rooted in druid and faerie legend so out of deference to Karen M. Moning's outstanding Highlanders series when I saw a copy of Dark Fever on the free shelf at the library, I decided to give the author's Fever series a try.Moning's plot premise of fae magic is intriguing; however, her female protagonist is anything but. I was far more intrigued by the enigmatic Jerricho Barrons and the mysterious fae, V'lane. Terry Brooks' Shannara series is far superior fantasy series of druid/mystical world-building and storytelling.The motivation behind stretching this thin story into five books and hawking Fever trinkets on the author's web page is to market these books as a potential script treatment. Mac certainly comes across as a dense, self-centered Buffy/Sookie Stackhouse-esque character who is simply bestowed with super powers.So far, I feel compelled to finish reading this the series since it is incomplete but I have no desire to invest in the books. I only read subsequent books when they are available at library and feel no compulsion to write a review for Faefever, Bloodfever, or Dreamfever, inasmuch as narrator and protagonist Mac shows very little promise of growth or maturity and the storyline only grows darker.I just hope that Mac doesn't end up with Christian...this D-student and southern hick has no place among the intelligent, witty, educated MacKeltar women."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I like this series - really, I do. I like Ms. Moning's writing style, I like the heroine, the mysterious Jericho, the story itself. But I cannot stand this \\"series\\" format. There is no real ending to any of the books - the \\"endings\\" are more akin to the close of a chapter. What a letdown. I started reading the first book knowing it was a series and I was fine with it, looked forward to it actually. I hate saying goodbye to characters I've grown fond of at the end of books. My first \\"series\\" was the Twilight series and from there, I read the Southern Vampire series (Charlaine Harris), the Mercy Thompson series and the Alpha/Omega books (Patricia Briggs). The books in each of those series actually end. A complete story is finished. Not so with this Fever series. The books don't end, they barely pause. I think this story - that now spands 4 books - should not have been piecemealed out to us the way it has been. I see no reason why it shouldn't have been in one publication. (Can you imagine breaking up Stephen King's The Stand into 5 books?) I've gone on with the series, despite my dislike of the \\"series\\" approach, because I really do like the story and the characters, and I do enjoy Ms. Moning's writing style. But I dont know that I'll buy any more of her \\"series\\" books. Too frustrating."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I really liked the plot of this book, but I could only give it three stars because the main female character just a little too \\"whiny\\"."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Gosh - so I go into this series thinking it is a continuation of the Highlander series (as I was told on the Amazon blog) and I disappointed. I read this first book, and nothing was resolved, I read the back of the second book and realized nothing was resolved then, I read the back of the 3rd book, and alas.....still nothing resolved. I agree with a very early review that this series shouldn't be read until the series is over. I equate this series of books to Lynn Kurland's recent series or maybe a push to put herself (Karen) in the avenue of Diana Gabladon.Regardless, it's highly unlikely I'll continue the series.

It seems to me there was barely time to develop any characters before the book waived goodbye until next time.So this story goes on for 4 more books? If they're all this lenght they could easily be combined into 2 or 3 books and we would have something substantial to read. I read this on a 3 hour plane ride, and I'm a slow reader.

Please, Karen, consider combining these and give us a BOOK and not a teaser."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"As a LONG time romance reader, I've found myself a bit bored with the lack of quality books out there. I have a few long time favorite authors, including Karen Marie Moning, that hold my interest and keep me coming back for more.Most fans of Ms. Moning's work knew going into Darkfever that it was not a traditional romance novel (thank God). It's the first part of a series. It lays groundwork and introduces characters for what I'm sure will be an incredible love story.A previous reviewer implied it was nothing more than glorified pornography. I'd like to invite that person to look up the word pornography in the dictionary.pornography (pr-ngr-f)n.Sexually explicit pictures, writing, or other material whose primary purpose is to cause sexual arousal.I'm fairly certain Ms. Moning did not spend months, if not years, researching the thoughts, ideas and places of this novel just so people could get their jollies from two people having sex. While her novels to usually include well written, erotic love scenes between people who love each other, this book had no place for that.I hope eveyone will give this book a chance and read it for what it is... the first part of a story that promises to keep us on he edge of our seats, unable to be put down, until we finally reach the end, in which case, some of us will start right back at the beginning and read it again."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"WOW - I'm so absolutely excited for this new series! Do you ever simply devour a GREAT book and then sit back and wish the book were longer, because you cannot believe you've reached the end of such an amazing adventure?Well , I think Ms. Moning is going to give us just THAT with her new series - a chance to prolong the magic and the excitement of discovering a new world, amazing characters and their adventures. If you're a book nut like me, you'll probably develop a love-hate relationship with this series, between loving the fact that there's more to look forward to and hating the wait for the next installment. (remember The Lord of the Rings? Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series? Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series? even the Harry Potter books?)DARKFEVER is the beginning of the tales of the Unseelie Fae, whereas Moning's Highlander books explored the Seelie Fae. Much Darker and gritty in nature, this adventure begins with a happy and naiive young woman's world shattering into a thousand pieces by the mysterious murder of her sister. Caught between her desire to discover what happened to her sister and her own coming-out (from a sheltered and happy world), everything, as Mac knew it, is about to be turned upside down...In her quest to learn about her sisters death, Mac discovers things several lifetimes couldn't have prepared her for. Logic and normalcy become and alternate reality, as she gradually pieces together a world that very much EXISTS parallel to the one she grew up in. It is in this new world, that she meets Jericho Barrons. Jericho is a mysterious character who at first glance appears helpful, but getting to know him and learning more about exactly who/what he is, sets Mac on her path of acquiring street-smarts in the world of Fae...I devoured it fast, and simply had to go back and savor each and every detail, that I know I will want to know and remember for the unforlding of this saga!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was so looking forward to this and had to wait on it from the library for 2 months. What a disappointment. DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS BOOK! It's shameful an author would publish a work such as this for loyal fans and not feel massive guilt. There was NO romance, NO climax, NO resolution, NO satifying ending. I agree to what another reviewer said: Wait until all 5 books are published and read them back-to-back as one book. Individually, at least this first book, was more like one long chapter. What a let down. Shame, Shame, Shame."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I love karen Moning books, however I did not know it was going to be told in the first person and not even having my favorite, previous characters, was not enough to warrant the purchase of the fourth book. I do not like clift hangers, especially when it takes so long for the next book to hit the shelves. Nothing really makes any sense and I am familar with the fey realm. This series was borrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring and a waste of hard covers prices. It should have been free from the onset. Take a tip from other series writers. They give some closure but you know there is more to come without frustration."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"To add to what others have said, the story concept is intriguing, but the heroine, Mac, is not. Mac is a twenty-something, but a mental and emotional pre-teen. Starting as a mystery, the story quickly evolves into a horror fest with erotic twists. Mac goes to Ireland to push the investigation surrounding her sister's death, since it seems to have burned out. Then, like Alice, she falls down the rabbit hole by taking a wrong turn in Dublin to enter an underworld where a battle between evil and not-so-evil? is taking place. She discovers she has special powers, can not figure out who the good and bad guys really are, and, as others have said enters a strained relationship with Barrons, some kind of dark prince. There is a lot of ambiguity in the story and characters, with no clear ending. Mac does seem to mature a bit toward the end, thank God, or I would have had to stop reading the book. Overall, the novelty of the story and descriptions of fae kept me interested to finish the book and even read the follow up story, where hopefully our heroine will act her age."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have read good and bad reveiws on this book and was a little scared to buy it. However, I love Monings work so much I knew it was a necessity! I loved it, really I did! I read it in one sitting and now I can't wait for the next one. I think the next books will only be better. I found this book to be much more visual than her others and while no, this isn't like the Highlander novels, it's just as good in a different way. I like the characters in this book and can't wait to know more about Jerico although I have an idea about him. I am in my late 20's so Mac didn't seem like a complete child to me like others have said. She has just been sheltered and as a Southerner myself she is understandable. I look forward to seeing Mac have love in her life. She deserves tenderness and I hope Jerico is the one to give it to her...."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Darkfever is an awesome new direction for KMM,while still retaining the quality feel of her older novels.Read the plog Karen did and the blurb for what the book's about,and THEN say you were disappointed that it wasn't her \\"style\\",or a \\"traditional\\" romance novel.It IS different,and that's what makes it such a great book,such a wonderful start to this new series.I've seen Mac bashed pretty hard,and while I do admit she got on my nerves a little in the beginning,the Mac at the end of DF is definitely a more mature woman.I don't think some people are giving her a chance,considering the circumstances which brought her to Ireland to begin with,not to mention the crazy situations she finds herself in.People have complained that she is not a \\"normal\\" KMM heroine.I disagree;in fact,I think she may just be the MOST \\"normal\\" out of all KMM's heroines,in that she is a live-at-home student,with a loving family and she isn't really sure what she wants to do with her life yet.Certainly,young women like this do exist all over the world.They are happy-go-lucky and carefree because they CAN be,and reality intrudes on Mac soon enough.She has enough intelligence to answer her wake-up call,and with a firm voice.Throughout the book you can see her changing mentally,and I liked her more and more as the story progressed.The first person perspective was a must for this story,because it lets you into Mac's head in a way third-person would never be able to match.Anger,fear,suspicion,lust,regret and hope are just some of the things you will feel as Mac struggles to find answers,not only from Barrons and the city of Dublin,but from herself as well.Jericho Barrons is an interesting,mysterious character,and he's not the only one;Karen treats us to MUCH more of the Fae world,and anyone who has ever wished for a closer look at the Seelie and Unseelie will relish thisbook.You get not only the lethally sexy V'lane,but creatures that make the Boogeyman look like your best bud.I would like nothing better than to see an all-out war between the Seelie and Unseelie,and it looks like it's coming.Karen feeds your imagination a buffet with DARKFEVER,and although we may have to wait for dessert,I am sure it will be delicious and well worth it!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I could not put this book down & I was hooked from page one! Karen Moning has come up with an addicting new series and I simply cannot wait to read the rest of the installments. I love MacKayla, and far from thinking her character as \\"lazy and self absorbed\\", I found her to be a normal young woman with a vivacious and witty personality trying to find her niche in life when she is suddenly thrust into an unspeakable personal tragedy. She jumps into the mystery and horror of her sister's horrifying death with both feet (albeit yes, with a well done pedicure) and I find her search into this new world she discovers fascinating and compelling and also felt immense sympathy for her character and her plight. I believe Ms. Moning is initially writing Mac as a 22 year old Southern ing&eacute;nue with normal foibles & quirks through a trek into a here-to-fore unknown fantastical world. Mac's personality and character will no doubt grow and mature throughout this series into an exciting and self prepossessing woman who is initially fighting to discover the murderer of her beloved sister and the truth and reason behind her murder and leads her into a fascinating new and dangerous world.I do not want to give away any spoilers, but I am on pins & needles in anticipation for the next book, Bloodfever, and also found the first person writing lent more insight to Mac and was very well done. There are of course so many different genres of writing and I enjoy so many of them and have an open mind to new reading experiences---where I have no doubt romance & the HEA will come in this series, please do not cheat yourself out of a fabulous read because it is not what you might have been expecting. If you are looking for a fascinating and engrossing new series with an entertaining and intriguing plotline with irresistible, engaging, and yes dark, magnetic and mesmerizing characters, well this is your read."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I never read a romance book until KMM's Highlander books, but I was hooked after reading just one. I bought Darkfever with a little hesitation since Ms. Monning stated that it was a departure from her other works.Here I am two days later and I can't wait to read the next installment. While there isn't a sexy romance in this book, there is indeed a love in this book that Karen captured with tendernous and sadness. The love that Mac has for her sister and the emotions associated with losing a loved one are captured and expressed beautifully in this book. Having never lost a sibling, I can't imagine what that loss would be like. I think KMM did an excellent job in describing the feelings and emotions one would go through after losing a sibling. It also helps the reader to understand what motivates or drives a person in the healing process.I'm glad KMM layed down a good foundation for complex characters and she spent time on the relationship that Mac had with her sister. I'm glad she included a glossary in the back with the pronunciation for all of the Fae terminology.

The main character Ms. Mackayla Lane, is a very annoying little prissy girl that I believe dresses in too much pink. But I believe the author wanted us to get that feel for the character because of the constant reference to that color in her wardrobe and accessories made the idea stick. She was also very naive. Which added to her annoying characteristics. The author's depiction of this character gave the reader a visual that made it clear that Miss Pretty in Pink was traveling in unchartered waters with no idea where, what or how she was going to survive. Or who she could trust.The man in black, Mr. Jericho Barrons as the author depicts him has so much swagger that he is oozing with it as he floats through air, crawls through sewers and ravages on unsuspecting victims in the middle of the night. In this part of this 6 part series (make sure it's 6 and not 5) you are to believe that he is need of information and is unable to get it without the aid of this pretty in pink mystery woman who happens to stumble into his bookstore.As she stumbles through a land that isn't even on the map, he is moved by her aura that suggest that she may be just the thing he needs to find the missing piece to the puzzle to stop world domination by the dead.This story has very little romance but a ton of mystery and mythical creatures that can keep the solid sleeper half eyed open.I look forward to book 2 and so forth.

Karen Marie has again created a fully fleshed-out and believable world that is compelling and alluring. Her characters are ones you either love, want, or love to hate.There is danger in this world she has created. Whether it presents itself in the form of a shadow that could literally suck the life out of you, or a death-by-sex-Fae that could enslave you. And there are sure to be even more dangers revealed.There are characters I am chomping at the bit to find out more about! Who is Jericho? WHAT is Jericho?The common thread is that she has again created a world and characters that I CARE about. Mac is a heroine with flaws. She has, up to this point in her young life, been only concerned with herself. It takes a tragedy to get her to look past her own nose. But she is strong, and I absolutely adore her. This road we have begun to walk with Mac is one that I absolutely would not miss!FYI - as for those other things . . . I didn't find the first-person distracting in the slightest. Actually, it was cool to be inside Mac's head. And as for the sex, I didn't miss it. I wished it had been there before I read the book, but after, I realized it'll happen eventually. And oh, boy!

Like why didn't Adam just kill Darroc from \\"THe Immortal Highlander\\" and be done with it? Because he is the villian in the \\"Fever\\" series (Lord Master). Darroc was briefly mentioned in conversation with Lucan in the \\"Spell of the Highlander\\". I can't wait to see Queen Aoibheal bring her other Druids (Drustan, Dageus and Cian) into the story to battle this new threat and hope there is some new ones written in to do battle also. I for one was glad to see no romance between Mac and Jericho Barrons in this first book. There is an attraction but remember, we are not sure what Barrons is exactly yet and with them keeping this on a non-personal matter for now will only make for better romance down the road. Besides who has time for romance when you are busy saving the world? Great Read and can't wait for the next books."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Darkfever is a hugely enjoyable book with an engaging heroine, MacKayla Lane, who recounts the way in which her life changed irrevocably following a telephone call from Dublin to say that her sister had been murdered. Mac, as the narrator, is looking back to events which happened over a year ago so we occasionally are told things that she didn't know at the time as we follow her travelling from her small town in Georgia to Dublin to try and find out more about Alina's death.Mac's investigations seem hopeless and yet she perseveres but her attention is soon taken by some very strange events - an odd woman accosting her, a strange vision of a handsome man turning into an evil monster, and some unusual shadows. When Mac meets Jericho Barrons, rich owner of a bookstore right next to a strangely dark and empty part of the city, she is forced to face up to some unwelcome new truths - that Mac has skills as a Sidhe-seer and that her life is in danger.Mac and Barrons team up in order to search for an ancient book that Alina was pursuing in order to try to defeat the Unseelies who are flooding into Dublin. However Mac is given little information with which to work, Barrons being master of cryptic conversation, and her own mission to find Alina's killer is still important to her.The writing style of this book is excellent with Mac, as narrator, a very amusing character whose take on the world can be great fun, even as she's facing evil and dark things worse than she's ever considered. Her descriptions of some of the Unseelie are very amusing and yet her sense of fear as her world falls apart is also very well written. Although billed as a romance there's almost no romance in this story but it is clearly the beginning of a series and there are some hints as to the romantic direction into which it will go. The only real drawback of this book is that it doesn't reach any kind of a resolution, it just sets the reader on the path of Darkfever's world and makes the next book obligatory reading. This book feels rather like scene-setting for the major battle which one assumes will come in a future book. It is still, however, a really enjoyable read with some great characters, a light and fresh writing style and an interesting setting in Dublin.[...]."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I don't know why there are soo many people giving bad reviews of the book. KMM is diverting from her Highlander storyline to give us something a bit more entertaining. Personally, I am happy that she is trying something new and different because I was very, very tired of the almost formulaic storylines in that series.I am an avid reader of sci-fi, fantasy and romance. I am quite used to reading trilogies. Often, in these trilogies, the first book is just enough to suck you in, and then leave you hanging. There are often not many answers forthcoming until you get to the 2nd and 3rd books. As far as the lack of romance or sex, I don't need either of these to enjoy a good story. I think everyone who picks up this series needs to understand that this is not KMM's tpical novel; you CANNOT judge this book based on her previous writing. I, for one, think it's fantastic that she is trying her hand at something new.I really enjoyed this story. It's darker than any of her other novels, but that's a genre that I greatly enjoy. If you don't like a grittier, serious, 'maybe not a happy-ending' story, then don't read this book. Now, having said that, I will say that I haven't developed much sympathy for her heroine yet. I think she comes across as too young, naive, and way to much 'Valley girl' mentality. KMM is trying for a combination of spunk/sass and innocence with her that just doesn't jive right with me. The spunk and sass are at odds with the innocence, and it creates a bit of discord with me.I can't wait to find out if Mac grows up and into the abilities that KMM is weaving for her. KMM has given us many tidbits of what's in store for Mac, so I'm looking forward the adventure. And, of course, finding out who she eventually falls for.It will definitely be intriguing to see if KMM ties this series in, at alll, with the Highlander series. I'll give away one tinsy story killer. It appears (though I could be wrong) that the Lord Master is a character from one of the Highlander novels."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"The first book in Ms Moning's new Fever series is a breath of fresh air, even if it isn't romance thus far. Personally, I'm tired of paying upwards of $6.99 for books that are poorly plotted, have poor characterization and while there are a couple of the mandatory steamy sex scenes, the relationship between the two main characters isn't fully developed or is unconvincing. The formula doesn't always work, and since I love to read paranormals, I've come across more and more books that just fall flat. Even though I can't quite figure out where Moning is going with this sidhe-seer series, it's showing signs of promise. It's not *all* good, but it kept me guessing and I'm excited to read Bloodfever as soon as it comes out.MacKayla Lane does undergo a transformation (physical, mental and emotional) from the first chapter to the last. When she arrives in Ireland following her sister's death, she's a naive, annoying and immature blonde who thinks the gardia (police) can gelp her get justice for Alina's murder. By the end of this book, she's learned that there's more to the world than she ever knew - including who she is and what she's capable of - and that she's become part of a war she had no idea existed. I'd like to think she's a work in progress, changing in order to stay alive. Character development is always a good thing, IMHO. Hopefully the Mac of the final book will be a character I can relate to and like a little more. Fingers crossed!Now, I wonder if Jericho Barrons and Mac are going to become more than just allies? Right now, I cannot tell, but I think it would be genius if the author took a couple of books to build that relationship into something solid before she throws romance into the mix. All I know is that Jericho manages to be an enigmatic alpha without falling into any of the typical romance stereotypes and pitfalls.. so there's a lot of potential, but whether or not the author intends to fulfil it.. I have no problem waiting for relationships to develop and plots to play out, providing the story is well written and conceived. I didn't quite feel like I got enough out of Darkfever (I felt like there should have been a just little more to the Mac/Jerricho thing to hold us over to the next book) but on the whole, I was hooked and there's a lot to look forward to in this series.

A dark world opens up for Mac as she forms a dubious partnership with Jericho Barrons. Will Mac unravel the meaning of Alina's messages as the veil between the Fae and mortal worlds crumbles?DARKFEVER is a fabulous addition to the urban fantasy genre. Fans of Karen Marie Moning's Highlander series should be cautioned that DARKFEVER is not a paranormal romance so that they are not surprised by the direction of the novel. This is not a happily-ever-after book but rather a dark and perhaps even a bit disturbing look at the shadowy world of the Fae. Good and evil are often intertwined and it is difficult to tell friend from foe in this world.Karen Marie Moning does a superb job at creating contrasts in DARKFEVER. These contrasts emphasize the disturbing nature of the Fae. At one point, Mac is referred to as a Rainbow and her bright viewpoint on the world highlights the horror of the shadowy corners where the Fae lurk. Jericho, on the other hand, is a complete enigma and this reviewer is looking forward to see what Ms. Moning has in store for his future.DARKFEVER will be greatly loved by fans of dark or urban fantasy.

She went on to tell Mac she didn't even know what she was and then the mysterious Sinsar Dubh, which Mac barely caught. The call ends in a dramatic silence, leaving Mac sure there was much more to her sister's murder than the authorities were aware.Of course, Mac is not content with the authority's performance regarding her sister's murder; she hops a plane and goes to Ireland to try to solve it by herself. There she meets the secretive and devilishly handsome Jericho Barrons.He quickly draws her into the shadowy underworld of the fae when he discovers she is a sidhe seer with special abilities.Jericho is icy cool to Mac and only tells her what he thinks she should know about his quest to find the Sinsar Dubh, what he does reveal is if this mystifying book falls into the wrong hands, the world will end as she knows it.This book is amazing and I fell in love with the fantasy realm and felt like I was traveling with Mac thru it all.Ms. Moning has such a gift of making you feel as if you are right there with the character.I am ANXIOUSLY awaiting Bloodfever and cannot wait until it comes out.This truly is a must read."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Unlike most who reviewed this book, I'd never heard of the author or her books before. Given the quality of this book, I sure ain't gonna read any more of them. Not one of the characters is likeable, especially the main character. Annoying! The stream-of-consciousness first-person writing is embarrassing to read, so cloying, and such an obvious attempt to create a cute but ditzy heroine. Like all of the free Kindle books, this book was meant to entice us into buying more from this author. No way!!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is the first and last book I've read by Moning. It was truly awful. The characters were so annoying. Mac, the main character, was shallow, petty, unimaginative, self-righteous, and boring. All she did was talk about her hair and accessories and criticize what everybody else was wearing. She had no depth at all, and her main goal in life was to be a slacker, living off her parents, in a podunk town. And what was with Jericho? All he did was shout orders at her (which she never questioned), constantly jerk her around physically and leave bruises (and she never fought back), order her to keep her mouth shut at parties (which she mindlessly did), and made her wear a bunch of slutty outfits (she didn't want to, but she couldn't go against his orders, could she?). It was quite sickening. The dialogue was mainly her getting verbally abused, and her response would be something witty like, \\"Huh?\\" The plot was weak and stayed unresolved at the end. There was basically no action, and the Southern stereotypes got old too. There was absolutely no point to this book. I love reading and am addicted to books, so I've come across some bad authors in the past, but Moning has got to be one of the worst."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I'm a fan of paranormal romance and picky about quality, but somehow I'd managed to go without getting into this series. Audible posted a word cloud on Facebook with the favorite male fiction characters, and I didn't recognize the name Jericho Barrons. I Googled it. Said, &#34;Sure, why not? I've met so many fans of the book, guess I'd better read them.&#34; I could discuss the many reasons I enjoyed Darkfever, but I'll just say this: I read this at the expense of sleep, and immediately had to buy the rest of the series for Kindle.

How am I going to be able to wait that long?"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Book DescriptionMacKayla Lane's life is good. She has great friends, a decent job, and a car that breaks down only every other week or so. In other words, she's your perfectly ordinary twenty-first-century woman. Or so she thinks...until something extraordinary happens.When her sister is murdered, leaving a single clue to her death-a cryptic message on Mac's cell phone-Mac journeys to Ireland in search of answers. The quest to find her sister's killer draws her into a shadowy realm where nothing is as it seems, where good and evil wear the same treacherously seductive mask. She is soon faced with an even greater challenge: staying alive long enough to learn how to handle a power she had no idea she possessed-a gift that allows her to see beyond the world of man, into the dangerous realm of the Fae....As Mac delves deeper into the mystery of her sister's death, her every move is shadowed by the dark, mysterious Jericho, a man with no past and only mockery for a future. As she begins to close in on the truth, the ruthless V'lane-an alpha Fae who makes sex an addiction for human women-closes in on her. And as the boundary between worlds begins to crumble, Mac's true mission becomes clear: find the elusive Sinsar Dubh before someone else claims the all-powerful Dark Book-because whoever gets to it first holds nothing less than complete control of the very fabric of both worlds in their hands. . . .Fine Printings' ReviewCould not put this book down for a minute! Karen Marie Moning has magic in her fingertips and once again proves her skill in reader captivation with the first book of this five book series. The perfect mix of revenge, shock, passion and discovery sets this book apart from other paranormals out there today. Her first book written in the first person paradigm, she weaves Mac's world and throws her from fanciful, carefree southern bell into the dangerous Dublin streets teeming with Tuatha de Dananns, Seelie and Unseelie alike.If you have read her previous books in the Highlander Series, some of this first book may seem a bit repetitive as Mac learns about the world between man and Fae, but fear not, for you Moning fans a new cast (and some old ones) enter to form fascinating relationships that will not let you down!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I come across this book by chance, Its a wonderful read i couldnt put it down. Karen marie moning did her research with this book everything is explained to the detail, Its a book that leaves you wanting more and more a great first book in the fever series.Mac lane is a small town girl who's only problems in life seem to be what outfit shes going to wear that day, and whether covergirl is still carrying her favorite shade of lipgloss.Until her sister who was studying in ireland is found dead, recieving a voice mail from her sister before her death leaves mac wanting answers. Answers about her past, her family and her heritage. She goes to ireland looking for her sisters murderer only to find that her sister wasnt killed by any regular human... but Fae.There are two sides of Fae seelie (the light) who live side by side with humans and the unseelie (the dark) who want to destroy the human world and take power.Both sides are looking for a book a book so powerful it could mean the differance between life and death of not just mac but the whole world. Mac comes to find out she was adopted and is actually a seer, (a woman who can see the Fae) it becomes her job to try and retrieve the book and avenge her sisters murderer.Then come J barrons a book store owner (who is some sort of warrior, we guess) he agrees to train mac if she helps him find the book. but what does he need the book for? we still dont know and this mistery man doesnt tell you anything about himself.And v'lane a death by sex Fae prince who works for the seelie queen who needs mac to help him find the book and restore order in the fae world before the unseelie take over and break down the walls between the two worlds.who can mac trust? she has no idea but she has to use each of them to her advantage to gain as much info as she can.I love this book at first mac got on my nerves acting like a barbie but the change in her becomes dramatic she becomes a fighter with a mission and i really like her character, the mistery with barrons just keeps you wanting more, you can just feel the sexual tention between him and mac.. and then there is v'lane a fae you just cant help but want. It makes for a good book and i would recomend it to anybody!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book is a page turner. Fast read, interesting from beginning to end. Interesting and mysterious characters fill these pages. You don't know what to expect from them and you don't know who to believe. I am not going talk about the book. It's free so you should just download it and see for yourself. Be warned if you're one of those people who like to start a series and read it from beginning to end without interuption, then do not pick up this book. The last installment, book 5, should be coming out in 2010 and if you hate waiting don't torture yourself. If your into PNR this is a must read. It's not really romance but there is some sexual content and it gets steamer as you get through the rest of the books. I went into this not knowing what to expect. Now I am a fan to the fever series; biting my lip until then next book comes out."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"The Fever Series is nothing like Moning's previous Highlander Series. It's set in present-day Ireland and draws on Celtic/Gaelic/Druid myths and legends to form the basis of the conflict. She takes her time developing the relationships between the primary charaters - and no, there are no hot and heavy sex scenes in this book, but don't think there isn't tension building along the way. Having read all four books in this series, it's difficult to only comment on this one book. This series may seem to get off to a slow start in DARKFEVER, but it's absolutely worth it. Moning does an amazing job of character development, laying the landscape for the story to unfold, and building the suspense. I cannot wait for the fifth and final book in this series! If you like the unusual, you should read this series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was hooked from the get go with this book. I couldn't put it down. Barrons is intriguing and Ms. Moning fed me the bait and I took it hook, line & sinker.The Shades are creepy and well written, and her description of Dublin is fascinating. I felt like I was there when I was immersed in the story."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I got this book because it was free. I am glad I did. It was interesting and made me by the next one.got to see what happens!!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I picked up DARKFEVER two days ago, and just a few hours back I finished the fourth book in the series, DREAMFEVER - if the fifth one was out, I'd be reading it now. I don't know how people who started with earlier installments have managed to wait for each new book to come out, what with the heart-in-your-throat cliffhanger endings. Putting up with that kind of anxiety for years would be tough; as it is, the fifth will be the last one in the series so I'll only be biting my nails through one cycle.Point here is: the Fever books will suck you in and pull you along like the funnest, sexiest, scariest roller coaster you have ever ridden.A few of the reviewers have expressed some frustration with Mac, the protagonist, and expressed their undying devotion for Jericho Barrons, the male lead. I have a few qualms with that. We'll root for tough-girl Mac in later books because we meet Southern sweetheart Mac in this one. DARKFEVER is the first book in the series, and there is a LOT of character development throughout. In DARKFEVER, Mac starts off as a pampered small-town girl who loves pink, looking pretty, and cute boys. We get to experience her innocence, and we'll watch as it's stripped away. One of the things that I loved about DARKFEVER is the poignancy of it - Mac narrates the novel, but it's an older Mac re-living the past. I cherished young Mac's naivete right along with the narrator, because I knew it could not last.By the end of the novel, it's clear that Mac is smart, insightful, and tough. One of the things that tipped me off to Mac's true grit - what made me really start to LIKE her - was the fact that she refused to even contemplate sleeping with Jericho Barrons. He's a character that's got a lot of evolving to do too. He's a dangerous, and dangerously appealing man - physically powerful, wealthy, seemingly omniscient, living by the credo that might makes right and utterly convinced that he's the mightiest, and therefore the rightest. He is exactly the kind of larger-than-life, too-thrilling hero that will make readers swoon, and I was soooooo proud of Mac for resisting the temptation. Because it would have been suicide.The whole series is full of amazing stories that keep you on the edge of your seat, but that's one of the things that fascinated me most: the more I read, the more I fell for Jericho Barrons, and the more convinced I was that Mac (who I was rooting for wholeheartedly) should keep a safe distance.I would recommend this book (very highly!) to readers who like strong urban fantasy - not just romance readers. If you like Ilona Andrews, Patricia Briggs, Kim Harrison, Jim Butcher, or Charlaine Harris, this is definitely a series you should check out. The author's background is in romance, and I'd intentionally avoided her until now, but these books completely reversed my opinion. Her writing is muscular, smooth, and fast-paced. The setting is amazing, the secondary characters crackle with life and energy, and she's not afraid to go some very dark places."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"this is my first karen marie moning book. i read alot of knootz and king. i enjoyed darkfever and look forward to reading more of ms. k.m. moning's books."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I downloaded this book because it was free.

Also very good."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I neither read nor know romances, but heard about and got this book as a fantasy novel, and I love it. The fey are interesting as hell, as are most of the characters (though the main character starts out as a sickening powderpuff of naive, prudish and sunshiney poodle-primped deeply southern hottie-belle,) and the suspense and mystery just keep building as it goes. I do have a quibble with a particular ability of Mac's that gives her an advantage over fey (besides being able to sense and see them) because it seems like a hastily devised and unlikely plot device tacked on for the sake of simplifying the protagonist's life (think \\"freeze tag\\"). I would also like to point out that this is the first book I've read that seemed to be riddled with product placement, specifically mentioning nokia phones and ipods and a myriad of name brands; annoying, but it fades as the story progresses (although Mac never lets up on naming which exact shade of pink nail polish would go best with her mood or outfit)."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I honestly wasn't expecting this book to be any good. In my experience, Karen Marie Moning's books are braincandy - not that braincandy is a bad thing, you're just not going to get anything out of it.The premise behind the book seemed a bit too farfetched, and at times, the melodrama goes a bit too far - but Moning has managed to create a character, who, while being annoyingly \\"perfect\\" (something that I think has no place in women's literature since the introduction of one Ms. Bridget Jones), actually does seem to have reactions that seem believable in the face of everything she experiences.Don't read this as a part of your dissertation on strong female leads in twenty-first century women's literature - but do read it if you're looking for something to keep you distracted on a long car ride, flight."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I loved the book; very entertaining and it sets the hook for the rest of the books. I read through the next two so fast because I just couldn't help it...I wanted to know what happens next! Now, sadly, I'm waiting... for the final two books to be released."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is the first series I have read about the Fae and this is also the first book I have read written by Karen Marie Morning. I decided to give this series a read because this book was offered as a free Kindle book and I love to try out new authors and new genres. The books in this series are in the following orderDarkfever (Fever Series, Book 1),Bloodfever,Faefever,Dreamfever, and Shadowfever - release date TBD.. I have so far only read, Darkfever, but I am picking the others tonight. These books are for adults. There is strong language.The book is narrated in the first person by MacKayla (Mac) Lane, a sidhe-seer. The story begins on July 9th, in Ashford, Georgia. That was the day she got the phone called that changed everything - that was the day she was told her 24 year old sister, Alina Lane, was murdered. For the last 8 months Alina had been studying at Trinity College, in Dublin Ireland. After only 21 days the case was being turned over to the unsolved division. In the beginning her father had spent endless hours of the phone calling every person he could, and then he retreated to his studying and hasn't resurfaced. Mac was determined to get them to reopen the case by going to Ireland, her mother disagrees - she doesn't want to lose another daughter. Later that day Mac remembered that she had dropped her phone in the pool and it needed to be replaced. After getting a new phone she listened to the 17 messages - and one was from her sister. The time/date on the call and her determined time of death were only 4 hours apart.Mac, Jet-lagged, and 4 thousand miles from home, checks into the room she reserved at The Clarin House. Her first few ventures into Dublin didn't end well she (1) was thrown out of a pub, (2) got lost and (3) met the mysterious Jericho Barrons. When Mac arrived in Dublin her only goal was to find her sister's killer, but she soon discovered that she must find the Sinsar Dubh, an all-powerful Dark Book, before someone else claims it. Since she couldn't get the information she needed from Jericho, she went to the library. She discovered that the Tuatha De' Danaan possessed 8 ancient relics called Hallows, ~~ 4 Light - (1) the stone, (2) the spear, (3) the sword, and (4) the cauldron ~~ 4 Dark - (1) the mirror, (2) the box, (3) the amulet, and (4) the book - aka the Sinsar Dubh. Since one mysterious, arrogant male was enough, she has to add another one. V'lane, prince of the Tuatha De' Danaan takes an interest in her. Can she trust either? Jericho seems to be using her - as a bloodhound. V'lane seems to want to use her - for sex.There are 2 breeds of Fae (1) The Unseelie and (2) The Seelie. They are at war and ever since the Seelie Queen, Aoibheal, disappeared. Now things are back to like before the Compact was struck, around 4000 B.C., between Man and the Fae. The Compact forbid the Fae to spill human blood, but that no longer is being honored. The Unseelie are the larger treat, since they just hunt and kill - no questions asked. At least the Seelie breed doesn't kill a sidhe; they have another use for them - Sex. This has it repercussions as well - unprotected Sex with the Fae leaves the woman a mess. It takes the woman a long time to get over the sexual hunger and she is never able to forget. She craves it; it is like a drug addiction.This book held my attention. I read it in one sitting - this book pulled me chapter after chapter without a break. Now I am going to admit that the Fae in this book were a little over the top for me, but they didn't deter from the story to much. There is also a lot of filler, but again it doesn't detract from the story. Do yourself a favor grab this book; introduce yourself to the world and characters created by Karen Marie Morning. I have added the other books in this series to my list of future reads - I suggest you do the same."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"My review will be brief given that there are over 100 reviews for this book already. I misjudged this book by its cover thinking it was a romance novel; I couldn't have been further from the truth. Although I found some parts a bit too wordy and bit too much rehashing on some issues; this book also had a good solid plot with eerie inclinations that intensified the mystery and anticipation. However, if you have a wild imagination and tend to be jumpy by nature, I don't recommend that you read this book after midnight, in the dark, with only a little booklight that tends to shed lots of shadows.lol I recommend this book to dark urban fantasy readers and look forward to the second book in the series Bloodfever.I also recommend:Magic to the Bone (Allie Beckstrom)Storm Born (Dark Swan, Book 1)Moon Called (Mercy Thompson, Book 1)Bad Blood (Crimson Moon, Book 1)Witchling (Sisters of the Moon, Book 1)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Holy cow!

The story ended on such a cliffhanger that I immediately started Bloodfever and read 216 pages the very same day."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"When I started reading this book, I was waiting like everyone else for some smoldering romance. I still haven't seen it yet, but the adventures and description of the places and people are well done. Contrary to the other reviewers who hated Mac for being shallow, I thought it was kind of refreshing. Because all the heroines who always seem to be good looking and you never read about them putting on make-up or being concerned about their look really seem to get on my nerves. Granted, it is a novel, so the good looking guy is always ridiculously good looking (and I am happy about it), but since the books are mainly read by women, I personally can relate to the main character who is concerned about her nail polish color being an issue :)because I think sometimes its the little familiar things that keep us going."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I knew it was a series and was anxious to know if Mac finds her sister's killer in the first book.

SO while waiting for some of my new young adult books to arrive...I decided to give it a try. Well....I am soooo happy I did. I loved this book from the beginning to end. I immediately adored the main character, Mac, from the very beginning. She is quirky, funny, strong, and independent She is the perfect heroine. Moning's writing style is just beautiful. She really embraces her characters and you feel and understand what they are going through.The story begins with the death of Mac's sister which causes Mac to go to Ireland (where her sister was killed) and try to discover the truth. The police are no help..they have no leads so she takes matters into her own hands. I love her ferocity and her will to survive. She faces everything with little to no fear and even when she does..she overcomes it against all odds.I also truly liked the \\"other\\" character, Barrons. I am not sure what to call him yet...I have a feeling more will be told in the next part in the series. He is very mysterious and of course HOT...lol..I look forward to trying to discover what his secrets are.Mac ends up not only searching for her sister's killer but also searching for her true heritage.

Moning crafted a gem with the first book of this series. She takes you brilliantly through the main character's disbelief in all things Fae so you're not going this journey alone. Mac is smart, sassy and endearingly human with mistakes and weaknesses and plenty of non-stellar moments... the kinship you sense to such a sister brings this magical story more alive so you can suspend that disbelief and inhale the intriguing plot Moning wafts around you! She will challenge your deepest thoughts on good and evil, how you define yourself between these polarities. What do you hear and what do you see? Upon which do you base your beliefs?

I ultimately decided on 5 because I think the little things that annoyed me weren't bad enough to knock of an entire star. Here's what I liked:Mac is a pretty fun character. Annoyingly stereotypical blonde girly-girl at times (think Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde), she also stood up for herself and wasn't afraid to get in anybody's face who got in her way (namely sexy and mysterious Barrons). All in all, MacKayla is a fun character. You could actually see her development, both outward and inward, over the course of the story, and I look forward to seeing where she goes from here. Barrons' domineering manner commands attention. We know pretty much nothing about him except that he is mysterious, sexy, rich, and dangerous. Enough to keep us interested? Definitely.I like how the Fae are portrayed in this book. Though we don't know a lot about them yet, they are interesting in how they work and their background. I'm intrigued enough to want to know more about them. I enjoyed the author's writing style. The setting is serious, yet the book is not dark with just the right amount of humor (mostly from Mac) thrown in.Now, what I didn't like: Really, it was small things. Mac did some pretty stupid things sometimes, enough to make me actually cringe. And the fact that, although the book was full of action, nothing really happened. This book was a setup for the rest of the series, but there was nothing in this book that came to a conclusion. However, I gave it 5 stars because, as I said above, those two small things don't cancel out everything I liked about the book.I listened to the audio of Darkfever. The narration was good in every way except when she did Barrons' voice; that made me cringe every time. I think she was going for sexy but ended up raspy and kind of creepy. Anyway, I have books 2-5 already cued up on my iPod waiting for me, so off I go to #2!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was first introduced to the FEVER series by my friend and fellow author Amber Lynn Natusch. I'd seen it advertised here and there, but had never looked into it. Amber raved about its twists, turns, and how everything fit together in surprising ways. That kind of book speaks to me, so I read the synopsis. Urban fantasy where the protagonist is drawn into the dark world of the fae. Count me in.I load it up on my Kindle (yeah, I read everything on Kindle these days), and on page two, I'm greeted to the following:\\"The Seelie and Unseelie have been smearing their bloody war all over our world since her disappearance, and although some might say I'm being broody and pessimistic, I think the Unseelie are gaining the distinct upper hand over their fairer brethren.\\"Yeah, this is going to be one of those stay up until 2am reading it books, huh?Yes. It was.This prologue did kind of prime me for something a little different than I expected. In a typical urban fantasy, the fantasy part is unknown to common people. This made it sound like some kind of post-apocalyptic world, although in reality, our narrator, Mac, is only hinting at things to come, as she does throughout the book.Mac's a spunky little hero from small town Georgia, off to explore the seedy side of Dublin after her sister is murdered there. What she doesn't expect (and who would?) is to get tied up in a struggle between the Unseelie and the Seelie. She can see them for what they are, which does not make them happy.Moning takes classic Irish myths, like the Gray Man, and applies wicked, grotesque twists to them. Her description of this creature, of the way it sucks the beauty and life from a girl, allows us to feel Mac's horror as we are forced to watch right alongside her.I loved this novel quite a lot, but there were some world-building decisions I'm on the fence on. One, I won't spoil because I don't want to give anything away. The other... I'm reading along in the story about the fae, about sidhe-seers, about Irish and Scottish mythology. I'm comfortable. Or at least I'm enjoying the inherent discomfort in the otherworldliness of the fae. And then, out of the blue, a vampire (and I don't mean a type of fae like the leanan sidhe). Yeah, not unusual for urban fantasy, right? But it feels out of place here. Maybe it's just me.That said, Moning handles every moment expertly. We never quite know who Mac can trust, and where she's going to be led astray, but thanks to the foreshadowing, we know Really Bad Things are coming.Not yet convinced to give this urban fantasy a try? Let me leave you with this quotation to help you out:\\"The way I saw it, what Barrons had just told me was this: A Faery not only wouldn't care whether I lived or died, it wouldn't even really register that I was dead, just that, before, I could walk and talk and change my clothes by myself, but afterward I couldn't, as if someone had yanked the batteries out of me.It occurred to me that I could really learn to hate the Fae.\\"I give DARKFEVER 5 phoenix hatchlings. Moning has an ebook box set for the whole series coming out soon, and that's definitely on my wish list."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"After Mac's sister is murdered in Dublin, Mac travels to Ireland without her parents' blessing. Soon after arriving there she meets mysterious Jericho Barrons, and learns that there's whole other world hidden in there. Mac discovers she's sidhe-seer; someone who can see through fay's glamour. She can also sense powerful fae objects and Barrons sees an opportunity to find the book he's after.I've heard so much about these books and about Barrons that I finally craved in and started reading. It seems like I'm the last one to read these but oh well...I liked the Ireland setting and Dublin's darkness which was, thankfully, the opposite of Mac's character. For me the biggest problem with the book was Mac. When the book starts she's this, nave, not-so-bright, I love all things pink-bright-fluffy-rainbows-clothes-makeup kind of girl that I wouldn't want to be locked in the same room with. The kind who nearly gets driven over by a car and the first thing is if your hair looks good. It just made her sound little shallow and there was just too much telling what kind of nail polish she uses and stuff.Also the book is told by first person Mac, but by Mac in the future. She would tell these annoying hindsight things that got old very quickly.Or so I thought. It would turn out to be just one more of those things I was wrong about. Soon, we would be living inside each other's pockets, whether we liked it or not.And believe you me, we didn't. pg. 75Believe you me? I certainly won't but apparently the editor does.I've been reading so much about Mac and Barrons and I was waiting to see some attraction between them but nada. Nothing. I guess that's for later books. I didn't hate Barrons but I didn't see that something that everyone else seems to see.All in all the book was enjoyable but not great. But I'm curious enough to see if that will change in future books to read more."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Can't wait to read the next one! characters are real and easy to get attached to. Story is fast paced and original."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"\\"Sometimes, Ms. Lane,\\" he said, \\"one must break with one's past to embrace one's future. It is never an easy thing to do. It is one of the distinguishing characteristics between survivors and victims. Letting go of what was, to survive what is.\\"MacKayla Lane is living the perfect life. She has a perfect family, perfect frie4nds, and a perfect job. But that is all about to change...When the sudden news of her sister's death brings her life crashing down Mac is intent on finding her killer. To follow the path she must travel to Ireland and discover the life her sister had there. What she isn't prepared is for the truths she is about to discover on her journey. A journey in the dangerous realm of the Fae isn't what Perfect Mac expected. She especially didn't expect to have to seek help from the one person that is making her life a living hell, Jericho Barron's.Jericho is a mysterious man that doesn't' have time for nonsense or helping anyone but himself. When Barron's has no other choice but to help Mac he quickly learns a lesson in compassion. Or at least in sociability. Mac isn't about to let Barrons' control her and her actions in any way.When they both discover that Mac is much more vital to their survival, the two must work together to find out the answers to their questions.But will following the trail lead to their ultimate demise?I have to say that this book was a little hard to get into at the beginning. Mac was not the kind of character that I can put up with but the action and other characters made up for it. When Mac suddenly transforms from a spoiled rich kid to a kick ass protag the story begins to make a turn for the better.Her stubbornness makes Barron's temper flare and it was hilarious to read. Barron's is one tough cookie to crack, and even though at the end he still is, you can't help but like the fact that he's pretty much a real bad ass.All in all, this book was good. I can't wait to read on and see what's going to happen next.[...]"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is a very well written series about a truly well imagined world. I heard about the series from a friend and was not disappointed. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a different kind of story, with twists and turns to keep you interested."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was hesitant to buy this book based on the Amazon postings. Many readers complained it was not like Moning's other books, and I agree. It is MORE!! This is no simple story. It is intense, dark, and non-stop. I can't wait to see what happens next and will buy Blood Fever the day it goes on sale."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Karen Marie Moning has done it again. This is a really great book, hard to put down. I read it in 2 days. Can't wait for the next sequel."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I love Karen Marie Moning books! I bought this book like everyone else with preconceived ideas...and no it's not exactly a romance but the storyline which to me is most important painted a picture of a world her other books danced around. If your impatient this isn't for you, but if you can wait I truly think this series will be worth it. This book pulled me in and didn't let go. I can't wait for the next installment."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have never, ever ripped a book in two... until this book.I always enjoyed this author's work and was beyond disappointed at the end of DARKFEVER. Granted, I think part of the blame lies with the publishers who neglected to point out that this book is the first in a five book series (In that vein, Ms. Moning should take a page from Tolkien and Rowling and actually wrap each book up and not leave so many open ends simply because she intends to drag the story out into 5 moneymakers). Also, they masqueraded it as romance, which it isn't. It's a paranormal thriller. If Ms. Moning is switching over to a different genre, then her publishers need to list her books correctly and refrain from conning her romance readers into purchasing books they won't like and can't return for a full refund. I enjoy scifi, fantasy, non-fiction, psychology and philosophy books. I read romance for its brain candy appeal. Thriller bores me to tears. Rarely, if ever, are the heroines or heroes in any real danger-- they survive to the end. If this book had been listed in the correct genre, I wouldn't have wasted my time and money.This was the most obnoxious, overbearing, redundant narrative style I've ever had the misfortune to read. If I read one more time how important it was to the heroine to be cute and decked out in pastels, I'd throw up in my own mouth. Also, the action scene at the end is so light on action and details as to be laughable. Maybe Ms. Moning will build into a better thriller author, but she fell far short with this book. I resent that I had to waste my money to discover that romance is her better genre and that DARKFEVER isn't a romance novel."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I hate this book beyond belief. The book lacks a little thing called substance. I wanted to just strangle the main character Mac. She was a little defenseless Barbie stereotype, whose delicate southern female sensibilities were hurt when somebody so much as cursed! She cant lift a finger to defend herself, and would rather slouch off her parents with a part time job, work on her tan, then do ANYTHING. It had immense potential when it came to plot but the characters made it unenjoyable. Jericho was a horrible character who did nothing but yell, bruise, and order Mac around. None of the characters are well written and have as much substance as a toilet brush, not to mention that Mac is the most worthless excuse for a heroin in any book I have read so far. Don't wast your money on this book."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I thought this story was very incomplete...I also did not like the 1st person voice. Not comparable to previous books. I won't buy a hardcover book from this author again. I'll also wait to read the viewpoints from other readers before I spend money."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Karen Moning has provided me with first-rate Scottish time-travel romance reading in the past, so I eagerly picked up her latest book. From the steamy cover art, I assumed it was part of the same series as her last book, The Spell of the Highlander. My bad. I was disappointed to find no, that is, none at all, sex in this book. I could imagine there might be some sex in the sequels, but don't come to Darkfever expecting bedroom scenes. The only bedroom scenes show the protagonist sleeping with the lights on for fear of the things that go bump in the night.Darkfever begins a new series that uses the same body of legend as the Highlander series, but which, at least this first book, takes place in Ireland, not Scotland. The main character is a young blonde southern slacker named MacKayla who is more concerned about her hue of pink nail polish than current or historical events. Mac's sister is violently murdered while on a semester abroad in Dublin. Belatedly, Mac hears her sister's last voice mail message and launches herself off to Dublin to uncover her sister's murderer. With as little experience of the world as Mac has, this is bound to get her in over her head fast. In the world of the Fae, ignorance can get an ignorant Sidhe-seer killed fast.Without spoilers, Mac's quest is not completed in this book; she has a hard time telling friend from foe, and ally from adversary. Her character development is interesting to watch as she learns more about her personal history and her inner strengths. But truthfully, I miss the sex."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was so disappointed. The main charactor Mac is so annoying and self-absorbed, such a lazy and shallow stupid 22 years old girl which the crap won't stop from her. I really wish I could get my money back, such a waist of everything."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I don't get the cult following for this series. The heroine was TSTL most of the time and I can't see why Baron even liked her. I couldn't stand her. I won't be continuing the series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I confess that I read this book because I fell in love with The Highland Series. I knew this was going to be different because the author warned us. That said, the main character was so juvenile that I found her unbelievable and I had trouble finishing the book~~and I missed not having any romance in the story. I will read the next installment and if the storyline does not improve, I will not read another."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I would unread this book if I could. I have never read a book that took so long to say so little as this one did. As other reviewers have said the book just ends, not having answered any of the more important questions. In frustration at the thought of buying/reading another subpar book just to get some answers I read the fan chats. After discovering that answers are still not given by book 4, and that many are hoping the next release will have answers, I am going to pass on this series.Mac doesn't have the sense to ask or investigate some things that should concern her, but her nails will be perfectly polished at all times. Even when she breaks her arm she insists on having painted nails, and you will know exactly what color they are painted everytime. Her actions are a blur to her in a fight, but she knows when she breaks a nail.There is also no romance in this book. Her interaction with V'lane is comical...death by sex? Don't worry she resists, although those scenes are the worst in the book. As they carry on a normal conversation he is barely even aware of her stripping and really doesn't seem to care that she is. She stands out in the street repeatedly lifting her shirt and flashing people, unaware of what she is doing at first, but redressing by thinking of her dead sister. This repeats over and over through her interactions with him with her skirt, panties, bra and bracelet. Barrons is no better. He essentially laughs at her and picks on her until he sees potential in her that makes her suddenly worth his while. Even then he barely seems to like her. I can't blame his character. She isn't very likeable."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"While I have greatly enjoyed Moning's highlander novels, Darkfever is the promise of an amazing world of fantasy, magical adventures and dark intrigues to come!It is unlike the predictable light-hearted highland romance tales.

YEP the true colors shining through are greed. All this author wants is to split up what could have been ONE awesome book into 5 different parts so she can make more money.Yes, the first book in the series was free on kindle....but that's where they hook you in. At the end of the first book, I felt there should be SOME resolution and that the story should tell more about the characters. WRONG....it feels like each book is just a reincarnation of the same theme.First book was free, second book FIVE bucks, third book SIX plus bucks, and the fourth book was TEN bucks...minus a penny. The last book in the series doesn't come out until 2011. I feel utterly ripped off. I feel like I wasted my time and I wish I'd never read the first book. I'll never pay for another book from this author again."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I guess this book just isnt up my alley, as I could not even get past the prologue.

But to my surprise the different content was good stuff! It was suspenseful, riveting, fun, sexy, and I am looking so forward to Darkfever II.

I will buy anything she dreams up and puts out because so far I have never been disappointed."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Finally..!! Something a bit different from Karen Moning and it was excellent. Plus I like the fact that she's explaining things slowly and didn't try to jam everything in swiftly since Fantasy/Paranormal books need a tremendous amount of disbelief suspension as it is. I can't wait for books 2 - 5."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Yes, I'll admit it: I was stalling on buying this book ever since I heard it was not a romance at all. I suppose I could forget the highlanders for a while, they were sort of getting redundant...ok, I'm lying here...but I finally broke down, needing my KMM fix after so long, and bought Darkfever. It had me instantly intrigued and I turned pages until I couldn't keep my eyes open only to reach for the book again come morning. Our beloved author has embarked on a delightfully interesting new series with great characters and a clever and intricate plotline. The first person tone of the book took some getting used to as this is not KMM's typical writing style, but she has proven that she is a wonderful author no matter how she tells her tale. Now the long wait until the next installment comes out..."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Alright so the newest book by Karen Marie Moning isn't exactly part of her Highlander series but it runs intertwined with it. And it's not exactly a romance...yet atleast. And to be honest I almost stopped reading in the first chapter out of disappointment, but I'm so glad I continued! This book is very interesting even though it does jar us from our intended and beloved stories of the hunky and bedeviled highlander druids.Written very beautifully, this story is of a girl from small town Georgis who doesn't realize that she and her sister are sidhe-seers. If you've read the highlander series than you know that these are people who can actually see fairies and aren't affected as much by their magic. Mac, our erstwhile heroine, has her nice bland-but-cozy world detsroyed when her sister is murdered on the streets of Dublin, Ireland. She runs off to Dublin to help the police track her sisters killer, even though it seems hopeless. What she finds is a city being eaten alive by the dark fae, the ability to see creatures she never even believed in her wildest dreams actually existed, the fact that she's a null and kind of a metal detector for fairy objects, and a safehaven in the most unusual place- the bookstore of the very excentric, gorgeouse , and equally arogantly frustrating Jericho Barrons. Jericho just happens to also be a sidhe-seer ( the only male I've heard of being one in the series)and is after the dark book wich has become lost. If their is any hope of saving Dublin than the two have to stick together.I think this new series, while not exactly what any of us were expecting, definitely has possibilities. Tiny sparks already shoot off between Mac and Jericho and I'm interested to see what happens. I do believe it would be better not to drag this series out though and get the next book on the shelves in the next few months."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"KMM has put a great new spin on her world of Fairy, Magic and Suspense. While the book doesn't have the quick romance of her previous books, it adds rich new characters with room to grow. It doesn't give you easy instant answers, but keeps you thinking, questioning, and wanting more. The book engages long past the first reading, and brings you back to reread it for more clues. For me, that's just good entertainment."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I would say not to waste your money and time and skip to book 4 & 5which are absolutely good plus they summaries the first 3 book .

It was only near the 'ending' that the author lost me. I'd go into specifics, but I'm trying to write a review and not a spoiler. The ending is definitely a cliffhanger, and I have no problem with that, but be forewarned.One of the things this novel could definitely benefit from would be more \\"show don't tell\\" in the writing. The book has a lot of potentially rich imagery and situations, but I often found myself annoyed at the author telling me how a character felt, instead of making me a witness to how a character felt. The descriptions get so hyperbolic at times that I stopped taking them seriously, especially when it comes time to convey horror or revulsion.The in-depth descriptions of the main character's outfits got a bit old. The use of acronyms made the book feel too much like a role playing game at times, and I found that really distracting. Words like \\"Null\\" also felt like they came from a game, especially in contrast to the many Gaelic rooted words in the novel, like \\"sidhe-seer\\". The characters were a little on the Buffy side of things, as were some of the situations the main character finds herself in.In other words, there were a lot of things I found wanting in this novel, but that said, I did tear through it, and I did enjoy myself.Would I recommend this to my hard-core fantasy/sci-fi friends, who like Tim Powers and Julian May? Probably not. Would I recommend it to my friends who are Buffy lovers? Maybe.A nice, light modern fantasy read that could have been a lot better. I give it three stars because it drew me in and I couldn't stop reading it, but it came dangerously close to two."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Well, there have been a lot of reviews on this book; and now I see why so many people said it was a cliffhanger (literally)!!! The book started off way to slow and the main character MacKayla \\"aka\\" Mac talks a lot in this book!!! And I mean a lot!!! I know I am one to talk about manicures, cute clothes & other varies stuff-but this main character took the cake. I mean sometimes I had to put the book down and just pray that the next chapter got better.So, the plot is very much vengeance with a capital \\"V\\"; she wants to catch the person responsible for her sister's (Alaine) death. Her sister decided to study aboard in Dublin, Ireland; this is where Alaine discovers that her and her sister MacKayla are not entirely human. They are both what is called a null, a null is a side-seer with powers to freeze a Fae with the touch of his or her hand (this is stated in the book). But before Alaine was killed she left a message to her sister, she wanted MacKayla to find the Sinsar Dubh before it falls into the wrong hands. Unfortunately, her sister dies but not before she can leave one last clue. When Mac finds the clue and sees all the danger the human world is in, she is determined to put a stop to the war. But, the war has just begun between the two courts called Seelie & the Unseelie. The obstacles she has to overcome doesn't have to be done alone, she has Barron. Or does she? Plus, she doesn't know what he is yet nor will she ever!?! She half trusts this handsome, superpower, bookstore owner!!! But he has saved her life, and they have worked together to acquire some Hollows need to read the Sinsar Dubh. As soon as the book takes off it ends and when I say it ends, well you will probably be just as disappointed as I was.

This one however... I kept expecting it to get better but it never did. I have always finished each book that I have started until I got to this one. I couldn't make my self get to the end. Maybe it's just me but I just couldn't bring myself to like it even a little."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book was okay - if I could I'd give it 2 1/2 stars. I've never read this author but heard she's really good, so I was a little disappointed.Mac takes some getting used to. Though she lacked maturity, it didn't bother me as much as other reviewers. I think she behaved as I'd expect a 22 year-old who has lived her life in a sheltered little bubble shielded from the world's uglines to behave. What annoyed me about her was her sugary sweet, cuteness and pink obsessed personality. Towards the end it was toned down somewhat.I liked Barrons, despite him being your basic mysteriously sexy alpha male character. The author keeps you on your toes about him, wondering if he's good or bad.The Fae prince, I did have an issue with, but I don't think it's his fault. Mac is never depicted as a very sexual character, in fact quite the opposite, as somewhat innocent and cutesy, so her abrupt sexualization at the hands of the \\"death by sex fae\\" was uncomfortable. Perhaps the author meant it to be shocking, to show the brutality of the Fae, but I had a big problem with it.My major problem with the book is that nothing gets resolved. You never find out who or what Barrons is, Mac resolves none of her issues (who she is, who killed her sister, etc...) - it's as if the book was cut off mid-story. I understand this is the first in a series, but this was ALL set-up and no closure. Some of the major conflicts, and I guess potential romance elements, were introduced, as was the world the characters inhabit, and then the book ended. It felt unsatisfying.But, by now I think 3 or 4 other books are released, so it may be worth it if the second book picks up the pace, since the characters and the conflicts they face are interesting and this is a quick read."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"It took me a while to get used to the writer's style used in this series, but once I got used to it, I have enjoyed reading the series. The problem is the first book only presents the situation, so you want to read book 2 to see how it gets solved. Book 2, fun read, but it still slowly showing you what is going on, and leaves you with more questions, so of course you are now hooked, and need to go to book 3.I just finished book 3, and I have to say, had I read the reviews, I would have NOT read book 3 until I had book 4 AND 5 in my hands. Book 3, leaves the heroine in a VERY bad spot. I am waiting to read book 4 from the library. I will NOT buy it, because according to reviews for book 4, it has another messy ending.It would probably be wiser for me to just wait for book 5, to avoid having to read another book that will leave Mac in troubles, but I really want to get the bad taste of book 3 out of my mouth, so I will have to bite the bait and hope 1) book 4 ending is not as awful as book 3's ending, and 2) book 5 gets publish soon.Do yourself a favor and do not start the series until you have the 5 book available for reading."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book was just \\"okay\\" to me.

Although I want to know what happens in the last two books, I don't want to spend my $ on two more books that should be one."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Karen Marie Moning has produced a riveting storyline captured within the first book of a series of 5 novels all tied together in a Land filled with monstrous and deadly Fae that are being unleashed upon an unsuspecting Ireland. Following the death of her beloved older sister Alina, who had been brutally murdered while attending college in Dublin, Ireland, MacKayla Lane, a young, pretty, carefree blond, decides to go to Ireland in the search for answers as to why her sister was murdered. Upon arrival in Dublin MacKayla finds that the police have no leads and have closed her sister's case, that her hotel room is 2 stories up the stairs, plus she is sharing one bathroom with 4 other rooms; that the English language is not really understandable when spoken by the Irish, and that she is apparently losing her mind because she \\"sees\\" something that could not be real. MacKayla's life continues its downward spiral into terror as she discovers that she is a rare person of talent that is very valuable to certain humans, but also a death sentence if discovered by the Fae that are infiltrating Ireland. A protector, and potential love interest named Jericho appears, and Mackayla is soon living under his protection; but the situation is critical, and soon survival becomes upper most in MacKayla's mind. I was totally enthralled with this story. I love the premise of this story, the fight against evil, and all of the shades of gray that appear in this fabulous story of good vs. evil, and the courage of the human spirit to seek revenge against evil that kills just for the sport of killing. I recommend this novel, I loved it, and I cannot wait for the next book in the series. I would give this book 10 stars if I could, but I am restricted to only 5. Do enjoy this story - it will keep you up reading all night long.Susiq2, Reviewer, Cata Network Romance"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I preordered the book, received it yesterday, and read it last night. To be completely honest, had I not seen Ms. Moning's plog, I'm not sure how I would review the book. She's right, it has to be taken on it's own, unrelated to her Highlander series. So, here I go...... Yes, it's well-written. Yes, it's fast-paced. Yes, the characters have some potential and I will probably read at least one more book in the series just to see what develops. However this book, Darkfever, is, in my opinion, derivative. It's not quite science-fiction/fantasy, though it reminds me of a number of science fiction novels I've read, some as recently as this summer. At the same time, it definitely cannot be categorized as a Romance. As a matter of fact, I actually found any sexually charged scenes in the book repelling, not compelling in any way. (Which makes me wonder if that is the author's intent.) The thing I've loved about Karen Marie Moning's books are the appealing characters, the humor in the midst of chaos, and the amazingly well-written romantic scenes. For me, this book contained none of the above. I certainly can understand and appreciate an author's need to tell a new story in a new way. I'm just not sure this particular series is what I want to read when I'm seeking a light-hearted escape from my very stressful, busy home-life/job/multi-tasking existence. I read a lot of books from all genres, and I found Ms. Moning's Highlander series to be a fun, fantastic, sensual vacation from everyday life. Darkfever, rather than allowing me to escape, kind of smacked me in the face with a whole lot of nasty stuff. While Ms. Moning may be onto something with this series, I'm just not sure I'll follow her very far. Sorry . . . . ."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was so hooked on this book! I found the first one as a free kindle download and bought the next 4 books because I couldn't put it down. THe 5th book just came out but when I finished the 4th I didn't realize that it wasn't out yet. I had to wait a whole 20 days for it and it about killed me! I had to know what was going to happen! If there was more books in this series I would read them in a heartbeat!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is not even my genre whatsoever. I happened to join goodreads a year ago and saw this book recommended and I read the whole series in a week (minus Shadowfever). It was that good. I am now reading Shadowfever and loving it too!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I admit, I had no interest in really reading this series until I kept seeing everyone chatting about the final book in the series on Twitter, Blogs, and well...everywhere! So, I finally caved and requested the first book from the library. I waited on requesting the rest in the series because either I will like the series enough to buy them all, or I will not enjoy it enough to continue. Needless to say, I have already put my order in to Amazon to receive the rest of the books in the series.At first, the book seemed to progress at a slow pace. Mac is telling us the story of how it began and how the phone call she receives changes her life. When she is notified that her sister has been murdered in Ireland, it crushes her. Especially finding out later on that her sister also tried contacting her hours before her death on Mac's cell phone. Mac had dropped her phone in the water so she was unable to get the messages from her sister until after her death. Determined to bring her sisters case out of the unsolved files in Ireland, Mac journey's to the last city and place her sister was at.I was disappointed that it took so long for Mac to run into Barrons. I had heard everyone stating how sexy and hot Barrons was and when they first meet, Jericho seemed cold and full of himself. Throughout the entire book I kept wondering what everyone saw in this character and how they could think he was all that and more. Yet, as I devoured the rest of the book and got sucked into the mystery of the series, I found Barrons growing on me. Especially when near the end of the book, Jericho is painting her nails and taking care of Mac. It showed me he had a caring side to him that you know he doesn't show often or to many people.That also brings me to the sexy scenes involving V'Lane. Now I will say right off the bat, these scenes were hot! The simple fact that he could just do that to Mac so easily was amusing yet sexy at the same time. V'Lane seems to be warmer in the romance department than Barrons at the moment, but I will trust in the remarks of fellow reviewers and readers that Barrons is the ultimate package in this department.Will I continue to read this series? Yes. Mainly because I still want to learn more of the mystery and unsolved questions that the book has left me with. Of course, knowing that Barrons will have some sexiness in future books doesn't hurt or sway me in the least! I have caught the \\"Fever\\" of the series!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I actually wrote most of this in response to a previous review and thought, why not post it as a review?I've been reading KMM since the beginning and the Fever series is wonderfully written and some of the smartest books out there. One of the great things about this series is you don't know what's going to happen. My friends and I rave about the fact that we can't guess what's going to happen which is so common on TV and in books.I do want to point out to a previous reviewer the fact that Ms. Moning has been using the term hallows since The Highlander's Touch came out which was released in 2000 (according to Amazon) and I never thought of Harry Potter while reading about them. In fact, KMM's hallows are a part of a complex mythology which she laid the ground work in her earlier books. I've been incredibly impressed by the foreshadowing her earlier books provided for this series. I also love the fact that you don't have to read her earlier books to enjoy the series so if you're looking for something deeper and more complex it's there or if you're looking for a read that's escapism and you don't want to see any deeper then what's written on the page you still have a extremely thrilling, engaging story with a heroine who has plenty of flaws but grows and evolves with each book into a kick butt heroine! Who wants a heroine who is perfect? Mac makes mistakes but you know what, she learns from them and it's exciting to see the woman who she is becoming. This series is a journey and one of the best series I've ever read. I hope that you give the first book a read and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This was a great book for me. i am new to Moning, but I am looking forward to the next book."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I stumbled on this in a roundabout way but I am so glad I did! This is a great series, great characters, wonderful storyline. Her fae folk track very well with another favorite of mine, Butcher's Harry Dresden series (check that out too if you are in to fairies and wizards sporting both a dark twist and laugh out loud humor) The development of the main female character, Mac, is very well done and her mysterious male counterparts will leave you wanting more! I await the fifth and final book with great anticipation and will be sorry to see it all finally end."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"If you come into Darkfever expecting it to be a paranormal romance complete with happily ever after, in the same vein as Monings' Highlanders series, you'll understand why the ratings for Darkfever are so mixed. Darkefever is not a romance and other than sharing the world of Druids, Fae and Sidhe Seers, it is nothing like Highlander books. Instead Darkfever is the first installment of five in a paranormal urban fantasy series, and unlike the HEA of the other books Darkfever leaves us hanging not coming to a natural stopping place until the end of the second book Bloodfever.In preparation for the upcoming release of Faefever, I just finished rereading both Darkfever and Bloodfever. Knowing what to expect this time my experience with Darkfever was quite different from when I read the book when it was first released. But story held up well to a second read. It is still every bit as interesting, even with my having a vague recollection of the key points.Darkfever slowly introduces us to Moning's world along with the lead, and narrator Macayla Lane as she heads to Ireland to try to get closure and justice for her murdered sister. Notice that I didn't call Mac a heroine, that's because in this book there is not much heroic about her. She is a beautiful, self absorbed and shallow southern Barbie, often too-stupid-live, but lucky enough to survive mostly because fate brings her to the doorstep of Jericho Barrons.Barrons is a dark, dangerous, powerful, enigmatic man and is exceedingly harsh, demanding and arrogant to Mac, but then again kindness would only get Mac killed. Barrons finds Mac's naivete irritating but intends to use her for her rare 'Sidhe Seer' skills - Mac is able to see through Fae glamour, sense magical objects and to freeze the Fae with a touch. These are important weapons because the Fae of the story aren't Tinkerbell, the dark ones are soul stealing nightmares and even the beautiful ones are cruel and dangerous. And the Fae are invading Mac's world in ever increasing numbers leaving pain and death in their wake. Some how tied into this incursion and Mac's sister's death, is a supremely evil and dangerous magical Fae book of spells, and Barrons intends to use Mac's newly discovered skills to find it and he's going to push Mac until she grows beyond the sheltered aimless life she lived before her sister's death until she decides to fight back and survive.None of the characters in the story inspire warm fuzzies, not Mac, Barrons, the nameless Sidhe Seer who leaves Mac in potentialy deadly circustances multiple times, or V'lane the gorgeous death-by-sex Fae prince whose presence brings the only sex to the book - inspiring clothes-shedding mindless lust in Mac everytime he crosses her path. But it's okay that we aren't in love with them yet, because Mac and Barrons and their uneasy alliance will all morph into something different by the end of the book. And the process of getting there is worth being annoyed with them at times as the story unfolds. And really, the reason that they can frustrate us is that Mac and Barrons are such vital and well developed characters.Even though I liked Darkfever the first time I read it, I enjoyed Darkfever even more this second time, especially since I kept on reading straight through Blood Fever and series only gets better and more interesting as Blood Fever picks up pretty much right where Darkfever leaves off. (Now only one more week until Faefever!)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"After reading the excerpts and a few of the reviews posted here, I was a little unsure about whether or not I would like DARKFEVER. Like many people, I absolutely love the Highlander novels, but this book seemed to come out of nowhere. I'm glad I gave the book a chance because it turned out to be a pretty amazing read. I was thrown off by the first person narrative at first, but Karen Moning does a good job easing the reader into the mind of her heroine.Speaking of the heroine, Mac turned out to be a stronger character than I thought she would be. I was totally prepared to be annoyed by her immaturity, but I couldn't help feeling for her as she worked through her guilt and sorrow over her sister's death. Yes, she is young and immature at first, but I think this makes her a more compelling heroine because you actually get to see her grow and slowly start to accept the fact that she is now a part of something darker and much more dangerous. I really enjoyed the tension between Mac and Barrons and actually laughed out loud during a few of their verbal sparring matches.Overall, DARKFEVER is fast-paced and suspenseful, and I was hooked early on into the story. I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I hadn't read this author before, and was tempted by this, the first in a series, as a free Kindle download. The plot moves along quickly, with plenty of nail biting suspense, but the author also adds a lot of almost laugh out loud humor, which kept a smile on my face through much of the book, and although some of the wise sayings scattered about were a bit trite, others were worth stopping to ponder for a bit. The book doesn't really have a conclusion, and thus leads one on to the next (not for free) volume, which I am now enjoying."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"MacKayla Lane's sister, Alina, was murdered. This sends Mac, a 22 year old beautiful, blonde southern girl on a quest for justice.. or perhaps vengeance. Alina was murdered in Dublin so after a short introduction to Mac in this story we're off to Ireland and an entirely new world.Within the first day of Mac's trip she's exposed to an Unseelie - a festering ooze of a man called The Gray Man who exists to steal beauty. This, obviously, throws Mac for a loop and from there on...the excitement and adventure grows.I've always been fascinated with Fae. Both Seelie and Unseelie have been topics of interest for me when it comes to Fantasty/Urban Fantasy novels. This book is a re-read for me, but as I was reading it I was reminded of just how much fun it was. Not only do we get introduced to Seelie royalty in the form of Prince V'lane, but also the mysterious, heart-pounding owner of a bookstore on the edge of the darkness, Barrons.If you are an urban fantasy lover, these books are a must read - but a word of warning. They end on some of the worst cliff-hangers I've ever experienced. Before you start reading be sure to have all four books around you, and be prepared to wait on another cliffhanger after the fourth until Moning sees fit to put us all out of our misery."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I thought this was a great start to a series that I wanted to keep reading more of."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I found this series after reading several romance/paranormal books and was quite surprised at how quickly i was sucked in! Some question this book even being linked to romance, however I feel it was the possibility (or impossibility) of a romance that was the heart of the story. It's not a book for those of you that like the typical romance novel. It is not the focus of the story, but is an underlying factor. The author builds strong characters that you become attached to and a world that is ever changing and interesting. You wont be able to put the book down. This by far has been one of my favorite series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Fever series is simply the best. Darkfever starts it all. I am fascinated, delighted, engrossed, ecstatic, electric, enchanted, thrilled, surprised, fulfilled. Ok, running out of adjectives. Characters MacKayla Lane and Jericho Barrons are simply the most fascinating characters that I have ever read about. Even though they are both still a mystery as to what they are and what they can do, the story has gripped me and kept my mind occupied in all my quiet moments."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"When I first bought this book it was only because it was one of the free books from kindle and it sat unread in said kindle for quite some time. I finally started it one day when I was at the gym and finished the book I was reading mid work out. At the start the lead character Mac seems really flat, but it quickly draws you in with the constant suspense and leaves you teeming with unanswered questions. If what you're looking for is a steamy hot romance this might not be your best choice but, if you are looking for a great suspenseful story rich with sexual tension this is an excellent choice. My only negative would be the cliff hanger ending but in the end that has only lead me to read the next two books in the series in record time and leave me on the edge of my seat waiting for the next installment."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"When I first started reading this story, the Characters took a while to develop but this story is so good! I fell in love with all the Characters, even the insignificant ones. The storyline is interesting enough to keep the pages turning and the cliff hangers at the end of each book leave you literally wanting more. Coming from someone who never thought she'd stray away from vampire stories, this Fae world that Karen Marie Moning creates is fun, exciting and different. I loved all the books in this series and can not wait till the release of the last one! Although, I would recommend waiting to read the whole series until after all the books are out, if you are like me and a series really fast and can't wait for the next book! And remember, stay in the light:)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"When you first meet MacKayla, she's spending her day lounging around the pool, working on her tan. You can tell she's a girly-girl and takes pride in her appearance. Mac can be off-putting. She's about as deep as a 2 inch puddle. Until her sister is murdered. Against her parents' wishes, Mac travels to Dublin to find her sister's murderer. Not only does she have to face the horror of her sister's murder but also has to come to terms with what she is and that her life as a 22 year old Southern belle no longer exists.I loved Darkfever. And I loved Mac. I was hesitant about her being the heroine of this book because of how her character was portrayed at the beginning of the story. But in true heroine fashion, she realized she is important in destroying the Fae and that she needed to get it together and do what was needed to learn and train. There were moments of whining and complaining and of course, denial. It didn't last too long to the point of being annoying. I loved Mac and Barrons' relationship. I'm glad that it didn't develop into a romance (yet) because I think it would have undermined the gravity of what they were up against. Barrons' sardonic comments regarding her appearance provided many laugh out loud moments. My favorite is when he referred to her outfit as a \\"perky rainbow.\\" I loved how he continually referred to her as \\"Ms. Lane.\\" I kept waiting for the Superman reference but didn't get one. Maybe in the next book? The book ended with no real resolution. No tidy ending where everything is rainbows and sunshine. At first I kept pushing the next page button on my Kindle, thinking this surely can't be it! I'm looking forward to reading Book 2 - Bloodfever. I have plenty of time to get caught up on the series before Book 5 - Shadowfever - is released in December."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have been putting off reading this series. I have heard about its painful cliffhangers and I am generally not a fan of that sort of thing. My theory was... I can put it off until the last book comes out and just read them all at once. However, I am weak when it comes to peer pressure and I was pretty sure @smokinhotbooks was going to beat me up if I didn't read it soon. So I gave in and dived in.The synopsis above gives a pretty good teaser into what happens in this book so I won't rehash it. I liked Darkfever enough to read it in 2 sessions... in one day. It was addictive, like those Ferrero Rocher chocolates.I found Mac to be an interesting lead character, even if she does obsess about her nail polish and the color pink a bit much. She is stubborn, often to a fault. I like where the author is pushing her character by forcing her to change her appearance - I look forward to lots of growth of Mac as a person and woman.Barrons just plain annoyed me in this book. He is obviously sexy, but I did not find him likable Instead I found him arrogant, selfish, and untrustworthy. I am curious as to what he is and where he goes from here considering all the crazy book bloggers who adore him as much as I adore Bones. Obviously he has to have some redeeming qualities and we just don't get to see them yet.All in all, I give Darkfever 4 stars. The writing was good and I enjoyed the first person narrative. My only gripe is I dislike the way foreshadowing done. Phrases like \\"I would come to know just how wrong I wass...blah blah blah\\" just irritate me. (BTW - not a direct quote). I get thats it is part of the cliffhangers, but argh. The book does end with things unresolved, but I was prepared for it and it seemed like a natural place for things to take a pause. Now, I must get started with book 2.... thankfully hubby is home today to feed me and the kids so I feel no shame in doing nothing but sitting on the couch in my pajamas with BloodFever."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Still scratching my head over why this one is filed under ROM for Romance. Not a speck of romance in it, as far as I could tell. Maybe her previous Highlander series was romantic, I dunno. This one has a couple of hot guys and some sex in it, but no romance. Mac Lane is 22, blonde and perky and pretty. Her older sister has been murdered in Dublin and the local police have closed the case for lack of leads. Mac flies to Dublin, determined to track down her sister's killer, and finds herself immersed in a world of dark Faeries that only she can see. She meets a man named Jericho Barrons who offers to protect her in exchange for her help in locating a very old and very dangerous book, the Sinsar Dubh. Mac is moderately irritating with her obsession with clothes and matching fingernail polish (Ice Princess Pink Blush) and Jericho is not much of a hero (yet - there are 5 books in this series.) Not even sure that Jericho is human, although that hasn't really come into play yet either. Needless-to-say (but say it I will, haha!) Mac gets herself into all kinds of trouble both with and without Jericho, and the ending is a cliffhanger meant to lead into the next book."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I loved the world-building in this novel and the premise is very intriguing, but it was so slow getting where it was going, and I still feel that nothing was really accomplished in the book.Intimacy rating: graphic and repeated depictions of sexual desire, several scenes of masturbation."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I am very quickly falling in love with this series.

I totally recommend this series . an awesome adventure !"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to Books4Reviews!)22-year-old MacKayla just had the worse experience of her life - her sister was murdered and she had to go and identify her mangled body. But now the police over in Dublin want to put the case on a back-burner because they have no leads, and Mac can't bear to let that happen.Quitting her job and taking every penny she has with her, Mac leaves her grieving parents and travels to Dublin where her sister was studying, intent on finding her sister's killer. What she doesn't expect though is the strange things that begin happening to her when she begins making enquires about something her sister said she was looking for in her last ever message to her - the Sinsar Dubh.Suddenly pulled into a world where the fae are a strange and menacing reality, Mac must try and solve her sister's murder, whilst at the same time preventing her own. What was it that Alina was trying to tell her though? And will she fall into the same trap?I enjoyed this book, although considering that it was set in Dublin, I didn't get much of an Irish vibe from the scene setting. I've been to Dublin and I can't say that the places that Mac visited reminded me of Ireland at all, and although she commented on people using the word \`Craic' (pronounced \`crack' and meaning fun) she didn't comment on the fact that Irish people also like to say \`that's grand' and \`t'anks a million', so the whole Irish thing was kind of lacking.Also, Mac commented on areas of the city that she called \`dark spots', abandoned areas where shades (lowest caste of unseelie fae) prey on humans and eat them! Mac says that these areas have been forgotten, and that they are not even on current maps! How bizarre is that? How can nobody notice a huge great chunk of space in a city like Dublin where nobody ever ventures? Bit odd.Anyway, other than the Irish thing, and the dark zones thing, I liked the characters, I liked the storyline, it was a bit dull in places, but then action packed a few pages later. Mac reminded me a lot of Sookie Stackhouse, probably in part because she was southern too, but she had a lot of the same ideals about clothing and food and stuff, she also ended up dealing with supernaturals too!This book did shock me in places though, mainly because it ran along in a very YA, PG13 sort of way, and then suddenly, some random fairy turns up and she starts talking about orgasms and touching herself inappropriately! It's not that I'm against sex in books, in fact quite the opposite, I love the black dagger brotherhood books, and I even enjoyed the first book in the fifty shades trilogy, but this was just so sudden, and totally out of the blue that I was just a bit stunned!Anyway, I did enjoy this book, and I'm interested to see where the rest of the series goes.7.5 out of 10."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Star stats:Jaded Adult: 3 1/2 to 4 StarsForever Young: 5 StarsFirst off, I loved the cover art to Dark Fever! Karen Marie Moning nailed it. Even before reading I was intrigued. A lone female standing in the center of a cobblestone circle surrounded by a mysterious fog mist. From 6:30 to 7:30 both am and pm, I was glued to pages trying to take as much in as possible.Sometimes you have to get the ending out first because that is what keeps you inclined to reading. How I love Moning old school appeal to writing when she left us with the classic cliff hanger. Many authors today give the readers of today more and more, epic type stories, because that is what we demand. So very few are willing to take the old school stand and the epic tale build. I for one salute Moning for the classic cliff hanger and can't wait to dive into book 2 Blood Fever of this series.Mac's life is great. She has the good friends, a decent job, and a car that breaks down only every other week or so just like mine. In other words, she could be me or any other woman. When Mac's sister is murdered, leaving a message on her cell. Mac ventures to Ireland to light a fire under the Dublin britches to find her sister murder or she will not stop until she does.Along the journey Moning trusted Mac in a realm where she can't tell good from evil?? Sounds just like everyday life, right? Not exactly. Mac learns that she has a gift that allows her to see things that others can't.In my opinion you have two types of young adult books. You have the ones that are written by middle age people who have become jaded by life to remember what it was really like to be seventeen or twenty-two. Then you have ones written by people who for one reason or another can recall that being twenty is just as confusing as being eighteen. Moning falls in the later, able to grab hold of that teenage awkwardness that doesn't seem to pass until your mid-twenties and land it smack dab on her characters.Being in my mid-thirties, I find Morning characters a little on the immature side. But as my daughter pointed out, I must be much too old to remember what it's like to be young.In a way she is correct, not that I am too old, but I have been jaded by my life experiences and just expect more maturity out of people and the characters I read. All that aside I did enjoy the book. And can't wait to jump into book two to see what happens between Mac and Barron."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"great book. very entertaining and has an original story, which unfortunately you dont see to often. all and all this is a great great series!!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I ordered this book, Dark Fever by Karen Marie Moning to replace a copy I'd loaned out.

(Karen Marie Moning) does an excellent job at pulling the reader into her world. She does this in all of her novels, but for me it was especially good in this novel because I went into it expecting not to like it. In Darkfever, KMM is building a world for us....but she's not just describing a complete fantasy world. She first, builds our images and understandings of Dublin and the Temple Bar district. I have never been to Dublin, but after reading this book, I sure as heck felt I had! Then, once she has you convinced that you \\"know\\" Dublin, she sort of slices it open and exposes this other world that exists right over/on/between/among the Dublin that we \\"know\\".I'm not sure what it really was about this series but it really drew me in and became one of my favorite series. K.M.M. has become one of my favorite authors. She began as a strictly romance author with her Highlander series and then ventured more into the urban fantasy genre with the Fever series. I finished Darkfever and immediately downloaded the next four books in the series....then pre-ordered book five!I'm not really sure that I would consider the Fever series as romance but it does definitely get \\"rated R\\" in a few places so be forewarned if you don't like that kind of stuff.

Her world is turned upside down when she learns of the death of sister, Alina, in Ireland where she had been studying. With no other clue to go on apart from a voicemail on her cellphone left by Alina, she packs her bags and heads for Dublin in search of answers to the mystery surrounding her sister's death and murder. In the cryptic message in the voicemail, Alina mentions the quest of the sinsar dubh. Only problem is what is the sinsar dubh and what has it go to do with the death of Alina?When Mackayla arrives in Dublin all sorts of strange things start to happen. She sees things which are not real. At first she does not know that she is a sidhe seer, a person who can see past fae magic. And then she discovers that she has further powers which can lead her to the much sought after Sinsar Dubh. During her stay in Dublin, she meets Jericho Barrons, a wealthy bookstore owner who too can see past fae magic. Jericho takes Mackayla under his wings and together they do battle against the evils of Dublin.Other colorful characters introduced in this book include V'lane, the death-by-sex fae, the gray man and the many-mouthed-thing.This is the first book in a series of five. After finishing reading this book I couldn't wait to get my hands on the next installment, Bloodfever. Karen Marie Moning has created another World with her stories of the Fae and you can almost believe that they exist on the streets of Dublin. This book a is departure from her previous books in that it is much darker and there is no romance or sex scenes. Although there is a hint that there might be in future books. I highly recommend this book and make sure you have Bloodfever ready to read once you have finished this one.

I'm usually turned off by books written in first person but a friend recommended it, so I finally picked it up.I'm so glad I did! I applaude the author for breaking the rules and being brave enough to plunge us into a story that is not quite a romance. Mac's story is engaging and told with such fluidity, I envy Moning's storytelling skills.From the very first page, I was engaged and immersed. Mac is a great character right from the start and you see her growth from the the beginning to the end. She's spoiled and naive, not yet aware of the threats surrounding her in the dark world of Dublin.And the moment Jericho Barrons steps onto the page, the book is on fire. He's strong and sexy, refusing to put up with Mac's immaturity and ignorance of what she really is.I loved this book. I love the characters.

Wonderful read and I will definitely continue with this series!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"When I first started reading Darkfever I thought to myself \\"Oh great, a fantasy book\\". I had to check the spine and it said \\"romance\\". Well, I do not normally read fantasy or romance books. However I decided to stick it out with this book. Maybe because it is set in Ireland and I am Irish. I decided early on that Mac was pretty funny and came to think of her as the \\"ditzy blonde\\"--(forgetting that I dye my own hair blonde). She made me laugh and I truly enjoyed her character. I could see where she would be maturing as the series ran on. As far as the \\"Fae\\" go, I do have to say that being Irish, I know that not all fairies are beautiful and sweet. There are some pretty nasty ones. My sister has a book about fairies and you should see some of the drawings by people who claim to have actually seen these creatures. As I read the book I began to believe in the plot more. I began to believe in this other \\"world\\". I like to think of myself as being a logical and reasonable person. Because of that I do not look at the world as if it were all in black and white. There are things we have no understanding of and when other people try to tell us of these things we usually shrug them off as being \\"ridiculous\\". Because of her abilit y to provide detail I was able to understand this hierarchy of the Fae. I am still a little confused about how the supposed \\"good\\" ones can still be bad and vice versa. That will come with further reading. I do believe in vampires (again this is not based on the Ann Rice vampire craze but on deliberate, logical research on my part for many years) and it was rather sad to think the vampire in this book came to his end. However once again, there is good and there is bad. Or good and evil. I believe that Ms. Moning is opening up an interesting door for us and I am thrilled to be entering. By the way, I could not remember the name of the book or the authors name and I really wanted to order the next book in the series. I tore my whole house apart looking for it and spent at least 3 hours on Amazon doing advanced searches for it. I finally found the book. I would suggest Amazon put in a few more choice words for their books. I looked under -- fairies, evil, suspense, romance, ireland, irish, sister, dead sister, vampire, shadows, night, and about 10 other words. I was desperate. I am so glad I finally found it and I can read it during Christmas break (in between taking my kids to the movies, making cookies, wrapping gifts, watching \\"guy\\" shows, and a million other things wifes and moms have to do for Christmas) Ms. Moning you are an excellent writer. My husband who hates to read would give you highest ratings. He says that he likes the way I write because it is as if I am talking to the reader. You have that gift. I was totally lost in your book and sometimes even ignored the phone because I did not want to quit reading!! Thank you."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have just started reading books of this genre. I couldn't put the book down. Some books do not need a bunch of mushy romance to make it good-this is one of them. I am sure Ms. Moning will eventually give us some \\"mush\\" when the time is right. I hope she sees it in heart to write a little faster! I am waiting for the third book in the series, and then the fourth...and so on...."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"All of I can say is Wow, this was a great read, I read the book in one sitting. I read some of the other reviews here and I know that others were disappointed by the lack of romance but, Karen did state that this wasn't going to be a Romance Novel.This book kept me on the edge of my seat and I look forward to reading Bloodfever."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have read most of monning's books and this new \\"fever\\" series is my favorite. I eagerly anticipate the thrid book and all of the great things that will happen in it. I highly recomend this series to anyone looking at a good new read."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Any Moning fan will appreciate this book. While very different from her other books, the story line has many interesting places to go. I suspect the \\"Fever\\" series will somehow mesh with the Kelter one. Then things should really take off. Ordered the sequel - \\"Bloodfever\\" - and await delivery as it was just released. Very worth the read."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I picked this book up randomly at the bookstore, because it sounded interesting and different. I had finished the book within 48 hours and made a special trip to the bookstore to get the second book. (Followed by the other three.)The book is amazing. Ms. Lane starts out as a simple girl who is looking for answers. Her story draws you in and before you know it your at the end of the book.The book doesn't have any actual sex scenes in it, but their are some scenes that are close.The author draws off of old legends and expands on some. This review is kinda short, mainly because I don't want to give spoilers for the next four books."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"But I got through it, took a break, and then read book 2... after book 2 the series got much better."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book had so much potential to be great. The world she has created is so interesting but there's hardly no action. Mac has all these advantages to kill the fae but its rarely acted upon. The actual story I felt like someone was going blah, blah, blah. I was disappointed but like I said it has potential to become a good series so I'll read the next book and see how it goes."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"As an urban fantasy fae-world epic, this is a quenching victory. But outside of the narrow confines of MacKayla's first-person POV, it's also a bit limited.The narration is long-winded and the romance is non-existent. I repeat. This is not a romance. MacKayla's male counterpart, Barrons, is cold, dizzying, and standoffish, and since you don't get to experience his viewpoint, you don't get to know him at all.MacKayla, on the other hand, is an in-your-face exhale of nerve and verve. While you might grow weary of her garrulous internal monologue, you'll be immediately charmed by her actions as you free fall into another world. The scenes involving the life-sucking Unseelie creatures and the forgotten neighborhood are nothing short of magical. The best part? When confronted with these otherworld nightmares, she doesn't cry in her Jimmy Choos and wait for a man to save her. She has no man. Just a dead sister, a cyptic voicemail, and a mission that might echo the pedestrian theme: Save the World.So, while this is not a romance, it's a tale of heroes: MacKayla and Barrons bonded together by a common goal. It's this very volatile alliance that sinks in teeth and holds you to the pages. Is Barrons who he says he is? Can he be trusted? And romance addicts will be panting to know: Will something carnal and earthly ignite between them? How long will Ms Moning make you wait for it? You'll pick up the next book to find out."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"My sister loaned me this book and said I would love it. However what she didn't tell me was it was a series!!! I read this book in one night because I couldn't put it down! All the deadly immortals and secrets, not knowing who to trust! This writer throws you into a world where anything is possible including everything you thought was impossible! Non-stop action with twists and turns! I had to order the whole series the next day because I couldn't wait to find out what happened."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I'm always weary of fantasy novels. Usually they are unbelievable or poorly written. I really loved this book. Mac Lane is a spoiled, shallow girl in need of having her eyes opened to the world. But her love for her sister is unmistakable and she is willing to brave danger to figure out who killed her sister. Really good character and plot development and the chemistry between Mac and Barrons is off the charts!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"How on earth has it taken me so long to read this book?!?! I'm officially hooked, I can't wait to read the next one."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was really suprised when I met MacKayla Lane, Mac for friends.She a southern belle/bimbo with long blond hair, always dresses in pink and pastels, with perfect manicures matching her outfits. She's worries about her outfit and her tan and that's about it.But the southern pastel queen's world changes fast when she gets the news her sister was brutally murdered in Dublin.When Mac travels to Dublin to pressure the cops to keep looking for her sister's murderer, she finds out the world isn't all pink, pastels and rainbows like she believed it to be. And the Fae are not cute little pink creatures with fluttering wings...It took me a bit to warm up to Mac but by the end of the book I really liked her. Barrons, hmm, not sure what to think of him yet... I don't really trust him, he keeps way too many secrets. But he'll protect Mac even if it's only cause she's useful to him, although I'm starting to think it's more than that.And V'lane, the supergorgeous Seelie Prince, or the Sex-by-Death Fae as Mac calls him... I really don't know what to think of him. I definitely want to see more of him in the next book."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I enjoyed the fast pace of this fantasy adventure and will certainly continue reading the Fever Series. The story develops with lots of twists and turns."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I finished this book in a few hours. If you're looking for a stand-alone novel with depth, don't come here. If you want an urban fantasy frolic with an interesting world and frustrating but likeable heroine, give this a try. The main character (Mac) has a tendency to come off ditzy and airheaded but shows surprising moments of strength (the author's note at the end helped me understand a bit better). Her love interest is cold, hard, and barely discernible as her love interest at all.Ms. Moning creates an interesting picture of the far, and some cool abilities for Mac, but the world isn't well-developed or deep. Like I said, this is not a stand-alone novel. Hopefully things broaden in the next few novels. For once, the main character isn't a PI/police type but just a regular girl. She may not be the strongest or the smartest but she's forceful, real, and flawed. You can't help but empathize with her throughout the book.The sexual tension between her and Barrons could be cut with a knife. They have a strange relationship and Ms. Moning definitely made the reader want more of them. It will be interesting to see where she takes things. Giving this 4 stars because I think the series has a lot of potential (though nothing can live up to the Hollows series) and I'll be immediately reading the next book."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was so impressed with this book and was hooked after the first couple pages. I really loved the main characters. Jericho Barrons is hawt! Mac is really loveable and it's fun to watch her character develop. Even though this more urban fantasy than romance(I think it will turn into a romance) the tension and possibilities for romance are there. Sometimes the anticipation is better than the real thing. And there is the mystery of what Jericho really is. Such a mysterious man! While Mac is telling her story in the middle of crazy events, she mentions things like 'later on I would find out that things aren't exactly as they seem....' (not an exact quote but you get my drift) and it really creates such an anticipation for what is going to happen and what you will learn later on. This is a great start to a series and I can't wait to read the next book."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I can honestly say a book like this is a first for me. I'm traditionally a \\"romance\\" type of gal. While this book certainly has it's share of tiny tidbits of chemistry between the leads, it really has very little romance in it (so far:).This is urban fantasy at it's finest. The world building in Darkfever is so intense and mesmerizing, that it sucks you right in. You are so immersed in this new world, that time suspends, pages fly by, and before you know it, you are left at the door of a cliffhanger ending that will have you reaching for the next book. I feel for those of you who had to wait between installments:)I really enjoyed the first person narrative. Although at times Mac bothered me, I felt like I knew her. Her honesty and tenacity to find justice and vengeance for her sister's murder was admirable. Her immaturity in the beginning of the book gradually fades away as she morphs into almost a completely different person. The shallow, spoiled, and self-centered Mac slowly gives way to a tougher and more likable Mac. Her courage began to win me over as the discovery of her true self leads to horrors that defy imagination.Jericho Barrons is very intriguing. Who is he? What is he? What are his motives? What are his feelings for Mac? Just when I thought I had him pegged as a ruthless, no holds barred type of hero, KMM has him painting Mac's toenails in the end!!! These types of contradictions in Barron's true nature and self have me sitting on the edge of my seat. I need to know more about this man!I've already started Bloodfever and won't stop this series until it's over! This is great reading!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Synopsis: Mackayla Lane is a typical 20-something girl. She lives in the small town of Ashford, Georgia, with her parents. She works part time as a bartender and enjoys working on her tan and spending time with her family. But Mackayla's world is changed forever when her elder sister, Alina, who is studying abroad in Dublin, is murdered. The Lane family is stunned and shaken by the experience. More troubling is the fact that the Dublin police have no clues about Alina's murderer. Mackayla refuses to see her sister's death go unsolved, so she goes to Dublin herself in the hopes of lighting a fire under the investigators or possibly turning up new evidence herself.Alina's murder takes on an entirely new and sinister view when Mackayla finally listens to her voicemail and discovers that Alina left her a desperate and puzzling message several hours before she was murdered. Mackayla plays the message for investigators but gets nowhere. When she asks a local bookseller about a Gaelic word Alina mentioned in the voicemail, Mackayla is told to go back to Georgia and forget she ever heard the word. Unwilling to take no for an answer, Mackayla continues to dig, but what she discovers terrifies her. Mackayla is a sidhe seer. She can see faeries.Desperate for help and not understanding how she sees what she sees and if her ability has something to do with Alina's death, Mackayla returns to the bookseller, Jericho Barrons, for help. Uncertain if Barrons is using her or helping her, Mackayla has no one else to trust in learning about being a sidhe seer or the death of her sister.Review: I tend to avoid books that generate an insane amount of hype. Sometimes, I should have stuck to my instincts (Twilight. I just don't get those books). Other times, my instincts were totally wrong (Harry Potter, The Hunger Games) and I am glad I went against them. Darkfever is another example of me being glad I went against my instincts.I almost don't even know where to start with this review. This story was complicated (in a good way).Mackayla is a great character. I enjoyed her Southern charm, which wasn't over-the-top, thankfully. Despite her supernatural powers, she was really normal. She was a normal girl trying to get justice for her sister. I enjoyed Mackayla as a whole.Moning creates an interesting paranormal world. I like the power with which she imbued Mackayla. I really enjoyed her faery structure and hierarchy. Moning created a tantalizing world for her story to operate within.The plot was quickly paced and kept me interested and entertained.I checked this book out from the library, because I was skeptical. I ended up liking it so much I went out and bought the entire series, including this book.I would like to point out that most booksellers have this series categorized as \\"romance.\\" It is definitely not romance. It is hard core Urban Fantasy with some racy sexual scenes. If the \\"romance\\" label has kept you from this book, don't let it.Overall, I enjoyed this book immensely and cannot wait to read the next installment!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I had a blast submerging myself in this world! I may have to re-read the entire series as I already miss all of the characters! Well done indeed!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I'm a voracious reader, and it's not often that I reread a series. I think the last time I did so was about 20 years ago, with Dorothy Dunnett's Francis of Lymond series. But I finished the last book a couple of weeks ago, and tonight I started over with Book 1 on my Kindle. That's high praise. But it's not an easy read.This is an impressive series not just for the finesse that Moning uses in creating her spectacular alter-world, but also for the splendid transformation of MacKayla from a shallow, over-protected girl-child into a gritty, disillusioned fatalist, and finally into a whole and real woman.And, of course, there's the man in her life. Definitely a fine reason to grow up."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Karen Marie Moning's Fever series can usually be found on the romance shelves, but having just finished reading the first installment, \\"Darkfever,\\" I'm more inclined to classify it as urban fantasy. While there are a couple of men foreshadowed as possible love interests for the heroine, and while there is some sexual content (most stemming from the mind-control powers possessed by some of the fae), the primary focus is on a murder mystery and on the magical goings-on in Moning's Dublin. The series also follows urban fantasy tropes in another significant way: it is written in first person and follows one heroine, Mackayla (\\"Mac\\") Lane, throughout its five books rather than featuring a different heroine and hero in each volume.Mac is normal. Painfully so. She's smart but unambitious, content to while away her days painting her nails and getting a tan. That is, until the day she learns her beloved sister has been murdered in Dublin. The police and her parents seem content to chalk it up to random violence, but Mac isn't satisfied with that, and goes to Dublin to do some investigating of her own. There, she learns that her sister was mixed up in the dangerous world of the fae. She also meets the enigmatic Byronic bookstore owner Jericho Barrons, who warns her that she will share her sister's fate if she doesn't learn the ropes quickly.Making Mac ubernormal was a brilliant decision on Moning's part. Mac is probably more \\"mainstream\\" than most of Darkfever's readers; if a fantasy fan found herself in this situation, she'd at least have \\"genre savvy\\" to help her navigate the dangers. Mac doesn't. She's suddenly thrust into a world full of horrible creatures she never even imagined. She's scared witless. Because we see through Mac's eyes, we're scared too. And the fact that she's willing to stand up to the fae, even though she knows she's a pampered Yorkie snarling at wolves, makes her easy to admire. (I love some of the more seasoned, tough heroines too, but I worry less about whether they'll make it out in one piece, which decreases the tension in the story somewhat.)And there's plenty to be scared of. Moning's fae are terrifying, both the hideous monsters and the beautiful creatures whose monstrousness lurks under the surface. For me the most chilling element is the Dark Zone: taken over by devouring shadow creatures, this part of the city is simply forgotten by the human inhabitants. This works into the plot in ways that sent shivers down my spine.Moning's prose is transparent; it stays out of the way of the story and propels the reader quickly through the plot. You probably won't stop reading to gawk at a stunningly poetic turn of phrase, but neither will you trip over any awkwardnesses.Most importantly, if you're anything like me, you'll reach the end and think \\"MUST. HAVE. BOOK. TWO. NOW.\\" \\"Darkfever\\" is compulsively readable and leaves readers salivating for the next installment,Bloodfever: The Fever Series (A Mackayla Lane Novel)."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Karen Moning has a rare and perfect gift--the ability to transport me to other worlds and captivate me with every book she writes. In this noisy, hectic world we all live in, I find it very hard to totally lose myself in a book. It takes a special author to guide me on such a mesmerizing journey, and Karen is on a shortlist of authors who always--ALWAYS--make me lose myself in her world. DARKFEVER is no exception. Suspenseful, sensual, and immediate, she weaves her famililar magic in this series launch book, making me want to read more (and stamp my feet and pout until I can get it in my eager hands!)If you're a fan of Karen Moning--or even if you've never read her other books--this new book is a must read!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is a very interesting, promising, and intriquing start to a new series. The new series will use many of the same characters and mythology from her Highlander series - the Faes: UnSeelie, Queen, King, etc. However it is darker, and none of the Druid characters from the Highland Series return (no Adam Black).As fasinating as it is, the problem I have with this first book is the unbelievably dumb protagonist. She's blond, and described with 'Barbie-doll' looks on numerous occassions. She grew up in rural Georgia, and acts like she's never been anywhere once she gets to Dublin (which she has not). The most irritating thing about her is her unwillingness to believe any of the warnings she gets, nor any of the dark visions that she has - even when she has them on numerous occasions. Her steadfast refusal to believe, coupled with the way the story is written - in first person, with the 'inside your head' nature of that way of writing, lead the reader to slap their foreheads with the palms of their hands and shout in frustration. Now I know what they mean when they say you have a character who is Too Stupid to Live. The problem in this book is that she's Too Stupid to Live - on every single page of the book, rather than just in a single scene or two. You want to slap her, or shout 'hello' when she can't figure things out.In her defense I'll say that she's supposed to be 22 and sheltered. But it is really hard to take. I have the feeling that the author thought she would be funny - with her endless descriptions of what she is wearing, her fingernail polish, and/or what people look like. But I found it almost unbearably irritating, and detracted from what would otherwise be a fascinating addition to fantasy lore about the Sidhe (Irish for 'elves' - of the Tolkeinsq variety).What makes the book bearable is the mysterious character Jericho Barrons. He is a joy to read, and steals every scene he is in. If Adam Black were the Capt. Kirk of Ms Moning's writings, Jerrico Barrons is her Mr. Spock - clever, logical, emotionless, poised. (OK, he's not strictly emotionless, just tries real hard to be that way). A fascinating character. And the conciet - the world that Ms. Moning has created, is also ... fascintating. ;-)So, regrettfully, I have to recommend this book - even with everything I said about the irritating protagonist. I eagerly look forward to the rest of the series.OH - BTW - this story is not yet a romance, so those looking for paranormal romance will be disappointed. It is a pretty good straight dark fantasy, with sexual tension. And judging from the previews, the romance part might unfold downstream. This doesn't bother me, but just a warning in case you are just looking for a romance book like her Highlander series.PS #2: I happen to have listened to the audiobook and can report that it is a real pleasure. The reader does justice to all the different voices, from Mac's southern accent, to Jericho's weird mediterrianian whatever it is, to the different fae and vampires. She creates a fantastic mood for this book. She's not in the same class as the guy who does the Harry Potter books - he created about 200 voices. But she does a great job with this material. Not all audiobooks are wonderful, so I wanted to pass that along."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"WARNING: You will lose sleep once you start the series, because you won't want to stop reading until you get to the last page of the fifth and final book...but it's worth it!This is the first book of five in the Fever Series. It is by far the best series of books I've read since I finished theThe Twilight Saga Complete Collection, which got me hooked on paranormal romances. While it isn't about vampires, it has plenty of interesting paranormal creatures...all set against a richly detailed view of Dublin, Ireland. The books are part fantasy, part mystery, part thriller, with a paranormal romance thrown in to raise the stakes even higher. You won't be able to read just one...you'll have to read the entire series. Fortunately, the complete series has already been published, so you won't have to wait for the next one to come out when you're finished with this one.;^DI read all five in one week this Fall, and I can't stop thinking about the characters, creatures and the unique world the author created. I recommend you get all five as soon as you decide you're hooked, so you don't have to wait for the next one to arrive before you finish the one before. Here's a complete list of the Series in order:1.Darkfever (Fever Series, Book 1)2.Bloodfever: The Fever Series (A Mackayla Lane Novel)3.Faefever: The Fever Series4.Dreamfever: The Fever Series5.Shadowfever (MacKayla Lane, Book 5)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I was recommended this series by a friend who really likes the Harlequin romance genre and thought this was something I would enjoy. I had very low hopes for this novel and was pleasantly surprised. In the beginning I wanted to fault the main character Mac, for her ignorance and large bouts of stupidity. However as the book progressed I realized that author was insuring her growth.Mac is a young woman of 22, who has never been out of her small southern town. She had lead a pretty sweet, naive existence of tans and being surrounded by pink. Her parents don't ask much of her and she is extremely close with her sister. That changes when she gets a call that her sister had been brutally murder in Ireland. Mac, nor her parents can seem to function and all Mac wants is revenge. She cashes out her life and goes to track down her sister killer for revenge. There she discovers a world not like her own and meets a man with secrets who helps her to stay alive. I won't give much more away except that Mac is not prepared for what she is, can do, and will be subjected to.The author is a pretty good writer, putting enough description and thought into making the novel cohesive. As I stated I hated Mac in the beginning because she had no brain. What would a pink, frilly girl be able to do against whatever mutilated her sister? She never thought things through and how she did not cruse or how shallow she was, did not work in her favor. But what should I expect of someone who has never experienced these things? Mac started to learn from her mistakes and I grew to like her more. I will admit that about 100 pages in I wanted to be through with the book but I continued reading and I am glad I did. I don't know what Barrons is or if he and Mac will end up together but he is one of the best male characters I have seen written in a while. As I am writing this I have already began on the second book and plan to continue the series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I downloaded this free on my Kindle and am so thankful I did. Wow, what a fabulous book! Character development cannot get much better than this. I am on the edge of my seat with this series. Love the interaction between Mac and Barrons. Chemistry, but not romance. Though you think just maybe ... someday ... something may happen. Who knows, but I am hooked! If you love action-packed, book with characters that have so many dimesions you may never think you'll figure them out, you have to read this series. It's one of my favorites now!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Found this book on a rack at the local King Kullen grocery store. Best find I ever had. Devoured the book and when I learned it was part of a series, I immediately purchased the others. Can't wait for the last book! The only drawback is that each book ends on such a cliffhanger! Bit frustrating having to wait for the ending, however the author was ingenious! Creating a story so fascinating and keeping you wanting more..."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"It started with a free book on my kindle and bam, I am a Karen Moning fan! This is a great series for a grown-up fan of the whole fantasy/romance/twilight story craze. But, unlike some authors just cashing in on success by slapping some cheesy gag fangs in a hot male mouth- Moning can write! This isn't a tween dream about finding love with a neutered male with sharp teeth and no bite, this is about end of the world stuff. Honestly, it seems unfair that Moning appears to slipping under the radar with her intriguing and dark Fae series. I quickly consumed my free introduction and happily plunked down my own money to continue the series. The final book comes out this year and you can bet that I will be pre-ordering that one... AND my own Team Barrons shirt."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I just got the Kindle application for my Iphone and this book was a free offer so I took it. It just sat in my folder for a few weeks until my husband and I were waiting to be seated at a restaurant. I decided to check it out while we were waiting, and the first FEW LINES of the book drew me in so completely that I read the entire time we were at the restaurant-even while I was eating! I've never read a book with a plot quite like this and I was so bedazzled with the characters and the story line that I wasn't able to put it down. I went back and read some of the reviews that were posted about the book and I have to say I'm a little disappointed. Do not believe everything you read as far as ratings go. I'm not sure what some of these readers have been reading in the past, but I found nothing negative about this book. I was absolutely in love from the first sentence. I'm so glad it's a series because I don't want to leave Karen Marie Moning's world!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I love Karen Marie Moning. I got addicted to her highlander series and when I found she had started a new series, I had to get it. It didn't disappoint. She has fused the real every day world with magic and has written a truly intriguing book. My only disappointment lies in the fact that I have to wait until the next book comes out. If you liked the Highlander Series or are a fan of Sherilyn Kenyon, you will likely enjoy Dark Fever."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have the DarkFever bug now, and it won't quit until I read All of the series. This was my first Moning novel and I am glad I picked it up. I don't see how this book could receive anything less than five stars because it had the creepy elements, sexual tension, amazing characters and it is a dark literature. The book is told in first person, which didn't bother me because reading from Mac's point of view allows me to feel what she is going through, and we see everything going on through her eyes- we peek into her world and I can relate to her being that I am in my twenties and all. I appreciate Moning for introducing this series because now I have another Fever approaching in October- BloodFever."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I have been a Karen Marie Moning fan for a long time. This new series of hers is outstanding. She has done a fabulous job with the world she has created within this book. Darkfever is book 1 in a series of 5.Mac's sister is murdered while attending school in Scotland. Mac sets out to Scotland to investigate her sisters death. While there she discovers that she can \\"see\\" things others can't. Mac learns that she has a gift to see the world of the Fae. She finds protection and guidance with Jericho Barrons, a mysterious man who also seems to have gifts of some kind.I honestly don't think 5 stars is enough. Karen has done an outstanding job. The mystery, the good and evil, the sexual tension. It is a great novel and I highly recommend it.Some may be surprised at the end, for it is abrupt. But it is a series of 5 books. A person can't very well give everything out in the first book of a series, that wouldn't give them anything to write in the other 4. I can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Take every terrible insulting thing that makes both the Twilight and Sookie Stackhouse series horrid anti-woman nightmares, put them together and decrease the quality of the writing even further, and you have this travesty of a series opener. The main character has an IQ slightly above that a rutabaga and a personality well summed up in her own admission that she guessed she \\"was a Barbie doll after all.\\" The series manages to insult women in general, southern women in particular, people form small towns, adopted people and anyone with the slightest knowledge of mythology.The fae are relegated to universally evil aliens, but don't really succeed at being Lovecrafitan horrors from beyond the void of time and space, and there are no explanations for the many deviations from traditional lore. The story centers around the search for a set of \\"hallows\\" a word that was not a noun prior to J.K. Rowling's use of it as such. The first time in was at least different and therefore somewhat imaginative, now it's just imitative and trite, a phrase that could describe the entire book.Every male described as in any way sexy is invariably also described as dangerous and despite saying how much this pisses her off the main character is also helplessly attracted to every single one, despite being universally treated as a brainless sack of meat by every male in the book. (Granted in her particular case the description is almost justified.) Despite making rounds to visit all the powerful movers and shakers in the Dublin magical community, not one of them is a woman, or has any respect for them.A previous reviewer condemned the writing for it's obviously 80's inspired image of male beauty, That is a minor quibble to its' 1880's ideas of gender. The growing wave of these spineless, brainless \\"heroines\\" who supposedly appeal to more \\"normal\\" readers outside of the fantasy market is deeply distressing. It is an insult to \\"normal\\" women if publishers think this is who they are, and most certainly should not be given to our daughters to say this is who we think they are.Disturbing themes aside, the book is also slow paced, full of plot holes and highly incomplete. Unlike many other series with large plot arcs, there is no internal resolution to allow this book to stand on it's own, as well as function within the series. Its free status basically makes it a come on, like the proverbial drug dealer, presuming that an already well selling author could not get this dud of a series to sell."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I loved this book! This is Moning in serious romance/intrigue mode. It's written in first-person which is different from her previous novels, but I found that this view enhanced the story. I read it in one sitting on my wedding anniversary! She's obviously a master at building erotic anticipation and I have to say, I'm downright greedy to get my hands on the next novel. (My husband was not disappointed either!) When's the next one coming out???? Thanks Ms. Moning for supplying many more hours of fantasy-fodder!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I devoured Darkfever in one sitting and am now savoring my second reading of it. I've read a lot about this book here and elsewhere. One thing I noticed from people who loved it and people who didn't was the fact that they wanted to read the sequel. Right there, that tells you how fabulous the story is.I admit that I am a long time fan of Ms Moning and after reading this book, that won't be changing anytime soon. She has enriched the world of the Fae that she had created in her earlier books while creating new and exciting characters that leave me guessing and wanting more.Mac promises to be an interesting and oh so human character who I will enjoy watching grow and develop and Jericho has me intrigued beyond belief. While this book may not be one of her \\"highlander\\" novlels it is still classic Moning, with fleshed out characters that I care about and a wonderfully written story. Now all I have to do is count the days until Bloodfever."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"great, great, great, great. I did the unmentionable and went to B & N because I couldn't wait two days to read the next book.thanks to all of you five star reviewers....you were right...... and just what I needed another author to enjoy. I think I need to open my own publishing house...."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Darkfever by Karen Marie Moning is the first in the MacKayla Lane series and what a great start! I love venturing into the paranormal once in a while and this novel really fit the bill for me.MacKayla (Mac) Lane is a small town, 22 year-old Southern girl who loves nothing more than sitting out in the sun by the pool or shopping all day. She has a crazy obsession with anything pink and loves to be a girly-girl. So when her sister Alina leaves a cryptic message on her cell phone and ends up dying a mysterious death in Ireland Mac is left with no choice but to haul butt out there and try to figure out what happened on her own.What she didn't expect to find in Ireland was a whole other world that runs parallel to ours that she had no idea even existed. Worse than that, from the very beginning things begin to happen that lead Mac to wonder about herself - just who is she really. Is this what her sister Alina meant by leaving a message telling her that she didn't even know who she was. So far this is proving to be very true and scaring the crap out of her as she's encountering creatures that were better left unseen.Mac learns of the Fae world, meets Jericho Barrons who introduces her to a world that just shocks her, and bigger than all that finds out that she herself is what is called a sidhe-seer. She's one of those rare beings that can see through Fae glamour and freeze them with a touch. That would be enough to send any normal Southern girl running home but not Mac - she sticks it out. She has to get to the bottom of her sister's murder - she has to know who killed her and get revenge.Now Mac is caught in this shadowy world with only the very mysterious Jericho as a guide and she's not too sure of him yet. It is in his best interests to keep her alive though since they are both after the same thing - the Dark Book - the Sinsar Dubh. Whoever holds this book holds the power of both worlds and there are many after it - many who are extremely dangerous beings. All Mac has to do is stay alive long enough to learn more about herself - who her family was and what her power is and how to use it.I enjoyed this book and I'm really looking forward to reading the whole series. This is the kind of series I can really get addicted to and of course Darkfever leaves us with this big cliffhanger that leaves a person itching to get to the next book to see what is going to happen. I loved Mac's character. I found her funny and spunky and she had me giggling more than a few times. I'm curious to see if there will be any type of relationship blossom between her and Jericho. However I do have to point out that this book is not for the faint hearted or shy - there are definitely some steamy goings on in these pages."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I had no idea what to expect from Darkfever. I was under the assumption it was vampire romance and I was completely wrong. Darkfever is a fae novel and much more urban fantasy than paranormal romance, although it did have a few titillating scenes.MacKayla is an average young woman, working as a bartender, enjoying her freedom, without much ambition for the future. That all changes when her sister is murdered and she travels to Ireland to investigate after the police give up on finding the killer. Mac soon comes to kind that she's far more than average, but has the ability to see the fae. This ability puts her in danger, but also gives her an edge while tracking her sister's murderer.Barrons helps Mac, but grudgingly. He's attractive but his demeanor leaves something to be desired. There seems to be an attraction between Mac and Barrons, but that remains to be seen in future books. The real steaminess comes from Mac's encounters with V'lane, a fae royal whose mere presence makes Mac take her clothes off - literally.The liked the story in Darkfever, but what I really loved was the humor. It wasn't humor for laughs, but more Mac's general personality and what she thought of this previously hidden to her world. Even with her new found ability, she still thought like a human - wondering things like what's up with the fae always wanting to take women on their knees? It was definitely nod and smile type of humor.Darkfever is a very good series starter which leaves the reader ready for more."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"What a fun roller coaster read!Darkfever (Fever Series, Book 1)is all about transition - from sunny Georgia to rainy Dublin; from sweet light innocent MacKayla to dark vengeful bitter Mac. You cannot help but feel her pain and guilt as the story develops, just like you cannot help but feel a heart-pounding anticipation whenever Barrons enters the scene - although whether that is a good thing or a bad is yet to be seen. Moning's take on the au courant fairy-tale is not necessarily the most original out there, but is certainly one of the more engaging and I look forward to the next installment!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Mac's sister is dead, and the Irish police haven't caught the killer. When the authorities inform Mac's family that they are sending the case to their cold case division, Mac takes it upon herself to fly to Ireland, and she'll make sure she hounds the police until her sister's murder is solved. But things aren't that simple, and Mac finds herself on a search for an ancient text as well. There are creatures in Dublin that not everyone can see, unfortunately Mac can, and it's making her sick. So she turns to the one person that has the information and skills that she needs to find her sister's murdered and the book, Barrons. But there's something not quite right about him...\\"Darkfever\\" was an interesting read, and the beginning of a series that people refer to as crack. Essentially, this means that not only is it a much loved series that people will defend to the death, but it is epic as well as addicting. I did enjoy Mac's character, I like to see characters break out of the regular stereotypes I see a lot of in urban fantasy - most of the female characters are tough, in charge, and never really bother with their hair or nails. Mac cares a lot about what she wears, what she looks like, and disdains dark colors - she'd rather be in bright pink and rainbow colors than dressed in all black leather. And along with all the pink, she has some brains as well. She's incredibly inexperienced when it comes to the magical world she's thrown into, but she's smart enough to learn and develop the skills she needs to survive.Fans of the book, or at least a lot of female fans of the book, swoon over Barrons. I didn't really understand that obsession. Frankly, I found Barrons incredibly uptight and extremely aggravating, I wanted to tell him to pull the stick from his rear end and loosen up a little. However, he was redeemed a little, at least in my eyes, near the end of the book. I saw some development there, and I hope to see that continue in the future books, and then maybe he will achieve swoon levels.All in all, the book was alright, and I enjoyed it enough to finish it, and I do plan to continue reading the series. I saw a lot of potential in this first book, and everyone speaks to highly of the Fever series, I want to know why! So if you're a fan, feel free to follow my progress as I move on to the next book. You know, as soon as I get to it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"At first I wasn't sure if I like the Heroine, she was very annoying. I'm happy to say, she has improved. Her experiences have matured her and I'm becoming more impressed with the development of this character.The story line is very good in the fact that the Fae are not portrayed as the hottest, sexiest, most glamorous... okay... not ALL the Fae are portrayed that way. The villians are really bad, but sometimes it's hard to see who the good guys are... Barrons?? V\`lane??Loving the series and moved on to the next book.Pam JS"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I am embarrassed to admit that for years I have judged Karen Marie Moning's Fever series by its covers (and even by the covers of Moning's other books), dismissing it every time I saw it. Then Kelly (fellow reviewer at FanLit), whose opinion I esteem, recommended the Fever series and, simultaneously, Brilliance Audio sent me the last volume to review. So I decided to get the first book, Darkfever on audio, and give it a try.MacKayla (Mac) Lane is a delightfully shallow Southern girl who we meet as she's tanning herself by the pool in her pink bikini. She works as a bartender, takes some college classes, loves her parents, eats a lot, and adores her Juicy Couture purse. The biggest stressor in Mac's life is her fear that Revlon might discontinue her favorite pink nail polish.But reality hits when Mac finds out that her big sister, who's also her best friend, has been murdered in an alley in Dublin. Devastated by her loss, frustrated by the lack of closure offered by the Dublin police, and spurred on by a cryptic clue on her voicemail, Mac sets off for Dublin to get some answers. She leaves behind her grieving and panicked parents.When Mac arrives in Dublin, her pink princess life suddenly turns into a dark underground world of deadly shades, life-sucking faeries, dangerous black-market relics, and powerful magic. When she meets Jericho Barrons, a wealthy and mysterious bookstore owner, he warns her to leave, but Mac is determined to get answers and the more she learns, the scarier it gets.I was immediately drawn to Mac, understanding the culture she comes from and being completely convinced of her authenticity. Mac is charming and funny, is concerned about maintaining decorum, and expects to receive Southern Hospitality wherever she goes. Her personality, manners, and wardrobe worked well for her debutante life in Georgia, but when she hits the wealthy and sophisticated section of Dublin, she seems like a Barbie doll. As Barrons puts it, she's \\"a walking, talking catastrophe in pink.\\" But she's so real -- grieving over her sister, concerned about her frightened parents, realizing that she's shallow, and knowing she doesn't have what it takes to save the world.Also impressive is the complete lack, so far, of a romance. I know it's coming, but it's not at all obvious that it's being set up. At this point the focus is firmly on the plot and the world-building. While I welcome a romance, I find that fantasy novels that are set up around the romance (often what we get from books found next to Moning's on the paranormal shelf) are usually weak in the areas of plot and world-building, and this is why I had dismissed the Fever series for so long. But I was wrong about this one. Darkfever is a fast-paced, compulsively readable novel with a relatable heroine, a wonderful setting, and a plot that's full of tension of the non-romantic type. Now that this solid foundation has been laid, adding romantic tension on top will be a bonus to the plot instead of a burden.This audiobook was read by Joyce Bean whose voice and acting skills easily range from Sweet Georgia Peach to Cultured Irish Alpha Male. Really impressive. I'm looking forward to the next audiobook, Bloodfever."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I read the whole Fever Series. I loved it, the books were very hard to put down. I was very surprised because I don't usually like to read these kinds of books. Can't wait to read the Hilander series if there even half as good as these. I am definitely now a fan of Karen Marie Moning!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"After a reading bonanza which ended with me feeling oddly depressed about the ever expanding urban fantasy genre, I found this. I was a bit hesitant considering that it was in the romance section but pleasantly surprised by the contents. It isn't much on romance though I suspect we'll be seeing some in following books but I found it to be good fun. Ignore the other reviews that says this book is anti-woman. I don't see it like that. Yes, some of the antagonist characters that are seeking the same mythical book as our heroine are anti-woman but then, that's why they're the bad guys. The main character is a bit shallow and appearance obsessed but then, how can we expect a character to grow if she starts off the book all grown up and strong willed? This is a fun, quick read with a nice little cliff hanger that made me go out and buy the next!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"MacKayla (Mac) Lane's protected, southern life is going well. She is holding down the fort at her house where she lives with her parents. The Lane family's lives are irrevocably changed when Mac receives a call that her sister, Alina, has been murdered in Ireland where she has been attending Trinity University in Dublin. There is one clue that is left behind by Alina. She leaves cryptic message on Mac's cell phone alluding to the fact that Alina was caught up in a quagmire of trouble.Mac decides to travel to Ireland on a crusade to find of answers. There Mac is caught up in the scary, elusive world of the Fae. Her Southern Belle reality makes a huge paradigm shift when she realizes she has a peculiar power that allows her to see the Fae's real face through the glamor they project to assimilate into the human world.As Mac gets further entrenched into the mystery of her sister's demise, she meets the mysterious Jericho Barrones. Barrones and Mac come to an uneasy alliance in the quest to search for Fae objects of power, one of which was specifically mentioned (the Sinsar Dubh) by Alina in the last voice mail message she left on Mac's phone before she died. The Sinsar Dubh is a very dark, evil book which was created by the Unseelie King.This book was an absolute joy to read. Karen Marie Moning's unique voice lures the reader into a world you could never dream up on your own. The smooth anecdotic writing of the author is stunningly resplendent. Moning builds a bridge between the reader and Mac through her writing by eliciting the feeling that the reader is the one and only confidant Mac feels safe enough to confide all of her secrets, insecurities, epiphanies, and emotions to as she is led into a very dark, scary, unfamiliar world. Hold on tight to your book as you are sucked into Mac's world. This story will amaze and tittilate while emotions you never thought a book could could call forth swamp your imagination.Happy reading from Bona Fide Reflections!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Ms. Moning's conversational style; especially the hilarious, silent two-way conversations in Mac's head, which leave you wondering if they're totally imagined or not. Our protaganist is upbeat, funny and polite (my favorite type) and kicks \\"petunia\\" (you'll get the reference once you've started reading). Every character was interesting, side characters too, and the plot moved right along.I appreciate that Ms. Moning avoided full-blown romance and sex scenes, though I imagine those will follow later in the series. I did think the fae-tantalizing was way over the top, but at least those scenes were fairly short.Given the genre and the serialized format, this was an excellent read."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is a really good book. It is well written, though sometimes she repeats herself a bit more than necessary...the author does a great job of creating a reader's sympathy of MacKayla. Young, underachiever, lost in the desire to be simple/selfish/shallow, she's forced to face a world of danger is not the smartest, but, by choice.I related to this woman right away. The characters are interesting, her perception of the fae are also unique; adding her own vocabulary, which she incorporates well into the story. There's even a glossary in the back that brings on the jargon at a quick glance/review.I'm definitely getting the 2nd one of this one!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"A friend recommended the fever series to me a couple of weeks ago and I blew through all five books in ten days. Absolutely loved them. Moning writes in a way that makes it so easy to visualize everything down to the smallest detail. She also writes exciting well rounded female and male characters. It was fun following Mac's progression from a pretty, fluff of a girl to a kick butt woman in each book.

Her sister has been murdered in Scottland and the police have no clues as to who did it, or why. So Makayla takes it upon herself to go to Scottland and find her killer. In the process she discovers some disturbing things about herself as well. She isn't who she thinks she is. The book has fairies, but not in the little pixie sense, and other characters who will be introduced as you read through the book (such as Jericho Barrons, who there is no earthly description for! Think Harlequin romance cover and you're just barely scratching the surface. The Fever Series is a far cry from Harlequin romance. It's much, much more!). You won't be able to put it down.The Fever series by Karen Marie Moning is fantasy/fiction at it's finest! These books keep me intrigued and up late into the night anxious to find out what happens to Makayla next. Karen's writing is such that I felt so totally engrossed in the story that I found myself thinking about the story throughout the day when I couldn't sit down to read it, then dreaming about it throughout the night!

The Heroine started at shallow but still likeable. As conflict grew, she grew into herself, her potential. Even though it was supernatural and prophetic, I could absolutely relate to her soul searching.The love interests are amazing. Both V'lane and Barrons are both so undeniably sensual, the sexual tension just makes your breath catch as you read.I have read this book twice and will probably read it again. The plot is a twisting, live thing which could go either way. Even after you've read it you feel like the finale is not set in stone. The characters are layered and intense. The relationships complicated and very realistic. The sexual content, while consummation doesn't occur, is not lacking in any way. In fact, I love the idea of the effect of the Fey's charisma, that there is sex worth dying for.I would recommend it to anyone, man or woman. It's not a girly romance. I even bought the series for my Dad (he loves Anita Blake, thought he'd like this and he did)."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"My review applies to the entire 5-book series, not just this book, as I spent the past 5 days reading all of them it's very difficult to separate.

This isn't a story about romance, but there is definitely romance in it.

I really liked the premise of the book and how Moning is exploring the world described by the Highlander series. I agree that the ending is abrupt if you don't know to expect it.However, I really liked seeing the darker side of things in the world of the Seelie and Unseelie. The book raised tons of questions, but that makes me all the more interested in reading the next book in the series.The only thing I didn't quite like is the character of Mac. She annoyed me in the beginning, but I think the characters IS a realistic representation of a 22 year old who has been thrown into a situation that was totally unexpected.

However, the main character is an airhead barbie doll with a low IQ, and by the 4th chapter you really wish someone would kill her and make one of the other more interesting characters the lead. I kept reading this hoping the main character would mature, throw less ridiculous tantrums, be more concerned about civilization than her nails, and do something intelligent, but alas, no. The torture of listening to her wine about her situation and talk about her clothes and nails goes on and on. The reader jumps to conclusions about the story line way before the she does, and it so painful waiting her to catch up, and watching her do stupid things (which the author excuses because she is supposedly in a stupor of grief). Skip this one - for a great female lead in fantasy, try Ilona Andrews Magic series, or Patricia Brigg's Mercy Thompson series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and KritiquesMacKayla Lane is bereft when her sister Alina is brutally killed while studying abroad in Dublin. When the Dublin Police declare the murder an unsolved mystery and close the case, Mac flies to Ireland, determined to find the answers herself. Mac's only clue is a disturbing phone message left hours before Alina's death, mentioning a dark book called the Sinsar Dubh.Upon arrival in Dublin, Mac is immediately pitched head first into a dark world inhabiting monstrous creatures more frightening then her worst nightmares. As if that isn't enough, Mac discovers she has the rare gift of Sidhe-seeing, the ability to see the Unseelie through their projected glamours to their true forms. She also has to fend off the attentions of Death-by-Sex Fae, V'lane who has Mac in his sights. Mac's only ally is Jericho Barrons, who is after the Sinsar Dubh for his own purposes and is not above using Mac to get what he wants. Unsure who to trust, suspecting everyone and everything, Mac is in for a dangerous game. For if the Dark Fae get the book first, it would mean the destruction of all humans.While this is a book by a master romance novelist Karen Marie Moning, this book is by no means even remotely a romance. Darkfever is much darker in tone, has a continuing storyline throughout the entire series, and while there is some physical attraction and sexual fantasizing occurring, there is no romance found here. I knew this going into the series so I wasn't upset, but if fans are looking for the usual romance and happy ever after from Moning, they may be quite disappointed.I loved the whole premise of Darkfever and am I glad I waited to read/listen until I could do Books 1 and 2 (Bloodfever) back to back. Though now I have to wait for book 3 (Faefever)! I love Karen Marie Moning as a romance author and now I love her as a dark fantasy author as well. The descriptions of Dublin, the Unseelie, and the circumstances of the war between human and fae were brilliantly done. I even found myself cringing a time or two over the appearances of some of the nastier of nasty dark fae.The idea of Sidhe-seers was a fascinating one and added depth to the story, since we know the horrors of what Mac is seeing that no one else is even aware of. I did often find myself wondering as we went along, how people seeing these monsters could possibly pretend everything was normal in order to protect themselves from discovery. I sure would have had a very hard time ignoring the disgust I felt at seeing these creatures. I also loved the fact Mac is a null. Her touch has the ability to freeze the fae in place briefly, usually just long enough to escape. I've seen the idea of nulls in other fantasy books and though the most basic principle of the gift is familiar, Moning took it one step farther here.Mac is a character I couldn't decide if I liked or hated in the beginning. She's such a fluffy, stereotypical blonde initially that I wanted to smack her for being so clueless. I was with Barrons in my original impression of Mac. She quickly grew up however once she got to Dublin and realized what exactly she was fighting for. Though she still had some of those flightier moments, she had changed so much by the end of the story (fighting for your life will do that to you) that she is like an entirely different person. Jericho Barrons is an enigma and I can't wait to learn more about him. I also found myself quite curious about the old woman who saves Mac very early on in the book and appears a few more times. What are her stakes in Mac's mission?I am glad I listened to Darkfever though since I'd have never been able to figure out the proper pronunciation of some of the words used here. I can only hope there was a glossary in the print books that tells how to say the words. If I had read this in print, I'd have been beyond frustrated trying to figure out some of the words and it would have stolen much of the enjoyment of the story from me. Joyce Bean handles all those unfamiliar words with skill. I love her voice and her ability to bring the books to life so I was quite pleased to see she was the narrator of Darkfever.Kelley A.

I have no interest in her story; I made myself finish the book but the cliffhanger didn't make me interested in getting the next book at all. I'll wait and hope that Ms. Moning comes up with a more interesting heroine for her next series.The first-person POV didn't bother me but the writing itself didn't seem up to par with previous books."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Moning is renowned for her romances, but she should also be worshipped for her deftness in the paranormal genre.I could not put this book down.MacKayla \\"Mac\\" Lane's whole world gets thrown in a new - and deadly - direction when the Dublin police telephone to inform her and her family that her sister has been found torn up and dead - murdered - in an alleyway. There are no leads and the case is being closed. Mac can not accept this fact and goes to Dublin against her parents wishes in search for her sister's killer to avenge her.But now Mac is finding more evil than that which killed her sister, and a whole world she never knew existed. In fact, she's finding out things about herself she never even knew.(This is not a book for tweens, unless they're mature, or you're not a \\"restrictive\\" parents. There's nothing past first base or anything, but one of the character's is a sex fae, so things can get downright wet and hot when he's around. Besides, the storyline and characters may be a little to complex for this generation's tweens.)With a strong, sassy heroine, a smoldering, mysterious hero, and the fantastic plot and ideas of Mrs. Karen Moning a great series has been born.Buy it. Read it. Love it."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"The narrator is just awful. I disliked all of her accents and she definately sounded like an older southern woman....not to mention, she made Jericho sound like a crusty old Irishman. I'd recommend just reading it the old fashioned way."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I am impressed with Moning's writing prowress- as always. She never lets a reader down. Hail to the Queen of para-normal romances!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I didn't think I'd like this book at first, but when I started reading it I got hooked. It's definately something different to read to liven things up. I still don't know who she's going to end up with or who I want her to end up with. Can't she have them all? lol.. jk"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I couldn't put it down, even in the midst of my class finals. Its not what Karen usually writes in a sense that its not a happy/its over kind of ending. It's a mysterious story and leaves you with .. whats gonna happen next kind of feeling, I can't wait until the next book to see whats gonna happen. Im still waiting for the ROMANCE part though. Hopefully she ends up with the guy I want...hehehe"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I've read most of Moning's Highlander series and found them to be pleasent \\"fluff\\" (something soft and easy that's good to pass the time with while waiting for favorite authors to come out with their latest and greatest). What a wonderful, dark, interesting surprise this book has turned out to be. Granted, it practically reeks, \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\"--only Mac (i.e.--Buffy) slays fae. She even haves the all knowing mentor who ownes and lives in his own abnormally extensive library. What impressed me more about this book than her others was the fact that she seemed to have actually gone out and done a little research on the Irish culture and current places. She describes the pubs and streets very detailed. I, unfortunately, have never been, but her detailed descriptions have a ring of truth and accuracy. Her character is likeable, regardless of the blonde, barbie-doll, always wears pink and accessories, style. Mysterious Jericho is definately someone I would like to hear more about. I especially liked the painting nails scene. It gave the story a lighter, softer touch after so much dark and depressing scenes.Overall, I could have taken or left behind Moning's Highlander series, but this newer Fever series has got my attention and my curiosity going. I think this time I will watch out for the next and let the other books be the fluff fillers between."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Probably the worst book I ever read. I would give negative stars if I could.I got this book through the Kindle deal. I am not a romance reader, I don't know the writer, never read her previous works. I don't think I will. Ever!The plot is boring, it is not leading to anywhere. The characters are weak.The heroine is a mindless town girl, whose biggest fear in the world is the discontinuing of a some stupid pink shade nail color. She is taking time to describe her clothes and hair (in her journal) even when she is chased by an evil fae.The author keeps describing her barbie like like matching pink outfits through the book. Half of the book is filled w/ outfit, hair and make up descriptions.I was glad when it was over.Even for the Kindle experimenting, keep away from this book, seriously. Buy a real book.It is an insult to your intelligence."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I love her books but I was very frustrated at how it left me feeling incomplete! Now to find out it will take 4 books to finish the story?Call me when it's done. Cliff hangers are not all they're cracked up to be!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Many people have complained about the lack of romance, no sex, etc. I have been reading romance novels since I was 14 which is quite some time ago, and haven't stopped since. Romance is really all I read. I love reading romance and so after reading many reviews about this book I was very wary of reading the book. In fact, I even got it from the library when normally I purchase a Karen Marie Moning book the day it is released.Imagine my surprise when I started reading the book that I really kind of liked it. As I got further in to the book I found myself liking it even more. It really is a fascinating story. The creatures in the book are terrifying and the Gray Man is very frightening. However, I loved all of that. I couldn't wait for what was about to happen next. The ending was great and only left me hanging for more. I can't wait for the next book.Yes, there is really no romance in this book but for me it was just the beginning of a great story line. This book is the build up to four more very interesting stories. As Karen says the romance will appear just not in this first book. Jericho is very mysterious and I'm very curious to discover exactly what he is all about and who he really is.Read the book...it's not boring and definitely keeps you wondering what the next page will bring. Just like me you'll be left waiting for the next book and wishing that it was being released tomorrow!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"The glimpse into a different side of the Fae world was interesting. It was odd that a 1st person story could be so distant-no connecting with any of the characters. I didn't feel any of Mac's grief/rage and she did come across as juvenile which isn't bad in fiction, but if this is a romance over the series I don't look forward to a glimpse of her sex life--ick! There's happy/sunny personality and then there's childish and Mac was really treading that line. I read romance for the sexy brooding hero but here the viewpoint kept me from understanding Barron's motivations and background so he wasn't much of a hero to root for. The characters in this book are defined as really hot or really repulsive. I saw the repulsive, the hot ones are seriously debatable. Hopefully V'lane doesn't make a future appearance in the series because Mac defined his actions best as tantamount to rape. Very disturbing in a romance. The stars I gave for my review is for the fascinating Fae world, not the characters."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"My friend recommended this series, so I picked it up and started reading it. Needless to say that I couldn't put the book down and read it in less than a day. It is about Mac who tries to find her sisters killer in Ireland and gets swept up in this dark and light fae war. Then there is Jerricho Barrons in the middle being a dark, handsome, and mysterious man that you want to eat up! This series is one of my favorites!!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Currently in literature paranormal is uber popular, from vampire's to Fae they are everywhere. This book is about the Fae, except, this book doesn't seem to romanticize them in any way. I am new to this author, but I've heard many good things about the Fever series, and I always enjoy reading some Urban Fantasy/Paranormal books. I did enjoy Darkfever, I knew that with all of the hype, I'd either love it or hate it. I really liked it. MacKayla goes from being this flighty girly, bartender young lady, who has no real goals in life, to throwing herself into the center of things, by investigating her sisters mysterious murder. She is a clueless young lady at the beginning but toward the end of the book you can see her starting to take shape. I like the characters, MacKayla is interesting, and there's a lot of potential in her. Barrons is a mystery and so are pretty much all of the male characters in this story. The whole world of the Fever series is different, with something scary potentially hiding behind every corner, and a mystery hiding behind the others. It's interesting, looking forward to picking up #2."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"The main character is MacKayla (Mac) Lane. Mac is a sidhe-seer, which is someone who can see the true nature of the Fae and are not fooled by Fae glamour or magic, but she can be hurt by them. Her life changes when her sister, Alina, is murdered in Ireland. Mac goes to Ireland despite her parent's disapproval to find out what happened to Alina. Once Mac gets there her whole life is turned upside down again. Alina left a message for Mac telling her to find the Sinsar Dubh and that a man who she thought loved her was one of them and out to get her. The problem with this is that Alina didn't tell her how to find the Sinsar Dubh or her boyfriend's name. Now the action starts.DARKFEVER is a fast paced, well written book. I liked the storyline, I like the paranormal suspense, and the characters are well developed. This is book one in the FEVER series and I look forward to reading book two, this was a fun read."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Okay, I am writing this after reading the entire Series. I have to confess up front, this is my favorite series of all time. Jericho Barrons and MacKayla Lane are my favorite characters and Jeicho Barrons is most definitely the sexiest alpha male in any story or series I've read so far.This book was a very slow start. In fact, I stopped reading it to read another book and then came back to it. I'm so glad I did. The story did finally get moving along and it was a roller coaster ride.I was a sheltered southern girl myself and I had no trouble accepting Mac as a naive airhead type in her early 20's. She's not an airhead at all as we realize later in the story but I doubt I would have liked her much if I had met her before she went to Ireland. Neither am I a big fan of fae and those kinds of creatures, however, I accepted this story very well. Maybe because it takes place in Ireland and the entire country seems mystic to me for some reason. I really loved this story.Mac is determined to find out what really happened to her sister. She gets little to no help from the police and meeets some strange characters. Then the stumbles into Barrons' book store and meets... him.Not sure who she can trust, she partners up with Barrons for whatever help he can give her and she begins to learn things, shocking things about this world and the fae world. The journey begins and I'm never sure if she should trust Barrons or not either but... oh my I hope he turns out to be a good guy.Great read, I highly recommend this entire series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book and the entire series were so exciting and imaginative that I had a hard time putting them down. I couldn't wait to see what happened in the next book. I liked the fact that it was more sexy than slutty. I didn't think of it as a romance book at all. It was more of a sexy action/Sci-Fi/fantasy story. I was pleasantly surprised because I purchased the first book from the Romance Novel section.The only problem now is that once I finished this series, I am having a really hard time finding another book that will keep my interest. I have started 3 books and stopped halfway through because they were so boring. I want to experience the same passion that I felt for the Fever series, and the other books are just not doing it for me!If you like Sci-Fi/fantasy and a kickass heroin, you will love these books!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Ok, let me start off by saying that I agree with many of the \\"bad\\" or negative reviews posted... MacKayla Lane is a self-centered, annoying, ditzy, blond bimbo... at first. Having lived in the south for a few years, I have actually known women like MacKayla Lane. Her character in Book One really didn't annoy me as much as some reviewers because I saw the potential for growth in the character and felt the author was making a point.One of the best things about this series is how the heroine transforms from your typical southern belle into an ass-kicking sidhe-seer. Book one, Darkfever, is just the beginning of this transformation. The other characters, the plot, and the setting (Dublin, hello!) made me continue reading the series and I am very glad I did.I would encourage those with mixed feelings about Darkfever to try reading Book Two, Bloodfever. I'm sure MacKayla Lane will surprise you given the chance."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Its the classic 'ordinary meets extraordinary'. MacKayla Lane is the cherised daughter of hard working parents who have it all together and nothing in her life is as it shouldnt be until her sister is killed. She finds out she's adopted, that there are multiple realities blah blah blah.I absolutely hate that she turns out to be adopted. I'm sick of stories about adoption. It would've been much more interesting if the plot went like this:MacKayla never new her grandmother but it turns out her grandmother is a Faery maid on the Seelie court and the Faery gene is dormant in her father so he has no idea about the alternate reality. Her grandma comes to find her and help her kick butt etc, etc.I love the personalities that are created as well. I like that she's innocent and naive. It doesnt make her seem like a 12 year old to me, it makes her seem like what she is. How would you react if you been thrust into a world you didnt know existed. Its hard to teach an old dog new tricks.Jerricho.... I'm gonna marry that man and have his babies. Right after i've had a 10 night stand with the death-by-sex Faery Prince.HOWEVER! There was not enought romance in this book for me. I'm used to reading Hannah Howell's books full of passionate sex, hot hormones and war. I've just ordered the second book, I hope Jerricho kisses her again...and again, and again. lol.I like the authors story telling."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This is a new style for me.

It is &#34;Paddy&#34; based on the Irish spelling, not the English."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Awesome and addicting, finished all five in two months, could not put down and have not been able to find a comparable series to read next. Would highly recommend."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I sort of stumbled upon this series and so far the first book seems good. I'm not sure how I feel about Mac, but the Fae world seems intriguing. Mac seems a bit immature for twenty-two and it's explained by constantly saying she is from a small Southern town...sort of an insult to a small Southern town.About halfway through, I am feeling a little bit bogged down with details and characters. I know a back story is important, but I found myself skimming through lots of info.Overall, I am interested enough to continue the series. I would recommend this book for sure."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I wasn't sure I'd like this book as it was supposed to be a 'sidestep' from her usual Highlander books (which are absolutely fabulous!). But I found I couldn't put it down. It IS different, but grabs your attention just as well, and right from the start. Mac is funny, smart and a little cocky, especially when she becomes aware of powers she never knew she had. How she handles herself in this world and the 'other-world' she is entering are what keep you engrossed in the story. Jericho is drop-dead gorgeous, of course, but Mac can handle him and in a way, I'm sure, he's never been handled before by a woman. She's as much a mystery to him as he is to her. As they begin their quest of looking into the mysterious death of her sister in Ireland and finding the powerful, dark, book Sinsar Dubh, Jericho proves to be mysterious, powerful, almost magical and, throughout their adventures together, you get the feeling he is going to be her defender, her hero, and maybe in the future, her lover?...... I only wish I didn't have to wait so long for the next \\"Fever\\" book - \\"BloodFever\\" coming out this year. There's actually no sex in this first Fever book, well, OK, maybe just a little, but not between the two main characters - (a lot of subtle 'flirting') - but sex is put on the back burner as these two enter the world of the Fae, Vampires and all those other-worldly creatures Mac and Jericho encounter. A book full of mystery, adventure, danger and the like. Characters that pull you in and keep you wondering what's going to happen next. Can't wait for the next book in this series!"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This book was soooooooo good! I will have a hard time waiting for the next in the series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I realize that DarkFever is the beginning of a new series, but it also is pulling elements from the established Highlander series. After I adjusted to the 1st person POV, it was a good story. But left me with many questions: How/Why did the Unseelie get free? When did the walls between the realms come down and why? Did something happen to the MacKeltar's that voided the Compact? Where is Aiobhiel? I thought Adam was the most powerful, dead-sexy Fae - so where did V'lane come from? Who or What is Jericho Barrons? The questions go on and on. Hopefully, BloodFever will answer some of these. Boy, it's going to be a long wait until August 07."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"In first person our only definition of the heroine is through her own eyes. In this case, the heroine is a lazy, self-absorbed 22-year old with no ambition beyond working a part-time fun job, brushing her hair, painting her nails and working on her tan. It's impossible to sympathize with her or identify with her and irritating to read this story unfolding through her juvenile conscience.My second problem with this book is the price vs. length. At 304 pages of story, it's barely longer than a novella, but the retail price is $20. Although the author states that Mac's story couldn't be told in 500 or even 600 pages, I suspect it could easily be told in a novel of normal length, especially since each new book will contain a recap of previous books, adding to the length, but not the story.It has been 15 months since her last novel, Spell of the Highlander, was released. At that rate, this series won't be completed until at least 2011. Fifteen months between installments is entirely too long for a cliffhanger series. The books need to be released no more than a couple of months apart.If the second installment is as irritating and shallow as the first one was I'll be praying for the Shades to get her...."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"I loved Ms. Moning's Highlander series and was really excited to read this new book (even though I was disappointed she had decided to start a new series rather than continue with the Highlander books). This book was terrible- Mac is annoying and Barrons does nothing for me. I can't believe this is part of a 5 book series- I will not be reading any more. Hopefully after she finishes this series, Ms. Moning will write more books like the Highlander series."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"MacKayla is a small town unambitious Georgia girl who works as a bartender, loves rainbows and the color pink, and cares about good manners and looking nice, but soon after Darkfever opens she is devastated to learn that her older sister and lifelong best friend has been murdered in Ireland where she had gone to study. Worse than that the police have given up trying to find the killer. Though her parents are falling apart and don't want her to go, she is determined to prod the local authorities into reopening the investigation, but what Mac finds when she arrives in Ireland turns her whole world upside down and has her questioning who exactly she is. Almost as soon as she is off the plane Mac starts noticing strange people, creatures really, who shimmer back and forth from gorgeous to hideous though almost no one around her seems to notice. It turns out she is a sidhe-seer and is able to perceive the un-glamoured appearances of fae, the magic race who most likely killed her sister. To avenge her sister and save her own skin Mac must drastically change her Barbie doll good looks and prepare to fight.Mac forms an uneasy alliance with Jericho Barron, a tall dark intense maybe-human guy who owns a Dublin bookstore on edge of an abandoned neighborhood that has gone missing from human maps and is now filled with shadowy dark fae. This book is the first part of a series and ends with an abrupt cliffhanger. It also fits into the New Adult genre recently described in a New York Times article. Darkfever has a 22 year old protagonist, paranormal elements, and steamy action beyond what would normally fit into the Young Adult category."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"It was a good book, but there were a lot of boring passages, the ending was very thrilling though, so I might read the next book too."},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"Let me start with this:I entered the foyer of The Clarin House and hurried to the counter. \\"Evenin''t'ye, m'dear,\\" the desk clerk said cheerfully. \\" 'Opin you 'ave reserves, a'sure ye'll be needin' 'em such a foine night th'season.\\"Please take note..I'm Irish, i have never nor has any member of my family ever spoken like this in my life!!!!!!!!Luckily this fades away as the book goes on till eventually it disappears altogether and then I really got into this book.I understand why Mac is so pink & pretty at the start as we clearly see her changing both internally and externally as the story goes on.I enjoy this author's style of writing and the tale she's telling which is predominantly Fae based and will definitely be a series I will be continuing.I definitely want to find out what happens.If you're hoping for a series with an ending at the end of each novel but a common thread throughout than this isn't it, I feel there won't be a resolution for a good number of books to come.Also romance wise it's going to be a while I'm guessing before we see where that goes but I'm willing to wait :)"},{"Title":"Darkfever (Fever Series)","review":"This whole series was great.

Overall I give it three stars as there are some great elements along with the mystery of what will happen as the series continues and how the characters will further develop. The main character certainly matures throughout the first book (given where she started that wasn't difficult) and hopefully we'll learn even more about the other characters she encounters during her adventure.

What a racist/specisist or whatever you call that attitude is,but exploiting old biases under a new guise is what she is doing. Sadly, it didn't get better from there. Unprotected fae sex makes human women get uncontrollably lustful and long for what they never should have had in the first place, she tells us. Oh this is pathetic and juvenile. What I first took for a positive trend in fantasy literature that would keep the old lore alive and with us in a contemporary setting is being plumbed for dollars without a care for the roots of actual Faerie lore at all, and presented to an audience that likely doesn't know the difference. I find this author highly irritating. Many swear her Highland series is just the best -- I will take them at their word, for I doubt I'll ever get those books on my reading list, based on this one.

It is the time before Custer; whites are just beginning to become more populous along the Oregon trail. The main character, Lance, is a boy looking for his role in a band of Oglala Sioux, whose main struggles still involve the enemy tribes of the Rees, Pawnees, and Crow, as well as the battle against hunger. It is his nature to stray from the fold, which goes against the strong tribal value system of doing nothing that will endanger the people. He adopts an enemy as a brother; catches horses; survives a winter alone; participates in the buffalo hunt; attends the Sioux tribal meeting on Bear Butte; falls in love; &quot;buries&quot; his mother in a tree-burial; and finally wins the tribe's--and his sweetheart's--approval for his keen vision in a revenge raid on the Pawnees. His talent is in watching and recording in pictures the people's stories: a comparison could be made to Sandoz and the Oglala historians she worked with. This book renders a topic of inherent interest in beautifully crafted sentences. There is much to learn in its pages."},{"Title":"The Story Catcher","review":"Mari Sandoz writes beautifully and with authority about the early settling of the land that is now centered around western Nebraska and the Sand Hills. She was raised by a pioneering family from that area and wrote passionately about the days of the Indians and early white settlers in the region.Story Catcher is about a young Indian boy who growing up into a young warrior had many experiences typical of Indian boys growing into manhood. This young man is different as he has the artistic talent to be able to draw and paint scenes envisioned by the youth of his era. His talent not only recorded events for history, but was able to present them as a story so they would record events in context to Indian reality and mythology. This story tells the \\"human\\" side of plains Indians learning to live and adjust to their ever changing environment as the white man pushed them farther west."},{"Title":"The Story Catcher","review":"this story is amazing. all though I am not of native american background I have some friends that are and fortunetly, they are related to the Sioux and Cheyanne tribes and they say this book is one of the best of it's kind."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"This was a compelling story that I read in one sitting.

What should be a distressing look at how Alzheimer's type dementia wreaks havoc on a family is, in fact, a life-affirming account of how two brave women deal with a dreadful disease that afflicts their fathers. \\"Picture Perfect,\\" a worthy finalist for a 2005 GCLS Literary Award, has earned its place among books of substance. Vollbrecht is an author to watch, as she is getting off to an impressive start.With hopes of making junior partner, Katherine Lorraine Bingham (Kate) prides herself on her accomplishments as she climbs the corporate ladder of an Atlanta-based accounting firmAlthough Kate grew up on a farm, she becomes a bona fide city girl who manages to fall in love with a country girl. Kate is reacquainted with Kayrun Clarice (Casey) when she goes to the hills of North Carolina to visit Nora Marsden, an old friend, former co-worker, and Casey's mother. Kate never counted on having feelings for the younger woman, who is actually closer to her age than Nora is, but sparks fly, and the attraction is mutual.Kate has suffered a devastating break-up, which leaves her clueless as to what went wrong. Casey is not looking for love when she sees Kate again, but they form a bond, at first based on friendship and commonalities, but resulting in so much more.Casey's father suffers from Alzheimer's, and her mother is in denial about the severity of his condition. Kate understands all too well the rocky road ahead for the Marsdens. \\"Although [Kate's] own father had been dead for more than six years, she was never more than a fleeting reminder away from reliving the horror of watching him die, synapse by synapse, as his brain rotted from the inside out. By the time it was done, he had forgotten how to do every single thing that constituted living\\" (p. 26).\\"Picture Perfect\\" is touching, sweet, believable, vivid, and has plenty of humor to keep it from being completely depressing. After all, Alzheimer's disease isn't a picnic. Vollbrecht does a fine job of tapping into the human condition and the emotions that accompany it in a well-written novel equipped with romance between memorable characters and well-plotted action. Dealing with ill parents is never easy for the children who end up switching roles with their elders, but Casey does an admirable job of taking on the arduous task with amazing strength and valor. Having Kate's help is the one thing Casey comes to count on, but can their love survive Kate's professional ambitions?While \\"Picture Perfect\\" is a truly satisfying romance, it is not simply a glorified lesbian love story. By showing how love helps conquer all, or at least how it makes life's adversities more tolerable, Vollbrecht provides the reader with just the right mix of pathos, information, and narrative to bring the reader into the story.With love scenes that don't need to be graphic to convey the intense love and lust between these two women, characters you'll become invested in, and a story with a moral that reminds us what's important in life, \\"Picture Perfect\\" proves that Jane Vollbrecht is an author who has already left her mark on lesbian fiction. I am looking forward to \\"Heart Trouble\\" (scheduled for release in August 2006), \\"Dykes in the Daylight\\" (February 2007), \\"Close Enough\\" (May 2007), \\"Second Verse\\" (November 2007), and anything else penned by this talented and prolific author."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"This is a touching love story between Kate and Casey.Unbeknowst to them, Casey's aging mother and Kate's friend, Nora is playing matchmaker.Will the career oriented Kate give up her relationship with Casey to move from North Carolina to Connecticut?Read this great romance and see what happens."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I love to see new names writing in the lesbian fiction genre, especially when they're as promising as this one. This first-time book by author Jane Vollbrecht is pure formula, but she really makes the formula work.The basic story: Kate Bingham -- twenty-something, working her way up through the ranks in a \\"boys' club\\" company -- visits her retired friend Nora. Nora has a husband with Alzheimer's and a gorgeous, gardener daughter named Casey. Nora won't put her husband in a home. Casey enlists Kate's help to care for her parents and in the process the two fall in love. The only problem is Kate's job is threatening to permanently separate them by a few thousand miles.Vollbrecht does a masterful job in dealing with both the elderly issue and the relationship issue. But, focusing on what's really important here (i.e., the romance), the author delivers surprisingly mature, well-developed characters with depth and dimensionality. For example, Kate's past includes a deceased lover, guilt over being closeted, issues related to being discovered at work, and much more.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and hope the author delivers an encore soon."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"\\"Picture Perfect\\" is not your regular lesbian love story, and in the beginning I was also disappointed at the almost superficial way the author bypassed the Feelings! But the more I read, the more I liked this book. The focus of the narrative is NOT on the love between Kate and Casey; that's more like the motor behind it all.The important things (it seems to me) are the values in life - family values, the quality of life, etc.For a first novel it's very well done, very well written, with a lot of funny \\"twists\\" here and there!

Casey Marsden is the daughter of Nora Marsden, an old friend and former co-worker of Kate's. All three women are thrown together again when a new tragedy strikes Nora's family. Nora's husband is slowly being robbed of his mind.Although not sure what she can do, Kate strives to help. Help that isn't easy for Kate to give considering she is still recovering from a not so long ago tragedy of her own. For that matter, what brought Casey home to begin with? Was it the tragedy her family is now facing? Or something else entirely? What could have affected Casey so severely that she gave up the life she had for the life she is now living?Even amidst impending loss, both Kate and Casey can't help but think Nora is playing \`matchmaker', something neither of them are sure they want. However, it's not long before both Casey and Kate start to feel Nora's efforts may have been worth it. Feelings each thought they'd never have again are beginning to resurface. Feelings that bring one big question as well as others for both women: How will the present, combined with the past, affect their chance at a future? Will they even allow themselves this chance? Only time and this newest tragedy will tell.Picture Perfect is a terrific story that is both heartwarming and heartrending. A story of how diseases of the mind can rob more than just the afflicted person of their life. Of what happens when parents become the children and children become the parents. With her first book, Jane has given readers a dynamic story filled with messages of tragedy, hope and acceptance. Her upcoming book, Heart Trouble, due out in August 2006, can only be another well-written, intriguing offer from a writer who has joined the ranks of talented storytellers."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect","review":"I can't believe the other readers,I just received it a week ago,the backside looks promising,but it isn't.I will warn,everybody for those who love,Gerri Hill,Lyn Denison and Kelly A.Zarembski,please never buy this one.At first I think the writer must be something,between sixty and eighty years old,how in the world,can she write this,it's just like reading a local newspaper,where you always find those free advertisements.There is never any electricity,or other tension,erotic ,your taxbill is less boring,they share there first kiss,whichfeels like buying a ice-cream on the street.It just goes on,the first time they share the bed,looks like a walk withyou grandma on a rainyday,not to far,please.

Not this book, you'll be interested from start to finish. The characters are well defined and the flow of the story makes you feel like you are part of the book. The main character, Lauren is the ultimate female persona in my opinion. I really like the way King describes the characters in his books, and this book has that same feel.Lianna's Children has a totally different approach to vampires. It's refreshing and it will give you a new out look on vampires in general. There is a lot of historical refferences in this book as well.

Before she has a chance to react to that, assassins try to kill Angus and he whisks her away to his sanctuary. Angus is searching for Lianna, the woman who turned him into one of the Nosferatu in 1746. Angus and Lauren will find Lianna and in the process become enmeshed in the strife between varying Tribes of the Nosferatu. Who exactly are LIANNA'S CHILDREN and for what purpose were they created?Chris Dauten has penned a tale rich in detail. The vivid descriptions bring each locale to life even as the lush historical details draw the reader back to a time forgotten. While vampire fans will enjoy the unusual aspect Chris Dauten takes with the genre, LIANNA'S CHILDREN will also appeal greatly to readers of historical fiction due to the abundant Scottish history portrayed in the storyline. There is a surprising lack of gore in LIANNA'S CHILDREN which makes this book appropriate for mature teenagers as well as adults.LIANNA'S CHILDREN unfolds much like a mystery. As Lauren and Angus search for Lianna, details of the Nosferatu world are slowly revealed to them. The twist as to the purpose behind whom and what LIANNA'S CHILDREN are is a fascinating one and Chris Dauten does an excellent job at building this storyline.Chris Dauten presents readers with a different type of vampire story. Those expecting mere blood and gore will be vastly disappointed as LIANNA'S CHILDREN is more of a thinking person's approach to vampirism. The metaphysical aspects regarding the portals are well explained and the inclusion of the historical aspect makes LIANNA'S CHILDREN a unique tale in the vampire genre.

But, as always, the late 20th Century heroes decide to take action to right this wrong, a wrong perpetrated by one of their own. The story was not too bloated (downright brisk, next to the sprawling crossovers today), moved like a good summer blockbuster movie should, and left a lasting mark on the DC Universe. That, and it boasted Dan Jurgens artwork, he also being an overlooked gem in the modern comic artwork field.Based around the idea that Parallax (former Green Lantern/now hugely powerful Hal Jordan, then a bit nuts after seeing his home city wiped out and having assaulted and bested his former masters, the Guardians of the Galaxy) wishes to redo time to save all his friends and family - and those of his cohorts, Zero Hour follows several dozen heroes as they race to save time or die trying. Along the way, that latter part is certainly fulfilled, as numerous heroes - and some villains - fall to the entropy effect Parallax is unleashing on the timeline.The original superteam, the JSA, bring the fight to Extant, a former hero-turned-megalomaniac who is aiding Parallax and reveling in the chaos unleashed. These geriatric heroes do not find an easy victory, with the whole team being changed forever. Their story here in fact laid the groundwork for James Robinson and Geoff Johns to reinvent that whole generation of heroes and identities, creating the stellar Starman and the current ongoing JSA, respectively.But really, all heroes are affected here. The build-up took place over every single issue in the DC Universe, as time shifts began to appear, characters from eras long gone or yet to come started to pop up and unexpected visitors refused to leave after arriving (current Kid Flash, then just Bart Allen, appeared in the pages of the Flash during Zero Hour's build-up). Numerous new heroes were introduced, some of whom are still around (though for how much longer...). While many hardcore fans objected to the use of Parallax/Hal Jordan as the villain - an objection taken shamefully to heart as the deceased hero has been returned to his mythic stature as a Green Lanter - for those of us who had recently started reading DC's stable of titles, the use worked very well. I thought his tragic turn fit well, but that's just me (his home city was wiped from existence, and people expected him to shrug and forget it?). His reasoning fit for what had happenedOver the course of the mini-series the whole wild story came together and in my mind, fulfilled its promise of a new DC universe, changed from what came before. It took a little time for all the ramifications to be felt - James Robinson/David S Goyer/Geoff Johns' JSA wouldn't launch for another four years and change, for example - and many of the new titles disappeared into obscurity. But that's all right. How many people remember Alexander Luthor? Who? Exactly. Created, used and forgotten in a year, as were most \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\" - the father of all these damned DC Crisis epics - created characters. Granted, not all lived, but you don't have to live to be remembered in comics. Look at Jason Todd, or Bucky...er...We see long-term fans feel the bitter weight of all these epic tales as they press on the stories today, constantly forcing judgments that are too harsh. Zero Hour came out ten years after Crisis on Infinite Earths (eh, more like nine), and was inevitably compared. The two series, however, are hard to line up. The former was a brief reboot of several titles and characters, and it did a fine job and was over in several months; the latter, the big Crisis, spanned a year and literally restarted the entire DC Universe line of titles. The newest incarnation, Infinite Crisis, is more comparable, as it had dozens of lead-in issues, on top of the 7-issue mini.Zero Hour itself covered five issues, and was entirely self-contained in those five. All I read at the time was Superman, and I didn't feel out of the loop at all . In fact, I thought it pretty crazy to see all the heroes and villains come out of the woodwork, like the JSA. Parallax came from left field, as did the deaths.It wasn't perfect, but I look back on it fondly. Few stories are really so good to earn five stars. This is a solid four star story, with great art and a terrific yarn of a plot that will satisfy many. You just have to let the story tell itself, have to let understand that not all characters can act as you want them in your fan fiction, and sometimes the greastest of heroes can become the most tragic villains. Give it a shot; you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Zero Hour: Crisis in Time","review":"After Crisis on Infinite Earths the history of the DC Universe had to be blended into one continuity, but not all of that history had been mapped out in advance and some of the continuity was a bit fuzzy. With Crisis almost a decade behind and hindsight being 20/20, Zero Hour was intended to tie up the few remaining continuity errors.I originally read this story when it came out in monthly installments and I liked it. The events here bled into other books and all kinds of time anomalies occured, like the Superboy of appeared after the death of Superman running into the young Kal-El Superboy, and a Batgirl (Barbara Gordon) from a time period before she was paralyzed showed up and joined the fight.The crossover tried to promote new characters like Damage and dealt with major shake-ups like what was happening with Guy Gardner, which is what a crossover should do. A regular Superman reader picks it up to see what happens to him and becomes interested in what's happening to Hawkman, so the reader starts buying Hawkman as well. Cross promotion of characters is the general idea here. But Guy Gardner is back to being a Green Lantern and Damage no longer has his own book, and a lot of the other things this crossover tries to promote are no longer relevant. In order to really enjoy this you would need to go and get the back issues, since most of what was happening at this time isn't collected in trades.A personal critique is that the characters who seem important in the beginning aren't the ones who seem important in the end which is just poor storytelling. Somewhere in the attempt to put in as many characters as possible, the story ends up a bit unfocused.But, as I said, I did enjoy it, and I still do. It was a story on a huge scale, time burning itself out on both ends. There were twists and turns. There were some very intriguiging paradoxes in the battle between Extant and Waverider. We understand why Parallax is doing what he's doing but at the same time we know he has to be stopped. The artwork is good, and lots of characters make cameos (not quite as many as in Crisis but still a lot).Keep in mind this was written before everything DC published got collected into trades. You do have to take it in context. And I highly recommend going to you local comic store and picking up the Zero Hour crossover issues of Superman, Batman, etc. They're definately worth reading."},{"Title":"Zero Hour: Crisis in Time","review":"Duuuude, welcome to the 90's where Superman has AWESOME longhair, Guy Gardner is called WARRIOR!! and Rob Leifeld is sending shockwaves through the industry with his.... well... there was a reason I went the entire decade without purchasing a single comic book.Here's a confession. I start my reviews well before I finish reading a book and my review for Zero Hour was shaping up to be pretty harsh. The first issue of Zero Hour is both the most poorly written and features the worst artwork. My experience with Zero Hour was similar to when I read \\"The Great Darkness Saga\\". At first I couldn't fathom why so many people considered it to be one of the all time great comic storylines and Paul Levitz writing was to put it politely, not good. By the end, however, I was a total convert. Zero Hour isn't as well regarded but it definitely improves as it progresses to an explosive and satisfying ending.Warning, I make no attempt to avoid spoilers....Zero Hour was shaping up to be yet ANOTHER story of the DC heroes teaming up to save the universe from being consumed. Nowadays it seems like the DC heroes are saving the universe about as often as I go in for a physical. One wonders why they're so affected at this point or feel such desperation since they do it all the time. The story felt like a watered down version of Crisis on Infinite Earths until the big reveal of the power behind Extant. I'd had knowledge of the events of Zero Hour but I'd forgotten that Hal Jordon, now self renamed as Parallax, was attempting to recreate the universe in order to \\"fix\\" it and restore Coast City. Long before Jordon stepped forward it dawned on me who the man in the shadows was but it still was a powerful moment. Sadly, DC comics wimped out and years later decided that Parallax was a separate entity controlling Hal Jordon. It's crystal clear that Dan Jurgen intended for Hal Jordon to be acting under his own motivation having snapped from the tragic events of the previous years and the story works much better as Jurgen intended it.What sets Zero Hour apart from Crisis on Infinite Earths is that there is a certain level of ambiguity about whether the villain is actually a villain. You never question whether the Anti-Monitor is villainous but in this story you're talking about Hal Jordon trying to restore his hometown even if his methods are horrific. In this sense it's more like Watchmen with readers able to debate whether Ozymandias's actions could actually be regarded as benevolent in the end. Even some of the heroes side with Jordon seeing wisdom in his cause. After reading Zero Hour I have to say that Infinite Crisis, a series I really enjoyed, feels like it rips off this mini-series heavily with Alexander Luthor replacing Parallax and Superboy Prime standing in for Extant. On the other hand, the conclusion of Zero Hour steals from Crisis on Infinite Earths where Dr. Light was used as a conduit for the energy attacks of various heroes to blast the Anti-Monitor. In Zero Hour the character Damage becomes the conduit. There is a ton of pseudoscientific gobbledygook and I learned that just about any problem can be solved by, \\"pouring energy into it\\". Need to widen a Boom Tube? Pour energy into it. Tear in the fabric of space and time? Throw a Mobius Chair at it and pour energy into it. Another way to close a time rift is to, \\"race away from the rift fast enough to create your own vortex-- then double back through it at ultimate speed-- right into the heart of the rift which may cause a powerful shockwave that will collapse it\\" And the cool thing is, it always works. I have to wonder if the JLA fixes a clogged toilet by focusing all their energy attacks on it in one concentrated blast.I don't regret buying Zero Hour one bit and say what you will it really is a major event in the history of DC comics. Crisis on Infinite Earths was better and in my opinion so was Infinite Crisis but Zero Hour carves its own nitch. Jordon becoming Parallax was pretty darn cool until DC undid it. I also have to say that Extant's costume is one for the ages and I loved the way his identity kept changing. If you're a fan of DC comics this is one you should probably own.So that's my review but let me close with a brief rant on the state of the comic industry. I didn't buy comics in the 90's because they were just too Kewl for my simple tastes. Actually, I was busy finishing college and finding a job and the cost just didn't factor into my life at the time. Zero Hour is a good analogy for the 90's. In Zero Hour a rift was consuming time while in the comic industry the publishers were burning the candle at both ends. The comic industry has always had a carnival barker type atmosphere with covers promising the most shocking, amazing stories ever but in the 90's they ramped it up to the nth degree with publishers more than subtly implying that the comics were serious collectables. Great writing was downplayed as publishers focused on pushing first appearances, issue number 1's (and 0's), character deaths, variant covers and *Good God* sealed comics never even meant to be read. Sure, you might have an issue of Spiderman but do you have the 3D, holofoil, glow in the dark, die cut, signed and numbered, limited edition variant cover? And these gimmicks worked like a charm... for awhile. And when collectors discovered that these are lousy collectables they naturally felt burned. There was a lot of bad writing and art shipped on high quality paper but wrapping an old fish in velvet instead of newspaper doesn't make it smell any better. The aftermath of Zero Hour was a major gimmick that saw all the DC titles restart with issue #0. Some of the monster hits of the 90's could sell in excess of 1 million copies and today it's rare for any comic to break the 100k mark in any month. Even today I've skipped Brightest Day and Flashpoint because the buzz just wasn't all that good. If comics are to regain their numbers it will have to be with better writing and a reboot of the DC universe with the same mediocre stories just isn't going to do it. Zero Hour didn't create these problems but it was definitely at the eye of the storm."},{"Title":"Zero Hour: Crisis in Time","review":"I was a little disappointed with this book.

It did a good job of clearing up a lot of continuity errors that were left after Crisis, but also added a lot of unneceserry items such as Catwoman's new origin. The use of Hal Jordan as a villain was a good tool, but at the same time wasted decades of great continuity used for this special character in order to attract more readers. Scenes that were memorable were Ollie Queen killing his best friends and The heroes themselves creating the big bang.It would have recieved 5 stars if these events were spread farther throughout the story instead of at the last ten pages."},{"Title":"Zero Hour: Crisis in Time","review":"Zero Hour: Crisis in Time is probably one of the best DCU storylines ever created. Saving Hal Jordan for something this big wasn't a sign of poor sales, but of good taste. He deserved to be a big player, but only so many stories can be done about a character with no fear. Anyway, if you hear someone bad-mouthing this story, they're WRONG! The only reason that people think it was a rip-off on &quot;Crisis&quot; was because of the fact that both villains of these storylines were smart enough to get a head start on destroying all the worlds without heroes! Besides, if you wanted to destroy all reality, what better force to use then the end of time itself? This is a great read, and no one that has really read it and looked into it can say anything otherwise."},{"Title":"Zero Hour: Crisis in Time","review":"Zero Hour came as quite a disappointment to me. I am a sucker for a company wide team up story, and a big fan of Green Lantern, but this story just didn't resonate with me. At the end there are a few good pages involving Green Arrow and his conflicted emotional reaction to the situation. But as a whole it is just lackluster storytelling.If you want to see all your favorite DC heroes band together, do your self a favor and read Final Night, one of the Crisis on Multiple Earth books, or better yet just re-read Crisis on Infinite Earths."},{"Title":"Zero Hour: Crisis in Time","review":"It was about time I looked on Amazon to get this comic!!! it took 5 minutes to find this book I was looking for ages and fast delivery made it the best present ever! thanks"},{"Title":"Zero Hour: Crisis in Time","review":"This was writen by the same riter who killed Superman and here Jurgens destroys and then rebuilts the DCU almost from the ground up. Bascally the same Story was already written with Crises on Infinite earths, however Marv Wolfman did it much more effectively. Jurgens just could not do anything more with this."},{"Title":"International Monetary and Financial Economics (with Printed Access Card)","review":"Daniels and VanHoose have put together an easy to read, real world applicable textbook. The topics covered are upper level collegiate international finance, but it's presented in a down to earth, orderly fashion. While I would have wanted color graphs, the full examples of complex operations (derivatives hedging, theoretical currency exchange rates and the like) more than made up the difference. They separate the elitist mathematics from that which students want and need. As a college student without a lot of time, that's a huge help. The most important teaching tool used extensively throughout the book is historical data. Being able to show why in theory, give evidence, and then present the deviations takes effort. There is no easy way to explain how the central banks around the world use different tactics in thier policies, but they got through it."},{"Title":"International Monetary and Financial Economics (with Printed Access Card)","review":"this is an excellent book. period. the other guy who gave it a low rating, i challenge him to find a better book on this subject"},{"Title":"International Monetary and Financial Economics (with Printed Access Card)","review":"This book came in an awesome shape, no marks, no wear. Its practicly new. Overral awesome conditions for an used textbook. :)"},{"Title":"International Monetary and Financial Economics (with Printed Access Card)","review":"the book is new.. and the price was even more than perfect. It also arrived very quikly."},{"Title":"International Monetary and Financial Economics (with Printed Access Card)","review":"This text is definately not an 'upper level' text. It is poorly organized, essential theoretical information is left out, there are abundant, unexcusable errors, and the middle third of the book is essentially a waste of paper.The text starts off rather well, but the decision to move to derivatives, etc at the point they do and then back to a general reading on international organizations and then back again to more mathematical models is a bit odd.The information on different world events and world institutions, primarily in the middle third of the book, is written to an audience that could easily be a principles macro class.There are better books out there."},{"Title":"International Monetary and Financial Economics (with Printed Access Card)","review":"It's was brand new, it came within 4 business days and in the near future i would purchase from them again"},{"Title":"Houndstooth","review":"I have just finished reading Houndstooth by Gary Ruse, an author whose later works I have read with interest, which mostly deal with Australian themes, but this one is a very different kettle of fish.It is in the genre called Techno-Thriller which is a sort of mix of Sci-Fi and thriller which I had not really come across before, but having read this ebook, I shall certainly look for more examples of this genre.So not only was Gary Ruse ahead of his time with this novel, which he wrote in 1975 and originally published as a paper book (obviously) and has now brought out as an ebook, but has shown what a skilled writer he is in his mastery of several very different writing genres.It all revolves around a dog.....The sort of hero of this book is the dog, Major, who is sent off on a very dangerous and extremely important mission to spy on a Russian plan to upset the balance of power between Russia and the USA, and the various adventures that befall the pooch in the course of his mission. Obviously there is a full cast of both Americans and Russians who are equally engaging as characters. One of the key aspects of Gary's writing is that no one, from the dog to the nastiest Russian is a stereotype, they all have many layers to their personalities, and thus hold our interest and sympathy throughout the book.Carefully researched.Also, and this is important with this sort of story, he has done his research carefully, so the main idea is firmly based on actual research, and is not totally fanciful. Scary idea I find, having the possibility of seeing what a dog or some other creature is seeing whilst sitting at a video screen in another country.Happily though, all his research has not resulted in a book that feels more like a sort of thesis than a thriller as is so often the case with heavily researched books (Forsyth springs to mind here for that failing). Gary uses the research with a light hand, so it all seems perfectly reasonable, and one never gets the feeling one is reading a slightly fanciful article in The Scientific American.All in all, a very satisfying and gripping thriller to pass a pleasant evening's reading, and one that I enjoyed enormously and can recommend to anyone who likes thrillers. As they say, I had difficulty putting it down once I had started to read it."},{"Title":"Contemporary Pre-GED Language Arts and Reading (Contemporary's Pre-GED Series)","review":"I use this and others in the series for our correctional facility GED teaching program.
