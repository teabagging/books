It reads Nicholas Rescher's ideas into medieval Buddhism without admitting the debt or justifying the anachronism.Full ReviewBy its title and self-description this book promises to solve the greatest outstanding metaphysical problem of Buddhist philosophy: how the theory of the momentariness of being can be reconciled with the obvious regularity and continuity of events.Continuity and regularity seem to imply cumulative determination and causal interdependence over time. In principle, Buddhists shouldn't have any objection to interpreting continuity in terms of causality. Causality is a fundamental concept in Buddhism. Indeed, a core teaching establishes the \\"relativity\\" of things to one another by an appeal to their causal interdependence. Recognizing this relativity, catechized under the label pratityasamutpada, and seeing how it entails the illusoriness of existence, is a crucial step on the path to enlightenment. But seeing how this teaching can coexist with the momentariness doctrine is a tall order: how could moments be \\"atoms\\" and yet interdependent? how could their contents be both absolutely self-sufficient and relative to one another?Already Kamalashila (8th century CE) threw up his hands on this one, admitting in his commentary on the Tattvasangraha of Shantaraksita that there's no accounting why dharmas pop into and out of existence in cumulatively coherent ways (like seed-sprout-plant, etc.) rather than as an aleatoric jumble. Commentators as recent as Stcherbatsky were unable to explain how dharmas could be confined to the instant and yet causally interdependent. Following in the footsteps of Kamalashila, Stcherbatsky simply denied that the Buddhist metaphysicians really believed in causality! (See Central Conception, p. 38: \\"A cause for the Buddhists was not a real cause...\\").Murti thought the hopelessness of this problem is what motivated Nagarjuna's famous critique of \\"own-being.\\" The doctrine of momentariness turns dharmas into paradigm examples of absolutely self-sufficient substances, things wholly possessed of their own being. Since relativity (pratityasamutpada) contradicts any such a notion, it's the putative ultimateness of the moment-atoms we must give up (Central Philosophy, p. 122). The universal assault on own-being then generalizes quite logically and naturally from the special but paradigmatic case of time.Stcherbatsky and Murti only disagree on the details here. They agree that causality and momentariness are irreconcilable teachings and that thinking Buddhists really held only one or the other, not both.Kalupahana agrees that the prospects of reconciliation are hopeless, and he agrees with Murti's assessment that this is what motivated Nagarjuna's critique, but he thinks it's all moot: the Buddha never taught momentariness. The doctrine of momentariness, he believes, is an unfortunate medieval excrescence that has no defensible place in Buddhist teaching (Causality: Central Philosophy of Buddhism, ch. IV).In short, no scholar thinks the two doctrines can be reconciled. And nor do they think any of the great Buddhist philosophers imagined they could be reconciled. From the analyses of Stcherbatsky, Murti, and Kalupahana we can draw the following conclusion: Although some Buddhist thinkers may have paid lip service to both doctrines, they saw the contradictions and so were in reality committed to only one or the other, never both.But the problem isn't just how the doctrine of momentariness can be reconciled with other Buddhist teachings. It's also how it can be reconciled with phenomenology and common sense. That the Buddha didn't hold the doctrine of moments is an interesting proposition and quite plausible, but the fact is that the doctrine was tenaciously cultivated for centuries by Buddhism's greatest philosophers. What we really need to know is how this was possible. How could so many sane intelligent minds hold such a seemingly incredible doctrine? Until we can explain how they reconciled the doctrine of moments with the phenomenology of their own ordinary experience, it's premature to talk about whether it can be reconciled with classical Buddhist teachings. And it not implausible to suppose that solving the former problem will make the latter one easy if not trivial.Whoa! Now Chinchore steps into the ring. She's ready to tussle with the problem unsolved by giants like Murti and Stcherbatsky, and look out! She's gonna save the theory of moments and reveal at long last how a great Buddhist metaphysician like Dharmakirti could find the moment-theory convincing. Is she up to the challenge? Sorry, this levitatingly light-weight contender doesn't even qualify for the competition. The book is horribly disappointing. It's more prolix than this review and says nothing. There as good chunk, maybe 50 pages, just giving essentially autobiographical details as to why she allowed the topic of the book to drift as her research progressed! Her only idea is that the Buddhists can accept continuity as a contingent fact. No answer at all to the big question: why so much continuity in this unregulated series of moments? Is it really all fortuitous? Just happens that way for no reason at all?GIVEN regularity and continuity as a fortuitous fact in our experience (which is giving a lot: the whole metaphysical question is begged), she makes the comparatively unimportant point that we then construe a public world of PRESUMED causal order. No sign of her knowing that this transition from privacy to world is still fraught with difficulties, or that it is the subject of much philosophizing--of, say, Husserl's whole phenomenology, and her attempt at executing the transition shows no descriptive nuance or rigor.There's the hint of an interesting idea in her suggestion that the mind's own facultative nature (its ability to cognize) serves as the indispensable model for this construction of objective order (because e.g. causation involves the ascription of facultative properties to things). Supposedly this is the fundamental insight motivating cittamatra, the Mind-Only school of Buddhist Idealism, and supposedly this is what is being developed systematically by that cunning Dharmakirti. Actually, it's a thesis cribbed from the contemporary American philosopher Nicholas Rescher (Conceptual Idealism, A System of Pragmatic Idealism, Philosophical Standardism, etc.). In fact, at this point in the book (ca. p. 179ff.) something bizarre happens. The philosophy of Dharmakirti turns out to be nothing other than the philosophy of Nicholas Rescher, which is embedded wholesale and sometimes verbatim--with nary a mention of Rescher's name--into the exposition of medieval Buddhism!An honest book about how Rescher's ideas could be put to use in this way might have been of some value, but this book is a joke."},{"Title":"Behemoth: The structure and practice of national socialism, 1933-1944","review":"This is one of the oldest books on National Socialism.

This is a manifestation of the complexity of our world and the way humans deal with it; no matter how deep you go, there are still questions and mysteries. Some subjects are easier to study than others, but the academic who studies pornography is up against some particular problems. Lisa Z. Sigel should know. She is a professor of history who has previously written _Governing Pleasures: Pornography and Social Change in England 1815 - 1914_. In the introduction to the current book for which she is editor, _International Exposure: Perspectives on Modern European Pornography 1800 -2000_ (Rutgers University Press), she notes particular problems in the study of the subject. It is often hard to find complete collections from which to draw primary material; research on cinematic pornography might simply be illegal in some places; it is hard to get grants to do such studies; and \\"few other historical sources can so quickly get scholars arrested at customs.\\" There are, however, intrepid academics who are slogging through for us, and _International Exposure_ brings together ten of them with diverse subject matter. Sigel justifies the endeavor: pornography is a vigorous commercial activity, it provides information about types of sexual behavior by time and place, and it indicates cultural attitudes toward sexuality. Nonetheless, most of the chapters here indicate the need for further resources and study about how pornography is produced and used. If you find detailed and academic examinations of aspects of the subject interesting, you will find much here to enjoy. The themes are a grab bag, as befits an edited volume. Initial chapters have to do with Germany, England, and France in the nineteenth century; there are chapters on early twentieth century England and France as well as contemporary Britain; three on post-communist Russia, Ukraine, and Hungary; and finally a chapter on the borderless cyber-world.In an examination of obscenity laws in the German states in the first half of the nineteenth century, it is disconcerting to find few German works on the wrong side of the law that we would consider anything close to pornographic now. Books that had sexual themes even without descriptions of physical intimacy were considered obscene if they depicted an unstable social world or women who were seductresses unworthy of a man's trust. One chapter traces how the image of the flogged slave was used by abolitionists, and since the image was sadder (or more arousing), the slave was generally a female. This sort of BDSM play is very common; that it might be directly related to the slave trade is something I doubt many participants acknowledge. Sigel's own chapter is on pornography that depicted incest in Edwardian England, and gives a brief history of incest laws and the philosophy behind them. Novels on the theme proved to be a charade about the family, with mothers restricting sexuality, daughters as both eager tempters and victims, and fathers as otherwise fully respectable gentlemen. The paternal perpetrator in the charade was freed from responsibility and any taint of violence. In the chapter on the Hungarian pornographic film industry, we learn that stag films were first turned out as early as 1899; pornography has so often spurred communication technology that elsewhere Sigel says that \\"it has become a clich&eacute;d claim that pornography spearheaded the growth of Internet technologies.\\" Hungary was exporting stag films by 1910, but was displaced as a center for production by other countries. Budapest has recently risen as \\"the center of the porno world,\\" with filmmakers from around Europe coming to Hungary to make \\"Budaporn.\\" One observer wrote, \\"Pornography is an industry for Hungary, not a tragedy.\\"The tone of each chapter is serious, with plenty of references and footnotes, but given the subject matter, there is wit on display; in discussing \\"shemale\\" porn, for instance, there is reported a climactic surprise unveiling \\"as the beautiful \`girl' with feminine curves and soft skin is dramatically revealed to be genitally and often priapically male.\\" I have only mentioned here the chapters I found most interesting, but each of the ten throws its light on aspects of a large subject that no one can doubt stirs a deep human interest. There is little titillation here, much intellectualizing, and lots to think about."},{"Title":"The inside of the cup,","review":"I was given this book as a gift, finding the title interesting and intriguing.

This stranger guards his privacy and desires solitude. His luggage consists of many bottles of powders and fluids as would be used by an experimental investigator. The local general practitioner visits the stranger, and sees something he can't believe. Then someone steals money from the Reverend Bunting although he and his wife see nobody. Later Mr. & Mrs. Hall, innkeepers, see the stranger's room is empty, until the chair moves around as if possessed by spirits. When questioned by Mrs. Hall the stranger removes his nose! Then the bandages and spectacles go, and the people see no head! When the constable comes to arrest him, the man removes all his garments and disappears into thin air. The crowd tries to grab him but he escapes.Mr. Thomas Marvel, a wandering tramp, is found by this Unseen and convinced to work for him. They return to the inn to fetch books and clothing. This sets off a commotion among the people there, and another chase. The panicked people fled from the streets and locked themselves in their homes. There was a story about \\"flying money\\" that was removed from shops and inns. At another inn Marvel seeks shelter, he has escaped from the Invisible Man. When this Unseen enters to take Marvel away, a bearded American fires at the Unseen with his revolver. Later the Unseen visits a physician for treatment of his wound (his blood can be seen). The Unseen has met Dr. Kemp at college, and is fed and clothed.The Unseen explains the scientific principles of optical density in a general way. If the refractive index of a substance was lowered to that of air it would be invisible in most cases (Chapter XIX). The Unseen kept his work secret because of the thefts in the scientific world of science. But the Unseen acquired money by foul means which cursed his work! Griffin tells of the previous experiments that led to invisibility (Chapter XX). The next chapters gives Griffin's history. But Kemp has written to the police, and they arrive. Griffin escapes once again, and Kemp warns the police about what must be done (Chapter XXV). Griffin is mad and inhuman, \\"pure selfishness\\". His attempts to kill Kemp lead to his own destruction, and his body becomes visible after death (Chapter XXVIII).If accurate, this story provides a snapshot of life in London and its suburbs at that time. It also tells that carrying arms was nothing unusual. H. G. Wells shows his literary skills in making believable an impossible condition. There are those who still believe that describing something in words makes it real (like \\"childproof guns\\", etc.). Readers of Wells' later works can judge how close to the truth his writings were. This fable warns against uncontrolled scientific experiments, from poison gas to atomic bombs, or the current craze for cloning or \\"genetic modification\\" The story of unseen theft of money can also be a warning against a Private Banking Cartel and its continual devaluation of the currency to help Big Business in its struggle against small businesses and working people. In this story the people unite to terminate the Unseen; this doesn't always happen in the real world."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"H.G.Wells tells a story of a scientist who has made a wonderous breakthrough in chemestry by finding a way to make living tissue invisible.We begin in a small town in America, where a stranger has arrived at an inn run by a busybody who is intent on discovering this strangers secret. He's wrapped up in bandages, and has a rude demenaor. The scientist spends his days and nights tinkering with scientific things which she doesn't understand.

All he thinks about is himself and to have power over others. He steals from his father who, since it wasn't his money, commits suicide.

Cool, right? Well, not really. H.G. Wells' \\"The Invisible Man\\" has the sci-fi master exploring what would happen if a person took an invisibility elixir, and discovered too late that invisibility has some definite downsides. It's possibly Wells' funniest novel, but it also has some wonderfully chilling moments.A strange man arrives at a hotel in Iping, wrapped up in goggles, bandages, scarves, and heavy clothes. He spends most of his time hidden away in his room, doing odd scientific experiments, and avoiding contact with other people -- while still keeping everything except his nose hidden. Meanwhile, the local vicar and his wife are robbed by a mysterious thief... who is completely invisible.Well, you can guess what's up with the stranger -- he's an invisible man, and after a blowup with his landlady he reveals his true.... um, lack of appearance to the entire town. After a series of disastrous encounters, the Invisible Man encounters Dr. Kemp, an old friend to whom he reveals how he became invisible, and what he's done since then... as well as his malevolent plans for the future.H.G. Wells isn't really known for being a funny writer, but the first part of \\"The Invisible Man\\" is actually mildly hilarious. He writes the first third or so of the book in a fairly light, humorous style, and there are some fun scenes speckled through the story, like a homeless man dealing with the Invisible Man (\\"Not a bit of you visible--except-- You 'aven't been eatin' bread and cheese?\\").But things get much darker after Mr. Kemp enters the scene, and we find out that the Invisible Man is... well, kind of malevolent and crazy. Very crazy.And as the plot grows darker and grimmer, Wells also inserts a clever (if far-fetched even by Victorian standards) explanation for how a person could become invisible, using a mix of science and fantasy. The plot hurtles through wild chase scenes and the occasional riot, and some moments of bleak tension (\\"When dawn came to mingle its pallor with the lamp-light and cigar smoke of the dining-room, Kemp was still pacing...\\")The Invisible Man himself (aka Griffin) is a pretty mysterious character for most of the story, since all we know about him is that he's invisible.... and also kind of a jerk. I mean, the guy constantly flies off the handle and even robs a nice little old vicar. And the more we find out about him, the more malignant and insane he turns out to be.Even if you had a way to become invisible, \\"The Invisible Man\\" would be a pretty effective way of dissuading people from using it. A deserving classic."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"This novel is another story of a scientist.

Griffin has checked into a hotel in a small town in Iping. He is a tall man with a shiny pink nose. His head is wrapped in bandages, and he wears a pair of glaring blue glasses. In his room he sits in his chair, smokes his pipe, talks to himself, and does strange experiments. As soon as this man comes to town, weird things begin happening like floating furniture and unexplained robberies. What is this man doing in this small town? Citicens in this town start to hear voices and see doors and windows unlock themselves. Could this man be the cause of the occurrences? This book has many plot twists and surprises. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. While reading this book you want to know what happens next. This book will captivate all readers. The Invisible Man is an extremely exciting book that must be read!"},{"Title":"The Invisible Man (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"Better than mediocre, but not quite as good as four stars, this book is worth reading, if for no other reason than to give one a feel for the origins of the science-fiction genre. Granted, Wells is not the originator or the genre; that title probably belongs to Jules Verne, but Wells is one of the earliest contributors to the development of science fiction. &quot;The War Of The Worlds&quot;, &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, and &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; are all among the earliest treatments of seminal concepts that later become standards of the genre, and are all reasonably interesting treatments of basic ideas, treatments which are later surpassed as subsequent writers build upon the basic idea and try novel variations upon them.As a story in its own right, this book is interesting, but has a few flaws: the explanation offered for why the main character chose NOT to use theatrical makeup to &quot;pass&quot; when he needed to seem normal was unconvincing (it would take too long to remove if he needed to suddenly be invisible; not nearly a sufficiently compelling consideration to offset the obvious advantages of being able to pass in normal society). Further, since he mentions that his earliest test of his procedure turned a piece of cloth invisible, it seems silly that he didn't make himself invisible clothes to avoid the rather obvious disadvantage of needing to be naked in order to be properly invisible, during an English winter (which is when he made his experiment.) Nor does it make any sense that he would become visible once dead; if his flesh was invisible, it should have remained so.Still, in spite of all these quibbles, it is a very interesting book, and well worth the reading."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"It's very compact and good to take with you to read anywhere.

I was surprised in the similarities and differences the book has to the movie. The scenes are rearranged from the book to make visual (or invisible) sense as a movie script.A man all warped up in bandages except for his large pink nose requires a room at the inn and pays well. Slowly the Innkeeper and her companions suspect there is more to his than just a man with bandages. Everyone in a while they glimpse light where there should not be. And the stranger is so cranky that the money may not be worth the trouble of keeping him. Soon there are strange happenings and the cat is out of the bag sort of speaking.The trail leads to murderer and a possible reign of terror. Read more to find out where the secret is reviled and how a man named Griffin got in this situation.If I had read this story a year ago I would have said it was a fairly well put together sci-fi story. I would just enjoy the writing and wonder how H.G. came up with the idea. However now after reading much of H.G.'s political writings I see that this is a thinly veiled social commentary. We find that unlike the movie where Griffin goes mad in the invisibility process, that in the book Griffin was always amoral and anything stressful could set him off. Also, somewhere out there is a couple of floating eyes that belong to a cat.Now one habit that .G. has in most of his tales is that just when you think he is finished on the subject, he will go off in another direction with some sub plot he has slipped in earlier. Therefore, what should have been a short story becomes a novel.

Well's makes this man a stranger to those around him, and does not portray his character very sympathetically. He uses the science fiction genre also in a unique way, by not creating a world with cultures and lifestyles changed by technology over time, but a small town effected by sudden exposure to a man changed by science. Plus, Wells uses ordinary scenes and transforms them by having his characters convey unexpected actions and reactions.Wells 19th century English seems outdated, but dosen't keep the reader from enjoying the great adventure."},{"Title":"Aquatic entomology: The fishermen's and ecologists' illustrated guide to insects and their relatives (A Series of books in biology)","review":"I am very pleased with this text, as an up and coming fisheries biologist, I hope to use it in my future."},{"Title":"Aquatic entomology: The fishermen's and ecologists' illustrated guide to insects and their relatives (A Series of books in biology)","review":"McCafferty's authoritative work is directed at the nonspecialist, particularly anglers with a scientific bent and ecologists who are not entomologists.

There have been several regroupings at the family level since this book has been published so even if you use it correctly, you can incorrectly identify insects. Also, if you are serious about identifying aquatic insects, the family-level keys of this book are insufficient to give your work credibility. Those are the two problems with this book... 1- it is a little out of date AND 2- it is a limited tool for identifying organisms.All that aside, it is a very good book to teach the CONCEPTS of taxonomy to students. The keys have nice flow charts that teach students to make the kinds of decisions that they need identify insects.Does it have legs? Or not?Does it have wings? Or not?Does it have one claw? Or two?The keys use pictures so that the process does not become bogged down in terminology.

The illustrations alone make it worth the money. As an aquatic entomologist who teaches an aquatic entomology lab to college students, I find this book to be an invaluable source of high quality images for use in my classes. The pictorial keys are also very helpful - they are very easy to follow and make it almost a simplistic task for a lay person to identify aquatic insects down to the family level. Some of these keys are a little outdated since publication of the book, but they are still helpful for the most part.My only complaint with this book is that it doesn't go into as much scientific detail as is necessary for a serious student of entomology. Still, this isn't meant to be a textbook or an identification manual for complex identifications lower than the family level.

Unlike a lot of the reviewers I had no problem with the gender switch in the karmic group. It worked quite well in the movie *Dead Again* and worked just as well here. I adored Miz Odette and Remy as well conceived secondary characters. The bacholor party is one of my favorite scenes and one of the few places in this book where Ms. Robert's humor really shines.However, I was really annoyed with all the foreshadowing that Ms. Robert's set up then blew off. The biggest offender being all the machinations to get Remy and Effie's wedding moved to Manet Hall. Were you expecting all kinds of fireworks at the wedding as Miss Josephine's and Julian's spirits were vanquished and laid to rest? They'd been slamming doors, throwing crockery around and causing frigid bursts of air in the passage in front of the nursery. I hardly expected them to go quietly! Were you expecting the lovers to find peace? And the baby to stop crying and the clock to stop bonging? *AT THE WEDDING?* I was. The ending was such a dissapointment. Without a whimper the ghosts have suddenly found peace and are gone. After the wedding. What was up with that? It was as if Ms. Robert's had either just gotten tired of the book, or had used up her word count and wasn't willing to go back and revise.I enjoyed most of the book so will give it three stars, but even as I write this I still feel cheated by the ending.

Retooling their sound and adapting it to the current marketplace caused (along with continued indifference from their record companies) sales to plummet. It was time to move on and the band did--they broke up. Paul Stump's biography of the band documents most of this but spends too much time analyzing the band's music at the expense of telling their story. Much like his \\"Cultural biography\\" of Roxy Music Stump writes a critical analysis of the band fit for a musician but that will leave the average fan cold. He's appealing to a cult audience just as the band did. That's too bad because of all the prog rock bands that came of age during the 70's, Gentle Giant demonstrated the creativity of bands like King Crimson, Genesis and Yes even if they didn't have the sales to prove it.Stump's book focuses too much on analysis and not enough on the band's story and that's its single largest flaw. I realize that Stump wrote this book a couple of years ago originally but this new edition (with a 2005 copyright) could have benefited from new info and a couple ofnew chapters. I'd also hardly call Stump's style \\"breezy\\"--pretentious and stuffy might be a better description of his style. It makes slogging through the book to find the minimal information about the recording of each album frustrating to say the least. Couldn't Stump have interviewed their recording engineer for stories about the recording sessions even if the band wasn't willing to talk about them? Geir Hasnaes' 20 page analysis of the band's music over time was more incisive discussing the same material that Stump does about the band's music. With the release of \\"Under Construction\\" and other posthumous CDs there was a lot of material out there to lend itself to analyzing the band's sound. These releases are barely mentioned.If Stump could have wrangled new extensive interviews with members of the band it would have helped the book as well. I personally was more interested hearing from Ray, Derek and Phil Shulman and their bandmates than hearing from Stump. The book reminds me of \\"Revolution in the Head\\" a book about The Beatles and their music. While spending a lot of time understanding the music is important it's also important to have a better sense of the climate and culture that surrounded Gentle Giant (and even the record company indifference). Stump should look to books like \\"Without You: The Tragic Story of Badfinger\\" by Dan Matovina which manages to balance a discussion of the conflicts that drove the band, their music, the climate and their audience in telling a complete overview of the band's history.Nevertheless, Stump's book has merit. You'll disagree with some of his analysis. For example he cites \\"The Power and the Glory\\" as Gentle Giant's most cohesive album. I think that most fans would disagree with that assessment. He also dismisses marvelous songs such as \\"Think of Me with Kindness\\" when its probably one of the band's most heartfelt and emotionally powerful songs on \\"Octopus\\". At 192 pages this book gives short shift to the band's history and their struggles. While the music was and is important its the struggles the band went through that informed their music and creativity and understanding that is just as important as discussing the use of counterpoint and musical theory.Mostof the research he's done for the book is excellent there are the stray facts that are incorrect (for example the band's last scheduled performance was at the Old Waldorf a rock and comedy nightclub in San Francisco not the Old Waldorf Hotel. The latter doesn't exist in the city and never did). The photos are welcome but could have been more extensive. Let's see what the band looks like now. What about interviewing Phil Shulman who was forced out of the band by his brothers after \\"Octopus\\". Shulman has done recent interviews so why not get his perspective at least on the band's early days? Derek Shulman's label DRT recently reissued most of the band's back catalog so what better timing to try and interview him? Stump's book on Roxy Music by comparison is twice as long covering roughly the same time frame.I was a bit underwhelmed and disappointed by Stump's book. This is a band that deserves greater recognition. \\"Acquiring the Taste\\" does what I suppose all books about music should do--it makes you want to seek out their albums and listen to them. As a biography though it leaves the fan and newcomer hungry for more than just a \\"taste\\"."},{"Title":"Gentle Giant: Acquiring The Taste","review":"Sorry Mr. Stump. Geir Hasnes should have written this book as his essay was wonderfully informative and straight forward.I don't like giving a bad review of anything or anyone and I can usually find something good to say about anything. I don't want to dis the book because if it alerts others to Gentle Giant, then it has served its purpose to a degree. That being said I can hold it in no longer.This book comes across as a high school draft of an idea about Gentle Giant's story and 'Prog' rocks origins which are two separate topics for two separate books that are both horribly handled here. The title of the book does not alert the reader that the author will be sniffily pontifiactingabout those musical origins when you are expecting a well researched bio of an amazing band. The information could have been integrated in a better way but seems to be shoe horned in where ever it'll almost fit.Not one of the seven surviving members of the band who are all still active in the business to a degree and still administer GGs product were seemingly not interviewed for the book as there is a long list of copied interviews from their heyday in the 70's. That is justlazy. That he consistantly glosses over certain details about their touring life with the repeated 'Reportedly this or that\\" compounds the laziness.Yet he goes far to create this weird prose that would fit more in a book of fiction than a musical biography. He also seems at odds with himself as to whether he actually likes the band or not. In one sentence he will dismiss a particular performance or song and then hail it as a masterpiece in the next sentence.Critisizm is fine as long as one is consistant about what one feels is weak or strong.Chronologically it is all over the place and without any reason other than to accomodate an off topic tangent, which happens alot in this book.If that weren't bad enough I would have to think that he was purposely using words obviously gleaned from a Thesaurus as some kind of private joke. Gentle Giants story ends up being a secondary character behind this God awful writing. Sounds like just another failed writer who has turned to music critisizm to pay his rent and is bitter about it and takes it out on his subject matter. I've met too many of this type of music critic and they are like mushy peas in a pod. As Frank Zappa has said,(paraphrasing),\\" Writing about music is like dancing about architecture.\\"This book proves Frank was correct"},{"Title":"Gentle Giant: Acquiring The Taste","review":"Paul Stump's previous works \\"The Music is All that Matters,\\" and \\"Digital Gothic,\\" prepared me for an exhaustive, incisive, piece written in a volcanic style, but this too-slim volume about one of the most beloved (and least successful) of the golden age Prog bands was less than I had hoped for. Having first heard of this book two years ago, and having unsuccesfully ordered it four or five times, I was finally rewarded by it's unexpected arrival a few months ago. Rather like the fabled prodigal, I put rather too much hope on Stumps book to fill the void in my life that constituted my love for vintage bands like Gentle Giant.If you love or are even interested in Gentle Giant, then Gentle Giant: Acquiring the Taste is a good place to start. The band was a family affair, begun by three brothers awash in the British music scene of the 1960's. Derek, Phil, and Ray Shulman began as would-be pop stars in Simon DuPre and the Big Sound. The evolution of their music from the beguiling \\"Kites,\\" their semi-hit of 1967, to the utterly anti-commercial music of the Gentle Giant years is the important mystery. Stump illuminates this transition from Psyhedelic to Prog rock with his usual clarity and deftness, making clear the motivation forces behind the band's complex music.Financial rewards always eluded the band, because, as Stump theorized, the emphasized their American audiences, who were loyal, if small, over their European ones who were larger and equally loyal. Stump also posits that bad luck, among other problems doomed the band. But consider that Gentle Giant put out eleven albums, only one of which was a live performance, the band's so-called failure becomes less clear. So they never had a million seller, so they never made the cover of Rolling Stone, they still had a respectable career. Stump invests a lot in promulgating this aura of America as the graveyard of mid-level English bands like Gentle Giant, but the two shows I saw in 1976-1977 in Philadelphia were packed and enthusiastic. I knew about and bought the import album \\"In a Glass House.\\"But there's the problem: myopia. I and my friends went out of our way to see the band and buy their albums, but as my friend Roger says \\"I saw Gentle Giant twice, but never bothered to see Led Zeppelin at their peak.\\" Maybe Stump is right: maybe GG should have toured Italy over and over, but if financial success was the only issue for the band, then they ought to have written different music.Gentle Giant: Acquiring the Taste is bittersweet, but if you loved the band, worth reading. The book includes a musical disquisition by Geir Hasnes that defines how Gentle Giant did what they did musically.Listen, if you saw GG in the 1970's, you saw the tightest, most organized, original musical group in the world. Underrated, yes, but highly influencial in modern Prog."},{"Title":"Gentle Giant: Acquiring The Taste","review":"Well i suppose ang gentle giant book is better than none, but this is a let down. The pictures are limited and very dark and grainy and almost added as an afterthought, but it is Stump's writing that is my big bug bearer. The reason that prog was so derided in the late '70's (though i continued to love it) was it's pretenciousness and the last chapter in this book where Stump analizes gentle giant's influences is more fuel to the fire of those that hate this sort of music. Come on Paul where do these notions come from? I'm sure the band didn't sit down and say 'let's put this influence here and be even more pompous!'It's good music for goodness sake and i don't need to be told the where's and why's as if i'm studying for some degree. No wonder you suggest not reading this chapter! As for the rest well a lot seems to be taken from the media of the time and there doesn't seem to be any co-operation from the band. I didn't appreciate the digs at other bands (ie Poco) that didn't fit into your blinkered view of what is good music.At the end of this i came away not knowing much more about Gentle Giant that i couldn't find out on the internet.

So it's good for that reason."},{"Title":"Gentle Giant: Acquiring The Taste","review":"It was not at all surprising that Stump had not been granted an interview with the band members given the baseless negativity of his remarks in his previous book. What was really surprising was a discovery that he does not know the subject. It sounds almost inconceivable that an author may not know what he's writing about, but it seems to be the case here. As with his previous book, Stump gathers a lot of information and thoroughly compiles it (this is why the 2-, not 1-star rating, still worth a read, lots of factual material) but when it comes to his own opinion you can clearly see his lack of understanding (conversely, whenever his \\"judgments\\" are a mere compilation of someone's views, it is more of a substance). Not only he doesn't understand their music, it seems he's barely listened to all their albums as his statements about their songs and records look more like a hastily constructed, long overdue high school paper- you have to write something, anything, and get it over with, no interest in the project whatsoever. Here's an example: \\"In A Glass House... is easily the longest, and also Gentle Giant's most calculated [album]. It's certainly a more approachable effort than any of their previous four, even including Three Friends.\\" (P. 71, picked it nearly at random). The original album is about 38 minutes, a usual duration of any other GG album. The CD includes bonus tracks, depending on the release it adds another 15-20 minutes to it. Is that what made it longer in Stump's eyes? Added up in a hurry without reading the label? And Three Friends is certainly a more approachable effort than In a Glass House. In parts it sounds too \\"simplistic\\" for GG. I've heard that GG did not like Three Friends and never promoted it although it's an excellent record in my view.One logical explanation of the possible reasons behind this unusual approach could be pure economics. The history of Stump's publications shows an obvious pattern. Tangerine Dream, Roxy Music, John McLaughlin (Mahavishnu Orchestra). Make no mistake, the pattern is not Progressive Rock. It's rather the esoteric nature of the subjects of all his books. All bands he writes about had a cult following. Rarely, if at all, had books been written about them. Assuming there are 100k fans per band worldwide, if only 20-30% buy a book, it makes it worthwhile to put it to print."},{"Title":"Gentle Giant: Acquiring The Taste","review":"The book was long overdue, but well worth the wait.

It is true that some familiarity with Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Derrida would be helpful in understanding the arguments and in appreciating the striking literary quality of this work. However, what Caputo deals with is fundamental and goes well beyond commentary on any single thinker. His fundamental thesis is that ethics is without any substantial ground beyond the simple and elusive happening of obligation which Caputo valorizes. Ethics becomes something that is dangerous. It is shown that the dangerousness of ethics is vital, that there is no greater danger to ethics than making ethics 'safe'. I think this book would be perfect if some of his criticism of Heidegger didn't occasionally verge on being just rhetoric. Heidegger is more of an ethical thinker than Caputo - a longtime Heidegger scholar - seems willing to recognize in the wake of the Nazism scandals.

Challenging read, one should have a background in continental philosophy and Nietzsche, not a book for beginners."},{"Title":"Against Ethics: Contributions to a Poetics of Obligation with Constant Reference to Deconstruction (Studies in Continental Thought)","review":"John Caputo (a Kierkegaardian pseudonym no doubt--so we will call him by his real name, Jack) uses his shocking, satirical, deconstructive voice in an impish, wild dance \\"Against Ethics.\\" Don't get me wrong, he is very serious--an intellectual Monty Python with teeth. He skewers the philosophical and human history of those who would step over the line and presume to \\"know\\" what is the truth, and thereby contribute to the misery of humanity--commonly known as the violent error of self-righteousness--which leaves dead bodies, literally and personally, in its wake.He skewers Hegel, Heidiegger and even the more careful Merleau Ponty (who, granted, slips into idealism at times) for trying to claim a perfect world, a shinny world, a perfectly embodied world and thereby evade the imperfect, the dull, and the broken-bodied of this world.If you woke up one morning as Kafka's cockroach in Metamorphosis, Jack would be right there by your side, rubbing shoulders with you as you waddled through the dusty corners of life-- not trying to eliminate your pestiness with the ethics of RAID. He is against the mean spirited nihilism of Nietzche (p. 235), but he loves the deconstructed shadows that follow in his wake (and that of Derrida).No, Jack is more of a court jester, a wise guy, a master of word play and language games in order to undercut false authority, harmful judgment and narcissism. While he claims to have minimal knowledge of truth, plays the humble card and keeps a low profile--he is all the while keeping close watch on you, lest you make one false step of claiming too much--which is nearly anything--since all propositions propose too much.He in fact deconstructs judging as: \\"not primarily a matter of applying the law, but of lifting the law\\" \\". . . in order to judge what is happening\\" (pp. 108, 106). And \\"Forgiving is just forgetting\\" (p. 110)--It never happened--forget about it.Rather than attempt to unravel the phenomenological riddle of being and of bodies of sound mind and physical health, Jack prefers to focus on flesh. Not the healthy embodied/world existence of Merleau Ponty's flesh, but of human flesh that is bruised and cut and bloodied. Because that is what happens as a result of the inescapable obligation that the Other (person) brings to each of us.We are fundamentally challenged to respond by either reaching out and touching the Other(s) around us, or by hitting, rejecting avoiding their obligation on us. And we can never trust that our reaching out and touching others is true altruism, because we are impossibly selfish, and in fundamental ways, rejecting, so that we hit and hurt, literally or otherwise. That's what we do, and that is not ok, so we are in deep need to forget about it.Despite his scandalous, dark and satirical intentions, there are occasional bright spots in the abyss:\\"What is at issue is not the purpose of what happens but whether one rejoices in what is happening, whether what is happening is a joy or a disaster, or something in between\\" (p. 233)\\"The point is not the \`meaning' of events but rather the 'joie de vivre,' the joy of ordinary life, of our days and works, of the finite, immanent, intermediary goals of daily life, the surpassing joy of the day-to-day, or work and companionship, the exultation in the ordinary, which is, after all, what there is\\" (p. 234)\\"My interest lies with people so exposed to the abyss by which events are inhabited that they cannot get as far as ordinary life and its ordinary joys and sorrows\\" (p. 235)\\"Faith is not a way of escaping what happens, but a way of interpreting it and coming to grips with it\\" (p. 245)It is not by accident that there are echoes of the Sermon on the Mount throughout \\"Against Ethics\\".P.S. This book makes most sense if you are a continental philosopher, have a stomach for satire, word play and life's impossibilities.P.S.S: St. Augustine's seventh homily on the First Epistle of John, paragraph 8:Once for all, then, a short precept is given you:Love, and do what you will:whether you hold your peace,through love hold your peace;whether you cry out, through love cry out;whether you correct, through love correct;whether you spare, through love do you spare:let the root of love be within,of this root can nothing spring but what is good.With love in Christ."},{"Title":"Against Ethics: Contributions to a Poetics of Obligation with Constant Reference to Deconstruction (Studies in Continental Thought)","review":"For those who live their philosophical problems this book is essential.

It was at this point that the author introduced the discussion of justice, and this with somewhat surprising reverence. He cites Derrida as saying, \\"Justice in itself, if such a thing exists, outside or beyond the law, is not deconstructable.\\" Now Caputo, eager to line up behind his hero Derrida, runs wild with this.His polemic for the value of justice would be somewhat more bearable if he didn't refer to the \\"innocent suffering\\" of people. Innocent entails the existence of guilt and suffering is implied to be 'evil', so that what he is really saying is for someone to suffer injustice is unethical, otherwise we could not speak of 'innocence.' He does not go so far as to write that we can speak of what justice or injustice actually is, but makes it quite clear that such injustices do exist; the implications of 'innocent suffering' demand it, for what is to say suffering is 'good' or 'bad' that we should think anything at all of it? The whole chapter seemed to me to be an underhanded attempt to encourage a tolerance for pluarity as long as there is no 'innocent suffering' . . . an obvious attempt to label such acts as murder, rape, genocide, etc., objectively undesirable because they create innocent suffering, while trying to maintain that ethics are subjective, which strikes me as being somewhat odd and ideologically/politcally motivated.Fortunately, the idea of innocence does not creep far into the book and later chapters restore the radicalism of ethics."},{"Title":"Against Ethics: Contributions to a Poetics of Obligation with Constant Reference to Deconstruction (Studies in Continental Thought)","review":"This is a great book, although it really is a bitch to read.

It is a tale of how one's man's perfect life comes crashing down on him due to terrifying and unimaginable events.Meet Mitch Talon; a hard-working and honest man who wants to live a peaceful life. Once he finds the woman he so deeply loves, everything seems perfect and set. That is, until fate steps in and causes his wife, who is bearing unborn twins at the time, to die in a hit and run. Mitch Talon knows that somebody must pay, and that someone will pay with his life. And that is only the beginning of a quest for vengeance and redemption. That's as far as I will go, because this novel is filled with many twists and surprises for you to uncover.This was a great page-turner, which did not disappoint me.

But then it took off! After you get into the story, you realize the first few chapters are just to set up the rest of the book, and hopefully, a whole series. I love the whole premise, that is, a lone gunman type of hero, or even sometimes, antihero. I found myself cheering for the main character, even when he was on a killing spree. In Gunslinger, Tufts has created a main character that Joe Average can identify with. If you grew up reading the likes of Louis L'Amour, you'll love this book!

Years later, I struck out on my own like many people did in the 1970s, looking for answers outside of the Catholic Church.Still, throughout my life, I kept a close relationship with my Catholic roots and in particular treasured this book, which had been my mother's when she was little. I have the original copy with a delicate line drawing of Jesus and Dilecta, the little girl in the story with whom I had so closely identified, on the cover. The image of that cover stayed with me throughout my life when I had inadvertently misplaced my copy among the many boxes of books one accumulates over one's lifetime.I recently rediscovered my copy and am now ready to send out new copies to any child that I think would appreciate its gentle story of goodness and kindness that are not confined to Christianity but certainly reflect the true message and teachings of Christ.If someone is looking for a simple, clear and yet profound way to reach the heart of a child about the role of God, Jesus and moral strength through the Roman Catholic religion, this is the book to get them. Many adults would do well to read it too, and reaquaint themselves with Jesus's example and message to us, so many years later. It resonates with crystal precision through Mother Mary Loyola's own life story and the dear little book she left us as only one of her lasting legacies."},{"Title":"The King of The Golden City: An Allegory for Children","review":"Wonderful allegory that explains clearly the teachings of the Catholic Church. My 7 yo asked if we could read it again before we finished it and I have been taking it to Holy Hour with me to study it more deeply."},{"Title":"The King of The Golden City: An Allegory for Children","review":"This book is so beautiful in gently explaining our relationship with Jesus. It hits at so many different levels that it is a great read aloud for the whole family. It is especially important for the child beginning to make her first sacraments. I highly recommend the CD AND the study guide. I didn't think I needed the study guide and when I'd gotten it I couldn't believe all the symbolism I'd missed. THis is a beautiful classic that every parent and child should share."},{"Title":"The King of The Golden City: An Allegory for Children","review":"For children AND adults alike. We are reading it as a family for the second time, it is a great allegory of our journey with God to the Promised Land. It is faithful to Catholic teaching throughout although I see only a few chapters that may bother our Protestant brethren. The comprehension and activities at the end are helpful and I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"The King of The Golden City: An Allegory for Children","review":"A must have for learning self control and mastery. A lost art in today's society. Children and adults will benefit especially from the chapter on the little person called SELF."},{"Title":"The King of The Golden City: An Allegory for Children","review":"I read \\"The King of the Golden City\\" with my children this year as part of our homeschool religion program. It had come well-recommended by friends, and as I read this aloud with my children, I completely understood why.This story was originally written in 1921 by Mother Mary Loyola of the Bar Convent in York, England, in response to a student's request for a story to help her prepare for her First Holy Communion. While this story can certainly help prepare one for that special event (and all the Communions that come after), it is more accurately described as a preparation for life.My children are quickly embarking on that stage of life where they will make so many decisions about the course that their life will take. They will face peer pressure and the call of the secular world and all the \\"goods\\" that the world can offer. This book illustrates all of those temptations, and the importance of focusing on what matters.Even as an adult devoted to serving God, I found much to take away from these pages. The story of young Dilecta and her visits from the King as He desires to bring her closer to Him tells of the desire of Jesus for each of us. My children easily picked out the majority of the allegorical images. What they didn't understand at first reading, I was able to help them with. There is also a very helpful study guide included, which can be adapted as needed for the age of the reader - from child to adult.This makes an excellent read-aloud book, even for children old enough to read well. Reading it aloud allows it to be discussed as needed. We read two chapters per week, once a week. My children looked forward to it every time. I highly recommend this book, either as part of a homeschool program, or simply as part of family faith formation."},{"Title":"The King of The Golden City: An Allegory for Children","review":"I just finished reading this book to my 8-year-old daughter last night. She was so glad that Dilecta finally got to the Golden City! Clearly she did not realize this meant that the little girl died.I have mixed feelings about this book. The theology seems to be sound Catholic doctrine, but the lanugage and usage are now so old-fashioned that I often had to stop and explain what the writer was saying.My daughter enjoyed the book. I wanted to love it and be moved by it, but I didn't and wasn't. I think if your child is familiar with older, pious Catholic texts then this is a great book for you. Maybe (like my daughter) your children will enjoy it even if the language seems strange."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Being a young American, the horrors that took place during this ordeal is rarely talked about to our younger generations.

From start to finish, the information within this book is amazing. With in depth accounts from the \\"guests\\" and their \\"hosts\\", Bowden makes you feel like you were actually there and allows you to feel the pain and uncertainty of the American's involved.I wish that everyone in America and the world could read this book, and realize that the terrorism and US/Middle East trouble that we face in this world is nothing new. We live in a scary world, filled with people that have different ideas of their \\"perfect utopia\\". With extremely different views from the people of the world, struggles are inevitable.

Great book!"},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"This book provides an excellent explanation of the crisis, which partly cost Jimmy Carter the election and where America should have conducted its first \\"War On Terror\\" (perhaps, that would have dealt with the current \\"president\\" of Iran and the others with him sooner, rather than later, and he wouldn't have come to the U.S.). True, the U.S. shouldn't have let the Shah in, but it wasn't right for the \\"students\\", including the current \\"president\\" of Iran to take people hostage. I applaud all those who stood up to these thugs, and Bowden gives great detail. He also provides excellent notes and descriptions of what happened to the hostages, after their release. I have my own thoughts about what should have happened, after our people arrived safely in the U.S., but I won't go into them here. Suffice it to say that if anyone wants to understand why we are having the troubles we are with Iran, read this. I wouldn't have wanted to have been in former President Carter's position. I think it was a betrayal, after what the hostages went through, that the U.S., in the succeeding administration, did \\"deals\\" with these people, and admitting this \\"terrorist thug\\" [Ahmenejad] into our country recently; a former hostage taker, but this is an example how our political system works.

It is very well written in that one can really sense the mind-set of the individuals (whether American or Iranian) involved during the US Embassy take-over. It also shed new light for me regarding President Carter's handling of the situation. This may sound spiritual but the book inclined me to think that Carter was the president at the time for a reason.

This book deserves it. I was quite young when the hostagee crisis happened but I still remember the images on TV. So I looked forward to reading the story behind the headlines and Bowden did not dissapoint. This guy is a really good writer. He really knows how to tell a story. I thought it was remarkable that he got access to the hostage takers themselves for interviews. But that's what makes this book so good- you get a full picture. The author does not hide his opinions about what happened. At times he comes down pretty firmly against the actions of some people back in the states - particularly the peace delegation, which when viewed through the hostage's eyewiteness accounts seems to deserve it. He does give a much more compassionate view of those trying to get the hostages home, an agonizing one step forward, two steps back operation. However I didn't find his opinions distracting. His passion makes the story more compelling, drawing out each person's character in rich detail. And one might argue it would make dry reading to be completely neutral. He still gives you enough information to form your own opinions. And this is the key to the book's current relevance- there's a lot of Aha! moments as you read this and make the connection with Iran today. Iran itself becomes a lead character in the book with Bowden's meticulous research. It's not merely a telling of the captivity of Americans but also about the ideology struggle being waged in the country. Overall a timely, gripping and informative book."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"I was born in 1973, so I was too young to understand what was going on. This event was never covered in detail in either my hs or college US history classes. The author does an outstanding job of setting the stage for the hostage crisis, as well as describing the underlying complexities that kept the crisis going for 444 days. I found the book to be very insightful, comprehensive and terribly interesting. I hate to use the word entertaining... but it was difficult to put the book down. Any scholarly high school or college student will find this book to be remarkably informatative, and any folks who have long since forgotten the crisis that gripped our nation, should plow through this book to gain a deeper appreciation of the crisis and those who bravely lived through it."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"In \\"Guests Of The Ayatollah\\" author Mark Bowden again lays out in detail a remarkable event of our times. As is typical of this experienced author, he re-creates the prevailing mood of the period and the background and thinking of the major players in the saga itself.From here, he narrates the experiences of many of the hostages over that extended period of time. Some heroic, others near-treasonous, with dashes of humor as all of them fought to overcome the anxiety and boredom of the 444 day confinement.I found the extended narrative detailing Operation Eagle Claw, the military attempt to free the hostages, both interesting and revealing. This is always difficult to do when the outcome of the event is already known, but Bowden does it well. He reminds us that Delta Force had just been formed and Special Operations was an untried theory in modern warfare. With Eagle Claw being their first operation, Bowden narrates their despair at it's failure, and fear that the concept itself was doomed. As we now know, the theory is sound, and Eagle Claw was a huge case of Murphy's Law in action, where many lessons were learned.Bowden ends the book with a large section of \\"where are they now\\" narrative concerning the players on both sides of the conflict. Armed with the axiom that events are always clearer in the rear-view mirror than they are in the windshield, he questioned both sides on their thinking during the period as opposed to their current opinions of that long-ago time. Again, very interesting and informative.A pretty tough read at 680 pages, but the author will keep you turning the pages. A 5-star effort, and for those who appreciate well-written detail of historical events will find this an excellent read."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Having been an adult in 1979, I knew the basics of this story--Iranian Islamic Revolution; Shah leaves for US for cancer treatment; students take over US Embassy in Tehran and hold 50+ US citizens hostage for more than a year. Military rescue mission fails spectacularly. Carter loses chance for second term as country agonizes. Carter negotiates release, which Iran allows on the day that Reagan takes office. Now I'm familiar with the details, which Bowden relates expertly based on exhaustive research started in 2001. Bowden gives the book its deserved historical context, describing the hostage crisis as the first battle in the war with militant Islam, although the tactics of 1980 seem almost quaint by post-9/11 standards. Carter took a lot of heat over the incident, but the ultimate survival of the hostages is a testimony to both his patience and humanity. The story makes me wonder why people would go into foreign service, but like a lot of professions, dangers of this magnitude are few and far between. Make sure you're interested in learning more--at 650 pages, \\"Guests\\" provides a lot of information."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"I like to read Mark Bowden for his clear prose and his ablity to to tell a tale.So I make a point to read his work. This is a great book at the right time. In my view if we want to understand why we face the mess we see in the Middle East, we need to read his book and learn from it. We need to see how Iran's leadership was the first and remains the most active worry to our Nation They really mean what they say about death to USA.That said make a point to read his closing and take hope, these guys can not in the long run win, but we are sure are helping them with the way Bush and his boys play to them for the same reason they use us as wipping boys to build up a base to control power."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Mark Bowden delivers his excellent work at another crucial point in the relations between Iran and the wider world. Iran somehow identifies itself primarily in its opposition to the United States, whether it be the Olympic loss of the US basketball team or the one-term presidency of Jimmy Carter. \\"Guests of the Ayatollah\\" is mostly composed of the experiences of the hostages, but by placing the events in a larger global context Mark Bowden creates an extremely relevant and compelling work. Bowden's recent visits to Iran to interview some of the hostage-takers reveal a rainbow of opinion, some are embarassed by their youthful enthusiasm, and others who have parlayed the events of 1979 into political careers. Dropping the dramatic movie-script style of Black Hawk Down, Bowden still delivers a taut, interesting, and as usual, insightful book.This is Bowden's third work to incorporate Delta Force, \\"Black Hawk Down\\" and \\"Killing Pablo\\" being the other two. Bowden seems like an unofficial Delta biographer now, and he has obviously established a relationship with the elite force, with contacts on the inside. His breakdown of the attempted hostage rescue and the resultant Desert One fiasco is fair and complete.Mr. Bowden ends with a summation of Iran today, and what he labels the \\"mullahocracy.\\" He frequently points out the contradictory beliefs that Iranians hold to be true, their utterly fantastical notions of CIA omnipresence, and the desire of so many within the country to modernize. It is an important book for those interested in US/Iranian relations, and it is also a great study of sixty-six people caught up in global affairs, and their widely varying responses to stress and imprisonment."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"This book not only provides a great insight as to the inadequacy of the Carter administration but an inside view of what is what like for each of the hostages.This should also be required reading for anyone who wants to know what we are dealing with both inside the US and the Islamists."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"If you want to see into the minds of the enemy, their motives, and their worldly ignorance, this is a must.

This is a first rate enemy assessment tool!"},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"I found the book extremely well written and enlightening.One comment of note: does Bowden realize that \\"thumbs up\\" in Iran is equivalent to the Western display of the middle finger? Gives the last few sentences of his book quite a different meaning."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Bowden ties together an amazing number of interviews to tell the story of the Iranian hostage crisis. While not engaging in moral equivalence, he devotes a great deal of effort to making sense of the motives of the various players in this historical drama.I was most interested in understanding why the Carter White House reacted so oddly to the crisis. Why did the U.S. do (apparently) nothing for so long and then attempt a spectacularly improbable rescue effort? Bowden sheds light on the behind-the-scenes negotiations and on Carter's decision making process. I am still unconvinced that Carter acted correctly, but the book helps to make some sort of sense out of how Carter acted.On a related point, Bowden rejects the idea that Reagan had much of anything to do with the hostages' release.With tensions between the U.S. and Iran still high, this is a very important book. It is also extremely engaging; Bowden is an exceptional author."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"I have read other books by Mark Bowden and he did not dissappoint me with \\"Guests..\\". True to his style that made his other books so good were his ability to get a 360 degree view of the situation by getting accounts from all sides of an event. He has the ability to create stories with in the story of all the people involved on all sides and it left me wondering how he was able to make such contacts, get precise information and draw the lines he did especially in regards to a radically Islamic Iran.The only part of the book that dragged was the day to day routine the prisoners dealt with (only a few were tortured i.e. beaten, most were just holed up, some alone for months on end and repeatedly interrogated and harrassed by uneducated fundamental \\"students\\"). The prisoners were held hostage for ever 440 days and like their monotonous time spent sitting in their rooms, the book got a little monotonous talking about it. One reason I bought the book was to hopefully learn something about the history of our two cultures and where it went wrong. Mr. Bowden's storytelling capabilities are so strong that to a point, the history lesson I was looking for was somewhat clouded by the situation he was writing about. This isn't a complaint, but I may have to re-read part of the book to find some of facts I was initially looking for.His character development was excellent, and added strength to the stories when talking about clashing personalities, prisoners harrassing the guards or doing un-Islamic things in front of the guards to embarrass them. His research on the failed Delta mission was first class (and very sad in regards to the time and energy spent along with the loss of such capable men) as was his research on Carter and his administration during the whole crisis. It may sound like a cliche, but when reading about the pressure Carter was dealing with, you did feel like you were a fly on the wall watching it go down.Finally, Mr. Bowden did an excellent job closing the book out. The last few chapters dealing not only with a \\"where are they now\\" of the prisoners but with the student-hostage-takers as well helps bring the story to a close. His chapters comparing Iran today with America and his experience going there for research was an entertaining and educational read about the stark differences between our two cultures. Again, he has an uncanny ability of writing to make the reader think they are there. The chapter on Tehran and what its like to drive around there, about how Allah must only like the color of dust, as well as the American merchandise sold and the types of \\"advertisements\\" they have on their billboards or posters is worth the time spent reading through the somewhat long parts in the book dealing with captivity.This was a subject he made a lot more interesting to me, and had it not been him writing the book, I probably would not have bought it. I gave it 4 stars unlike the 5 stars I gave to \\"Killing Pablo\\" or \\"Black Hawk Down\\" because I was much more interested initially in those stories. This is a great book, even if some parts are a little too long."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"\\"Guests of the Ayatollah\\" is a riveting account of the seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran by militant Islamic radicals and students in 1979. Fifty-two Americans (an additional 14 had been released earlier) were held hostage for 444 days until Ronald Reagon's Inauguration in 1981. With such a large cast of characters, it is helpful that each of the six chapters is opened with a page of photographs of the principals for that chapter (with two pages of maps).The author of \\"Black Hawk Down\\" chillingly describes the doomed Delta One Task Force rescue attempt in the midst of a presidential election year. His research will make this book the definitive account of this crisis. Mr. Bowden seems to have interviewed everyone involved : the hostages, the Iranians, Delta Force soldiers, and American politicians. He injects himself into the epilogue as he traveled four times to Iran in 2003-2004 to track down the key Iranian participants. \\"Guests of the Ayatollah\\" is a page-turner that sheds background and light onto the current nuclear crisis with Iran."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"The newest book from Mark Bowden again delves into the murky realm where political scheming and military manuevering meet. Detailing the 1979 Iranian Hostage Crisis, Bowden tells a compelling story that weaves the personal experiences of those involved together with the clash of cultures and global politics.As usual, Mark Bowden does a superb job of cutting through the mitigating complexities to deliver a strong narrative that imbues the reader with a clear picture of the unfolding events. He delivers nuanced portraits of many of the hostages, candidly exploring both their strengths and weaknesses. Simultaneously, he tells the saga of the birth of Delta Force, and the botched rescue attempt that was their infamous first mission.While I found \\"Guests of the Ayatollah to be enjoyable and compelling, it fell short of Bowden's \\"Killing Pablo\\", and \\"Black Hawk Down\\". I believe the primary reason is that Bowden is at his best when depicting scenes of action and mayhem, whether Special Operations firefights or Columbian drug wars. While \\"Guests\\" does contain many action driven passages, the bulk of it is devoted to the ways in which the hostages dealt with the tedium of captivity. Obviously that is an essential part of the story, but I found it led to some passages that seemed repetitive, especially the ones that detail criticisms of the hostage's guards, and of the philosophy of the Iranian cultural revolution. The secondary weakness of the book is the ending, in which Bowden switches to a first person perspective to discuss his own ideas about Iran in the present day. For me it lessened the impact carried by the rest of the book.My two complaints are very minor, but enough to prevent a full five star rating. This fascinating and imformative book is a great aid for understanding the current crisis developing between America and Iran. Ultimately, any reader should find this to yield many rewards."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Guests of the Ayatollah is by far Mark Bowden's best work. If he doesn't win a Pulitzer Prize for this brilliant piece of journalism he will have been robbed! His outstanding research, interviews, and story telling weave the most compelling narrative of what actually occurred behind the walls of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Iran during the 444 days that America was held captive. You actually feel like you are right there amongst the American hostages battling anger, fear, depression, smiling inward with every small personal victory over the Iranian students, and comtemplating ways to escape the nightmare both physically and mentally. You also get a clear picture of a President who is angered by the turn of events in Iran, but is too weak to do anything about it. The inclusion of the details of the bold, but ill-fated American rescue mission (Operation Eagle Claw) is fascinating in itself and brilliantly woven into the story. Twenty-six years after the U.S. Embassy takeover you would think that everything that needed to be said about the crisis would have been said, but as Mark Bowden shows that's clearly not the case! THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY MUST READ BOOK! A note to Mark Bowden: A great piece of journalism, Mark! I hope you pick up a Pulitzer Prize. You deserve it!"},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Anyone who wants to understand our current stand-off with nuclear Iran simply must read this incredible book of historical journalism. Mark Bowden has captured the very essence of our ongoing, 27-year conflict with radical Islam by exposing the horrid events of 1979 - 1980 when rage-filled college students seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran. It's a triumph of professional research and sophisticated storytelling.Bowden takes us inside the U.S. embassy just as the takeover was about to be launched. In short order, we meet an incredible cast of real-life characters, from street savvy embassy staffers like Michael Metrinko to clueless government officials and over-confident radicals. As the hostage crisis unfolds, we can see how the self-righteous \\"joy\\" over the initial takeover quickly degenerated into a sad drama of suspicion, prejudice and incompetence that dragged on for 444 days - much longer than anyone really wanted, including the hostage takers themselves.To make matters even worse, the very same radicals who launched this tragic episode are now largely in control of the Iranian government. Many Americans are still clueless about the events that got us to this place. It's a bad dream that just won't go away...Both Iran and the U.S. get their fair share of criticism in this exhaustively researched book. If you're looking for an \\"us vs. them, good guys vs. bad guys\\" treatment, don't look here. Bowden properly points out our massive intelligence failures before, during AND after the initial embassy seizure. Even the aborted rescue mission seems rooted in a fantasy cloud of wishful thinking. For their part, the Islamic radicals come across as typical \\"true believers\\" who never let the facts get in the way of the \\"truth.\\" Like the Taliban, the ultimate legacy of the hostage-takers was to establish a dysfunctional, paranoid regime that poisons the soul of Islam and breeds violence throughout the Middle East. Lord save us all.Only one criticism: I wish that Bowden had included more maps of metro Tehran, more photos of second-tier players and more verbatim excerpts from original documents. Even with those flaws, this is certainly the most important non-fiction book of 2006. Bravo, Mark Bowden!PERSONAL NOTE: As a graduate of the J school that hands out the Pulitzer Prizes, I'll be extremely disappointed if Bowden doesn't win a medallion this time around. And based on some correspondence I had with President Carter back in the early 1980s, I think he would agree, even if some of the memories in this book make Carter wince."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"This supurb book is quite long, 700+ pages. That's because it's really three, or maybe four, or depending on your point of view, perhaps five books in one. It's the story of the hostage crisis in Iran in 1979.The first book is the story of the hostages taken from the embassy. This covers them as individuals, their duties in the embassy, their lives as hostages. A surprise was how poorly they were organized to collect useful intelligence.The second book is on the students that stormed the embassy. They first did this somewhat as a lark. And it grew beyond them. A surprising part of their story is how ignorant they were of world affairs beyond their own lives. And finally how they have suceeded in the government of Iran since. But you have to wonder what would have happened if the Marine guards had started shooting.The third book is on the Delta Force and 'Operation Eagle Claw.' As we know it was a disaster. We really didn't realize just how bad it really was. Let's hope we do better on the next such event.The fourth book is on the American diplomatic response and President Carter's actions and decisions. This part also discusses the world's response and that of the United Nations which basically issued public statements.The fifth book if you can say it exists, is on the overall relationship between the United States, the west and radical Islam.We really don't know what happened in incidents like this one until we read the well researched books books such as this one that seemingly can't be done until the political passions have died. This book is exactly that kind. I can only add my two cents to the other reviewers who say that this should clearly get one of this year's Pulitzer's."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Yes, it is a very thick book, but it needed to be because the Iranian Hostage Crisis had so many plots and sub-plots, not to mention rumors and spins, that anthing shorter would not have done the subject justice. Bowden explains in great detail how internal Iranian power-struggles influenced the Hostage Crisis more then 20 years ago. What is more, these struggles continue to the present day. The book made that clear and gave me a good foundation to understand present day Iran, its civilian government, the ayathollahs and the West's difficulty dealing with it. I read it in one setting, shortly before the most recent Iranian hostage-taking incident. It helped me understand the latest hostage crisis, in fact, I was not surprised by the way it played out at all."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Mark Bowden has a track record of writing gripping accounts of some of our most important - yet under-reported or politically inflamed - historical events in these modern times. In his latest, \\"Guests of the Ayatollah\\", he provides a tremendously thorough presentation of the Iran hostage crisis of 1979.This book traces - in remarkable detail - the taking of the U.S. embassy in Tehran by radical students, the ordeal faced by the hostages, the failed rescue mission, and the politics involved in the crisis. I cannot think of a book prior to this that has so comprehensively presented all of these elements together. Normally, it would seem too far-reaching and would result in a messy, disjointed work; with a few minor exceptions, Mr. Bowden manages to keep it all together through 600-plus pages.Mr. Bowden does well through the course of the narrative in several key areas. First, he conveys the sense and sentiment of that stage in U.S. and world history. We recognize immediately how the timing of this hostage-taking was the capstone of a period of negative news (as it related to the U.S.). We also get the sense of the revolutionary - yet disorganized - undercurrent in Iran that prompted this incident. Second, Mr. Bowden relates the confusion and uncertainty about keeping the hostages in the weeks and months after the ayatollahs assumed control. The impetus for the embassy takeover was loosely tied to revolution but misguided, and it is obvious that the students didn't know what to do beyond their initial success. Third, the reader gets a very clear picture of how life was like as a hostage. One learns that the hostages were largely not detained under equal conditions. Some were treated harshly, others seemed to have far more \\"freedoms\\" in captivity, and the rest floated somewhere in the middle.Mr. Bowden also does an excellent job of detailing the planning for and the failed attempt at rescuing the hostages. This is to be expected, based on his work in \\"Black Hawk Down\\" and other works. The geographical and logistical situations were huge obstacles, and we see how inter-service mistrust and a new type of special operations conspired to doom the mission before it even started. In retrospect, it is quite remarkable that the disaster at \\"Desert One\\" didn't lead politicians to scrapping Delta Force and seriously curtailing special operations for decades to come.Much attention is also placed on the political and diplomatic machinations that occupied the 444-day ordeal. The reader truly sees how the Carter administration was hamstrung by indecision and uncertainty about how to proceed with getting the hostages back. In many ways, the obstacles facing the politicians was the same as those that the military faced. It is unclear, though, just how large a role this incident had in the demise of the Carter presidency. If anything, Mr. Bowden downplays the hostage-taking as a reason for Carter's electoral defeat, though he does seem to give half-hearted credit to Ronald Reagan's election as finally providing the break in the diplomatic impasse.As good as the work is as a whole, there are a few drawbacks. One is that some of the descriptions of the day-to-day events of the individual hostages get somewhat tedious and repetitive. In one sense, this could be viewed as an aid in conveying the ennui and \\"grind\\" that the hostages endured. The point was certainly conveyed, but given the length and scope of the book, it did little to move the story along as a reader.Another drawback is that, despite being fairly objective throughout the course of the book, Mr. Bowden's personal political biases show up frequently in the descriptions of the diplomacy and politics of the crisis. President Carter is certainly a sympathetic figure in that - in the larger scope of history - he was ill-prepared for the events that defined his presidency. Ultimately, he probably does deserve some credit for helping finally get the hostages home. However, there are places in this book where Mr. Bowden seems particularly eager to make President Carter blameless, while at the same time being quick to cast President Reagan with much blame for seemingly being ignorant and indecisive in his own right about what to do with regards to the crisis.Nowhere is the personal political bias more evident than in the first chapter of the epilogue, which leads me to the third drawback of this book. That is, this first chapter of the epilogue seemed to be completely out of place in relation to that section and the entire book as a whole. The chapters of the epilogue that followed actually provided a \\"where-are-they-now\\" summary of both the hostages and the students. Why Mr. Bowden and/or his editors chose to preface it with his support of Carter and not-so-subtle criticisms of Reagan and - to some extent - both the two Bush presidents is beyond me. Granted, I obviously disagree with many of Mr. Bowden's political assertions, but I don't mind that as much as I do the placement of this chapter. It would have been far better to make that the closing chapter, where the author would naturally come in to close the narrative with his/her own reflections. This made the conclusion of Mr. Bowden's book more jarring and disjointed.All in all, though, \\"Guests of the Ayatollah\\" is a very thorough and excellent book. It is probably too much for the average reader, but - aside from the drawbacks I have detailed here - it should ultimately be an important book for historians and well-informed citizens to read. After this book, there should be little reason for other authors to re-hash this important event in modern American history, because there wouldn't be much to improve upon."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"On 11/4/79, a group of radical Islamist students stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran. Inspired by the revolutionary leader Ayatollah Khomeini, they hoped to stage a 3-day sit-in protest of America's allowing exiled Shah Reza to enter the U.S. for medical treatment. This modest goal became much more dangerous - 66 American hostages were taken and most held 444 days. Religious hardliners on the Revolutionary Council used the crisis to purge moderates from leadership. Meanwhile, Washington neither saw the gathering threat to its longtime Cold War ally, the Shah, nor did they foresee this crisis.Underlying the crisis was resentment over the U.S. helping to engineer the replacement of Iran's elected government after U.S. oil assets were nationalized. The embassy's staffing once neared 1,000 (what in the world for?), but at the time of the crisis was down to just over 60. Most of those held were suspected of being CIA spies, and some were physically abused during questioning. Thirteen black and female hostages were released as a gesture to \\"oppressed Afro-Americans\\" and the special status Muslims afforded to women.The U.S. tried to defuse the crisis by having the Shah leave New York for Panama - did not help. During the crisis the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, OPEC doubled oil prices, and Iraq invaded Iran. Slowly the hostage-takers tired of the stalemate. However, President Carter saw minimal hope for resolution, and a tragic rescue effort was undertaken. Due to a sandstorm and mechanical problems, the U.S. lost 8 men in a fiery landing-zone crash between a helicopter and a C-130; in addition, 6 other choppers also failed or were left behind. (Some believe the heavy media hostage situation coverage, together with an on-going presidential campaign, created extreme political pressure that brought on the failed mission and nearly worse.)Last minute negotiation attempts with the Carter administration continued almost until the Reagan inauguration. This undercuts those who believe Reagan's people made their own agreement to end the crisis, though Reagan never made a proposal on how this would be done.The current Iranian President Ahmadinejad admits involvement in the hostage crisis, but denies personally invading the embassy grounds or holding and interrogating hostages. (Several of the hostages, however, disagree.) Regardless, many of the students involved in the 1979 crisis are now highly placed in Iran's current government.Interesting history that also shows how a relatively minor event can generate significant complications. Several times the Ayatollah could have stopped the events, or even prevented its initiation - however, his playing to Iranian public opinion prevented easy resolution."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"For those interested in history and especially the history of the relationship between Iran and the U.S., this book is essential. This book is well written, fine storytelling, and appropriately detailed without belaboring the point. Probably the best one source history of the hostage crisis. Some may find it a little too charitable to President Carter, but it appears to be a fair portrayal."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"An incredible narrative of what must have been a very traumatic time for the hostages and the American public as well. Having been born the same year of the embassy takeover, I obviously could not appreciate the significance of this event without living through it, but Bowden's book does an excellent job of putting you in the shoes of the hostages and the diplomats who worked on their release. Yes, it is a long book, but at no point did I feel that it was dragging on. A great book."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"I have no idea why this book did not win the Pulizer Prizer.Easily the best non-fiction that I have read in the past 10 years."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Mark Bowden, best known as the author of \\"Black Hawk Down,\\" has written another powerful book. This time his attention is turned towards the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979-1981. Many readers will find his account moving, troubling, and a little thought provoking...all at the same time.For better or for worse, the bulk of this book focuses on experiences of those on the \\"front lines\\" of this crisis. Much of his text focuses on the experiences of the hostages. It gets a little repetitive, not too much, but it also serves a purpose of communicating that the tedium of being a hostage. Much of this material is fairly standard stuff, available in other books. What makes his book new, is that he has visited Iran and interviewed many of the Iranians involved in this incident and presents their perspective ill-informed, strange and slightly wacky as it may be. He gives them an honest airing, but uses a rather restrained presentation of the evidence to shoot down their arguments when these offer themselves to investigation.He also discusses the efforts of the military to put together a rescue mission. He does such a good job of telling this story and at times it looks like the mission might work. Despite his background writing \\"Blackhawk Down,\\" Bowden is not in his element discussing military issues. There are some important nuances he misses, like the differences between flying over land and water, and why Marine pilots flying Navy helicopters had different approaches than the U.S. Army to this mission. Military professionals might be disappointed, but the general public will probably not even notice.What is more noticeable is Bowden limited description of \\"big picture\\" issues. He draws all his information from interviews with participants, memoirs, and contemporary news accounts. As a result, he offers no description of geopolitical issues in the Middle East, and his coverage of the rather weak, inept diplomacy of the Carter Administration is quite limited, giving the President to a large extent, a pass on this incident. His argument that this crisis was America's first confrontation with extremist elements of Islam seems weak and in any case is not particularly well developed.Finally, and this is no small thing, this book reads well...very well. The organization and the quality of his prose make it so easy to read. Chapters are often only a few pages long. The end result is a compelling book that is difficult to put down."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"On 4 Nov 1979 radical students invaded the US Embassy in Tehran, seized and took hostage American diplomats to initiate a 444 day crisis without parallel in history. Bowden is justified in examining this event as the opening salvo of a war that is now all too familiar.Bowden provides a riveting history of the hostage experience, including their views of Iranian captors.

I actually found this book more enjoyable than Black Hawk Down as it was easier to learn more about the central characters. Considering the impact of the hostage taking on the Carter Administration this is also one of the first in-depth third party reportings on the story. The staff and hostages are portrayed as normal people caught doing their jobs in extraordinary circumstances. The hostage takers are portrayed neuturally but not sympathetically. Bowden makes it very clear this was an illegal act and sities the take over of the Iranian Embassy in London as an example of what civilized nations do when this type of thing happens. This is a great read and well worth the investment of time."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"The amazing thing about this book is the amount of work that went into it. The embassy takeover was 27 years ago. Bowden tracked down an impressive number of particpants, including the hostage takers, and interviewed them. The story is familiar to many of my generation but the details are not. I learned what the hostages thought and, to an impressive degree, what the hostage takers thought.The only flaw in this otherwise excellent book is the intrusion of Bowden's politics, something I did not notice in Blackhawk Down. He seems to agree with the Islamists that America's support of the Shah was criminal and he shows more sympathy for President Carter than I thought appropriate. There is a fair case to be made that the Shah might have weathered the storm if another president had occupied the oval office at the time. There is no question in my mind that the Iranian people are far worse off under the mullahs than they were under the Shah. Bowden slights this aspect of the story. Otherwise, the book is terrific.His discussion of the rescue attempt is good but an excellent book has been written about that and is called \\"The Guts To Try.\\" It would make a good companion to this book, especially for those interested in military history."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"I couldn't put it down. I think it really sets the reader up with a better understanding of Iran in the 20th century, and how things have gotten so out of hand there now 26 years after the ordeal ended."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"I started this book four days ago, and despite its 600+ length, I plowed through it because it is so well researched and well written. I was a young child when the hostage crisis was going on, and I did not know very much about it, though I remember coverage on the nightly news. This book explained so much about how the crisis occurred and what happened behind the scenes, from the negotiations of Jimmy Carter and the relentless practicing that Delta Force went through for six months before attempting the rescue. Reading about the rescue mission made me think a lot about the parallels to Obama's decision to authorize the strike on Osama bin Laden. What Delta force did in 1980 was the nascent beginning on US special operations. My only criticism is that it drags a bit once the hostages have been in there for 6 months, and there is no end in sight. Though, that is probably how it felt for the hostages, too--endless. Well done, Mark Bowden!"},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"I've been on a major Iran kick this summer for some reason. Guests of the Ayatollah is a fairly lengthy 650-700 page look at the Iranian hostage crisis. Perhaps due to Bowden's background as a former sports reporter in Baltimore, the text is fairly easy to read and actually reads like a lengthy novel.Bowden tries to tackle the crisis from all sides: the Iranian hostage takers, the embassy hostages, the President and his key advisors, the military role in the ill-fated rescue operation, and even the reaction of the American public as we move towards the 1980 election and beyond.Much of the book is spent inside the embassy through the collective recollections of the hostages however. Overall, I thought Bowden struck a pretty good balance between all these different narratives, but individual opinions will vary of course.When you're trying to string together as many different perspectives as exist in the Iranian hostage crisis, the reader is bound to be left wanting in one area or another. I thought Bowden did a fantastic job capturing the dynamics between the hostages themselves, rather than merely bouncing them off their Iranian captors.Would make an interesting companion piece to the new David Crist book The Twilight War, which provides a comprehensive treatment of U.S.-Iran relations from 1979-2011"},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"GUESTS OF THE AYATOLLAH is not as exciting as Mark Bowden's BLACK HAWK DOWN, but it is more important. It is an objective account of the sixty-six Americans who were imprisoned after Iranian students stormed the American embassy in Tehran. For fifty-two of these hostages, this hard, sometimes painful experience lasted from November 4, 1979 to January of 1981. Four hundred and forty-four days!For me it was important not just because I am American and while reading I could easily identify with the hostages, but also because I learned about Iranians. Not all of them are fanatical ignoramuses. Some are no more ignorant than me and my fellow Americans. I learned about the tyranny of the Shah Pahlavi. I learned that Iranians are individuals. Some are reasonably good persons, some are irrationally bad, some are not as bad as others. So if I were president, I would hesitate to push the red button and cook up a dish of instant Persian parking lot. I would be cooking many friendly people.Much of what Bowden gives us would in other circumstances be boring. I mean the intimate everyday details he provides. But this is about the hostages, which elevates mundaneness to something special. Also, Bowden perks things up with dozens of pertinent anecdotes, and his proficient writing style helps too.I am thankful for the two drawings, but the drawing of the embassy should have included a compass. I'm still unsure if north is to the bottom or top. Also, the map of Iran should have included more locations from the story; for example, Abadan and Shiraz. Source notes and bibliography seem to be in order, though I did not use them. The index was excellent, but this book should have had an introductory listing of characters, giving easy access to their ages and positions.I don't know why we got only a few photographs. I would have welcomed more, but maybe they were not available, or maybe more photos of the hostages would impose on privacy.After reading about the release of the hostages, be sure to continue reading. Only a few pages remain, but they present clear images of what Iran is like today, unless six years have produced radical changes. Again, it's important."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"I was cursing Mark Bowden for the first 150 pages, but after that, I was singing his praises. This book follows the daily trials and tribulations of the hostages, their captors, and those taking part in the negotiations over their release. As you can imagine, this can include minutiae that is not always interesting. I found it VERY difficult to get into this book, but after forcing myself to read past the first part, I found it engrossing and I couldn't put it down. I now feel like I know much more about the crisis than I did before and I would highly recommend this book to anyone willing to invest the time required."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Mr. Bowden does a great job of of presenting the \\"in general\\" politics of the situation, the atmosphere, and at times captures the anger, frustration, and bewilderment of the persons involved. This is what I like about the book so much. It wasn't just information about what happened. After reading this I knew more about the world before my time, and I also knew more about why things are the way they are now. In addition to that, the involved reader will be taken through all the emotions that Mr. Bowden captures...From the confusion of the first moments, coming up with ways to cope, desperate attempts to escape, and finally being released and coming to grips with how surreal the experience was. In short, this book was both informative and an experience (well, if you empathize with what you read).This book was my first by Mark Bowden, and it was so good I went on to read Killing Pablo, and Black Hawk Down which are both equally as good."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Great book. I found it especially interesting and insightful, as someone who was a kid during the Iran hostage crisis, and remembers it strictly through the prism of childhood. The book gives a very detailed description of the embassy takeover and of the long ensuing ordeal of the collective and individual hostages. It also helps to give some historical perspective on why the Iranians hated the US and what events led to the crisis. All in all, a very interesting and informative book."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Mark Bowden does it again. He's at his best when he's waxing lyrical about yes another failure by the United Stated. And this was a biggie. 444 days these people had to endure, never knowing which day would be their last. Bowden introduces each character and provides enough information for you to feel, by the end, you know them. You're rooting (and wincing) for Mike Metrinko when he launches yet another anti-Islamic tirdae against his guards. Very enjoyable and made better by a 'where are they now?' section at the end."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"The depth of Bowden's research is astounding. I disagree with other reviewers who found the detailed accounts of the hostages' day-to-day existence boring. Only Bowden could spin a sense of THEIR boredom into very engrossing reading. The back matter (interview details, epilogue, analysis) is every bit as interesting as the body of the text, though it reveals Bowden as an undisguised Carter apologist and somewhat mysteriously scornful of Reagan. All in all, one of the better books I have recently read."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"This book gives a great overview of the Iran Hostage Crisis as well as insight into the daily lives and struggles of some of the hostages. I was in high school when this happened and only recall the taking and release of American hostages. This book filled in the blanks. Thank You Mark for such a fine book?"},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"I though Mark Bowden's attempt to tell the stories of the American captives of the 1979 Iranian revolution was an excellent attempt at personalizing what had been an under told story. Sometimes he succeeds brilliantly, as he does with both John Limbert and Mike Metrenko. Each were important for their own reasons, one because he spoke perfect Farsi, the other because he was CIA with extensive contacts in the country, and documents how each of them were treated because of this.On the other hand he is weak in explaining what some of the captives acted the way they did. There was the young marine sergeant who was extremely cooperative with his jailers, telling all the personal information he had on many of his compatriots. This fact is mentioned, but no effort seems made to get to know or understand that young marine.All in all, this is a good book with many flaws, only a couple of which were documented here."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Mark Bowden's terrific book Guests of the Ayatollah is first rate original source history - that is where the author can rely on interviews with eye witnesses for his information. In this case Bowden seems to have talked with everyone involved - from the hostages to their kidnappers. ( I agree with President Carter that it is totally wrong of the media to constantly refer to the wild eyed youth who did this as students.)Bowden does an admirable job of telling a story that takes place in many locations - Tehran, the White House, the field in Iran where the desperate rescue attempt went so tragically wrong. He depicts how different people respond differently to the stress of imprisonment. Bowden even lets the Iranians have their say - not that he agrees with them, but we get a fair indication of what their grievances were with the Shah of Iran.Of course, after 9/11, the Iranian hostage crisis seems almost quaint. While Bowden does a great job on the scene in Tehran, he is less strong at analysis of how this \\"First Battle in America's War with Militant Islam\\" led to 9/11, Iraq and Afghanistan.This is, like the author'sBlack Hawk Down: A Story of Modern Wara great job of reporting."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Lots of stuff in here I had forgotten about, and more details I never realized. Initially, because there were so many people involved in the story, it was a bit hard to follow. But overall, it's fascinating to read about all the hostages and their different situations, how the fared, what they were thinking, and how America was reacting. I particularly was intersted in all the details about Desert One. What an unfortunate fiasco, but the way it was micro-managed its clear it was doomed to fail. Even thoug the outcome is well known, this was still very gripping."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Bowden writes another great text with solid research and scholarly analysis. This is an exiting look at the 444 days of the hostage crisis. It is not another political blame book, but an honest approach to the actual events. Bowden has an ability to immerse the reader in the unfolding events as if he or she is there, while being able to provide a clear and well reasoned history.This book also has the benefit of being very timely and shed's a lot of light on Iranian culture and modern times."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"We too often forget. It has been less than 10 years since 9/11 and many people have forgotten that tragic event. 1979 is almost 30 years ago and half of my office has no idea what we went through with this crisis. I still remember cutting high school to attend the parade, so when I heard about this book, I knew I had to read it. It did not disappoint, it only confirmed my feelings about Carter, the administration, the worldwide ignorance and the radical forces at play. Read this book....."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"I remember the date very well, 4Nov79. Surprised to see 7Nov79 on the dust jacket. Reading the fine print, I received an \\"uncorrected draft copy\\" that was not for resale. No idea how that managed to find its way to my door.In any event, looking beyond the misspelled words and repeated paragraphs in my copy, the author captured the daily torture/torment that the Americans hostages endured for 444 at the hands of \\"the student protestors\\". I was hoping for some insight into why this happened, what \\"the students\\" hoped to gain, why it lingered, and why it ended on the day of Ronald Regan's inauguration. The book satisfied my questions. Unsure how the author managed to compile all this information from the hostages in the minutest detail, but it was there. I would not have wanted to retell it if I had endured this ordeal."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Four hundred forty-four days. Think back to what you were doing 444 days ago. Think about everything you've seen and done, the people you've met, fallen in love with, fallen out of favor with during this time. Now imagine being held against your will for that long. Imagine being locked away, forced to not speak to anyone, the fear of brutality and execution hanging over your head for those 444 days. Can't do it? I bet neither could the 50+ US diplomats held hostage by radical Iranian students over the entire year of 1980 (plus a little on either side). Mark Bowden's \\"Guests of the Ayatollah\\" does an outstanding job of conveying just what such an experience would be like.While Bowden's tone is journalistic and fairly neutral, he pulls no punches. The good, the bad, and the ugly on all sides are on full display throughout the book. The ignorance of the Iranian students, fueled by dogma and naivety, feeds their brutality and kindness alike. The stoic individualism of the American hostages feeds their capitulation, as well as their defiance. The utter insanity of the situation as a whole hamstrings the US administration and greatly contributes to the failure of the inevitable rescue mission. In the end, though, the book illustrates that there were no winners and nothing but losers from this dark time.On November 4, 1979, Islamic students overtook the US embassy in Tehran, taking most of the diplomats and staff hostage. What should have been a brief outburst of violence quickly devolved into a standoff between the West and a new breed of government that placed God ahead of all else. Bowden makes it abundantly clear that both sides could have ended the siege with simple actions: On the Iranian side, all it would have taken was for the Ayatollah Khomeini to proclaim the freedom of the hostages, while on the American side, extradition of the less-than-squeaky-clean shah back to Iran would have sealed the deal. Unfortunately, as Bowden also clearly explains, neither action was feasible given the intricacies of both domestic and international politics at the time. The entire situation was a fiasco from the start, and only ever got resolved by the outside factors of the Iraq-Iran War and the election of Ronald Reagan.\\"Guests of the Ayatollah\\" is told from three interweaving perspectives. The hostages are a blob of characters, difficult to keep track of with only a handful being instantly recognizable upon their mention. But this is a good thing, for it really hits home the dehumanization that occurred to them during their captivity. The range of actions and emotions by this blob assists the reader in empathizing with the plight of the captives. One can alternately understand both the defiance of Michael Metrinko and the outright capitulation of Joe Subic. On the other side, the most striking aspect of the hostage takers is their naive ignorance. Whether this was due to youth, religious brainwashing, or some other factor isn't 100% clear; Bowden only manages to track down a handful of them to get their stories in the book's epilogue. Paranoia, however, clearly played a part; the repeated references to the embassy as a \\"den of spies\\" shows this. In the end, one can't help but come away with the impression that the hostage takers were nothing more than children being strung along and played by the puppet masters of the Iranian regime. On that front, as well as the parallel one of the Carter administration, the overwhelming impression is one of futility. Both sides essentially had their hands tied by the events of the day. The purges taking place in Iran kept the moderates there from speaking out, leaving the handful of individuals willing to negotiate having to do so in secret. Also, their novice diplomatic skills kept them shifting the conditions of release, even right up until the end. Khomeini, on the other hand, is strangely absent from all negotiations; but, as stated earlier, Bowden clearly shows that the cleric was the true puppet master with the ability to end the incident with but a wave of his hand. Why he never did this is sadly unexplored. In America, Carter was fighting challengers from both parties, causing him to tread lightly. But, more importantly, it was ultimately the sheer lack of options available to the president that caused the situation to go on for as long as it did. The communication breakdown between the two states combined with the infancy of the uber-military team, Delta Force, left Carter holding the bag in what turned out to be a deciding factor in his downfall.All in all, \\"Guests of the Ayatollah\\" does an excellent job of conveying the intricate horrors involved in the Iranian hostage crisis. From the president down through the military men involved in the rescue mission to the hostages themselves, Bowden paints a vivid picture of life during these 444 days. He's got another winner on his hand."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Reads like a thriller novel, but is 100% true. If you are completely unfamiliar with the history of Iran from about 1945-1979 you should probably spend at least a few minutes learning about that before reading this book. The book jumps right into the drama of the hostage crisis without providing much background.I listened to the audiobook. The pros of the audiobook version are that it is skillfully read by the author of the book. The con is that the audiobook is abridged."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Mark Bowden is a genius at bringing intensive historical events to life and Guests of the Ayatollah doesn't disappoint. While easy enough to step back and look at the boiling pot of the clash of cultures and paranoia that led to the takeover. However, his ability to bring to light the individual stories, including tracking down the hostage takers gave an incredible insight into the mindset of the key players. I was particularly fascinated by his ability to not just focus on the takeover and Desert One pieces, but also highlight the more interesting vignettes from the 444 days.Bowden is a great reader for his own material, which only makes the audio book more interesting. If you're a fan of Bowden or want to understand more about militant Isalam, this is a can't-miss."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"When the American Embassy in Iran was overrun by radical students, I like most Americans followed the story very closely. This book was an eye opening experience as to what happened on the inside. How the hostages were mistreated, starved, and beaten by radicals. But, they were also treated with kindness by some of the radicals, which I had never heard before. The only fault that I have with the book is that it seemed to finish up much more quickly than it started and you feel a little cheated. Overall a good book. I admire how the hostages handled themselves and how they were able to continue on with their lives when they got released."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"A number of other reviews of Guests of the Ayatollah, by Mark Bowden, have commented on the repetitive nature of the day in, day out activities of the 51 American Embassy hostages In Iran. I don't know if this is true on not, but it definitely is NOT in the 10 hour abridged CD, narrated by... Mark Bowden. Bowden and his editors have pulled together enough of the individual stories of the hostages to make this an exciting \\"page\\" (or CD) turner. From the initial take-over of the US Embassy, to the daily grind and trials of the hostages, to the efforts of the political and military branches of Carter's administration, Bowden puts together a whale of a tale... and it's all true.On the (slightly) negative side, I really wanted to hear about what the former hostages are doing now. How has this experience changed their lives? I suspect this is in the book, and I will look it up. There was, in the CD version, a follow-up for many of the hostage-takers. In particular, I wanted to know more about \\"Screaming Mary.\\" Unfortunately, her successes in the current Iranian government leave me rattled.So thank you, Mark Bowden, for condensing this disturbing chapter of American-Iranian history into a shocking and sad tale."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"This may be the non-fiction book of the year...gripping story of US Embassy Hostage crisis...Bowden has done pain-staking research here, not only from US side but also with Iranian students who stormed the US Embassy...right up there with his previous work (Killing Pablo, Blackhawk Down)...highly recommend!!!"},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"I enjoyed this book, and it kept my attention despite the very complicated web that was the hostage drama. It is daunting to keep up with 50 plus souls, who are for the most part kept separately and even in different Tehran locations. The author stitches this all together quite well.I honestly would have enjoyed more on the political and diplomatic front, as opposed to the detailed information on daily hostage life...but, one can't have it all in a single book, really.Like some others here, I did have the feeling that Bowden was a bit easy on President Carter. Bowden does hit most of the high points of Carter's key failings in the crisis, yet I constantly got the feeling that he was, at the same time, finding any excuse to note Carter's deep concern, and his patience, and so forth. It's as if he wants his readers to feel some sympathy for Carter and his handling of the whole affair. I for one feel Carter very serious botched Iran policy far more seriously and comprehensively than this book lets on."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Having just returned Iran, this book refreshed my memory of the hostage crisis. It's long but interesting. The author does a good job of relating the events that led up to the taking of the American embassy and the subsequent events until their release over a year later. The book is 650 pages. The story could probably have been told in 400 pages; I'm not sure we needed to know everytime they were moved and their daily activities (or lack of). His ending comments about Tehran are outdated. The people in Iran today are very positive about Americans and Tehran, while still congested and polluted, is a thriving \\"developed\\" city. The parks are glorious, unlike his ending comments. Visiting Iran was one of our best trips ever. We felt safe and the people were remarkably friendly. Anyway, the book is worth reading if you're interested in finding out more about the hostage crisis."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"What more could there be to say about a crisis that happened a quarter century ago? As it turns out, there are some very important things to say about it, and Mark Bowden's masterful history of that crisis says them.First, this is an absolutely first-rate \\"you are there\\" account of what the American hostages went through as Iran descended into chaos and near madness after the ouster of the shah. You will literally feel their anger, fear, and depression, and you will feel their pride when they can defy or denigrate their captors, even fleetingly. However, you will feel the smugness and religious certainty of their captors, too. Make no mistake: Bowden clearly sees the American diplomats as victims of an outrageous act; there is no moral relativity here.Second, the book is thought-provoking in ways I didn't expect. The ostensible trigger for the crisis was the decision by the US to admit the shah to this country for treatment of the cancer that would eventually kill him. However, that decision was sold to President Carter by his Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance, who in turn was sold on it by Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller. As the years roll on, it's interesting how many disastrous US foreign policy decisions come back to Kissinger.Further, the CIA was no better then at understanding and predicting events in the Islamic world than they are now. Shortly before the crisis erupted, the agency reported that the religious radicals would soon be relegated to the background there, so the US could deal with an emerging secular state with confidence. In reality, the country degenerated into a hurricane of religious nuttiness that soon swept aside all of the secular leaders. Quite literally, no one at all was really in charge of anything in Iran, and that's the reason the crisis dragged on for over a year.This brings us to the role of President Carter. Nearly everyone felt at the time that he was too weak and vacillating to resolve the crisis. Not so; he tirelessly attempted to find a way to deal with the situation, but every attempt failed when the connection at the Iranian end fell apart. No one could have done much more, which is why presidential candidate Ronald Reagan continually criticized Carter, but never offered a word of explanation about what he would do.The failed rescue attempt was blamed on Carter, too, but as Bowden makes clear, it had little chance of succeeding, mostly because the equipment available at the time was inadequate, and the situation was impossible. Even if Delta Force had made it to Tehran, it's likely that most or all of the hostages and rescuers would have died in the operation. Carter and the troops deserve credit for daring the attempt, even in the face of near-certain failure.This book is must reading as the authoritative account of the first battle in the war with the \\"Islamofascists.\\" And it's worth reading as a rich account of the courage that the hostages and their would-be rescuers displayed in very trying circumstances."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"This book is a timely reminder of times past. Mark Bowen has done some heavy research and presents the action regarding the take over of the US Embassy, in a sharp and focused manner. In light of the situation in Iran now and the postion taken by the present Prime Minister, he missed a chance to follow up his role in the take-over. Mark gets very tied up in making sure we know every detail and so loses the essence, the \\"feel\\" of a scene. All in all, this is a worthwhile analysis but I believe that it would benefit from being about 75 pages shorter."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"I am old enough to remember the incident when it happened, but this book filled in a lot of details that I didn't know or remember. The author weaves in the personal stories of the hostages from interviews and other writings. Very good. I recently saw a series on Discovery Channel about the book, which was also well done but in less detail."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"The best book that I've read in a long time! This book reads like the best international intrigue novels that I've ever read. That one knows the outcome before hand diminishes it not at all. That you can remember many of the events and characters amplifies the experience. That this was the first major, headline-grabbing battle of the current Western Civilization vs. Islam war makes it a must read."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Bowden has done it again. Balancing multiple storylines to weave together a thorough understanding of the crisis. Of course the story of Desert One helps lift the book beyond its dominant political themes."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"An excellent blow by blow account of the Iranian hostage crisis. Bowden's bias knocks a star off. He basically sides with the hostage takers--describing them as just a bunch of goofy misguided kids engaged in mere horseplay. The hostages weren't tortued and beaten that bad, and plus they \\"mistakenly\\" referred to their captors as \\"ragheads.\\" How ignorant! Perhaps Bowden thinks they should have stayed there a little longer just to make up for such transgressions?In an attempt to make Jimmy Carter look competent, he wisely spends little time on the President's futile attempts to resolve the crisis--keeping the focus on the hostages themselves. But it's still a factual account--and the facts don't lie; Carter was a horrible negotiator. It was only a year into the crisis he figured out what \\"contingency\\" meant. Bowden's sly parallel of Ronald Reagan with the Ayatollah at the end of the book is also not lost."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Another interesting, informative and well written book by Mark Bowden. He is able to gather reams and reams of ino and put it into an easy to read format."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Because he is such an exceptional writer of historical narrative, I have tackled his latest Guests of the Ayatollah. Nearly finished I wanted to share my thoughts with you: I give it 5 stars. It is a page turner like Black Hawk Down;it doesn't matter that we know the outcome already. There is plenty of tension, drama from the failed rescue effort, poignancy as you read the hostages' response to isolation and physical torture and the pathetic impotency of the American government. It is a mirror of human nature. When these events occurred I was living in San Francisco and mired in left-wing politics, aware of the revolution but blind to the significance of Iran's Islamic fascism. From afar it was seen as an ugly but just struggle against colonialism. How right and ultimately wrong we were. I now see it as typical of the outcome of semi-colonial revolution where the population is too backward and the middle class too small to embrace secular democratic reform. Iran had the misfortune of the mullahs and the deep uniting strain of Muslim fanaticism which assumed the mantle of nationalism. This book has as its backdrop the struggle between those democrats and the religious fanatics -- the militias steady drumbeat of brutality and public executions to drive Westernizers out. It is also parallel to the developments in Germany in the period between WWI and WWII, except Germany's middle-class was strong enough to briefly sustain social democracy.It's ironic that as I read we have these same forces in Iran, even the same people, \\"teasing\\" us with the ultimate threat of nuclear annhiliation, and simultaneously the response of Israel to the Hamas Palestinian kidnap of a soldier. My conclusion: the only thing the Islamic fascists understand is military might; diplomacy is utterly useless with them. The Israelis know how to call their bluff.Read the book."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"I enjoyed Mark Bowden's previous works, including both the acclaimed \\"Black Hawk Down\\" and the slightly less popular \\"Killing Pablo.\\" Bowden's prose carries you along briskly through his tale, demonstrating his exhaustive research but sometimes sacrificing context and exposition in his efforts to tell a riveting tale.That mild criticism does not apply at all to his latest work, \\"Guests of the Ayatollah.\\" Bowden demonstrates a solid grasp of America's slip-shod management of U.S.-Iran affairs through the 1970s, and \\"Guests\\" is filled with enough back story and exposition to satisfy the reader who is a neophyte in that area (such as myself). A lot of this exposition goes a long way toward explaining why the Iranians seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and also explaining why some Iranians thought it was a divinely-supported gesture and other Iranians thought it was the most self-destructive measure imaginable.Bowden gets ample opportunity to flex his writing muscles, describing in thrilling detail the hostage-taking itself and the precarious life of the Americans under the thumb of the student-terrorists. The hostage crisis gradually goes from a flash in the pan to a more serious, long-term standoff, and Bowden weaves dextrously between the plight of the captives, the frustrations of the Carter White House, the military planning for the ill-fated Eagle Claw rescue mission, and the anguish of the families of the hostages back home.Thanks to what must have been hundreds of hours of interviews, Bowden recreates several remarkable scenes, such as the innumerable anti-American tirades by various Iranians (my favorite is when an Iranian chastises a hostage for the U.S.'s racist decision to nuke Hiroshima and Nagasaki, only to be shocked to learn that the Japanese attacked the U.S. first at Pearl Harbor) as well as the grand-standing by various left-wing Americans who traveled to Tehran to visit the hostages and turn the crisis to their own advantage. You may want to have a soothing beverage or exercise equipment handy when you read this book, as the frustration of the hostages, their families, and the White House pours from the pages.And most thankfully, Bowden never turns his story into a simple \\"U.S. Good, Iran Bad\\" dichotomy. While Bowden definitely sets the blame where it largely belongs, Bowden neither excuses past U.S. missteps in Iran nor forgives Americans who behave badly during the crisis. Bowden also shows that several individual Iranians demonstrated remarkable bravery in attempting -- at the risk of their own lives -- to end the hostage crisis. This balance makes \\"Guests\\" a worthwhile read rather than an anti-Iranian screed.A hefty tome at well over 600 pages, \\"Guests\\" is nevertheless a page-turner. A timely book, this deserves to be read and read widely."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"I read the book a year ago and purchased the book on CD just recently. I found the CD set informative and well read by the author. This period in American history is so relevant to our international missions. The story should be shared with American adolescents to understand what happened and why. It could help them understand why we do not have a mission in Iran and the interactions of the U.S, Algeria, Iran, and even Iraq to some degree. It also better identifies the issues with the Carter Administration and how nightly news evolved."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Well done and easy to read whether you are familiar with the history of Iran and the region or a novice in the area. I highly recommend this as a must read for those who wish to stay informed with evetns that are shaping the middle east and our world today."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"An excellent (and detailed) account. Bowden spares no one in this work, including America's at times shortsighted foreign policy and decision-making. But above all, it shows that no matter how much many people wish it to be so, not everyone on this earth thinks alike or shares like values. It is particularly chilling in exposing the radical Islamic mindset, which has one foot in the 21st century and the other in the 7th. A truly dangerous combination. Regardless of what you think of American foreign policy, the ignorance displayed by the students in this sad tale is truly mind-numbing and is portentious in its implications."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Nov. 4, 1979 dawned wet and chill on the streets of Tehran, Iran. Life would get much hotter before the day was out. The American embassy would be stormed by hundreds of students, and it would take 444 days before 52 of those captured inside saw freedom again. For them, and many of their countrymen, days went by slowly as the concept of Islamo-fascist terrorism was forcibly introduced upon the global stage.Mark Bowden's \\"Guests Of The Ayatollah\\" tells the present-day (2006) story of the Iran hostage crisis and its aftermath from several perspectives, including the hostages themselves, the hostage-takers, the soldiers sent to rescue them, and the U.S. president who was committed to the hostages' peaceful return, whatever the cost. Somewhat subjective and beholden upon the perspective of a tiny minority of the hostages, \\"Guests\\" is nevertheless very readable, addictive, and quite often maddening.What did the hostage-takers expect to accomplish? They said they wanted Iran's former ruler, the Shah, back to stand trial, but even after the Shah's death the hostages remained captive. They wanted the world to rally around their Islamic revolution, only to be attacked by Iraq while their neighbor Afghanistan was invaded by the Soviets. They did get plenty of media attention, as America looked on and wondered what could be done.What was really going on, and the part of the book Bowden brings home with the most authority, was an Orwellian takeover of a previously sophisticated, cultured society by a group of narrow-minded goons who wanted to ensure theirs was the only acceptable path. Anti-hostage rallies Bowden likens to 1984's \\"two minutes of hate\\" were designed to focus all anger and blame against a distant adversary while power was amassed by a coterie around Iran's new spiritual leader, the Ayatollah Khomeini, a vague character whose hard face concealed a vacillating mind. The students hoped to sway him in a more radical direction, and succeeded more than many of them wanted.Several of the hostages' stories are told very well, especially that of the defiant Michael Metrinko, who spat contempt at his captors in their own Farsi. Others describe a more complicated time of it, at times giving in and feeling residual guilt. When you are being threatened with death constantly, and deprived of all basic human rights except food and oxygen, it's hard to be brave. Many were, though. All in all, it's amazing all were returned alive given the experiences recounted here, and some degree of heroism no doubt helped.Bowden spends more time on a failed rescue mission, Operation Eagle Claw, than it merits. Strangely, he all-but-ignores one of the Iran Hostage Crisis's most inspiring sidebars, the escape and rescue of six hostages with the help of the Swedish and Canadian embassies (which provoked a hilarious complaint from the Iranian government about violating diplomatic responsibilities.) Two-thirds of the book is concerned with events before Eagle Claw, in April, 1980, and Bowden skims through the next eight months.But the book is certainly timely, and very readable. If you are the least bit curious about this freakish footnote that has become a milestone in our new world order, you will want to read this book."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Mark Bowden had written another great story. Piecing together the many people involved along with the details of this historic event is a monumental task. It is my opinion a great story and especially for me as I have just visited Iran including the former embassy. Seeing the anti-American murals and the defaced US Embassy seal was like stepping back in history. But the book became more alive to me because of my experience. I must add too that several Iranians I spoke to hate the current regime and the religious autocratic government.Although it is a long book and sometimes challenging to keep track of the hostages and where they were being held, I was able to feel some small amount of their emotional turmoil.Capturing the tragedy of the bungled military rescue attempt and President Carter's agony and struggle to get the hostages released in a peaceful way was a brilliant.In light of what is going on in the Middle East now this is a timely read."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"I am a Fan of Mark Bowden every one of his books read like a fiction book even though he writes about real life!"},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"For someone who loved Black Hawk Down this book was a huge disappointment. Very slow moving, excessively detailed and ultimately boring, I am sorry to say I gave up before the end."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"This is a fascinating, gripping non-fiction account of the Iran Hostage Crisis of 1979-1981. I bought this book after seeing \\"Argo.\\" This book is definitely not an account of the true \\"Argo\\" story; in fact, the six workers who were the subject of that film are mentioned only very briefly in this book (as in, maybe ten sentences).This book gives a brief background of the events leading up to the overthrow of the shah and the Iranian Revolution in the late 70s. Prior to reading this book, I only knew that there had been a revolution and that it had involved a retreat to a more fundamentalist Islamist state. That was the extent of my knowledge of the revolution. I knew nothing about the crisis itself. \\"Guests of the Ayatollah\\" starts with a concise history of shah's rule, the revolution, and America's involvement in putting the shah into power. There is definitely more in-depth reading available on the subject, but the details provided in the book gave me enough background to sufficiently understand the political climate at the time of the takeover.The book weaves the story of the takeover with the ongoing political change in Iran, the stories of the hostages' experiences in captivity, the failed rescue attempt by a U.S. special forces outfit, and the Carter Administration's response to the crisis. The book jumps around among these different topics, but it's in chronological order, is easy to follow, and is very engrossing.The only real issue I had was keeping track of the various hostages. The author doesn't provide accounts of all 52 hostages who spent the entire 444 days in captivity. But he follows enough people, who for the most part all seemed to have similar diplomatic roles, that I did get their jobs/titles/responsibilities confused. It turns out that this doesn't matter much - you become acquainted with the hostages throughout the book as they endure their captivity, and the author re-references some of their background details.Some other reviews of this book have complained that the descriptions about the hostages' daily life got tired and tedious. I did not find that to be the case. I found that reading about how they developed communications systems when they couldn't talk, interacted with the guards, and got on each others' nerves was extremely interesting. Different people responded differently to the captivity, and the ways some of them tried to torment their guards were actually pretty amusing.The inside account of the Carter Administration's approach to the crisis was also very interesting. I walked away from this book feeling as though Carter made decisions based on what would preserve lives, and not what was politically advantageous.One final note: I recommend buying this book on an e-reader if possible. I ordered the paperback version, and it's pretty hefty. So I returned it and bought the e-book. The Kindle version was properly formatted and contained all the same pictures as the paperback version. (There aren't many photos in this book. If you are looking for pictures of all the hostages, you won't find that here.)"},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"I have read several of Mr. Bowden's books but I'd say this is his best one to date. I was expecting something along the lines of Black Hawk Down with a minute-by-minute account of the action. But the hostage crisis in Iran really wasn't the same type of situation. What I wasn't expecting was a personal account of what it was like to be a hostage in Tehran in 1979. I was only 10 at the time and all I really remember is Ted Koppel, the Nightline count of days in captivity and America's \\"inability\\" or \\"unwillingness\\" to strike back (and its impact on the 1980 Presidential election). In my mind I kept thinking \\"What type of hostage would I be\\"? Would I become docile and unemotional? Would I give up hope? Would I relish in harassing the guards (plenty of hilarious accounts of this in the book!), even if it meant brutal physical attacks and other physical discomforts? Mr. Bowden takes you much deeper into the people in this book than any other of his I have read. There's not the constant adrenaline-pumping action as in Black Hawk Down but still plenty, from the taking of the embassy to the aborted rescue mission. You are really taken into the minds of the hostages, their captors and President Carter and Co. This book gave me an appreciation for the delicate situation in which the US was in. Not striking back seemed weak, but who and what could we strike? A lethal response seemed very likely to result in the hostages being executed. I am fully aware of the sacrifices our Armed Forces members bear in defense America, of freedom and democracy, but the actions of Delta Force and others in the daring rescue mission make me love 'em even more. The author also provides a glimpse into what some of the captors were trying to accomplish and why. A thoroughly researched book which offers a rich and comprehensive view of a major event in our (and the world's) history. Don't let that put you off, it's highly readable and I found it difficult to put down."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"This is the 3rd Bowden book I've read and as usual very well written and meticulously researched. Bowden is not afraid of tackling complex, controversial, and contemporary subjects. He is at the top of his game. Very good book. When I check for latest releases of books, I always type in his name to check if he is pending release. A great author, journalist, and writer. This book is full of historical and geopolitical detail. A very thorough look at a subject that has been written about a few times, but not with the precision and clarity of Bowden's writing."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"This is a case where truth is stranger than fiction. The research that the author undertook was prodigious (check \\"Source Notes\\"). Over several years Bowden not only interviewed government officials, captives and their families but also traveled to Iran and met with many who participated in that event. The hostage conversations, while not recorded, were based on and personal diaries and writings of the hostages themselves.The new regime made the old one look almost benevolent in comparison. It's common - The French, Russian, Chinese and Cuban Revolutions began as fights against human rights abuses and ended in dictatorships much worse than those they replaced. Iran highlights Islam's problem - an inability to separate state/culture and church, even in \\"secular\\" nations. Although the majority of \\"students\\" were woefully ignorant about the outside world many leaders were familiar with the US. The organizer developed a warped view of the US at Berkely. The female \\"voice of the students\\" who attended the Univ of Penn insited Islam \\"freed\\" women. She is still active in politics and supports the regime to this day. All attempts at understanding came back to religion. Islam has never undergone the secular scrutiny of its history, beliefs or documents like other religions. Iran's own brand, Shia, is particularly dangerous with its blend of fanaticism, prophecy and love of death, an idea that has spread throughout the Muslims world.Quickly, a publicity stunt spiraled out of control. Iran found itself run by old preachers and mobs of chanting, ignorant kids obsessed with the idea of \\"spies\\". Despite the fact that many captives felt friendship for the Iranian people, brutal treatment began immediately with beatings, questionings, threats and confinement. The scenes kept switching from DC to Tehran as Carter tried desperately to find a solution to the crisis. It was not until after the unsuccessful rescue attempt that the nation finally turned on him.We have hung negotiations, frustrations and anger from the White House. From Iran are stories of escape attempts, beatings, solitary, heroism and even kindness. Michael Metrinko, my own hero, stubbornly refused to bow even in the last minutes. I almost cheered when the plane took off. We are also witness to despicable scenes of American \\"activists\\" joining the \\"students\\" in denouncing the US. Particularly galling were \\"religious\\" leaders who partied with those who executed non-Muslims as a matter of course. A new political allinance was born between Islam and the Left. In Europe it is a fiat accompli with its trinity of evils - Western culture, Israel and the US. The image of millions obeying their ruler, climbing to their roofs and shouting \\"Great is Allah\\" for hours crystallizes the entire event. My grade A"},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Kudos to Mark Bowden for bringing his investigative talents to the Iranian hostage taking.News junkies in the 1979-80 time frame will remember the broadbush reporting of the event in real time.But just as with his earlier book, \\"Black Hawk Down,\\" Bowden unearths immense detail that goes far beyond the news reports. He probes events leading to the hostage taking, the daily lives of the hostages and especially the failed rescue mission, as well as their release and epilogues. I found the pages moved quickly, like those of a thriller. Most interesting to me was how the hostages structured their days with exercise, smuggling messages, creating dates of cards and calendars, and ferociously reading any books they could lay their hands on.The Farsi-speaking hostages, most especially Michael Metrinko, played mind games with their captors or expressed open defiance.Bowden tilts a bit in favor of Carter and downplays Reagan in terms of the ending of the crisis -- you can be the judge of whether this is fair. Five stars nonetheless for more than 600 pages that would appear to be definitive in capturing a modern oddity, the overrunning of an embassy with a headless local government unable to intervene and a president who was cautious, perhaps too much so, in his response."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"In the terrifying takeover you feel you are there. You experience the fear, uncertainty, frenetic rush to make the best decisions, destroy documents and the domino of decisions to surrender. These people had been through all this a few months earlier when leftists took over the embassy briefly. (One wonders what procedures were put in place to prepare for this in the intervening months.) You never lose sight of the personal cost and effect of this assault throughout the book.It's also a fascinating study of geo-politics as we witness the evolution of a hazardous undertaking that at first repulsed then won the support of a fragile revolutionary council. Iranian politicos and clerics cleverly orchestrate focused hatred on an outside power while consolidating the throne of fanatical islamists.I appreciated the detailed account of the failed rescue attempt. We tend take well-honed, precise military operations for granted and overlook how many uncontrolled variables and unknown obstacles must be met with creative field work. His account gives you an appreciation for what these men do.I also liked getting a fuller understanding of how our leaders were working behind the headlines. While the Carter presidency justly earned a poor reputation, I refrained from second guessing what the administration did or didn't do here. This account shows how we don't know a lot of the facts. It gave me a greater appreciation for making decisions while on the hotseat and without the benefit of hindsight future pundits enjoy.It was interesting to see the red herrings and slender threads offered for grasping. I would like to have known more of the stories of the 6 who escaped with the help of other embassies. I liked learning where many of the Iranians involved ended up years later, as well as some snippets from the author's visits to Iran to prepare for the book."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"I've enjoyed reading this author before and looked forward to getting this one, too. I was a teen when this happened and this book fills in all the details that weren't widely revealed back then. It really helps you understand the thinking of those involved and the strength of the hostages. Very well written and thorough, but maybe a few pages too thorough.

I have recently become interested in Iran as a result of the U.S.-Iraq War and the recent turmoil in Iran related to the Iranian presidential election.

He spends appropriate time on President Carter's agonized approach to the affair and to the Delta Force rescue debacle, but for the most part the tale is told from the point of view of the hostages. The entire affair is, in turns, baffling, infuriating, and poignant.My favorite parts of the book were the anecdotes told in passing, which beautifully capture the frustration, hope, and humanity of the hostages and their captors. Here us a sampling of some I especially enjoyed:* The impractically idealistic students who initially led the captors reminded one hostage of Vietnam War protestors who gathered around the Pentagon, hoping to levitate it.* A joke going around at the time told of Teddy Roosevelt's ghost visting President Carter. Carter told of the Soviet invasion of Afganistan. TR asked if we responded with conventional weapons or nukes. Neither, Carter confessed. The same type exchange occurred about the Hostage crisis. Then TR breaks out laughing, purporting to recognize that Carter was joking. \\"Next you'll tell me you gave away the Panama Canal.\\"* The hostages called the small cockroaches in their quarters \\"Mullahs\\" and the large ones \\"Ayatollas.\\"* Twenty-five years later, two of the most despised, unrepentent leaders of the captors had bought a resort in Iran and hoped the hostages might come back for a visit to give a bit of free publicity to the resort.The book is an excellent read on its own terms, as a compelling history of the Iranian Hostage Crisis. It has even more to commend it in providing background and context for the curent standoff between Iran and the United States."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Bowden does a masterful job of writing; giving needed background and depth to the 1979 takeover, and, effortlessly detailing the hostage ordeal while never losing focus on a wide cast of characters. The story moves along quickly and never labors. Heroes are identified; those less than stellar are noted. Harsh judgments and perspective are reserved to the end. If there is a weakness, it is Bowden's failure to provide a clear timeline for events but that is a minor inconvenience. This book is a scorching indictment of Iran and makes the reader's blood boil if he/she has any appreciation for the rule of law and sense of humanity."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"I found this book to be a wonderful introduction into the current difficulties of our relationship with Iran.

But what surprises me somewhat is the fact that almost all the (mostly American) reveiwers have virtually ignored one of the book's most significant and timely aspects: The hostage crisis and the subsequent and ongoing unease between Iran and the US/Rest Of The West is a classic, textbook case of blowback.When mutterings of a more equitable sharing of oil revenues got too much for the US, Kermit Roosevelt spearheded a coup that placed the Shah at the top of the Iran heap, and a murderous, ugly and cruel period was unleashed.And even when the Shah was disposed from the Peacock Throne, the US was unequivolcally warned that allowing him into the US would have dire consequences.And so it did.Reap what ye sow, people ... Iran, Iraq (remember that photo of Rumsfeld shakin' hands with Saddam?), Afghanistan (let's see - who can we utilise to screw the Soviets? Oh yeah - the Taliban!) And on it goes ...Seesm to me there's little point detaling the ignorance, violence, cruelty, duplicity and criminality of the hostage takers and their puppet masters unless the many misdeeds of the US are also acknowledged."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"I have just finished reading Mark Bowden's \\"Guests of the Ayatollah: The first battle in America's war with militant Islam.\\" The book was of great interest to me because I was one of the 69 hostages taken by the grandiloquent Republic of the Great Lebanon in 1948. Because I was first down the gangplank, I am the first American hostage in Lebanon.I am proud to say that we hostages behaved better than the ones taken by the \\"students\\" at the American Embassy in Tehran. We had no traitors, no squealers, nobody like Sgt. Joe Subic, who pleasantly pointed out the CIA people to the hostage takers.And many of us were in on a huge secret. The Arabs had missed the most important passenger on the Marine Carp, a big shot with the Jewish Agency who used to hang out on the former rear gun turret of the ship listening to his Zenith Trans-Oceanic Globemaster radio. And none of us told them about him, nor about Gad and Yossef, two soldiers of the Irgun Zvai Leumi who were returning home after escape from British arrestIn Tehran, there were some real heroes among the hostages, such as Michael Metrinko, who resisted the \\"students,\\" telling them exactly what he thought of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei, even when it meant he would be mercilessly beaten.But there were some real traitors, too, such as the late (and unmourned be me) Rev. William Sloane Coffin, who visited the hostages and then spoke up fearlessly in support of the hostage-takers.Like Coffin, the Rev. Darrell Rupiper, a Catholic priest from Omaha, backed the \\"students\\" all the way and even turned over to them a secret message from a hostage that sought to tell America that they were being mistreated, beaten, starved, and tortured. Rupiper would not even carry a message to a hostage's family.Not as bad was Rabbi Hershel Jaffe of Newburgh, New York, who managed to get himself beaten by the \\"students\\" and who was appalled at Father Rupiper's attempts to join the revolution. But the two Jewish hostages absolutely refused to have anything to do with Jaffe.It should be noted that the Jewish hostages, Barry Rosen and Jerry Plotkin, had to put up with Christmas merriment, courtesy of the \\"students.\\"The Lebanese intelligence service had surprised us. We were never questioned (except by a Dixiecrat U.S. Consul who wished us cancer, syphilis, and other diseases). There was no attempt to segregate the Haganah hostages from the Irgun Zvai Leumi hostages and only a few of us were even aware that a Palestinian overland truck driver was a member of the Fighters for the Freedom of Israel (Sternists). In those days the Jews were the Palestinians.We were treated worse than the hostages in Iran. We were given one hot shower in the six weeks we were there. We all had dysentery (and were glad to be brought paregoric by the Dixieicrat.

Ultimately, however, the book fails to deliver.Bowden delves in considerable detail into how the hostages coped with their incarceration. The focus is on a few of the hostages who obviously were interviewed extensively. Others receive only passing mention. The book is a bit tedious as it describes the hostages daily routines -- over and over again -- which is probably one of Bowden's main points. But we get it already.Bowden spends surpisingly little time on the geo-political considerations at play, mentioning only in passing the role of Anwar Sadat in taking in the shah, for example. Little attention is paid to the effect of the weakness of the U.S. response to the crisis. With a subtitle like \\"The First Battle in America's War with Militant Islam,\\" one might have expected more of a discussion of that topic.Jimmy Carter is given particularly favorable treatment. Bowden's message seems to be: what else could he have done? The answer should have been \\"plenty,\\" though it is fair to note that doing more may have resulted in many dead Iranians and perhaps death for all of the hostages. In light of September 11, it seems easy to conclude that in today's world, no U.S. president, GWBush in particular, would let such an outrageous act go unpunished (and unresolved) for 444 days.Carter's negotiations with the hostage-takers were toothless and appalling. Bowden lets him off far too easy. Yes, the hostages made it home. But in the meantime, it became apparent to Iran and to every militant Islamist in the region that the U.S. would not fight fire with fire, and we are still paying the price for his failings.The book is an interesting study of the effect of long-term incarceration and contains many stories of individual courage, including that shown by the members of the hostage rescue mission. But, on balance, it fails to confront the reality that the U.S. government failed to respond as a great nation should have. Instead of worrrying about the nation's interests, Carter worried too much about 52 individuals. While Al Qaeda, not Carter, was responsible for 9/11, it is not too much to say that terrorists the world over were heartened by the weakness Carter showed from November 4, 1979 until his retirement on January 20, 1981."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"It is just like an American's we forget so quickly.

The book goes chronologically through the hostage crisis starting with the day the hostages were taken. The book is told from the viewpoint of different participants and reads smoothly throughout. I was impressed that the book not only tells the story of the hostages but also the would be rescuers. Additionally the book gives the political context that the hostage crisis happened in not only in America but also in Iran. With Iran being a hot button issue in today's political discourse it is nice to get some of the backstory of Iran and the United States involvement in the country.

I was 5 or 6 during the Iran hostage crisis and wanted to better understand what led up to it and if the movie was based in truth or if Hollywood took way too much \\"artistic license\\". I purposefully did not buy the book ARGO because I wanted a different perspective. What I found in this book was not only a fantastic accounting of the hostage crisis but also a great history lesson in US / Iranian relations. The book goes into great detail about the overall political climate, the political position of the hijackers and the treatment of the hostages. Ironically, hardly any detail was provided about the six potential hostages (escapees) who were the focal point of ARGO. The book also goes into great detail about the failed rescue attempt and those details are extraordinary. If you are a fan of or curious about the origin of our Special Forces (Delta Force) you will particularly enjoy those chapters despite the failure of the rescue. Although I have not quite finished the book I would highly recommend it if you are interested in the subject."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Extremely relevant to understanding today's complex foreign policy issues in the region it is also a comprehensive and fascinating retelling of this significant event which marked a distinct shift in geopolitics for the region and the world, the ramifications of which we are still dealing with today. I was 5 when the embassy was overrun, 6 when Reagan was inaugurated and they were released, and I can still remember watching the news reports with the updates and the footage of them being welcomed home, it was my first glimpse of the cruelty that is possible in the world. I have always remembered the Iran Hostage Crisis as my first major international event so I welcomed the opportunity to delve into the details as an adult. Bowden is a consummate researcher, an excellent craftsman, and has the ability to lighten the subject with moments of levity, keeping the reader engaged throughout. It is clear that he had the trust of not only the hostages and their families, along with Carter administration and military sources, but of the perpetrators as well, creating a fully dimensioned portrait of the events and the driving forces behind them while never losing sight of the human pawns who were swept along in the chess game of history they had unwillingly been drafted into. A must read."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Reading GotA called vividly to mind those 444 days that I, like so many Americans, watched and waited, our breath held and outrage simmering, as the Iran hostage crisis unfolded. Bowden does a terrific job of putting readers inside both the embassy and the minds of the hostages. GotA is heavier on profile than history/analysis, but there's just enough of the latter to establish the context of this terrible event and its lasting repercussions. When I began reading this book, the new movie \\"Argo\\" had just come out. Though the film takes certain dramatic liberties in depicting the same events as the book, it gives every impression of having captured the feel of those events, as they were lived on the ground, to a tee. I would highly recommend reading this book and seeing that film in combination."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"In 1979 when the hostage crisis began I had just turned 12. I recall how this story dominated the nightly news headlines. My father worked for the US Department of State so our family probably followed this story a little more closely than most.(In fact our family has a very tangential connection to the story. My father was a Regional Security Officer. This means that he was in charge of security for all the agencies doing business under the auspices of the embassy. In late 1979 when the shah of Iran came to Panama, I was one of the first people to hear the news. I recall feeling thrilled that my father would trust me with such a big secret.I also recall vacationing in London in 1982. We were having lunch in the US Embassy cafeteria and I recognized former hostage Ricahrd Queen. Queen had been released early because he had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.)This book was quite interesting to read because it gave us an insider's view of the hostage crisis. Bowden interviewed all the living hostages as part of his research for this book. And for those hostages that were deceased he relied on interviews conducted for other books.For those of us watching at home, it wasn't immediately apparent some of the abuse being suffered by the hostages, but Bowden lays it all bare for the reader. In addition Bowden provides great detail about the living conditions and the various moves of the hostages, the amount of contact they had with each other and the sheer psychological strain they endured.I learned a lot. For instance, I hadn't known that three of the hostages (L. Bruce Laingen, the mission chief - I attended boarding school with his son; Victor Tomseth, the political chief; and Mike Howland, the assistant security chief) spent almost their entire captivity in the Foreign Ministry, separated from the other hostages.The nucleus of Iran's grievances against the United States date back to the CIA-sponsored coup in 1953, Operation Ajax, which deposed Mohammed Mossadeq from power and installed the shah with absolute authority. Gradually the shah's rule became more and more oppressive and behind it all Iranians saw the unseen hand of the United States.When Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Iran from exile, the shah fled the country and the Islamic Republic of Iran was born with Khomeini wielding ultimate authority.The United States maintained relations with Iran and tried to cultivate contacts with the new regime. I think Bowden shows that the Iranians were so blinded by the past wrongs committed by the United States that they were unable to see that in the Carter administration they would have had a partner willing to try and make up for those past wrongs.The proverbial straw that broke the camel's back was the US decision - disastrous in hindsight - to admit the shah into the US for medical treatment. The average Iranian learning of this decision assumed that the US was plotting a way to restore the shah to power.Another huge mistake was, having made the decision to admit the shah to the US, the embassy should have been evacuated, at least temporarily.The really unique (to me, at least) feature of the book is that Bowden also tells the story from the perspective of the hostage-takers. Here is where the book really excels because Bowden shows that, far from being a well-thought-out, well-orchestrated plot, it was a stunt staged by a group of Islamist students that really spiraled out of control. The students expected the occupation of the embassy to last three days and then they expected to go home. But there was such a groundswell of popular support that it actually toppled the provisional government (Iran was in the throes of the Islamist revolution sparked by the return of Ayatollah Khomeini) and turned the student group into a player in internal politics.It also had the unintended consequence of leaving the US no-one with whom to negotiate with for the hostages' release. At several different moments the US thought it had reached agreements with representatives of the provisional government only to have the rug pulled out from underneath them by Khomeini.In the course of his research into this book, Bowden traveled to Tehran and intereviewed as many of the hostage-takers as he could. Some of them have risen to prominence in the government while others have become disillusioned by the theocracy.Not surprisingly those who attained prominence in the regime stand by their actions as a legitimate course of action. These figures seem to not understand that any benefit attainted by Iran is more than outweighed by the harm of 25+ years as an international pariah.(An aside: it is apparently without irony that some of the hostage takers protested at US interference in Iran's internal affairs. What do these people think the Iranian government does in Iraq? Afghanistan? Syria? Lebanon?)With regard to the failed rescue attempt, I have read several books about the special forces community (including Charlie Beckwith's 'Delta Force') and was quite familiar with Operation Eagle Claw. So I didn't learn anything new there. Oh, I did learn that Charlie Beckwith was a jerk.All in all, though, this was quite a well-written and informative book about an important episode in our relations with the Middle East."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"When \\"Guests of the Ayatollah\\" is good it's great, but there are basically two big climactic moments where Bowden gets to strut his stuff: the initial embassy takeover and the botched Delta Force rescue. Otherwise, it's a slog to read and you might just very well feel like you've been a hostage yourself after 500+ pages. The man writes great action...therein lies the problem: much of this material requires other talents.Bowden thinks he's masterful at sketching characters and \\"getting inside their heads\\", yet he treats each person with his pithy journalistic run-down and it is clear that what works for military types doesn't work for intellectuals and diplomats. As the crisis drags on we are once again reintroduced to the same characters and situations over and over again -- which certainly is accurate -- yet with each subsequent episode it's the same superficial rehashing of the players and motivations. For someone who is so reknowned for his research it's amazing that the author can't seem to rally his facts to steer a compelling narrative.I walk away from this book having little appreciation for the thinking of many Persians or knowing a thing about Khomeini's ideaology. Much is made of the outlandish, ridiculous politics of revolutionary Iran, but Bowden's own lack of knowledge and interest in the deeper strains of this culture is painfully evident.The same goes for the last major theater of operations -- the home front. Nothing special here...just some good, clean reportage of what transpired and the opinions; e.g. The missed opportunity to see the conflict through Brezinski's eyes is an unfortunate lapse. People like Hamilton Jordan, Cyrus Vance, and others seem to be paraded in front of the reader but remain distant abstractions. Most importantly, Carter's POV is given full credibility; Bowden fails to critically examine what can only be considered a less-than-stellar performance.All in all, a disappointing book. I see that Bowden wrote a cover article on operation \\"Eagle Claw\\" for the Atlantic last year -- one might seriously consider only reading this portion of the narrative."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Mike Bowden became famous (or at least known to me) for his Black Hawk Down book, now also a movie. Black Hawk Down was all action, fast paced, and also surprisingly short.Guest of the Ayatollah is monstrously long. Sixty percent of it can be edited out and the book would be at least as good. The most suspenseful action sequence is at the beginning, the takeover of the embassy. The rest is a mind numbing slog documenting every visit to the toilet by each hostage, including what they ate before the said visit, and what they scribbled on the wall when bored. Even the sequence where the US military attempted operation Eagle Claw to rescue the hostages is not well paced - the buildup and execution of the operation are diluted across multiple chapters (because the book tries to be chronological and cover way too many details and characters). Richard Marcinko does a much better job describing the operation in his autobiography.It seems like the author tried to create the definitive account of the hostage crisis by showing up-close the life and personalities of the hostages and the hostage takers, as well as the political environment around them. However, he misses the forest for the trees sometimes. For example, the Soviet invasion in Afghanistan or the Iran-Iraq war get minimal coverage. What else was going on in the Middle East? What else was happening in the US? What was the role of Iran on the international stage, then and now? Not enough coverage or analysis.The last chapters surrounding the epilogue are probably the best since the author tries to summarize his own findings from recent visits in Iran and his take on what happened in 1979 and why.Not recommended unless you are a masochistic history buff."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Guests of the Ayatollah presents the extensively researched, impelling non-fiction style for which Bowden has become widely acclaimed through his other best sellers. As someone who has read other Bowden books, I felt Guests of the Ayatollah is his best book to date.In this book, Bowden provides the intense, all-inclusive details from start to finish of the 444 day Iranian Hostage Crisis. The reader is taken inside the holding cell of each hostage and witnesses in vivid detail the daily routines, abuse, and emotions each hostage endured during their stay. I quickly became a fan of certain hostages such as diplomat Michael Metrinko, who so adamantly despised his captivity and insulted his captors for which he suffered solitary confinement and severe beatings up to the 444th day. While Bowden shares the heroic stories of the hostages, he doesn't disregard certain hostages who fellow captives felt were cowards and swine.Bowden has become widely acclaimed for his ability to investigate the subject of each book and then transpose his research into dramatic details for readers, and Guests of the Ayatollah is no exception to his method. Where Guests of the Ayatollah differs from other Bowden books is in its significant focus on the Iranian and American political environments during the hostage crisis. Bowden provides an in depth summary of the Carter administrations options and its secretive negotiations with what still existed of the volatile Iranian government. Rather than provide his opinion on the performance of the Carter administration, Bowden does a fine job of avoiding personal bias, and allows the reader to reach an informed conclusion in regard to the politics surrounding the Hostage Crisis.Some reviewers seem to feel that Bowden provides justification for the actions of the hostage takers. I don't believe this is accurate given that Bowden spends very little time examining the Shah's government other then to acknowledge America's continued support for the Pahlavi government up to the revolution. I found that on the controversial issues Bowden provides the facts and allows the reader draw his/her own conclusions. However, Bowden offers one prevailing conclusion that the Iranian Hostage Crisis established the power of the mullahocrasy in Iran, which runs the government to this day. The epilogue goes on to examine whether or not the hostage crisis benefited Iran, and concludes the establishment of the mullahocracy has done more harm to the country.If you enjoyed Killing Pablo, you will definitely enjoy Guests of the Ayatollah. If you liked Black Hawk Down you will also enjoy this book, though it doesn't assert the amount of focus to military operations given in Black Hawk Down. If you have not read anything by Bowden, you should, and Guests of the Ayatollah is a wonderful starting point."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Mark Bowden's \\"Guests of the Ayatollah: The First Battle in America's War with Militant Islam\\" is an excellent account of one of the lowpoints in American foreign policy: the taking of American hostages by Iranian students in 1979. Bowden's meticulously researched narrative is the definitive story of the ordeals that the hostages went through, although he does not cover the diplomatic (and other) aspects of the story as well.Bowden's story is based heavily on interviews with the hostages and he gives personal, detailed accounts of the hostage-taking and their daily lives. Most of Bowden's book focuses on the first few months of the captivity, and he spends a lot of time on the events on the day they were taken captive and the immediate days afterward. He also does a good job describing the military's training for and execution of the failed rescues mission.Although this is a very good book, I do have a couple of criticisms: Bowden's narrative, while detailed and flowing, is short on \\"historical details.\\" For example, Bowden never tells us in his text the date of the initial hostage-taking (you have to read the caption to one of the pictures to find out that it was November 4, 1979). He is also quick to defend Carter's inaction during the crisis by saying that Carter did everything that he could, which I found unconvincing.Reading this book made me mad - mad at the Iranians, mad at our government's inability to do anything, mad at the couple of hostages who cooperated with their captors, mad at the minority of family members who worked against our interests during the crisis. Some of my earliest memories of \\"current events\\" were of this crisis, and failed rescue attempt, and the announcement of their release during Reagan's inauguration. This book is a reminded of what many of us have forgotten. For this reason, if no other, this book should be read by every American. Thankfully, Bowden has written an excellent book to give us all even more reasons to read it."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"This book is thick (700 pages), but well worth reading if you are truly interested in history and culture. Despite the length of the book, it is easy to read and follow, most parts are positively riveting. I was surprised as how quickly I was able to get through it.All the positives about this amazing book -- which really does read like a novel -- have been repeated several times here, and I don't wish to be repetitive. I will share that one of my few disappointments with the book was that there was no index of key figures. I wanted to be able to quickly remind myself of who someone was and what their role was in the U.S. or Iran, without having to flip backwards to 50 pages or more. I would also have liked to have a short Farsi glossary, because it was difficult to keep track of the heirarchy of the Islamic rulers and so many foreign phrases.Towards the end, Bowden appears to lose his journalistic neutrality at points (or maybe he didn't intend to appear neutral at all). There are times when it appears that his own judgment is given, rather than a historical viewpoint, or the viewpoint of the hostages or other key figures."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"This is an interesting and well written story about the 1979 hostage crisis in Iran. Although the majority of the book focuses on the hostages themselves and their captors, it also briefly discusses what was going on in Washington. The book also gives a description of the attempted rescue of the hostages by Delta Force.....one that ended in tragedy due to a dust storm that damaged the helicopters on their way to a staging area in the middle of the Iranian desert. Because there were not enough helicopters functioning after the dust storm, the mission ended before the rescue attempt started. When the helicopters started leave the staging area in route to a carrier in the Persian Gulf, one of them collided with a C-130.Throughout the book, one reads about the courage of the hostages; some of them defiant to end. In some instances, it was almost humorous how the hostages made life difficult for their captors. Even though none of the hostages were killed, the book shows that it was a traumatic experience for the hostages. They lived for more than a year under constant threat of death. Some of them even endured what they thought was going to be their execution. The book changed my opinion of how Carter handled the crisis. I used to think that he was weak and ineffective in how he handled the crisis, but in the end, all of the hostages came back alive. There really weren't any real options for rescuing the hostages without tremendous risk of losing them or our troops. Delta Force was in its infancy at the time and even though they trained their mission and were ready, many thought that the mission was extremely dangerous and even suicidal. When Carter exhausted all attempts at diplomacy, he decided to order the attempted rescue and unfortunately the Iranian desert doomed the mission.I enjoyed the book and learned a lot about what the hostages experienced in what was our introduction to Islamic extremism."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"I was a bit too young to remember, much less understand, the events that unfolded on 4 November 1979 (that have since been eclipsed by the events of 11 September 2001). Years later, I remember going to class down a hallway where one could spot the occasional faded sticker on a locker door that had the Stars and Stripes and screamed \\"Free the hostages!\\" on the bottom. I would wonder what that was all about and what that meant. Two decades later, after hearing about these events through the prism of media reports, I got this book. After reading it, I can honestly say that it will be considered a \\"primary source\\" for historians for decades to come.The book reads like a novel; constructed with dialogue and differing points of view, from the Iranian militant students who stormed the embassy, to the Carter administration, the Delta Force that eventually took part in the ill-fated Operation Eagle Claw, and the hostages themselves. Bowden does a commendable job of reconstructing these events and the American, Iranian, and to a lesser extent, the world reaction to the embassy takeover. At the close of the book, an at-length expose of Iran a quarter century later, as well as what became of some of the 66 hostages (11 of whom have since died, making the writing of books such as these ever more important as time passes) closes the circle and leaves the reader with much to think about and to consider.Perhaps the greatest strength of the book is Mr. Bowden's commendable efforts to contact as many of the participants as possible, to include U.S. government officials, Iranian government officials, and interviews with the participants, both hostage takers and hostages alike. This makes for a well-balanced, objective look at the events of that time. No one can justify the seizure of an embassy, as it goes against every convention and all diplomatic protocol imaginable, but Mr. Bowden deserves much credit for nonetheless working tirelessly to look at, and present the events, from the Iranian angle regardless. It is also an \\"easy\\" read (not dry or bogged down in any way); once I began I found it hard to put down. I find it curious that the review I first encountered decried the changes in scenery and the long \\"dramatis personae\\"; while indeed this does occur, I found it less daunting than in other books. It is also helpful that many of the people we encounter here are people we already know about.The weaknesses are something I feel compelled to nit-pick. Mr. Bowden apparently does not believe that capitalization of proper nouns is necessary in the English language. Would it have physically pained him to capitalize different branches of service, titles, and offices, all of which can be said to be proper nouns, or was he flirting with the writing convention of e.e. cummings? It is hard to say, but I found this grating. I am curious as to why the Ayatollah Khomeini was constantly referred to as an imam, which is the Arabic, not Farsi, term for what the Iranians would call a mullah (an ayatollah being the highest-ranked mullah), but no explanation of this usage was provided anywhere. As the book concluded with the release of the hostages, Mr. Bowden kept referring to Inauguration Day as happenning on the 21st of January, even though the inauguration, as all have since 1937, took place at 12 noon on the 20th (8:30 p.m. in Tehran, also on the 20th). Finally, being as I am not old enough to recall the embassy takeover, I found it curious that, especially in the beginning, he kept alluding to a previous embassy takeover in February 1979, in the very beginning of the Islamic Revolution, but he provided no further explanation as to what happened (other than a similar event that took place at the U.S. consulate in Tabriz that he briefly highlights). Perhaps it would have been even more illustrative had he began here as a prologue, and then kicked off his book with the cold, wet early November day that would go so terribly wrong with the U.S. embassy in Tehran.Nonetheless, I found this book to be a first-rate chronicle of the 444 day hostage crisis that essentially ended a presidency and has kept U.S.-Iranian relations on ice ever since. If you are like me, and lack first-hand knowledge of what happened during those days, this book will benefit you by providing you with plenty of details of all that happened then. If you are old enough to remember this time period, perhaps even watching the program that would eventually turn into the modern-day \\"Nightline\\" back then, you will learn a great deal of behind-the-scenes goings on that may alter your perceptions of what was going on between 4 November 1979 and 20 January 1981. \\"Guests of the Ayatollah\\" is a highly recommended read."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"Bowden does a great service to the hostages in detailing their story in this very readable account. The main disappointment is his pandering to the left in implying that America was somehow responsible for the hostage taking by supporting the Shah (still the best ruler Iran has ever had, even if he was a tyrant). He is also very soft on Carter, ignoring the massive failings of the administration on many issues, including this one, which led the terrorists (\\"students\\") to think they could get away with the seizure, which they did. Still, the account is accurate in its details and is long overdue."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"This is a long book, yet Mark Bowden manages to keep the pace going and provide an insider's view into the Iran Hostage Crisis. He manages to convey both the day to day story and the larger picture very effectively."},{"Title":"Unheard Words: Women and Literature in Africa, the Arab World, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America","review":"This is an excellent book and it gives an objective, nearly complete look at the hostage crisis in Iran. It is a compelling chapter in American and Iranian history and this book tells the story so well and from both sides point of view that it should be assigned as a supplemental book in any history course that covers American/Iranian history of the period. While some will complain about the detail involved in the story of the hostages' day-to-day existence while held captive in Iran as \\"boring,\\" it is a necessary component of the book. After all, this was a crisis that lasted 444 days and understanding the hostages' long-term suffering and boredom is an important part of the story. I also did not find that aspect of the book boring, but I can see where some certainly would lose some interest. However, the book did fall short of perfection. It grieves me to give the book four stars instead of five, but the author missed an important component of the story. While Islam is certainly mentioned and discussed, there should have been a chapter with some of the developmental background of the Ayatollah's early life and an objective discussion of Twelver, Shiite Islam that played such a large part in the Martyrdom complex mentioned in the book and the prevalent belief in predestination that Allah controls all and all will happen as Allah wills along with the end-times death-cult aspect of Iranian Twelver Shiite Islam. It is these aspects of Twelver Shiite Islam that led the hardliners to so ignore the practical implications of their conduct and to take such a ruinous path that continues today with Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons. The book offers no discussion of the full beliefs of the fundamentalists like the Ayatollah that controlled the outcome of the crisis. In fact, some of the hostages themselves are quoted making statements about Islam that reflect what I call an incomplete understanding of Islam. For example, one hostage derides his jailer as not acting like Muhammad because, as the hostage believed, Muhammad had benevolently spared everyone in Mecca when he took the city. While such perceptions of Muhammad are not unusual among many Muslims and such beliefs are certainly readily peddled upon ignorant non-Muslims, the reality is that Muhammad had some critics killed when he took Mecca and the mass conversion to Islam was a result of his large army and fear of what would happen if they did not convert to Islam. Moreover, Muhammad committed many atrocities and for one of the Americans to plead with his jailer to be more like Muhammad was quite ignorant as a fundamentalist Muslim, more well schooled in Muhammad's full history, may well have said OK and chopped off his neck just as Muhammad had done to hundreds of captives. This book, as the full title indicates, was about America's first encounter with militant Islam, but there is no attempt to explain militant Islam and the result is that readers will not obtain the full understanding of what drove the rabid hatred of America and why events that happened decades prior loomed so large in the minds of Iranians. Just what was it in the religion of the Iranians that made them so fervent in their hatred and so ready to believe any rumor about the Americans? It was at its core the influence of Islam on the culture upon which the Ayatollah and his supporters so capitalized. This book is in many ways symbolic of why the crisis occurred and why even today so many of our leaders have a poor understanding of what drives Iranian behavior. It is the inability to explore, discover and admit that real Islam drove the hostage crisis and that the moderates are the ones that have hijacked the religion. One more chapter added to the book discussing the foregoing topics and this book would have been the author's Magnum Opus and a perfect recording of the crisis that would be read, and justifiably so, by many generations to come. Even with its errors of omission, this is still a wonderful book and I suspect that it may remain in print for a long time."},{"Title":"Culdcept (Culdcept), vol. 1","review":"Based on the semi-popular PS2/Dreamcast RPG video game, Culdecept is a manga taking place in the same world as the game. Not necessarily based on the game itself, but taking the surroundings and ideas from it, similar to how Wild Arms TV did from its original game series.Set in the land of Bablascha, special card each contain a monster or creature within them that can be summoned forth to do battle. Sorta like in Yu-Gi-Oh, accept for real. Each card is a piece of an ancient book called the Culdcept which was made by the goddess Culdra in her creation of the universe. Only people called Cepters can actually wield the powers of these cards.Najaran is an apprentice Cepter, and she gets sent by her master to seek out info about the mysterious Black Cepters who are attacking city upon city in their quest to collect all of the cards, and gain ultimate power. Najaran and her strange comrade Goligan, a living magical staff with the head of an old man, head off to desert town of Soron, and get railroaded into taking part in a Cepters tournament. After defeating all the other contestants, Najaran confronts the cocky elf boy Zeneth. Their fight nearly destroys the stadium, but Zeneth forfits making Najaran the winner.She then gets invited to the local kings house for a banquet. Najaran soon discovers though that the king has been replaced by evil Black Cepter, Depthera. It looks like she is to be doomed, but Najaran gets saved by the last minute by Zeneth of all people. From this point, it becomes Najaran's mission to hunt down the reminaing Black Cepters, and their dark lord.Culdcept is a pretty good manga, certainly well drawn. The character designs are a little original for a a manga too, although some seem like their right out of Lodoss War. This is a fine series for otaku and furries. Fans of Final Fantasy will take delight in seeing Cait Sith make a cameo, or at least the Culcept universe version of him."},{"Title":"Tom Watson: Agrarian rebel","review":"Woodward, the dean of southern historians, was the author of numerous definitive works on the south from 1865-1900, including THE STRANGE CAREER OF JIM CROW and ORIGINS OF THE NEW SOUTH. He won the Pulitzer prize for editing the diaries of Mary Chestnut, but he probably deserved it for this, his first work. Woodward was a master prose stylist, but I don't quite think he ever quite matched this book in wit and irony. The first half of the book is replete with CHARACTERS worthy of Anthony Trollope, John Brown Gordon, the &quot;plumed knight of Appomattox&quot; and main player in one of the great stock market scandals of the day; Joe Brown, the former confederate governor of Georgia also known as &quot;Old Judge-MENT&quot;; Alexander H. Stephens, the former vice-president of the Confederacy and a force to be reckoned with even in declining health; and last but not least Robert Toombs, a TRUE unreconstructed rebel, who refused to take the oath of allegiance to the Union after the war, who hated the railroads (and the use of public funds in their development) almost as much as he hated the North. Even though he was unable to hold public office, he maintained influence just by his force of personality. Above them all is Watson, a man who loves (and hates) not wisely but too well. A man of infinite paradoxes. An apologist for the &quot;old south&quot; who proclaimed the common interests between black farmers and white farmers. A white man who, more than once, would defend black political allies from lynching, but later would be the most vociferious defender of the practice. A crusader against corporations, he would grow fearful of socialism. A democrat with authoritarian personality. A man of the people who was one of the largest landowners (and landlords) in Georgia. A powerful &quot;demagogue&quot; (in the root sense of the word) who was a remarkably BAD politician and political strategist, eventually turning on every constituency and ally. Incorruptable, but in the end wholly given over to his (and his region's) prejudices, hatreds, and pathology.This is a definitive biography, but not the last word on Watson--certainly not the last word on populism. As much as we see of Watson's psyche, this book is very much an account of a public life, the personal dimension and familial relationships are only touched on, sometimes only hinted at. If every there was a subject fit for a &quot;psychobiography&quot; it is Watson.As to the movement he lead, the somewhat idealized portrait needs to be balance with reference to THE WOOL-HAT BOYS and BLACKS AND THE POPULIST REVOLT. But when all is said, this book is a classic. Worthy of sharing shelfspace with Boswell's LIFE OF JOHNSON and even Trollope's politcal novels and Gore Vidal's historical novels."},{"Title":"Tom Watson: Agrarian rebel","review":"Watson's story is a fantastic one, and this book tells it well. This book is superlative to follow Georgia politics in years Watson affected it. One is totally repelled by Watson after 1904, not only by his vicious anti-Catholicism but even worse by his role in the Leo Frank case. This book is a sheerly interesting book about an awful man. It is of interest that Woodward describes Autobiography: The Story of an Old Man's Life, by Nathaniel E. Harris as &quot;one of the most remarkable books ever written.&quot; I wonder where I can find the book."},{"Title":"Tom Watson: Agrarian rebel","review":"Woodward was a master, and is sorely missed. Tom Watson is an epic and tragic story of a man, and the history of Populism as a movement, with all the aspirations and limits of American democracy. The single best work of history i have ever read. If it is out of print, that is a true shame."},{"Title":"Tom Watson: Agrarian rebel","review":"Jimmy Carter has always referred to the demagogic Tom Watson as a political mentor. Hardly surprising since Watson was a phoney and a bigot who began his career supposedly championing Poor Whites - AND - Blacks, and ended it an acolyte of the Ku Klux Klan, a Jew-baiter, Catholic hater, a political hack of the Segregationist Democratic Party and unrepentent Racist who \\"stabbed\\" the backs of the very Blacks he once claimed to be as friends. His notorious role in the judicial murder of Leo Frank*, as Woodward related, was especially repugnant. In effect, Watson called for mob rule - and chortled \\"Jewish Libertines take Notice\\" after Frank, who was innocent of the murder of Mary Phagan, was judicially murdered by a bunch of Watson's minions and hired thugs.Carter of course started off in reverse, but there is really no difference between the two outside of their half-baked, suiting their needs \\"Liberalism\\". Watson was a coward and a bigot, Carter no different.Woodward also gives the reader an overview of post-Reconstruction Georgia, with cast of characters including John Gordon, the Confederate General who became a U.S. Senator, pledging loyalty to the United States, yet in effect continuing the policy of the Confederacy including ensuring that Black Americans lived little better than slaves. A fertile breeding ground for a Watson - and later, Lester Maddox and James Earl Carter Jr.*p.s. Frank was innocent, and the courageous Governor Slaton chose to commute the death sentence pushed by Watson. By doing so, however, Slaton was forced to flee Georgia when his life was threatened by Watson's minions and by the Klan, leaving Frank to a horrible fate. Many years later, the true killer of Mary Phagan confessed. It is interesting though, that Mr. Carter NEVER signed a posthumous pardon for Mr. Frank. It was finally signed by his successor in office."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Dictionary of Greek and Roman Mythology","review":"Having had ocassion to research and write several papers dealing with mythology, I have often turned to Stapleton's book to acquire at least a basic familiarity with a myth or legend.

He says he's a duck, a big brown duck, &quot;Well, he has no feathers/and he has no beak./He has four claws/on his hairy-scary feet./He has two ears/that stick up a mile,/and a wicked/foxy nose/and a wicked/foxy smile.&quot; But shrewd Mama Duck isn't really fooled. She tells that old fox, &quot;Do like a duck does&quot;, and pretty soon she has him waddling, scuttling, and strutting, jumping into mud puddles, eating bugs and beetles, running through thistles, and diving into the river. &quot;Down go the ducklings, all tails up!

In this story, the fox attempts to persuade mother duck that he is a duck as well, so that he can sneak up on her ducklings and have one for lunch. Mother duck asks the visitor to prove himself by quacking, waddling, eating bugs for lunch, and - finally - diving headfirst deep into the pond, whereupon the fox decides it's not worth all the trouble and heads for home. Children who don't know that foxes eat ducklings might find the story to be a bit over their heads. I think my daughter, who is 3, was too young to really enjoy it.

Thanks and best regards!"},{"Title":"SCENT IN YOUR GARDEN.","review":"There are so many gardening books on the market why should you care about this one? Well, for one thing the author Stephen Lacey is a distinguished British garden expert involved with the preservation of all those lovely gardens you like to visit when you go to the U.K. Lacey, not to be confused with Allen Lacy his garden buddy in New Jersey, is also the author of THE STARTLING JUNGLE a very good book on building the appealing and different personal space.In SCENT IN YOUR GARDEN, Lacey continues with his discussion about adding elements to the garden that pleasantly stimulate the five senses. In SCENT he list many plants (photos and text descriptions) including trees, shrubs, bulbs, perennials, and of course Roses that fill the air with perfume.One might not think of planting a tree for its scent, but I can attest to the wonderful perfume of the Persian or English Walnut tree--and the nuts are tasty too. Of course Lacey includes those plants many of us already know, Nicotiana, Hyacynths, and Lonicera (honeysuckle) but he also tells the reader certain species of tulips, daffodils, Paeonias, Viburnum, and herbs have their charms.Lacey includes a section on herbs. He says herbs can be grown in herb gardens, but culinary herbs in particular are quite a treat grown in pots by the back door--Parsley, Sage, Rosemary, Thyme--provided there is enough sun. So you have the double pleasure of smelling the herbs through the screen door or window, and enjoying their aroma served up in your favorite dish. Some species of butterflies are particularly fond of Parsley so you'll have some pretty sights too (they lay their eggs which then pupate and eat it!!).Lacey's book does not discuss growing techniques in any great detail, but it probably wouldn't matter anyway since what works for a plant in England often does not work in the U.S. I live in Zone 7, however, and I most of these plants will work in my growing zone. The roses are tricky--what works in the mild English sun often croaks in the hot Virginia sun--but he lists two roses I am growing for their scent--Comte de Chabord and Blanc Double de Courbet. I have also been able to get some roses to grow in Virginia Lacey does not list such as the lovely clove scented climber Polka.I recommend this book to anyone trying to bring a little perfume (day or night) into their surroundings. Scented plants can be grown anywhere and from my perspective, the sense of smell is just as important as the sense of sight in the garden."},{"Title":"SCENT IN YOUR GARDEN.","review":"\\"Scent is the most potent and bewitching substance in the gardener's repertory and yet it is the most neglected and least understood.\\" This single introductory sentence sets the tone for the bombardment of the senses that awaits us within the pages of this book.Mr.Lacey's book is so beautiful, it might be hard to believe the emphasis is on fragrance and not color. But, scent is the waft of anticipation overflowing within his chapters. It is his premise that the garden should reward us with pleasure of fragrance every day of the year. He has set about to fulfill this promise by giving us encyclopedic information on fragrant trees, shrubs, perennials, annuals, bulbs, roses and, of course, herbs. Specific selections within each genus help the gardener to choose the most fragrant of the Mock Oranges, Honeysuckles and Old Roses.But, this is much more than just a beautifully illustrated reference book. There is practical advice on every page. Mr. Lacey's observations help us to choose the right scented plant for the close border, the wall garden or the tree lined driveway. Shade, Water, Rock or Conservatory, no garden is to be without a selection that will satisfy the hunger of our nose.And, even though he is an English Garden Writer, Mr. Lacey has thoughtfully included English measurements (as well as metric) and notations of soil preference. If you garden in very hot areas of the US, be sure and take those part shade directions to heart.Whether you haven't thought about the Scent in Your Garden or want to fine tune the orchestra of fragrant sensations in your existing garden, this book will have you making lists and tracking down those 'can't do without' fragrant plants."},{"Title":"Decorative Touches","review":"If you are seeking to create elegant and decadent gum paste flower sprays for a show-stopping celebration cake, this is your book! Decorative Touches by Tombi Peck is a creative and imaginative approach to gum paste flower sprays for cakes. This book encompasses weddings, christenings, Mother's Day, and a harvest cake.What I appreciated most about this book is the attention to detail in the pictures. Showing how to wire a floral spray was a great way to add value to this book, and a great example of the attention to detail showed by the author. Peck also showcased her originality in the diversity of the projects presented from bonsai trees to a water lily pram. I found the book to be well-written, original, detailed, but regionalized."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Pleasure","review":"I thought this book was an average read. The characters did not reach me at a personal level, and it did not pull at the heart strings. I thought that Skye was a little bit flaky. She fell into bed and in love with both of her men awfully quick. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with falling into bed, but she just made it seem a little blase. It was all in all worth the read, but if you loved this book and have not read Virginia Henley's Pirate and the Pagan, you must pick it up. It is by far a better book. In fact, it is one of the best books I have ever had the privilege of reading and the storyline is very similar with one exception. NO WIGS!"},{"Title":"A Pirate's Pleasure","review":"Move over Errol Flynn! This is swashbucking at its best. If you're a reader whom can feel being present during the scenes in the book, and if you enjoy sword fights, battles on the sea, then you'll enjoy 'A Pirate's Pleasure'. Although not a constant thrill, when the fights did occur, I found myself sitting on the edge of, whatever I was sitting on, turning the pages to see the outcome of the altercation. The characters were enjoyable. Once you resigned yourself to get past the wigs, powdered hair, buckled shoes (I find it hard to call a man handsome with buckled shoes and powdered wigs), you thoroughly enjoyed the characters and came to love the rogues of the novel, Lord Cameron and Captain Hawk. Skye Kinsdale Cameron was forever reaking havoc either on land and on sea and forever leading both she and her male companions on perilous life threatening edge of your seat escapades. In the words of Captain Hawk, 'she was trouble'. And their love was stronger and more tumultuous than any hurricane on the ocean, or any tornado on land. In response to the reviewer from Utah, whom suggested reading 'Pagan and Pirate', she's right, the 'Pagan and Pirate' is an outstanding novel (one of my favorites), however, I didn't compare the two. I loved both. 'A Pirate's Pleasure' was non stop swashbucking, reckless behavior, and edge of your seat escape scenes, whereas, 'Pagan and the Pirate' was sensuous and deadly intensive. I suggest you read both, and enjoy both authors and enjoy their unique styles of writing characters that we either love or hate and always remember."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Pleasure","review":"All right. so maybe the pirates in this catastrophe weren't unionized, but that's the impression I got from Silver Hawk and his pirate brotherhood (updated for 2001, of course). I'm not sure this book is bad so much as it is only ridiculous. Having read Sweet Savage Eden, I was curious about its sequel, and that curiosity did not pay off for me. A Pirate's Pleasure is a pale shimmer of its predecessor, with characters and dialogue so disparate from the first that I had to wonder if indeed the same author penned both books. Any book in which the heart of a knight lies within the (perfect, of course) physique of a pirate immediately gets slated as &quot;humor&quot; in my mind. On the bright side, at least some of the cover art isn't your typical Barbie doll stuff--the portrait of Skye Kinsdale on the spine and the back cover looks much like Sigourney Weaver after battling the aliens. Pretend you don't see this one."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Pleasure","review":"I got this book when it first came out; it was my first Heather Graham book. It was by FAR the most passionate and entrancing and still remains my #1. I gave it to one of my girlfriends and it went on to many of my co-workers! They all bought the book; I bought another because this one was pretty worn out. Needless to say, I have bought many of Heather's books since &quot;Pirate&quot;."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Pleasure","review":"Loved the book. As stated by others there is no rape in this book. Not even sure how they got rape in any way. Maybe some clothes ripping and a forced kissed with a little bit of fondling, but that's it. It's a great read with a twist. Most likely you will be able to figure out the twist before you get there. I do find Skye a little annoying, but not that bad. I have read and re-read a lot of Heather Graham/Shannon Drake's books and now that I am older I realize she makes the heroine seem dumb a lot times, even though they are smart. How I mean this is when the heroine tries to defy the hero, she does some pretty dumb things. She also argues a lot for no reason. Some of the times it does not even making sense. In this book Skye just rushes reckless a long time after time putting her and others in danger. That is what I find somewhat annoying about the heroine. With all that said, she is still one of my favorite writers."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Pleasure","review":"This is hands down the best Pirate book I have ever read. The story line was slam packed with action and romance. How Heather Graham can think of this stuff blows my mind. I definately recommend this book. I could not put it down and was sorry when it was over."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Pleasure","review":"I have a three letter word that describes this book. \\"OMG!! Ok, \\"omg\\" is not a word but its the best word, letters, or slang to describe this fabulous book.The man and the girl are not just perfect but born for each other. The chemistry is outrageous. Sky is one of my most favorite female characters so far. She is strong even though she does have a few weakness's but that does not stop her from fighting for what she wants. I won't add to much more because the first 2 chapters will tell you everything you need to know. I have read over 100 books this year so far and over 300 last year and this book was the most unpredictable. The twist in this book made A Pirates pleasure my favorite book of all time!

Her alpha male heroes and ultra-sassy heroines are unforgettable, but more than that she turns this genre into literature. You can see the stories unfold as if you were watching an epic movie from the fifties with Technicolor and the best actors of the day. If only they made movies like this today, but alas there are no stars to portray these valiant characters and no directors clever enough to bring them to life. Lucky for us they come alive during the reading of Ms. Graham's spectacular stories. A Pirate's Pleasure is truly a masterpiece. It is beautifully written and one cannot wait to turn the page and see what new adventure awaits. The love story is captivating and tender and makes the reader feel the romance and the emotion.Brava, Ms. Graham. I have just ordered several more of your books and cannot wait to indulge myself.A.

Hide the cover with a paper bag and forget you ever saw it, because it is not indicative of the story's worth. This book was well-written and engaging from the very first page. The plot line was actually so well concealed that I was completely taken by surprise at where it was going, in a very, very good way. After reading the book, I went back and re-read the one-star reviews and realized that those women had either given up and thrown the book away (gasp!) before they got to the plot spoiler, OR they were feminists who were much MUCH to eager to cry rape. There absolutely was NO rape in this book.This is a great book, despite the cover, and gave me two days of mini-vacation right in my house. I definitely recommend it; you will be happy you gave it a chance!"},{"Title":"A Pirate's Pleasure","review":"This book is the classic example of an 80's romance novel with plenty of over-the-top action and cheesy romance dialog. I can see why there are big fans of this book as the story is not meant to be taken seriously. It was a fun rompt story that never let up from the action. My only big complaint was the heroine, as she got on my nerves. She fought, complained and put herself in danger non-stop! She pulls so many stupid decisions, all in the name of keeping the story action packed, but it was too much. This story would have been much better if only the heroine showed a bit of common sence. How the great Pirate hero falls for her was a mystery to me."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Pleasure","review":"I would recommend this book others readers. I enjoyed reading the Pirates Pleasure. Very nice and light very amusing story. But unusual for Ms. Graham. I am used to her more heavy and intense writing style. I think, however, that the heroine in the story was not very smart. Without giving away the story's surprise I feel she should have smelled a rat sooner. About four years ago I read a story similar to this but that other pirate was better at disguising his identity.The Pirate and the Pagan"},{"Title":"A Pirate's Pleasure","review":"In response to a previous review, I fail to recall a rape scene in this book. The heroine cries rape at one point in a fruitless effort to deny her true feelings. But, I don't feel that there is actually rape occurring.I remember when I first read this book. I was so engrossed that I had to read it all in one sitting. I believe I stayed up until 2 in the morning.While Love Not a Rebel is my absolute favorite (number 3 in the North American Woman trilogy), A Pirate's Pleasure (number 2 in the trilogy) is one that I reread often as I continue to derive pleasure from it. Be sure to check out Sweet Savage Eden (number 1). Also, for a continuation of the Cameron legacy, look for the Civil War trilogy: One Wore Blue, And One Wore Gray, followed by And One Rode West.

I will say, however, that after reading this book I had to go burn it in my kitchen sink. Not in a censorship kind of way, more like a spiritually cleansing kind of way. I know some of the older romance novels often included a rape scene as a convenient way to explain why a character lost her virtue (and therefore could continue to sleep with the hero) but the rape in this book (which does not come at the hands of the pirate) is beyond belief. The fact that the main character is content to stay and fall in love with the man who rapes her goes against all my feminist sensibilites. This book is a gigantic waste of time.

This was one of the worst books I have every read. The review on the back of this book never even mentions her husband that she didn't know she even married because her father went behind her back to force the issue. It talks about the romance with her husband's cousin and him being a pirate. Then for a woman to be bedded by two men unwilling is not romance. Then to discover your pregnant and you don't know who the father is not romance. That's terrible! Save the trees do not print any more. If I could give this book a negative I would. One star is just to high for this book. Never will I read another one of her books. Your time is more valuable then to waste it reading this book."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Pleasure","review":"I LOVED this series by Heather Graham overall, but I got annoyed this particular heroine. I was ready for the pirate captain dump her on some desert island to get rid of her she was so naggy and shrewish, with no particular redeeming qualities. I found their verbal sparring in the book annoying after a while, her constant unreasonable escape attempts silly (I mean, really???) You've on an island where you can see from the ship's window that its a pirate's lair with no possible means of escape other than to fall into worse hands, but you decide you're going to do it anyway - well, just because... Why? No explicable reason...) And then when the hero is playing duel roles, I found I just couldn't believe she wouldn't recognize his voice, something about his ways - even with a wig - that would give her a clue. AND - then he (spoiler) makes her think she might not be able to tell which man is the father of her child???? How cruel! That said, I LOVE this series. This book (in my opinion) is just the weak link."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Pleasure","review":"This was my first Heather Graham and it introduced me to a wonderful trilogy (The North American Women) that is a part of the Cameron Saga (see list below). It is the 2nd in the trilogy and I recommend reading them in order (which I have now done). This second one is set in 18th century America (Virginia) and the Caribbean, and it captivated me from page one. I never lost interest and neither will you.It's the story of Lady Skye Kinsdale whose father has ordered her home to Virginia to marry a man he's promised her to from birth--a man she's never met. She's coming home aboard her father's ship from England where she has been at a finishing school. Before she leaves England her father has her wed by proxy to the man, Lord Roc Cameron, but she knows nothing of it. When her ship has nearly arrived, it is seized by pirate One Eyed Jack, a ruthless killer. But before he can have her, another pirate, the Silver Hawk, retakes both vessels and holds Skye captive. Skye, who was trained to use a sword by the finest swordsman in Europe, can hold her own against the pirates, and does. The Silver Hawk (\\"Hawk\\") admires her courage...and her golden haired beauty. But Hawk confuses Skye. On the one hand he is ruthless, rough and domineering and on the other he is gentle and honorable and holds her through her nightmares (she fears darkness). Unaware she's been wed to Lord Cameron, Skye finds herself attracted to \\"the pirate scum\\" (her words). And so the adventure begins...and it is a real adventure. A keeper!The plot is intricate and has a major twist I did not see coming. I could not put it down and stayed up very late to read it. Once it was finished, I had to read it again--immediately. You won't regret buying this book. Having now read the others in the series, I can say they are equally good. Heather Graham's writing is superb. The story pulls you in and does not let you go. There are no slow spots as the action and characters become so real. The sexual tension permeates the book and is very believable.Here's the Cameron Saga:The North American Women trilogy: Sweet Savage Eden, A Pirate's Pleasure and Love Not a RebelThe Camerons in the Civil War trilogy: One Wore Blue, And One Wore Gray, And One Rode West"},{"Title":"A Pirate's Pleasure","review":"I love every thing pirates and when I came across this book, I couldn't pass it up. I was definitely not disappointed! I thought it would be a usual pirate book, but several twists and turn in the book keep you glued to the book. I love how strong willed Skye is and how courageous she could fight. This is definitely a keeper!"},{"Title":"Eric and Matilda","review":"This is a lovely picture book for children. The simple drawings help illustrate the characters, Eric and Matilda. When Eric sees Matilda it's love at first sight. Eric wants Matilda to know he loves her, but try as he may she doesn't notice him. Finally Eric is advised by a wise owl to simply tell Matilda how he feels. When Eric tells Matilda he loves her he is pleasantly surprised to hear she loves him too and they both fly south together."},{"Title":"Cola (Spanish Edition)","review":"\\"Cola\\" translates as \\"Glue\\".

I did not go out looking for this. It was recommended by a friend.The book is a little slow getting into, so hang in there. I usually give a book about 80 pages. If it is not good by 80 pages it probably will never get good. This book passes the page test though.This book surprised me by the author's ability to write a ficticious story about nonfictitious characters. For the time that it was written it is superb. I recommend it to those who are looking for a good read."},{"Title":"One Up: a Woman in Action With the Sas","review":"Sarah Ford's two-fisted journey from a London council flat to the WRENS (Royal Navy) to her undercover action with the Special Air Service in Northern Ireland is an amazing odyssey, and her narrative keeps the pages turning. This is one tough broad, brought up on the mean streets of London, and her poignant struggle to escape the despair and poverty of the bottom rungs of British society and lead a productive life is truly inspiring.What is really amazing about this coming-of-age story, however, is the unusual direction it sudenly takes, leading her away from the Royal Navy and into the shadowy world of the SAS, where she risks her life almost daily in the deadly rowhouses of Northern Ireland. This is an angle on &quot;The Troubles&quot; you don't see much of. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"One Up: a Woman in Action With the Sas","review":"This book is a first person account of the personal experiences of the woman who lived a life out of the ordinary. It offers the reader the reality of her personal life from her upbringing and how it lead her to serve in the British forces, her training for special operations and clandestine operations in Northern Ireland during some of the worst years of its history. This is a well-written book that offers the reader facts, intrigue and humour in rapid fire.Sarah Ford offers the reader superb value for money with this book and could easily offer us another. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"One Up: a Woman in Action With the Sas","review":"\\"One up - A woman's action with the SAS\\" by Sarah Ford is interesting, but not particularly well written - the journalist who worked with Ford on the script doesn't seem to have done her job all that well. I didn't find Ford likeable, but I assume she couldn't care less - she comes across as a capable, determined woman succeeding and gaining acceptance in an environment where this isn't the norm. The portrayal of the \`Det' and the SAS as hard-working, hard-drinking professionals with a penchant for schoolboy pranks at each other's expense comes across as odd, but then what do I know? An elite evolves its own rules, after all..."},{"Title":"A Simple Story","review":"This is no &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; -- everybody gets what they deserve, according to the strictest moral code, and some get it with interest.However, Inchbald excels at characterization -- she unites vanity and passion in one character, and still has a believable personality to show the reader -- and she can show a character in change, without losing the character's integrity. Although the tragedy she creates has a moral &quot;told you so&quot; aspect hard for modern readers to take, it also has the pathetic grandeur of the great tragedies -- small, pointless faults and actions which lead to irreversible pain. The humanity of Inchbald's insight is what makes this book one of my favorites among the 18th century women writers."},{"Title":"A Simple Story","review":"Those who like Austen, Edgeworth, and Burney will enjoy this novel by Mrs. Inchbald. The primary characters of Mr. Dorriforth and Miss Milner are written with such humanity and honesty rather than cliched caricatures. (Warning: spoiler alert) Of particular notice is Inchbald's treatment of the adulterous or \\"fallen\\" wife. It is quite different than the other portayals given in other 17th and early 18th century novels. Inchbald makes neither a villainess nor a martyr out of Miss Milner (Lady Elmwood), but shows her as a victim of being brought up to be selfish and spoiled. The reader finds themselves rooting for Miss Milner's reform due to her many good qualities and her sincere and ardent love for her husband. You find yourself alternately pitying her and being disgusted by her. Yet the image of her that is left is that of a true penitent. Dorriforth's weakneses are explored as well and his transformation into an unmerciful tyrant as a result of her betrayal is an interesting plot twist of Inchbald's. By the end of the novel, Mrs. Incbald succeeds in convincing her reader to lament the spoiled and indulged upbringing of Miss Milner and to ponder what could have been if she had been raised differently."},{"Title":"A Simple Story","review":"Inchbald has a great talent with words. This books is insightful, provocative and dramatic. Inchbald talks about love with such candidness and frankness that while your reading you can't help but feel an overflowing of emotions toward the main characters. Very satisfying ending the tidies up all the problems throughout the book."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"This is one of my favorite books, along with The Godfather & The Last Don."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"I thought this book was gonna be good because of who wrote it, but it just goes on and on and on with no point and not a whole lot of plot."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"Merlyn would have hated this book and the author who wrote it.

Very depressing and dark, but Puzo is the master story teller and his talents are vividly displayed in this epic story. One of my favorite Mario Puzo books."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"Don't believe the 5-star reviews of Fools Die. It's a stinker!The inside info about gambling casinos was interesting, but the book had no plot and was just a rambling collection of episodes with little point, except the futility of life.People who call this \\"brilliant\\" or a \\"masterpiece\\" must have low standards. If you don't find yourself bored out of your skull, then you'll be at least angered by the chauvinistic treatment of women and the 1970s opposition to women's liberation. It must be that when you have a bestseller, you can write whatever junk you want and it will get published. I don't know how Puzo stayed awake while he was writing this--undoubtedly with copious infusions of caffeine.Spare yourself the misery. Don't believe the 5-star reviews."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"Tedious, arid, banal, boring, bromidic, insipid, lifeless, random, tangential, vapid, pointless, plotless minutia about nothing.If this \\"book\\" has a plot, then its safe to say no one has discovered it yet. Even the five star reviews posted on Amazon are unable to provide even a hint as to a plot. Truly, this book, the first 35 pages are about playing cards, could be likened to a book describing the grass growing. Fact is, Puzo had one good book in him: the Godfather. Nothing he wrote before or since, is worth reading."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"It's really too bad that \\"Casino\\" came along and kind of cornered the market on the \\"Vegas in the '70s\\" movie because this one would have made a hell of a film had anyone ever had the vision and the talent to bring it to the screen. Because it's got everything \\"Casino\\" has and a plethora more: It's fiction so the storyteller doesn't have to pay tribute to some schlepp's \\"real life\\" story of \\"behind the scenes\\" Vegas. Not only that, it lays out a magic carpet on which the reader flies, taking him into worlds of earthly delight that approach dizzying heavenly heights only to see these mortal fools fall from the clouds into the hell that only human greed, lust, and, yes, love's betrayal can create. The story deals with three best friends, Merlyn, a writer, Janelle, a bewitchingly beautiful actress whom he loves, and Cully, a professional gambler who is perhaps the novel's most interesting character because he is it's most human. Finally, it is Cully, and his relationship with his older, wiser, mentor, Gronevelt, the owner of the palacial Xanadu hotel (a pleasure dome that SHOULD maybe exist only in the reader's mind) that reveals the most about what it is to be wise, what it is to win and have everything, and to be a man who \\"gains the world only to lose it\\"..."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"I Read Over 2500 Book's And This Is One Of The Best, Hope Someone Will Take It To Novel......That's Puzo's Best Book ."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"A man named Gronevelt runs the Xandu casino in Las Vegas and he knows that whenever a table doesn't pay, someone is stealing. Watch the percentage is his mantra. Puzo's multi-level plots prove Gronevelt correct as several characters do what they can to cheat, beat, or alter the odds of life. Once again Puzo proves himself a master of the insightful, complicated stories that never let you down.In this one, he gives us Merlyn, a guy from New York who meets Cully (a casino insider) and Diane (another casino insider) but also Osano a famous writer and Hollywood-type. He weaves these and others together as they crisscross the country from New York, to Las Vegas, to Hollywood. They all have their motivations and reasons for taking chances but sometimes forget Gronevelt's admonition only to discover that fools die. In Puzo's straight forward style he unravels believable plots with clever dialog and scenes that keep you reading well into the night.This is one of my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"From beginning to end this MARIO PUZO epic is true to his usual captivating stlye, and then some...It seems clear that Puzo has put a lot of himself in this novel, mixing his own personal experiences with a riveting tale of love, sex, war, revenge and the vast complexities of human interrelationships. Indeed, this is a novel about war between men and women, war in business, war with oneself. The exploratory self-aware nature of the main character Merlyn is not just interestingly developed and continuously evolving, but IS pure realism where only a book can be. Some say this book should be made into a film, but, and no doubt this review will lose some readers here, if Hollywood make a ham out of it as they did with the only oh-so 'The Godfather', then it is best left in the literary medium. Mario Puzo himself had no small axe to grind when referring to what Gil Scott-Heron called 'Hollyweird', and that relation is again explored in 'Fools Die' to a degree.In reality, this book confronts issues about the society and beliefs within 1950's America, friendships and revenge, power and wealth and most predominantly: self-preservation.The style does not fluctuate readily, allowing for a smooth read, but the prose swings from first-person (including amazingly insightful feminist point of views) to third; coping with themes and continuity extremely well. This book is not War & Peace, and it is not meant to be. It CAN serve as a eye-opening life-changer or simply be a damn good read! Underlying the plot, there always seems to be a dark undercurrent of sorts, and indeed death is no passing acquaintance (as Puzo readers will attest to) - but the key to this great novel is the underlying subtext (and here we can see the real underbelly of modern America culture) - no, not the mob you may be surprised to see, but inherant corruption within the very belief systems of the characters involved. Buy it, read it and read it again."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"this was a good book. i loved the way mario puzo wrote it. its exactly how people these days talk. i also thought it had an excelent plot. how it varyed from location to location.

Why junk novels like Puzo's The Last Don and The Sicilian were made into films and not FOOLS DIE I'll never understand. What a great film this would have made under the direction of a Scorcese, Coppola, or even Tarantino. This novel is Puzo's best, followed by The Godfather, and The Dark Arena."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"Puzo, I have found, is one of the best storyteller I have ever read. Although Fools Die is not the Godfather, nothing is though. Nevertheless, this is an excellent novel that got better with every page turned and seemed to move quicker, deeper into the book."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"Well, I just finished this one. Not too bad, although I wouldn't agree with most of the comments posted here. Better than the Godfather? Don't fool yourself. I found that it was more about Merlyn (the main character) than Vegas itself, and I don't remember him being that 'attached' to the city. However, Fools Die is a good read. I would suggest it to any Puzo fans, just don't expect it to be a classic."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"I am usually a sci fi/fantasy buff, but this book made me reevaluate where I stood on fiction. The scope of this book is truly impressive, it is not merely a story, it is a chronicle of a mans life. And even this misnomer is misleading, it is not so much a chronicle as a saga. This book will and should live on as an example of one of the greatest works of literature in the 20th century. I am duly impressed with all that Mario Puzo has written, but this book tops all the charts for him and for any other author. This book was great, if you don't read it, you are going to regret it when you son is talking about it in an english class in 20 years."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"I've never read a Puzo novel but found this book to be very average. There was really no set plot as far as I understood but maybe that's the way he wanted it. I found myself getting bored with all the ranting going on, especially from the &quot;Osano&quot; character. The only thing I REALLY liked about it were the conversations between Cully and Groneburg (was that his name?)and the little casino secret tidbits they talked about. A few of the things about the characters weren't very belivable and irritated me. For example, how Merlyn grew to not care about the film he was semi-working on and his percentage on it. For a man struggling for any type of income why would he do this? Maybe I'm just overanalyzing the whole thing but in my opinion it just wasn't the &quot;GRIPPING, POWERFUL&quot; novel that half of you reviewers are claiming it to be. But for an affordable p-back, you really can't go TOO wrong."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"Sorry. I was very disappointed in this book. Frankly, at times it was a struggle to read. The story was good, the characters believeable, but something was lacking. I'm still not sure if I would term Merlyn as deep or shallow. Here's a man who loves his wife yet holds a lifelong, cross country affair wth a bisexual actress. Please! The man was a series of contrasts. Maybe that is what Puzo was trying to bring out but he lost it on me. What I did, however, particularly enjoy, was how Puzo brought the &quot;beginning&quot; of the book to the climax. That was genius. But if you want to read a good Puzo book, pick up &quot;The Last Don.&quot;"},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"life, commitment, relationship - everything is so true in this book. I just couldn't believe somebody could see it so clear, how the life of a man is complicated..."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"And I mean the early Harold Robbins, where the stories didn't get submerged in grossout imagery and demeaning sex. I'm talking about the Harold Robbins of \\"The Adventurers\\", \\"Never Love a Stranger\\" and \\"A Stone For Danny Fisher\\". Only this one comes across a bit like \\"The Dream Merchants\\" with one of its twin settings in Hollywood, fused with the Vegas scenes that \\"The Godfather\\" only briefly touched on as a place for Fredo to spend his summer vacation. The main character is good-guy minor author Merlyn as a customer in a Vegas casino, with Cully playing second banana as a casino employee on the rise. Merlyn's role model is the more established but crude writer Osano (I didn't catch a first name), who insults women and proteges like Merlyn with equal abandon to cover for the fact that his fame masks his declining talent. The story begins with a mutual friend of the pair breaking the bank at the Xanadu, only to take the elevator up to his hotel room and blow his own brains out. From there it switches back and forth between third-person narrative about Cully and first-person diary-style of Merlyn. We watch while Merlyn struggles with the battle beween creativity and the interference by cast and directors that a screenwriter must endure. Meanwhile back in Vegas, Cully moves through jobs as a dealer, a pit boss and the eyes and ears of owner Gronevelt on his way to the top of the Xanadu heap. Puzo established a name for himself as a writer of Mob stories on the strength of \\"The Godfather\\", but in truth this man also scripted the first two \\"Superman\\" features. As such, it shouldn't come as any surprise that he was also able to handle the character-driven sweeping bio style that made Robbins famous."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"Overall, a disappointing read.

Its a page turner as you read through the pages with the main character John Merlyn and the scenes behind the publishing house and movie production in the mid of the book. Osano, Artie and Janelle indulge in a bad game of lust n kill n hook to series of scenes thru the story with the sex scenes more pitchy to read tilting away from the grip to read.

The first Puzo books that I read were &quot;The Godfather&quot; and &quot;The Sicilian&quot;. I did not particularly care for this third book. The book is all about casino gambling and Hollywood. About 1/3 of the characters are interesting but the rest leave something to be desired. The book really hits rock bottom as soon as the main character hits Hollywood. Somehow I still felt obligated to read this novel and spend many late nights reading past the halfway point of the book just because Puzo's name is on the cover in big black letters. I'm sure you know what I am talking about. Overall the book is written somewhat poorly and I'm sure if you read it you will know why Puzo is known for &quot;The Godfather&quot; and &quot;The Sicilian&quot; and not this novel.

Leave it to Hollywood to pass on this classic. I have always loved Puzo,(The Godfather is the greatest movie of all time), and with &quot;Fools Die&quot; he once again shows why he has no peers when it comes to story-telling. Beyond all the glitter of Las Vegas and Hollywood, Puzo simply tells a great story, and I loved the characters, especially Merlyn and of course, the great &quot;Osano&quot;.(Wouldn't it have been wonderful to see who would have played him in the movie?) One minor complaint. I've always felt that the Janelle character was overdone, that perhaps she should have been written out completely. For a while I wasn't sure why, but I think now it is because I wanted Merlyn to be just like his brother Artie, &quot;the only faithful husband left in New York City:&quot;.

The words fit together to create an amazing story. This books proves that Mario Puzo does not need to write a story about the mafia to remain America's favorite storyteller.&quot;Fools Die&quot; is set in Las Vegas. It deals with four friends who all meet in Las Vegas. Jordan traveled to Las Vegas to escape his homelife where his wife was leaving him. Merlyn &quot;The Magician&quot; went to Las Vegas to take a break and relax. Cully worked for the casino and overlooked the casino floor. Diane was a hooker for the casino. The book starts with one night, Jordan starts a lucky streak. By the end of the night, he obtained over $400,000. While his three other friends made arrangements for Jordan to leave the city, Jordan pulled out a gun that he had brought, and killed himself.The book continues with telling stories about Cully and Merlyn. It shows their struggles, and how they start to recieve power. Cully becomes the casino manager's right hand man, but eventually decieves him to gain more power. Merlyn gets a job enlisting people into the six-month army reserve program. He becomes a crook by accepting bribes for people who are low on the list and do not want to become drafted into the army. By taking the bribes, Merlyn moves the people up on the list. Eventually, the FBI catches onto the scheme, and investigates. Merlyn, now a very wealthy man, quits his job.Many other great characters are met during the book, especially the world famous author Osano, whom Merlyn starts to work for.This book works on many levels. It is romance, thriller, crime, and dark comedy all rolled into one great book. Mario Puzo's genious work should be read by every person, because it will appeal to all. I hope you all read this book.To read more books by Mario Puzo, read &quot;The Godfather&quot;, and &quot;The Last Don&quot;.

I thought the ending was a little limp, but maybe Puzo was just happy to be done with it. If you've never read Puzo, maybe start with a different one. Fools die is not his best. Nevertheless, at times this book was brilliant. I'm not averse to quitting a book if I'm not enjoying it. I was never tempted to quit this one. Puzo has a way with words.

Mafia ?If you want a thought provoking book, written at a pace which will not only captivate and entertain you.This is the one.Unbelievable, This book blew my mind...

And almost every time I read parts of it, I get a different perspective on life, or at least the way I think about it. Yes, we are all an X in an indeterminate equation, a sort of phantom in life. We are all degenerate dice-throwers living in a big, huge casino. We are all part of Puzo's tale of hustlers, fools, losers and survivors in the glamor capitals of the world, surrounded by countless tables of chance. Man has not changed that much throughout the centuries, has he? We laugh at the primitive man for his worry and terror of all the tricks of nature, and we ourselves are so frightened of the terrors and guilts that roar in our own heads. What we think of as our sensitivity is only the higher evolution of terror in a poor dumb beast. We suffer for nothing. Our own death wish is our only real tragedy.But what about the title? Only fools die? What about the wise? Was it meant to be \\"Only fools wish to die?\\"And what about Gronevelt? Gronevelt who repeats ad nauseam \\"You have to get rich in the dark...you have to live with percentages...forget about luck, that's a very treacherous magic\\". Is he supposed to be God? The crippled, senile Gronevelt who, in his solitary rooms, pushes his magic buttons to send a rush of oxygenated air to keep people awake. Had he also pushed the buttons for Cully and all the others (fools?) to die?Well, that's the way I see it. And if a million people read this book, I get the feeling there would be a million different interpretations of what seems to be its main idea.This is a very good written book about the lives of those who lose and the effects of human weaknesses on each other. And if you like Dostoyevsky, chances are you'll like this and other books written by Puzo, since sometimes he's taken a single line from a Dostoyevsky book and has based an entire novel on it. Not that he has stolen any of his ideas or style, though.While \\"Fools die\\" may not be Puzo's best work, it certainly is food for thought...I suffer, but I still live!"},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"This book just seemed to captivate me.

All the other Mario Puzo books are trash in comparison, do not waste your time with them."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"Heres a great story about gamblers in Vegas. Too bad only a quarter of the book has to do with this storyline. He mixes the Vegas storyline with a monotonous story of a writer and his sex life, using this story as a sounding board for his opinions on famous literature and male-female relationships. Puzo has some insightful opinions about these things, but he beats the subjects to death. Every woman in the book other than two married women are hopeless sluts. Worse then sluts, they are basically whores. I dont think Puzo even proof-read his own book, because there are several small conflicting story points. No climactic ending, he builds up tension but doesnt deliver. There isnt even any fool that dies. Read it for the interesting Vegas insights, speed-read through the rest."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ.

Absolutely Fantastic!"},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"This book is great. Why? Well, because it talks a lot about life and the funky things that go on in it. Now it may not be the funky things that go on in your life, but we all tend to have some weirdness to our lives and this story is one that focuses in on a guy and the bizarre things that go on in his. I've read al ot of the reviews and it appeared that a lot of people we're comparing it to the Godfather and I say to those people who are looking to read this book for that reason, they shouldn't. They should'nt because it's nothing like the Godfather. Puzo's writing is still wonderful, but this book dose not have anything to do with the mafia. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a fun, fast, entertaining read, but not to those who are just looking for another book like the Godfather."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"This book really attempted to explain all aspects of life.

I would rate it up along with THE GODFATHER. I think Mario Puzo's way of intangling the reader in the story is a gift few writers have. It is hard to find writers who do not care about the fads of this modern world, and write books that describe their train of thinking, not what will sell. Although, I am merely a teenager, Mario Puzo is my literary inspiration. FOOLS DIE was the best book I have read in some time. Personally what fancied me was the opening and conclusion of the book. The Characters were superb, along with the story line. Without Puzo there would not have been great Family, Gambling, Las Vegas, or Mafia novels."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"&quot;Fools die&quot; is, in a way, a book about life. You follow the main charecter, Merlyn, as he changes through life. Very facinating. I haven't read Puzo's most famous book:&quot;The Godfather&quot;, but seen the movie. I think they both have the same aspect, in the sense that they both deal with the darker world behind our own. Not that this is a horror story, but that we always try to look at the glittering and beatyfull facades, and forget the rest. This book goes behind them, and shows us what the world &quot;really&quot; is like. It is not the best book I have ever read, but it's one I stil think about, and it changed my way of looking at the world. That's why I rekomed it hear. I have allready told all my friends about it. I just really hope that people (especially men!!) really aren't like it's described in this book. If they are, I don't want to be a woman anymore!"},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"Godfather is a shallow action thriller compared to Fool's Die. Don't be fooled by the superficially simple title, this tale of a mans life is a modern David Copperfield. At times I consider Fool's Die my favorite book of all time. This seems to be Puzos sleeper novel, I can't believe there are no other reviews for it. The most enjoyable aspect is the main character's realistically flawed choices in life, a man at once both honorable and improvident. This book is required reading to all intelligent men, especially aspiring writers(the main character is a writer), who should relate to the main character's dilemmas and trials."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"I first read this book when it was released back in 1979 ( Ah, My Sweet Lost Youth!!!)and I was so impressed by it that I wanted to write a letter to the author teling him how much I enjoyed it. This book has it all. Lust, greed, treachery, deception, sex and violence all the way from the High Roller Gambling Rooms of Las Vegas to the Shores Of Japan. The main character is a guy named Merlyn who somehow believes that he is a type of magician who can control his destiny.Another character worth mentioning is the writer Osano who desperately seeeks refuge from his loneliness in a heady mixture of drugs, casual sex and booze. All of this is deftly handled by Mr. Puzo and the reader is in for one heck of a roller coaster ride!!!"},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"The book starts off with a bang - a distillation so to speak of the work of character in the book.You can read the first few pages on Amazon. I did and it inspired me to go to the local bookstore and buy the paperback. Well, after the short and introspective \\"book 1,\\" the scenes shifts to an introduction to the initial characters and the setting is the Xanadu in Las Vegas.Many cool intricacies of the casino and its management are extra added info as the flow of character development builds nicely.Of particular interest though throughout is the relationships between men and women. The thinking and vocal great author Osano, he of seven wives, gives some very interesting thoughts concerning this subject!Gronevelt is brilliant. The tough casino operator who lives and dies by \\"the percentage.\\" Countdown Cully is memorable, so slick and sharp. Jordan figures heavily in the beginning. Merlyn is mostly the narrator throughout and most things are seen through his eyes and written by his pen. Merlyn himself - a study in contrasts and surprises.Bisexual Janelle, who loves Merlyn more than any other man is comprehensively explored. Merlyn loves her deeply.But he also loves his wife who makes him happy. She though, in contrast with other characters, is hardly developed at all.The hollywood crowd is vistited upon also. Not very nice people those folks, one would think after reading Fools Die!All in all, this book has plenty of merit even in addition to the fact that it was fun to read."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"Positives: Fools Die is a complicated tale of the inner workings/intertwined worlds of Hollywood and Las Vegas. Puzo is a master-story teller (this is an understatment), who develops characters to their fullest, scenes that are rich and robust so as to put the reader \\"right there,\\" and writes compelling dialogue.Negatives: Unless you have a fairly good grasp of the arcana of gambling, the novel's plot will be like swiss cheese in many places. While we are on the subject of plot, it is hard to figure out if this is a tale of degenerate gamblers lost in a miasma of winning, losing, and losing and losting..., of hookers, profligate lifestyles and intrigue; or is this a novel about writers who are comtemptuous of Hollywood; the age old argument if novels are the \\"true art-form\\" as opposed to movies?The sex is gratuitous in the extreme, so much so as to be chauvanistic. The dialogue is raw in the extreme. Puzo's view of human nature is cynacal and a tad jaded. In retrospect, I have to question if all of this was necessary in order to tell a great story."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"This book was mixed. The main character, John Merlyn, lacked character. He was a boorish family man flirting with people who have more troubles than him. The story is action packed in the beginning with Jordan playing at the Baccarat tables in Vegas. You don't really need guns and fights to have action in a story, just a page turner that will lead to a climax as Jordan's gambling does in the first fifty pages. Osano is the only character I found to like as a prolific author who is also a chauvinist pig despising feminazis. How would you like to say &quot;I'll fight you or F*** you&quot; in front of a crowded female audience at the Womens Liberation Convention? Good old Osano.The last 100 pages would lead you to a shocking conclusion only to become a dissapointing thud. This book is a page turner, true to that. However, the middle of the book gets too much detail going behind the scenes of book publishing and movie production and less into the corruption and scemes this book promises between the &quot;golden triangle of corruption.&quot; It leaves you with too many questions to ask as if the author forgot he left us the evidence to investigate the deaths of Cully and Janelle or the many flights John took to Los Angeles that would leave his wife questions if he is having an affair. John's wife must be dumb....At any costs, I'd give &quot;Fools Die&quot; a moderate consideration. This book killed time for me in the Samoan &amp; Australian Afternoons. However, It leaves many questions unanswered with a storyline that looks like it will give you multiple climaxes to conclusions only to resort to an ending that is a whimper."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"One of the most wonderful and thought provoking books I have ever read. In my opinion, the very best book that Mario Puzo ever wrote."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"This is one of a handful of books I re-read from time to time, mostly because I get something different out of it each time. I suppose I'm still trying to figure this one out.Let's start with the title itself: After a lifetime, Merlyn notes &quot;only fools die.&quot; Is that Puzo's point? Jordan, Cully, Osano -- were they just fools? They certainly helped do themselves in. But what of Malomar, Artie and Janelle? They didn't ask for death? Were they fools too? What, then, did Merlyn do differently? &quot;Am I a monster that I should live?&quot; Well, is he?And what of Gronevelt? Aged, infirm, still pushing buttons in his casino -- both literally and figuratively -- controlling the lives and deaths of others. Is he meant to be God? Are we simply gamblers in some univeral casino, and degenerate ones at that, unavoidably subject to some inviolate &quot;per-centage&quot; beyond anyone's mortal control? Is that Puzo's point? Do we kid ourselves to think otherwise? Is life itself made up of those eternal moments the croupier says &quot;A card for the player&quot;?There is much in this book to keep you fascinated and turning the pages. It's unfortunate, I think, that this book followed &quot;The Godfather&quot; in Puzo's output. The books are totally different, and those seeking a &quot;Godfather&quot; reprise will be dissappointed. (Similarly, I've always thought that silhouette image on the cover of &quot;Fools Die&quot; was a cheap and unnecessary attempt to evoke a &quot;Godfather&quot; connection -- the book is strong enough and deserves to stand on its own.)After nearly thirty years, however, the book reveals certain flaws. The coarse language -- particularly on the part of the women -- seems unnecessary and distracting. While I've certainly heard real-live women use the same words, they don't seem to use them in quite the same way Puzo writes. Men and women ascribe different meanings to the same words. I doubt Puzo knew or cared about that. Janelle's language in particular seems forced and rather phony. Today I find her language somewhat embarassing.Nevertheless, this book has a strange appeal for me and has had since I first read it more than 20 years ago. So many lines from the book have meaning for me and have stayed with me for years: &quot;A terrible longshot, but what's that to a gambler? I still have a stack of black chips and an itch for terror.&quot; Hate to admit it, but I sometimes think that sums up my life.I once read that Puzo himself called &quot;Fools Die&quot; his favorite and best work. I don't disagree."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"I really enjoyed this introspective, somewhat auto-biographical novel. Puzo draws on his experiences in Vegas, in Hollywood during production of the &quot;Godfather&quot; and in NY, to convey a very realistic writer's life. It doesn't always surprise, it just tells a good story of a not-so-perfect man and his somewhat ordinary existence. Merlyn is no magician, and neither is Puzo, he is just a talented storyteller we know well."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"Mario Puzo's Fools Die is more than a look at the inner workings of the grand triangle of corruption, Las Vegas, New York, and Hollywood. What it really is, is a novel that USES Las Vegas, New York, and Hollywood to illustrate modern man's relationship with woman.Each of the male characters of the book personify men with different attitudes, beliefs, and methods in their relationships with women. I am suprised that people rarely mention this material in reviews of this book. Mario Puzo explicitly introduces the reader to these themes in the introduction. For this review, I will focus on this thematic material.General plot summary:Main character John Merlyn gambling and meeting people in Las Vegas, engaging himself in illegal dealings working for the draft board in New York, and having one of his books turned into a movie in Hollywood. But this plot only provides a setting for the interactions that examine human relationships.Generally, the men, despite all of their power and charm, are unable to cope with the modern woman and most of them experience some sort of downfall.Here is a rundown of the main characters and what each of them represent:Jordan plays the part of the hard working, monogamous puritan. In order to protect his wife and children, he becomes a powerful entreprenuer and builds a wall of power and wealth around them. Little did he know that the destruction of his family would come from within! Apparently, in his quest to safeguard his relationship, he forgot aobut the intimate details that he needed to use to keep his wife interested. His wife, though not a businessman like Jordan, is more clever. A cruel divorce prompts Jordan to give up his former life and devote himself to the casinos and gambling in Las Vegas.Osano plays the part of a powerful celebrity who uses his fame, reputation, and money to go through a series of women. Like many celebrities, he has many marriages, and many divorces. He openly scoffs and his ex-wives and tries to use his power, wealth, and fame as shields to keep himself pyschologically above all of his failures with women. He seems to get the better of all of the women that he deals with. All but one that is. There is one ex-wife that he can never get the best of. She remains his psycological superior, despite all of his power, bluster, and ego. Watch his downfall (or partial downfall) at her hands.Artie, Merlyn's brother, plays the part of the handsome and honest man. He stays true to his wife, despite all of his temptations that ask him to roam astray and sample the wares of many other fine specimens of the female family. Artie is the man embarrassed by his power over women. he is the one who can have the most attractive women without even trying. He is annoyed and bothered at their frequent advances, and, unlike most of the other men in this novel, usually turns them down. But how happy is he? Will he die a death of unfullfilled despair because of his failure to fulfill his male urges?Merllyn, the main character, plays the role of a few men. Initially, he is a faithful man that will not stray from his wife, despite numerous opportunities. He believes that their mutual love of sex unites them and makes cheating unnecessary. But, as what happens with many men, he begins to lose some interest in his wife and eye other possible prospects. He succumbs to these temptations and begins to play the part of the man who has the faithful and committed wife at home, while he finds other women outside of the home to pleasure his sexual needs.During his extramarital affair, he plays the part of the man struggling to have a fulfilling relationship with a woman who takes on feminist ideals. While they profess to be enlightened enough to have a no strings attached relationship, they both become angry and jealous with one another and secretly long for a monogamous relationship. Their emotional roller coasters and conversations are intriguing if you find this to be an interesting dynamic.Gronevelt is the rich businessman who never truly understands an intimate, loving relationship with a woman. Unlike Jordan, he is not restrained by some kind of puritanical code. He sleeps with women freely and without too much attachment, compensating these women with a \\"honey bee\\" or a hundred dollar bill. When he finally does find interest in one of his one-night stands, he makes the mistake of slipping her a honeybee after her night of \\"service,\\" forever ruining his chances with her.Cully is the \\"player\\" by modern terms. He seems to have a system worked out. His system involves everything from token gifts, to phone calls, to pyscological games, to offerings of making a naive girl a starlet to false romantic words and praises, to every other possible trick. He is a character, one of the few, that never seems to be bested by women. But his victory is somewhat shallow, as he is ultimately alone.Last, but not least, we are introduced to a female man. A lesbian who pursues the woman that Merlyn is interested in. Though she is committed and caring, she is mistreated and falls victim to the charms of the feminine woman just like all of the male characters of the book.This thematic material is introduced to the reader in Las Vegas, New York, and Hollywood. In Las Vegas, it is in the context of Gronevelt and Cully working for a casino. One of them playing the part of the player, perhaps occasionally the pimp, and the other of them a big business man that only has time for women when they fulfill his sexual desires. Las Vegas also where we meet Jordan. He is only in Las Vegas to escape his former life, his married life. Despite all of his efforts, his long time wife cruelly divorced him, destroying everything he had ever worked for.In New York, we meet Artie and his wife, and Merlyn's wife. Merlyn is a character that does not solely occupy the realm of New York. His gambling addiction and success take him to Hollywood and Las Vegas, in the former, he loses his ability to guard against temptation and begins to play the role of the man that enjoys a stable household and a woman on the side.In Hollywood, we meet Osano, the actor, celebrity. We are introduced to all manner of actresses who try to sleep their way to fame. We observe how producers, directors, and actors use their pull in the movie industry to secure a degree of sex and intimacy.Does the title, \\"Fools Die\\" imply that anybody will die as a result of this corruption and women-chasing? You're damn right it does. Whether it is by suicide, sexually transmitted diseases, despair, or assasination, plenty of the main characters will meet their demise.---------------------------------Unfortunately, despite the novel's rich thematic material, the stories become dull from time to time. There are some parts of the book that are page turners, and there are parts that are extremely tedious. The story line is so fragmented that there never seems to be a cental plot, other than an exploration of man's relationship with woman.Although I got bored with it a few times, I do recognize the value of this book. It successfully explains and illustrates interesting dynamics of modern relationships between men and women. If this is of great interest to you, than I recommend it. If you are a follower of the Godfather, Puzo's greatest novel, than be aware that this book is very different and you might not enjoy it."},{"Title":"Fools Die","review":"This book is story of two books - one of great fluidity, great sequences, -the other one of no plot, little action, and very little intrigue. Mario Puzo is always a great read, and when reading his works, pages just seem to fly by. The unfortunate thing is that this book is 500 pages (more like 800 because of the small font) of nothing.There really is no plot. It basically chronicles a man named John Merlyn for a few years, as he visits or works in Las Vegas, then New York, and then Los Angeles. Another Puzo novel, the Fortunate Pilgrim, also really doesn?t have a plot, but the characters and description are so interesting, it captivates the reader. This book has none of that. The characters are not appealing, a little unreal, and are not really covered in great depth.Also, the book gets repetitive after a while. Puzo feels the need to describe the same emotions of the some character over and over again in only slightly different situations.Of the few books I've read of Puzo, this is by far the worst."},{"Title":"XML: Your Visual Blueprint for Building Expert Web Pages (With CD-ROM)","review":"I finally found a self-taught computer book that doesn't make me question my language comprehension ability. This book cuts to the chase and tells you what you really need to know, instead of long passages of history dating back to the Civil War, as often done by other publishers. Every chapter is done in two pages, and step-by-step screenshots of the programming steps are shown. Programming tips and potential errors are also stated clearly in a single sentence, instead of &quot;nested&quot; (a little programming joke ;-P)in another sentence. This book reads like a reference, yet it is informational enough. But if you expect explanation behind every coding, you'll hate me as your reviewer because this book is not comprehensive enough in that sense.The CD-Rom includes codes and examples and searchable e-book for your practice sessions. Aside from visual learners, I would definitely recommend this book to practical, on need-to-know basis learners and those who are not blessed with patience as their virtues.

I went to a bookstore and browsed both, read the first 35 pages of each book, and this book by Emily Vander Veer has far more info per page, and so I ended-up buying it on Amazon. It is easier to understand (at least for me) because of the way the book arranges / presents the examples. Your mind doesn't get too overwhelmed/distracted too much by searching for info on a page. Only disadvantage is the smaller font on the examples... It's a great start. As long as you don't ask too many &quot;why&quot; questions, it will tell you &quot;how to&quot;. I now know more about XML today than I did last week - and the year before. This book won't teach you everything about XML, you'll need a more advance book afterwards. But hey, I don't know too many &quot;complete, all-in-one&quot; books. A minimum background on HTML would help. If you have done Java/Servlet/HTML/ASP programming, this should be perfect, and with just a bit more imagination you can see the bigger picture. I totally do not agree with the negative feedbacks given about the book."},{"Title":"XML: Your Visual Blueprint for Building Expert Web Pages (With CD-ROM)","review":"This book is wonderful, if you don't have a clue about all this new web-technologies popping up every day.

I have absolutely zero experience with XML (or HTML), and I saw this book on his shelf so I borrowed it, hoping it would give me a clue as to what I'm supposed to do for the next few weeks. I am shocked at how little I know after completing the first two chapters! Each two pages is a new concept - which I think is a great idea. But, after you follow along with the examples, there is no description/pic of how it should look in your web browser! How do I know if I'm doing it correctly if I don't have anything to verify it with? It's kind of like reading a programming book that never shows you what the execution of the program is supposed to look like - that's ridiculous! Also, the lessons explain the \\"what\\" to do, but not the \\"why,\\" which is really frustrating when you're trying to REALLY learn something - not just fake your way through it.

Each page has 2 screenshots of what is being done, but it somehow doesn't explain very well. Trying to be concise is one thing, but seeing the big picture is something else. And I didn't get the latter part of it.The book really should explain thoroughlly what is going on. Sure, it has screenshots of the code and some explaination on how, but not the WHY. Besides, its not like each screenshot has plenty to show! For example, each page has 2 screenshots, but at least one showed an empty notepad with an 'Untitled' everytime when there should be a title and a miserable prompt! Why couldn't they just do that once and get on with it rather than repeating it every turn of the page?? This truly sounds like an Idiot/Dummies book isn't it?The aim of the book was to learn XML by teaching yourself visually. That aim was definitely fulfilled, as it did visually present the examples, and you really have to find out how its all related by yourself!In conclusion, its not a good book no matter how visual it gets. The primary problem lies in how everything is tied together and that's not explained well. I bet the Visual Quickstart version is way better at doing that than this. However, if you don't think so, then please have a skim thru and see if you can paint yourself the big XML picture."},{"Title":"XML: Your Visual Blueprint for Building Expert Web Pages (With CD-ROM)","review":"I'm new to XML.

It's not a usage that has caught on in any significant way since the publication of this book in 1992, and perhaps that is unfortunate, because I, for one, happen to agree that \\"everything changed\\" in the mid 1960s, and that the changes weren't for the better.Eninis' main thesis is that rocknroll was the synthesis of the six pre-existing \\"streams\\" of American popular music: Pop (Tin Pan Alley/Brill Building), Black Pop, Country Pop, Gospel, Jazz and Folk. In the first section of The Seventh Stream, Ennis focuses on the \\"assembly\\" of the six distinct streams against the back drop of technological change between 1900 and 1940. His insightful, distinct division of American Popular Music into six \\"streams\\" is paired with a turgid, obvious recitation of the pre-World War II struggle between the publishing industry and the broadcasting industry. To his credit, Ennis does clearly demonstrate how this struggle influenced the development of the \\"six streams\\" (In a nutshell, the rise of radio favored Black Pop and Country Pop at the expense of Traditional Pop.)The lasting contribution that Ennis makes to \\"rock history\\" comes in his tour-de-force of a second section, where he describes the emergence of rocknroll in the post World War II period. Perhaps his most important insight is the manner in which he describes the reflective relationship between Charts and the Record Labels who sought to profit from that information. The concept linking the two is the \\"crossover\\" i.e. a song that appeared simultaneously on two or more of the three major post War charts: Pop, Country & Rhythm and Blues. Ennis makes the case that it was the goal of the actors in the period immediately preceding the emergence of rocknroll to CREATE a sound that would \\"chart\\" on all three charts at the same time.This was certainly the goal of Bill Haley, whose \\"Rock Around the Clock\\" was the first rock \\"hit\\" in 1955. Haley, a long time musical journeyman, had been tinkering with different stylistic combinations in a concentrated attempt to \\"cross-over\\" BEFORE he recorded rock around the clock. This was also the case for the man who would embody the emergence of rocknroll: Elvis Presley. Before Elvis arrived, Sam Phillips was LOOKING for someone LIKE Elvis- a white guy who could sing like a black guy. It's an analysis that very much gibes with my own reading of the same books that Ennis relied on. In this analysis, the technological changes that preceded rocknroll's emergence (the 45)) were a necessary but not sufficient condition for the emergence. Rather, it was the effort of specific individuals to \\"solve the problem\\" of cross-over appeal, as based on their analysis of the Billboard/Cashbox charts. This effort was largely undertaken by the independent effort of small scale record label owners- not- repeat- not- by the major labels of the time.Like other books about rock that were published prior to the mp3 revolution, Ennis' section covering the mid 60s to the \\"present\\" suffers from the absence of the internet. Certainly, one is reminded of the \\"End of History\\" type books that accompanied the fall of the Berlin Wall and failed to anticipate the rise of Islamic radicalism.One theme that emerges from the Seventh Stream is the way in which dominant streams become creatively \\"exhausted\\" and then look to outside influences from less popular streams. Ennis also tips his cap to the importance of demographics- it's hard to divorce the emergence of rocknroll from the post World War II \\"baby boom\\" and concomitant rise of \\"Youth Culture.\\" All in all, the Seventh Stream is easily the BEST book I've ever read on the roots of rocknroll. It's a must read, especially for young musicians or would be cultural critics.

Even more so, they always seem to enlist the help of friends such as Biff, Chet, Iola, and Callie. However, in book five of the series, the author takes a different approach.The location of this story is \\"Big Sky\\" Country, AKA Montana. Fenton Hardy, father of Frank and Joe, has asked his sons to help him round up a gang of thieves who also seem to be implicated in a botched gold heist some 25 years in the past. The gold, while not stolen, has been missing ever since. Hence the set up for the adventure.Personally, this book did not work for me as much as the previous four have. First, being on location in Montana, searching for hidden gold, allows this book to be more of a cowboy/western adventure than a good mystery. For those who like cowboy/western adventures you'll definitely like the story, I just don't care for the genre. Next, the supporting cast of characters have changed dramatically. There are no \\"chums\\" to help out and even their father has been nearly written out of the story delivering the occasional one-liner, such as \\"Be careful boys.\\" The entire book rests with Frank and Joe. Finally, the book did not read as smooth as the others have. The plot was rather confusing with the introduction of several new characters. You almost had to keep notes as to who was who.

I always thought Bayport must not be a very safe place with all the crime that seems to occur there. Anyway, the boys are wandering around in the fog near Bayport when they encounter an old man who was accidentally shot by hunters. The boys learn that the old man is Mike Onslow, who the boys were seeking because of his knowledge of the Lucky Lode area in Montana. Their father is chasing criminals in the area and he was hoping that Mike could provide information about where the crooks could be holed up.Mike tells the boys about his time in that area as a gold miner. Mike and three other miners were getting ready to leave their claim when Black Pepper and his gang jumped them. One of the miners, Bart Dawson, had a plane nearby with the gold already on board. Bart slipped away and took off. When Black Pepper and his men followed Bart, the other three miners escaped from the cabin. The miners were supposed to meet up later to split the gold. However, Bart Dawson disappeared. Mike then drew the boys a map of the area.The boys travel to Montana through Chicago. In Chicago, men posing as their father's associates kidnap them. After a harrowing escape and stupid actions on the part of the kidnappers, the boys were able to continue on their journey.In Montana it appears their adversaries are ruthless, and their adversaries attempt numerous times to stop the Hardys from investigating their activities, including trying to kill the Hardy boys and their father. As the story proceeds, we learn that there may be someone telling the criminals about the Hardys' plans. Who can the Hardys trust? The boys also fend off assassins, a fall from a cliff, and a cave-in in their most harrowing adventure yet. All the while the boys and their father must discover the hideout of the criminals, and, as you have already guessed, where the gold from the plane is located and what happened to Bart Dawson.The Hardy Boys face many mysteries and yet the author managed to clearly explain how the mysteries did or did not relate to each other. Each of the first five Hardy Boys mysteries were quick, enjoyable reads, and I would recommend them for children in the age range of about eight through whatever age the series holds their interest.Though the Hardy Boys series is written in a relatively archaic fashion, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent. The stories were once recommended for children ages 10 to 14. As children are exposed to more violence and seem to require greater levels of stimulation, the recommended age range has move to 9 to 12. I think any child capable of reading some of the challenging words in these books will enjoy them, regardless of how tame most of the action may be. Once a child has reached age 12 or so the stories may be of less interest, but given the combination of mystery and action, these books remain good safe choices for parents who want to know what their children are reading."},{"Title":"Hunting for Hidden Gold (Hardy Boys, Book 5)","review":"Hardy Boys, Hunting for Hidden Gold is one of the best books I have read in my life.

Hardy Boys can be read by all ages. it is not really hard to read. In the whole Hardy Boys series there are 58 books. I am looking forward to reading more books from the series. Hunting for Hidden Gold is a sort of long book. It is about 150 pages long. That is not too long but it is not very short either. Since it is long, it gets lots of action in it.

This edition is said to be drastically altered from the original. What this means, according to the Hardy Boys Unofficial Home Page, is that the text and plot have both been changed.Frank and Joe Hardy become involved in another mystery when their father calls them out west to help with a case. They are searching for a gang that is involved in robbery, and even on the way out west, they are kidnapped and attacked and it is only with great luck that they even are able to meet up with their father. They find him hurt badly, but begin the investigation on their own and learn about a mystery about gold that was stolen from a prospector years ago.

The pop-ups are colorful and will attract the child's eye, although the dialog will seem strange to the modern child. It and the diagrams are unaltered and in true 30's style, there are phrases like: \\"LOOK! THE ALARM INDICATOR! WE'RE LOST! CAUGHT OFF GUARD! IN THE GRIP OF A DREADED COSMO-HURRICANE OF SPACE!\\"There really is nothing like the science fiction of that time. With very little to work with other than exclamations, made up technical phrases and scantily clad damsels, the writers, illustrators and animators did the best they could. I enjoy reading and watching it on occasion just to see be reminded of how things were. If you read this book through modern eyes, you will probably be disappointed.

It really describes every bad boy out there and WHY you were drawn to him and what possibility there is at fixing the situation. My ex didnt really fall under a specific catagory (he shared qualities of other catagories)... however the most he resembled was the Eternal Teenager.Whats funny is that he used to be married and he has a child. He still wants a family and he wants marriage but he refused to act like a responsible adult. Now this he would argue because he thinks he's got it all under control. BUT saying you cant take your daughter to the dentist because of a lack of money, and then buying expensive marijuana... is not a good justification.

I take my hat off to the authors, who after all are men. They could have kept this to themselves, and therefore held onto the power; but they didn't. Thankyou."},{"Title":"\\"Let's Face it, Men are @$#%\\": What Women Can Do About It","review":"When I first saw this book, I thought that it was just another male-basher. Further inspection proved that it was written by men and that it was directed toward women. The focus was to help women recognize patterns in male behavior and make intelligent choices. The first thing that the authors say is that NOT ALL men are (expletive deleted). That impressed me. The author's credentials also impressed me. They have worked with women, men and couples for some years. I wish I had had this book ten years ago. But it's good to have it now that I find myself single. The authors have sorted men into different categories based on their behavior. They realize how hard women work to maintain relationships and give them strategies for having a positive impact on their own life and chosen mates. I don't give anything 5 stars, I won't give this one 5 stars because I think JERKS would have been just as good an expletive as the one they used but so be it."},{"Title":"\\"Let's Face it, Men are @$#%\\": What Women Can Do About It","review":"Has your man turned out to be the Prince of Darkness instead of Prince Charming? There are two ways of looking at this situation. You can either get out of the relationship quickly or stay and fight for the love and respect you deserve. But how do you deal with someone who is unreasonable? What if your strong and decisive man has turned bossy and controlling? This book is really about men from your worst nightmares. The honest truth is you probably know some of these characters in your real life. You could even be living with one of them. This book describes almost every bad way a man can treat a woman and what to do about it. The advice is really practical, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny and always entertaining. The authors give some really clever techniques that are quite harmless but produce some stunning results. It gave me some ideas that I put into use immediately with some of the men in my life. Like I have a friend who likes to call me late at night instead of at a decent hour so I simply said: \\"Could you call me later, I'm really busy.\\" This of course threw him for a loop and he didn't say anything for a while. So don't be surprised if men start to be a little shocked by your new attitude. You deserve to be treated right and with this book you will get some good results.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"\\"Let's Face it, Men are @$#%\\": What Women Can Do About It","review":"I got this book recently after my break up with my ex and my psychologist recomended it to me. It really describes every bad boy out there and WHY you were drawn to him and what possibility there is at fixing the situation. My ex didnt really fall under a specific catagory (he shared qualities of other catagories)... however the most he resembled was the Eternal Teenager.Whats funny is that he used to be married and he has a child. He still wants a family and he wants marriage but he refused to act like a responsible adult. Now this he would argue because he thinks he's got it all under control. BUT saying you cant take your daughter to the dentist because of a lack of money, and then buying expensive marijuana... is not a good justification. But even if I let that slide there are a dozen more things he does that blatantly say, hes ONLY into what HE wants and how he wants it...This book is good for &quot;ah HA!&quot; moments but it doesnt really support the emotional turmoil you may feel afterwards.

In substance, I found the book lacking. It simply serves to fan the flames in the battle between the sexes, which I suppose, if I was a therapist in this area, might be a self-serving proposition.Basically, this book appears to suggest that the reader be more manipulative than her partner to get what she wants. This is hardly a new concept! The now infamous &quot;Rules&quot; book was almost entirely based on this idea. I did agree with the principle that men are less likely to &quot;work&quot; on a relationship, than women, but again, I am fairly certain this is not headline news to most of us.I would tend to believe that any relationship where both parties are consciously, and continuously attempting to out-manipulate one another, is most certainly making both people miserable, and probably doomed.I would not take anyone proffering this type of advice seriously, unless of course I was predisposed to dishonesty, manipulation and deceit. I considered this book a waste of my time, and my money."},{"Title":"\\"Let's Face it, Men are @$#%\\": What Women Can Do About It","review":"My roommate from a few years ago had this book on her shelf and let me take a look. After skimming through it, it became obvious why she had trouble finding guys and keeping them. Books like these make relationship problems worse by simply bashing men and telling troubled women it's not their fault.I don't want to knock all women who buy this book, especially if it's just for fun, but I feel sorry for the women out there who feel compelled to buy books like this one to help them find someone. Your lovelife isn't going to improve but the bank balances of the authors certainly will.

The ones that say women are crazy and the ones that say men of jerks. This is of the latter. It tells women that basically what ever goes wrong in the relationship, it isn't your fault. It catergorizes men into certian types. I guess for some women they must connect with this. Being a guy it just irritated me and gave women more fuel for their fires. Likewise I would believe that many women are not pleased with the male books that point out the shortcomings of women. The solutiions to life will not be found in the pages of this book or any others. The problem is much deeper than that. Women and men are totally different, with different needs and different expectations. We need to recognize that. I am afraid that feminism has done nothing tohelp this fact. In the \\"good old days\\" women and men had predefined roles and we didn't have the same problems. Now you have 2 very different sexes vieing for equality. Equality on every level will never work because we are so different."},{"Title":"\\"Let's Face it, Men are @$#%\\": What Women Can Do About It","review":"The book, written by two male therapists, opens by saying that not all men are jerks, but there is a significant number of men that ARE jerks, and they can make your life miserable. The authors also state that men in our society today ARE getting off too easy, that in their experience, men really DON'T work as hard as women do in improving relationships. (As if THAT is a big secret, just look at any magazine rack.)The book follows the basic self-help formula, but with a twist. Most of the popular relationship theories bog down when they assume that your mate is willing to work with you 50-50 to improve your relationship. That assumption that has made John Gray (of Mars/Venus fame) a rich man and millions of women miserable, but I digress... Anyway, the authors assume you do indeed live with a person who would rather use John Gray's book for toilet paper rather than read it, so they proceed to tell what you need to do to make your life more bearable. Again, there's a twist, and their advice isn't for everyone. They tell you that jerks don't respond to an appeal for fairness or kindness (you've probably already figured that out), so you need to be willing to meet their manipulative behavior with your own manipulative behavior. At that point the book gives you some very concrete examples of what you need to do and say in order to get them to change their behavior. The book acknowledges that some women will not feel comfortable being manipulative, but their argument is you can either be 100% totally honest (which you already know gets you nowhere) or you can be miserable - or you can leave... My final take? If you're married to a jerk and value marriage more than your personal happiness, you can make things better, but only somewhat. If you're single and dating a jerk and wondering what to do? RUN LIKE HELL!"},{"Title":"\\"Let's Face it, Men are @$#%\\": What Women Can Do About It","review":"This book dares to be honest. It has a tounge-in cheek, yet frank &quot;just the facts, ma'am&quot; approach to an age-old problem. Written by men, it offers no excuses for &quot;problem&quot; men's behavior. I've read several books to learn how to deal with an abusive boss. When I read this one I said, &quot;Ah-ha!&quot; It makes the point that merely understanding the differences in men and women's behavior is not enough to affect positive change. Many books have been written describing the problem of abusive men, but this one gives examples of ways to extract one's self from the cycle of abuse, if one is unfortunate enough to have to live or work with this type of man. Some of the suggestions are outlandish, but they illustrate in an absolute way that to change the dynamic in a relationship you MUST change your approach to it. Sometimes one must fight fire with fire. It positively changed my relationship with my abusive boss."},{"Title":"\\"Let's Face it, Men are @$#%\\": What Women Can Do About It","review":"All the other books I've seen out there discuss relationships and men as if they would actually be participating in the change/growth process and reading and listening to self-help advice right along side you. This book deals with the reality: that most men who need a lesson in sensitivity, caring, integrity, and commitment will not touch the kinds of books and advice that would require them to BECOME sensitive, caring, and commitment savvy etc. They point out what we already know, that books like Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus and the like, are only bought by and large by women. Of course this means that none of the men you wished would change ever will, because they won't be buying these books or using their well-intentioned advice. This book, however, is different. While most of the other books as mentioned above require the men to participate, this one points out the very real fact that it only takes one person to put a twist in the relationship, and that person is you. This doesn't mean they're saying that you can change a person, rather that if YOU change, things around you change. For example, if you act a certain way every time he does something, (like cry for example or give an ultimatum or consistently ask him to change a behavior), he gets used to it and hence, acts in HIS same old way (like rebelling for the sake of rebelling or hanging up the phone when you cry etc. etc. or going out with his buddies even more because you say you don't like it). Therefore, if you change the way you behave 180%, he's shocked and caught off guard, he doesn't have any choice but to change his way of reacting. For example, if you want him to quit smoking, encouraging him and giving him articles to read only makes him smoke more sort of rebelliously. But if you suddenly 180% turn around and encourage him to smoke, buying him cigarettes and giving him ashtrays etc., he will be freaked out and won't have a reason to rebel anymore, he'll be forced to look at his own behavior and how he feels about it, rather than continue it just to displease you. What impressed me most was the totally workable, user friendly ideas in the book. It doesn't go on and on theorizing about relationships and feelings etc. etc., but actually blends the who and the why with the WHAT TO DO. I have used these steps with amazing success. All I can say is the techniques in this book are ones you've never heard of before. I laughed a ton when I read this book and you probably will too. I laughed even more when I watched the techniques working before my very eyes. It will increase your self-esteem without your even realizing it, a nice side effect. If you are frustrated, buy this book. It will open your eyes."},{"Title":"\\"Let's Face it, Men are @$#%\\": What Women Can Do About It","review":"Let's face it...there are a lot of unkind people in the world - male and female. I happened to pick one for a partner, and was stuck living with him until I could afford to move away. I had to find a way to cope and survive with an angry, controlling man. This simple, practical book saved my life. It made a completely intolerable situation much more tolerable and peaceful. I kept the book well hidden and could reference it when I felt I needed support and strength. It does take a while to modify your behavior and get used to reacting differently to situations as suggested in the book. If you are not willing to learn to react differently to your partner, buying this book won't help you. If you are sick and tired of your situation and are willing to do something different - then this will help. There are excellent chapters to help you evaluate how bad your partner is, and if you should stay. One of the best chapters is about how to get out and leave - safely and sanely. The fact that it is authored by men makes the book's suggestions very effective regarding what will, and will not work with some men. It is simple enough for anyone to understand, yet touches on some important aspects of behavior modification and human nature that are intellectually stimulating as well. The book is written with a slight touch of humor that keeps it positive. The book also has chapters on how to recognize unkind men early on and avoid them. It gives you little \\"tests\\" to see if you have a jerk on your hands and to get away before it's too late. My situation has improved so much that there is now hope in a situation that was truly hopeless, and I do feel that this book has helped bring it about.

But this one I found to be the most down to earth and realistic in it's viewpoint of what women need if they are in need of such a book. Does not put down men in general. It does help us understand how we as a society raise our little boys to be jerks. How to spot a jerk before you get too involved with him, and what to do if you find yourself in a situation where you are involved with a jerk and need to consider your options. Of course there are differences between men and women, and both sexes are trying to bridge the gap. But there is a group of men who have no interest in changing or making their relationships better. It is for the women of these men who this book seems to be aimed at."},{"Title":"\\"Let's Face it, Men are @$#%\\": What Women Can Do About It","review":"I always love hearing suggestions like the ones in this book. The assumption coming in is that the reader bought the book because they have tried everything but the other person is still a \\"jerk\\". Unfortunately, it ignores the fact that a relationship is a two way street. There are certainly a number of cases where one person is completely (or mostly) in the wrong. However, is it not much more likely that both sides are not working together, and that both sides are indeed to blame? A husband may be a jerk, or a wife, and both sides would simply blame the other. It seems rather biased to assume that just because things aren't going well in a relationship that the man must be wrong, and the perfect woman must now employ these techniques in order for him to see the folly of his ways. It is classic revisionism that when the man is a jerk its his fault...however, when the women angers the man she is simply reacting to his awful behavior. Wake up people! Its not the womens fault when the mans acting terribly, but women its not the mans fault if you're acting horribly as well. Take responsibility for yourself and learn how to examine things from the other persons shows. That, rather then passive aggressiveness or blatant manipulation, is the real path to a stronger relationship and a more caring bond."},{"Title":"\\"Let's Face it, Men are @$#%\\": What Women Can Do About It","review":"This book was right on and what i had been looking for to help me understand the men in my life whether the men i date or family memembers.

In my case I must say that the book has provided me with the tools to deal with a partner of 26 years who happens to match two of the personality types discribed in the book. I have never been so uplifted and inspired. Upon first glance I knew that I had found a jem of a self help book. It is extremely well written and sites examples that most all women can relate to. Not only does it provide honest discriptions of toxic men but allows the reader to view the man she may be involved with in a different light. I have personally used several of the techniques in the book and I would like to thank the authors for their help. I was virtually at my wits end with my &quot;toxic&quot; man. The book discribed excatly what I had been doing and why I was going about it the wrong way.

It really helps you to stop trying to please them too. You cant make them happy or make them stop criticizing you. It's impossible. The best thing this book taught me is to stop arguing with them and instead - agree with them. You have to read it to understand how this works but it is so FUN and it gets them off your back!! It made my life so much more peaceful and tolerable. It is a very interesting twist on human behaivor and the effect of one person changing drastically and in turn the other person has no choice but to do the same.

From the quick &quot;Is he or isn't he&quot; survey to the categories of men to avoid: Controllers; Liars and Cheaters; Immature; Emotionally Retarded and Mixed Breeds, the authors provide a humorous look at a very serious subject. The names and descriptions of the men we've all had to deal with at one time or another: The Ice Man or Don Juan are very entertaining. Best of all, though, the book provides practical advice: what to do when you see it coming and what to do when you are in the middle of it.

The pot calls the kettle black. The tares call the wheat heretics. Woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you, for so did their fathers to the false prophets. This book is borderline antichrist. It appears to have been written by the same spirit that it pretends to expose. For a better look at this subject, read, \\"This Church is not Appearing Glorious and it doesn't seem to be Purpose Driven\\". Leave this one on the shelf."},{"Title":"Unmasking the Jezebel Spirit","review":"A good overview of the Jezebel spirit to assist pastors, prophets, intercessors and all lay people in identifying and dealing with this ubiquitous and insidious problem of Church life. The Jezebel spirit rebels, controls and manipulates, often veiling hidden ambition under a religious garb, and operates in a variety of methods from intimidation to sexual manipulation to blatant witchcraft. Many people might identify this spirit also exerting its malignant influence outside church in diverse arenas of life such as in workplaces and politics at every level. John Paul Jackson gives examples where pastors or churches have been destroyed by the effect of a single person operating in this spirit. \\"No Church is too great, too pure or too healthy to be exempted from a Jezebel spirit\\", and hence this book is a warning and an exhortation to all - to walk in deep interior humility and to continuously examine and purify one's own intentions - while remaining on guard and recognizing attacks from without. It's also a useful manual on how to deal with the problem and those affected by this spirit.Minus half a star for leaving me a little dissatisfied. Perhaps it's because Jezebel is only half the story - the other half is Absalom and Ahab. The masculine form of the Jezebel Spirit, an Absalom spirit, is skimmed over in two paragraphs, whereas the remainder of the book focusses on Jezebel operating through women. Also the bottom line is that it takes an Ahab - unrighteous and compromising authority - to tolerate/accommodate a Jezebel. An alliance in the heart - lust, ambition, idolatory - gives rise to an alliance in the flesh. The book apportions one chapter to describing an Ahab spirit, compared with seven chapters describing how Jezebel operates, and the examples drawn are almost all involving women. Is John Paul Jackson just trying to narrow his focus, or is this an oversight ? - considering that whereas Jezebel threatened to kill the prophets, Absalom, out of the King's very own household, threatened to tear apart the Kingdom of Israel. And it was Ahab who, through his alliance with Jezebel, was the one who gave her an operating platform in the first place. Beware Pastors! If you think you have to watch out only for women, you may have your antivirus on, but your firewall is switched off!Minus another half star for not making resoundingly clear the fundamental preventative to Jezebels, Absaloms & Ahabs: Christlikeness, humility, holiness, purity of heart. For sure, spiritual authority in the form of Jehu is needed to slay Jezebel when she has already manifested, but prevention is better than cure. This is where I think the book is a little fuzzy. On the one hand John Paul Jackson warns against ambition, gain and lust. The mixed message seems to occur when on the other hand he implies that the primary motivation to defeat Jezebel was the Lord's promise of increased spiritual authority and Divine favour. In other words - spritual self advancement: the very temptation that is capable of incubating a Jezebel. When desire for external ministry becomes more highly prized than desire for the Holy Spirit's transforming us into the image and likeness of Christ, the resultant spiritual distortion sends out an invitation to dormant Jezebels to come to life. No folks, the motivation should be nothing other than the Lord's glory, even if the confrontation entails, like John the Baptist, losing one's own head.Finally, to those potentially influenced by the negative reviews that the message of this book is too one-sided or might lead to witch hunts: this is not what the book is about. Rejecting the truth of the message because of the book's deficits does not negate the reality of the evil that Jezebel is, nor the unfettered power that this spirit wields in modern secular society and to a lesser extent in some churches. Jezebel originates from the pit of hell and simply must not be tolerated.The responsibility to overcome Jezebel does not lie just in leardership's ( Jehu's) hands: ALL are called to overcome."},{"Title":"Unmasking the Jezebel Spirit","review":"You may be up against it....and don't know it. But if you have ever confronted it, you won't forget it. I know of no fouler spirit unleashed against the church today. Yet, little is written about it---a few small pamphlets and a couple of books. Of all those, this is the best, I believe. Some of the good things written these days are in the phamplets, but they're too short to do more than simply observe that the problem exists. Here you will find no mere poking fingers in the clouds or railing against it. Rather, its history, how to identify it, what to do about it, and the dangers of deciding to do nothing about it, are all covered----and all without fanaticism or wildfire---a treasured commodity. WARNING: if you are looking for a book to give ammo for witch-hunting, this isn't it. He warns against this sort of thing, reminding us that those afflicted are hurting people in need of much healing and grace. Be ready to be challenged to walk humbly and with holy hands, as we deal courageously with this spirit. As a pastor, I would that every pastor had a copy. Oh, the things they DON'T tell us in seminary!"},{"Title":"Unmasking the Jezebel Spirit","review":"This book accurately describes a woman I had a close relationship with, and was forced to end. During our friendship I experienced new kinds of abuse that I didn't know existed - the feeling of opening up my soul to someone and having them pour battery acid into my guts.I was describing this to a pastor friend and he recommended this book.I'm a married man and I had a female friend with strong prophetic gifts. She was helping me, and to a lesser extent my wife, with marriage and emotional healing challenges. She was very perceptive and highly adept; there was hardly a ball I could throw her that she couldn't throw right back.She and I became very close friends and our relationship became literally psychic. We began having identical visions in common and experiencing the same manifestations. She could literally read my emotions 1000 miles away. We were spiritually very intimate and there was very little that we did not share with each other.It was exotic and unusual, endlessly fascinating. I had no grid for a male-female relationship like this and I didn't know anyone else who had that kind of a friendship with anyone. It felt very safe and very comfortable and special.Over time she explained to me that shortly after we first met, she had received a vision that the two of us had a mutual destiny, that our paths were intertwined. It sounded beautiful and I trusted her completely. I began to think of her as my spiritual twin sister and soul mate.But my wife and some of her friends were increasingly uneasy about my friendship with this woman and they began to challenge me on it. I listened to them and as I began to set and enforce boundaries, my friend became angry, rageful and accusatory. Her prophetic gifts became a weapon of false accusation and control.We began having nasty fights - worse than I've ever had with anyone, with the exception of when my mother had a bout with bi-polar personality disorder. Conflicts would rage for weeks at a time.She had her hooks deep in my psyche and I couldn't just walk away from it. I felt responsible for her emotions. It was a co-dependent, verbally abusive, prophetically abusive relationship.With the help of a therapist (a secular one actually - one need not be a Christian to see how unhealthy this was) I began to set firmer boundaries and watch as my friend would proudly step right over them. She had no respect for me or my marriage. She thought everything she did should be met with respect and gratitude. At first she talked of unconditional love but everything she did came with a big I.O.U.Several books were extremely helpful. One was a novel \\"Unadulterated Love\\" about an emotional affair - which was exactly what I had been having with my friend. For a long time I didn't want to admit it, but that's what it was.Another was a book on Borderline Personality Disorder. Another was \\"Controlling People\\" by Patricia Evans. All of these books had an eerie familiarity - they shed light on blind spots I had towards my friend.Unmasking the Jezebel Spirit was probably the spookiest of all, because the majority of the descriptions fit my friend. Her incessant demands for my time and attention. The sexual tension that was under the surface (fortunately our relationship wasn't physical.... but it could have easily been). The book describes HER marriage and her husband's response to her control tactics quite accurately. The misuse and abuse of spiritual power; the immense adrenaline rush that Jezebel feels when someone submits to her power.The insidious demonic influence and the deception. The things that a person with prophetic and seer gifts, who is not mature in the use of them, can do to manipulate and wound others.It took the concerted effort of a pastor and several friends to untangle myself from this, and the scars were very deep. It is taking a long time to heal those wounds. I feel like I was slimed and spiritually violated. And I also see the ways that I was carried away by my own desire for ego stroking, my unmet emotional needs and rationalizations. I am responsible, because nobody can give away my own power except me.It's scary to consider where this relationship might have gone if any less care had been taken. Sometimes... you learn more about a relationship from how it ends than from how it began.I heartily recommend this book."},{"Title":"Unmasking the Jezebel Spirit","review":"Feminists and other people with a personal agenda will(of course) disagree, but this book is vital for pastorsand Christians everywhere to understand the manipulativeand satan-strongholds that can operate (often, at first,subtly) within local churches. The Jezebel/Ahab principalityis a demon-stronghold that can divide and destroy not onlyministries, but entire local churches! - It is VITAL to knowand understand how it operates.Pastor Francis Frangipane has identified and dealt withthis \\"Jezebel spirit\\" in seminars, tapes, and a booklet andbook. John Paul Jackson has an excellent teaching ministryand here (in this book) he exposes the manner in which thisdemonic-activity can lock-into certain personality types(NOT ALL OF WHOM are necessarily female).I have worked many years as a pastor and a missionary on aforeign field. I can definitely testify that the \\"Jezebel-demonic-spirit and stronghold\\" is very, very real and HIGHLYmanipulative and (often) destructive within local churches.If one is not aware of the problems and operations of thisspirit, they will almost surely fall prey to it sooner orlater in today's secular and religious world.The \\"Jezebel-spirit\\" is a classic \\"seducing spirit\\" in thewitchcraft and manipulative sense, not so much in the sexaulor carnal sense. It operates mostly on an UNconscious level:wherein it is absolutely CERTAIN it is doing \\"God's Will.\\" !READ THIS BOOK and get very well informed on a MAJOR areaof spiritual warfare and demonic-deception."},{"Title":"Unmasking the Jezebel Spirit","review":"I think this book is a must for all church leaders and pastors. John Paul Jackson brings out the evil of the so called \\"Jezebel Spirit\\" in lamen terms. This enlightens you so much, that you have to be careful not to judge just anyone as having a Jezebel spirit. He describes what it is, how it acts, who it acts apon. Even how it must survive, in todays society. And it really makes you realize just how manipulative people are today, and how people are like wolves in sheeps clothing. I suggest you get and read this book. You can also study it, and better understand it in the bible."},{"Title":"Unmasking the Jezebel Spirit","review":"I enjoy reading the revelations that our Christian leaders put forth in their books and this one was outstanding. The authortakes time to explain what the Jezeleb spirit is and how it works to destroy Christians and churches. It isn't a woman against man thing, it's evil against good. The spirit is one of control and destruction. I felt the writing was Biblically sound and the examples were excellent. A good learning tool for all Christians serious about their walk with God!"},{"Title":"Unmasking the Jezebel Spirit","review":"The contents of this book reveals the Truth of the Word of God concerning one of the most powerful dark forces that the body of Christ faces today. Because of the nature of exposure to it's characteristics it will fight the Christian believer from accepting what is written here.Only those that are willing to accept the underlying agenda that this spirit carries will be able to accept how God is using this author to relate to the body how to fight this spirit but not be controlled or entangled in bondage by it at the same time. There is a key to fighting warfare and I believe that the author has found displayed, and explained very clearly how God intends to give us the victory over this spirit. Those who criticize and judge the author already have an issue within themself that must be reckoned with in order to help others. We must start with ourself first and then help others. This book is excellent because it gives guidelines and instructions on how to discern when it is present. This was an assignment well done."},{"Title":"Unmasking the Jezebel Spirit","review":"This book is a must read for every Church worker and Church member of all Christian denominations.

That spirit spent the next 9 months attempting to dismantle our ministry-- and in some ways, succeeded. A friend warned us that a congregant had a \\"Jezebel spirit,\\" but I mistakenly believed that referred to a type of sexual whorishness. Boy, was I wrong.In 2003, I purchased Unmasking the Jezebel Spirit to read during surgery recovery. WOW. It seemed as if JPJ had somehow viewed my life for a year or two, then went and wrote the book-- the incidents he wrote of were THAT typical!!!In fact, when my pastor confronted this Jezebel spirit, he inadvertently did exactly what JPJ says NOT to do-- and got exactly the results JPJ says will happen if you don't deal with this spirit correctly.I highly recommend the book.It helped me learn to separate the PERSON from the SPIRIT that is operating, allowing me to move into forgiveness.Buy it today!"},{"Title":"Unmasking the Jezebel Spirit","review":"this was a very thought provoking and interesting book. i agree with 90% of it. what troubles me is that this book was written from the perspective that all 'pastors' are godly, and untouchable. even by the jezebel spirit. but what if you were under a pastor who operated in this spirit? i have been there and seen it happen. it just troubles me that people who are discerning something wrong in a church or ministry might be discouraged from listening to the Holy Spirit about leaving such an atmosphere after reading this book. the pastor at the church we left exercised cruelty, control and manipulation. and anyone who questioned his tactics or tried to leave was a 'jezebel' or in rebellion. i just wish the author had made a distinction that all of the problems are not necessarily in the congregation of people, or even with the staff, but some lie directly with the pastor. this book just seems a little unbalanced. it has alot of good information in it though, and we should all start with examining ourselves before we point fingers at someone else as operating in this spirit, whether it be layperson, leadership, or even the pulpit."},{"Title":"Unmasking the Jezebel Spirit","review":"If you ever really wanted to know the true battle that is happening in the spirit realm this is the book foy you.

It does not set right. I have listened to the author a few times and have listened to a few elaborate reviews of his book in 2 churches. The author himself seems to be well-meaning and has intentions of exposing something that is definitely wrong within many of our churches. There is a very hurtful and intimidating determination to control others among believers. This is what happened when Jesus walked the earth! And Jesus addressed those Pharisees and Saducees with a label - not Jezebel spirit or spirit of Jezebel. Jesus called them hypocrites. He called them blind and identified their works as sins and as their own forms of righteousness.Queen Jezebel (I Kings 16, 17, 21, II Kings 9) was a person herself. What spirit did *she* have? Just her own? Spirit of Jezebel on herself? No. She had a spirit of witchcraft, idolatry, lust, murder, and covetousness. Just read the Word of God for what It says! And what about \\"that woman Jezebel\\" who \\"called herself a prophetess\\"? (Revelation 2:18-29) She was seducing and teaching God's servants to commit fornication in Thyatira! She taught them to eat what was sacrificed to idols and some where committing adultery with her.HOW did we come up with concepts to label people with a Jezebel spirit because they act like Pharisees? Jesus didn't even throw out names of spirits all over the place when somebody had an actual spirit or sin itself. He even asked legion what his name was before casting him out. Surely Jesus knew his name. But think about it. Was Jesus not setting an example for us as He often did teaching us to observe what He did and said? There are evil spirits. But don't make a grave assumption that one spirit's name is Jezebel when it's really not and think you're going to cast it out. At least, be willing to follow example of our LORD and Savior Jesus Christ, upon Whom we believe, and ask the thing before mouthing off. This is dangerous. And His Word tells us not to be false accusers (II Timothy 3:3). We flirt with false accusation when we take a few aspects of a person and label them as being something they are not. Did the author say if a woman wears lipstick she has a spirit of Jezebel??? And yet we find in II Kings that Jezebel painted her face. (I believe in wearing make up in modesty and moderation.) So, if I do everything else right and put on lipstick, eyeshadow, and blush, I have something in common with the person Jezebel. Does that make me have Jezebel spirit? I have yelled at my husband (battling with that flesh to get it right). By me yelling at him, do I have Jezebel spirit? Jezebel did not have to yell, yall. Though she did, I'm sure. She was queen. She was seductive. She had other ways of getting what she wanted to the point of murder. How in the world are saved, Blood-bought saints of God being labeled as having this \\"spirit\\"? Call sin what it is and watch God's deliverance through repentance. If women who love Christ can have this spirit, then what of the women in the world - waving their behinds in the camera for the world to see? What spirit is this? Do not some icons resemble Jezebel more than women who love Christ? And the woman calling herself a prophetess in Thyatira. Her deeds were specified. Yet in modern church, we are adding to the description. Manipulation is witchcraft to only an extent. Think about it. The pharisees manipulated people trying to trap them and tempt them to stumble over their words so they can bring about accusations against them. They tempted people to lie and be lying witnesses against Jesus Himself. The son of perdition, Judas, was manipulated by them financially. And Jesus called none of them witches. But he identified their sins - called them hypocrite, blind and said they could have no part with him except their righteousness exceeded their own. He gave Himself as an answer. We have introduced witch-hunting through this teaching of Jezebel.Sisters, let's not add or take away from God's Word. Don't get extra-Biblical. Stay safe and go by the Word of God. Pray for the author that He embraces and teaches God's Word and call sin what it is - sin. Domination, control, and intimidation exist our Christian churches. They are acts of sin because they are rooted in pride, self-righteousness, covetousness, and other works of the flesh. They are in many women. I so hate that my sisters in Christ get so offended by this next point. But Paul gave us a remedy to having such ways in the church among women. In I Corinthians 14, I Timothy 2, (although he encouraged women to teach other younger women, encouraged women to prophesy with covered heads and fellowshipped with Phillips 4 daughters who prophesied in Acts 21)Paul instructed that women should not usurp authority over men - exercise spiritual authority over men. Even in our ministry, we as sisters are supposed to be managed by a mature male pastor as Paul writes. And we still have positions of leadership (service - as leader is servant) and teaching in church as women. A pastor can establish order to eliminate a lot of what this book confronts. It's just true. There are evil spirits. The Word speaks of them. But spirits cannot be named like we are naming a character in our own fiction. Be like Jesus. Stand on His Word. Speak It. The Holy Spirit will bring it to remembrance. Study It to tune in to Him. Stop studying people's views and private interpretations of God's Word. It will lead to error...and additionally in this case false accusations through witch-hunting within the church."},{"Title":"Unmasking the Jezebel Spirit","review":"Rev. Jackson has revealed little about Jezebel and a great deal about himself; he has unmasked his own suspicion, fear, and jealousy of women in ministry, especially those with a prophetic ministry.The thesis of the book is that the \\"Jezebel spirit,\\" a demonic force and celestial power with worldwide influence (p. 2) has invaded the Christian Church; especially those churches that operate in the prophetic. This invasion calls for an army of Pastors in the model of King Jehu (2 Kings 9-10) to make war on those who manifest the \\"Jezebel spirit,\\" almost exclusively women, and literally throw them out of the church.Rev. Jackson fails to correctly delineate the parallel between the two passages of Scripture upon which his book is based: that of the account of Queen Jezebel in 1 Kings 16:29 - 2 Kings 11:2 and the reference to the woman, Jezebel in Revelation 2:20-28. Both Jezebels in Scripture were condemned for causing the people of God to commit fornication, worship false gods, and learn the \\"deep things of Satan,\\" causing judgment to fall on God's people. Incidentally, there is no \\"Jezebel spirit\\" mentioned in Scripture. The charge Rev. Jackson brings against the \\"Jezebelites\\" is based on his second-guessing of motivations of women in ministry, not on sins similar to those of the original Jezebels.The whole \\"Jezebel spirit\\" mythology is a recipe for handling a woman whom the Pastor finds threatening by labeling her with a mysterious spiritually discerned stigma which only the Pastor can discern and confront; destroying her credibility behind her back with the whole congregation; bringing the power of the Pastor and the organization against her in an inquisition without ever identifying the crime; and after breaking the person, subjecting her to years of shame, blame, and condemnation. (p. 145-149) If she will not submit to this abuse, she will be thrown out of the church. The root cause of such a vendetta is apparent: the Pastor is threatened by the spiritual gifts of the person in question.

Because this pastor actually allowed this spirit to DEVIDE and CONQUER. I suggest when you study this book learn from its concepts and realize the open doors are WOUNDEDNESS.

It also caused me to examine my own heart and motives - and I could see mistakes I had made that (in truth) actually dishonored my Pastor, even though I spoke under the guise of offering \\"constructive criticism\\".

He is so right. He confesses that even he, in researching for the writing of his book, began to feel suspect himself. Maybe there is a little bit of Jezebel in all of us? Maybe it is a natural phase we go through? Whatever, the book does arouse considerable introspection, especially when we want to be right with God and to avoid all attitudes and practices that could do spiritual harm to others.The scripture that kept running through my mind the whole time I was reading the book is, \\"If your heart condemns you, God is greater than your heart.\\" (I John 3:20)By the end of the book, the author makes clear all the attributes normally found in one who bears the Jezebel spirit and suggests sound counsel to pastors and others for dealing with such an individual. He even lays out the measures that must be taken to redeem and set free those who are influenced by this spirit.Throughout the book the reader is introduced to real-life scenarios in which Jezebelites have wormed their way into churches and the personal lives of church leaders only to leave them and the churches in a heap of rubble. By the end of the last chapter, one who desires to live a Christlike life knows he/she must deal quickly and forthrightly with devisiveness and seduction.I recommend UNMASKING THE JEZEBEL SPIRIT only to the spiritually mature who take seriously their responsibility before God.Virginia Rogers"},{"Title":"Unmasking the Jezebel Spirit","review":"Doesn't only pertain to females; but does talk about the Jezebel spirit as a manipulative, divisive force.

Freddie Montgomery is a beast of little burden. A dissolute son of privilege, he bungles his way into the All Ireland bludgeoning team where he joins the likes of Monaghan's Francie Brady and Mayoman Christy Mahon. In a monologue of sinister undertone Freddy recounts the unfortunate missteps that conspire to push him to the brink of desperation. He lands in debt, uses his wife and child as collateral, and travels to his ancestral patch to wring blood from a turnip. Erin has no welcome for this prodigal son. His opening gambit as art thief on the country estate circuit proves disastrous. Poor, poor Freddie, he can't do anything right. The novel contains a darkly comic murder scene involving a maid, a hammer, and a rented car which springs \\"forward in a series of bone-shaking lurches.\\"Our narrator, two years in the nick, grapples with age old questions, the poles of Catholicism and Calvinism tugging at his mind and soul. Freddie alternates between contrition and rationalization, questioning \\"whether it is feasible to hold on to the principle of moral culpability once the notion of free will has been abandoned.\\" This existential conflict puts the novel in Camus territory. But Freddie, as character, as articulate lizard, most resembles Humbert Humbert. Villainy is always afforded a certain degree of sympathy if it accompanies such dazzling displays of imagery and word craft.With leaps of imagination Banville breaths life into the inanimate and lends substance to shades of feeling that normally elude remark. Take for instance his description of prison visitors: \\"They must feel the force of our longing, must hear it, almost, the mermen's song, a high needle-note of pure woe buzzing in the glass that separates us from them.\\" Through Freddie, Banville registers the kind of revulsion and regret that make everyday existence so excruciatingly labored. Freddie's pomposity and sense of entitlement (\\"I wanted my share of this richness, this gilded ease.\\") attract derision, but he is no monster. Despite protestations to the contrary, he is all too human. His crime seems doubly terrifying because his flaws, not wholly unlike our own, are so familiar, so common."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"\\"My Lord, when you ask me to tell the court in my own words, this is what I shall say.\\" Thus begins \\"The Book of Evidence,\\" the sardonic, self-pitying, occasionally witty, and ultimately unreliable narrative of Frederick Charles St. John Vanderveld Montgomery (a/k/a Freddie Montgomery). I say \\"unreliable\\" quite consciously, because Freddie Montgomery says as much throughout the novel, another in a long line of remarkable fictions from John Banville, perhaps Ireland's finest living author. As Freddie relates at the end of his tale, \\"I thought of trying to publish this, my testimony. But no. I have asked Inspector Haslet to put it into my file, with the other, official fictions . . . [H]ow much of it is true? All of it. None of it. Only the shame.\\"And what is Freddie Montgomery's story? An educated and brilliant academic, he married a young woman, Daphne, whom he met while teaching at Berkeley. He left academia for a dissolute life on a Mediterranean island. He became indebted there to apparently dark and unseemly characters, left his wife and young child behind, and returned to his family home in Ireland to obtain enough money to repay his debts. While in Ireland, he committed a brutal and seemingly inexplicable murder, fled the scene of his crime in a kind of \\"Lost Weekend\\" of drunken binging and obsession with his dark deed, and, ultimately, is apprehended and imprisoned. He writes the dark, powerful, obsessive interior monologue of \\"The Book of Evidence\\" while sitting in prison awaiting his trial.The reader is never quite certain what to make of Freddie Montgomery. He is, indeed, a disturbed and disturbing narrator, someone who kills an innocent woman for no apparent reason, with chilling sang-froid. He bludgeons her with a hammer and then wonders, as if he were the victim: \\"How could this be happening to me-it was all so unfair. Bitter tears of self-pity squeezed into my eyes.\\"Freddie Montgomery's narrative is lucid, but it's not clear that he is entirely sane. There is complete lack of feeling. He seems a psychopath, or worse. Perhaps he's simply mad. Perhaps he is commenting on himself when he says, \\"Madmen do not frighten me, or even make me uneasy. Indeed, I find that their ravings soothe me. I think it is because everything, from the explosion of a nova to the fall of dust in a deserted room, is to them of vast and equal significance, and therefore meaningless.\\"There is a cold anomie that pervades Freddie's actions, his reflections, his feelings. It reminds the reader of \\"Crime and Punishment\\" or \\"Notes from Underground\\". But there is also a dark humor and a sleight of hand working here that is absent from the great Russian master. Perhaps Irish sensibility is creeping in, perhaps just the penumbra of the post-modern. Whatever it is, it works."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"The Book of Evidence is a marvelous piece of literary, philosophical, and political fiction. This is what critic Eve Patten has to say about the novel and its author:\\"Regarded as the most stylistically elaborate Irish writer of his generation, John Banville is a philosophical novelist concerned with the nature of perception, the conflict between imagination and reality, and the existential isolation of the individual. While his writing flirts with both postmodernism and magic realism, it is best understood as metafiction in the tradition of Samuel Beckett, Banville's acknowledged mentor. Like Beckett, he moves fluidly from Irish landscapes and characters to European contexts and histories, and from conventional narratives into fabulism and distortion. Relentlessly and some might argue, pretentiously allusive, his works play with both overt and hidden references to his literary idols, particularly Proust, Dostoevsky, and Nabokov. . . .\\". . . The Book of Evidence (1989) consists of the prison memoir of Freddie Montgomery, on trial for the brutal murder of a female servant who interrupted his plan to steal a painting. Freddie is at once a disarming and objectionable narrator, blinded by his own ego, capable of the most intense response to the portrait he steals, but unable to empathise in any way with his human victim. At the heart of his predicament is his own existential insecurity, his perceived lack of substance: 'How shall I describe it, this sense of myself as something without weight, without moorings, a floating phantom? Other people seemed to have a density, a 'thereness', which I lacked. Among them, these big, carefree creatures, I was a child among adults.' In this fragility of identity the novel locates an ethical dilemma: if Freddie's concept of self is ultimately a fiction, then can he legitimately be held responsible for his crime? What is the nature of his guilt, defined by Freddie himself as 'a failure of imagination'? And how far can the reader trust his narration, a dubious construct fraught with implausibility, inconsistency and pride.\\" (Copyright Eve Patten, n.d., British Council website accessed May 16, 2003)Why do I add \\"political fiction\\"? Because the \\"picture,\\" a master's portrait of, Freddie imagines, a successful burgher's protected wife from the era of the Dutch Republic, hangs on the wall of one of the big houses associated, in Banville's novels, with the English overlords of Ireland. Freddie's muddled crime, moreover, occurs against the backdrop of an anarchist's bombing and with much the same result. Further, every plummy accent, every civilized affectation (including even \\"Smyth,\\" the name Freddie adopts to rent his get-away car, a Humber Hawk, at once an allusion to England's fabled river and Nabokov's Humbert Humbert) is associated with England. Freddie's confused effort to claim, or possibly to reclaim, the painting, like his effort to define his missing self, is thus, on one level, Ireland's effort to reclaim something of its robbed patrimony.This is a great short read. Robert E. Olsen"},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"The Book of Evidence is an ex-scientist's confession of his gruesome but motiveless murder. Thirty-eight-year-old Freddie Montgomery returned to Ireland (from some Mediterranean island) hoping to solicit funds to pay off his debts. When his mother told him that she had got rid of the pictures his deceased father left behind, Freddie paid a visit to the Behrens who might have bought the pictures from his mother. At Behrens' Whitewater House, Freddie, with a ball of twine and a roll of wrapping paper, stole a painting that for him had become an obsession-Portrait of a Woman with Gloves. Never would Freddie expect what started as a casual escapade ended up in a gruesome homicide when a maid caught him red-handed.John Banville bears the tour de force of storytelling that evokes Dostoyevsky. Freddie Montgomery showed no remorse for his crime, unlike Raskolnikov (the protagonist of Crime and Punishment), he had no motive to kill. But when he could go back in time, Freddie would still choose to kill simply because he had no choice. Freddie left marks of careful premeditation of his stealing but not murder. Banville intermingled the events leading to the atrocious act with Freddie's dreams, dreams that were not some tumble of events but states of feelings, moods, pangs, and emotions. Freddie somehow lost track of the perception of time-so much so that somehow time was warped. Places (like he reminisced on his Berkeley days), people (how he met Daphne through her roommate), and events (annecdotes of his father and childhood) became like movie stills so isolated that he had no way to tell if they could be real.The inebriating prose reminds me of Nabokov (especially Lolita). Freddie simply indulged in a hazy, disheartening, and morbid sensation. The prose was full of his gripes-about his distaste for the world, resentment toward his mother, disdain for the attorney (...a life spent poking in the crevices of other people's nasty little tragedies...p.73). At one point he felt he had committed the murder a long time ago. The prose exerted a mounting sense of panic and unease that infect the readers. 4.1 stars."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"I know a quite a few people who love this book, so my opinion may be an anamoly. Banville is quite witty and there are a few lines here and there that made me chuckle aloud. That said, you'll hear The Book of Evidence compared to a great many literary heavyweights. Unfortunately, your time would probably be better spent reading the originals to which the book is compared. Take the character of Freddie Montgomery, for example. There are, as many have stated, more than a few traces of Humbert Humbert, but none of Nabokov's acrobatic command of language and metaphor; an impulsive murderer-protagonist with nowhere near the depth of a Mersault or a Raskolnikov; then about a hundred or so vaguely-reworked modernist cliches (e.g. - the mind/body split, the \\"untethered in the current\\" metaphor that plays so heavily in books like Tropic of Capricorn, the \\"finding oneself in a reality that feels like a simulacrum of nonreality\\" motif, etc.) that seem to have been ripped wholesale from Banville's forerunners (a short passage about a third of the way through, for example, wherein Montgomery describes how, upon awakening, he cannot tell whether he is in the present or in his childhood, seemed taken right out of the opening chapter of Proust.) How much you enjoy this kind of thing depends on whether you regard the preceding as an imitation or as an \\"homage\\".This is not to say that Book of Evidence is a BAD novel...at worst, it just offers nothing new. If you're looking for an introduction to the \\"anti-narrator\\" genre, this is a decent place to start. But, if you've already devoured Banville's predecessors, you may feel a bit disappointed when you find he doesn't quite measure up."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"You might like to know, first off, that the hardcover reproduces a depiction of the painting Freddie steals, at least a \\"detail\\" from it; the paperback post-Booker nominee (and pre-Booker winner for The Sea) does not. It helped me to see what Banville so well describes on the page, and I flipped back and forth between cover and paper repeatedly in this key section.I think that Banville characteristically in the novels I've read tends to compress much into the last pages, and if you tend as I do to adapt to a steady pace as you acclimate to his style, allowing yourself to be immersed in his prose, you may weary of its elaboration by the time in its fading moments when your stamina's most demanded. He often places in final sections key realizations faced by his narrators, but he does not highlight these from the rest of the detail and density. It's easy to skim past important sentences if you're not fully attentive. This makes for an exhilarating but challenging read.Some others who have here commented on the novel claim that Freddie lacks any insight into his crime, and is incapable of feeling, and that his sanity is to be questioned. I disagree. He states that he does not feel remorse because remorse implies that the sufferer expects forgiveness. For the murder of Josie, Freddie acknowledges no such remedy is possible. The final pages turn very moving as he grapples with his failure to realize until far too late that his victim deserved to be taken as if a fully living, rounded, respected human being, and that Freddie comes to this realization only after the murder, while incarcerated, makes the ending of this book powerful.The more I read Banville, the more I recognize his pattern: he sets up his plot around a tormented character looking back on his failure. You read a couple hundred pages dense with felt detail but with little dialogue, from within the narrator's fevered recollections, justifications, and anguish. You grow a bit tired of the pace, relentless yet after a while similar in its torrents of elegant but rather detached observations about the wider society from which the protagonist removes himself. Then, in the last few pages, the perspective shifts, and the denouement carries you into the workings of, if not grace, then enlightenment, however brilliantly painful it may be for his erudite but often spiritually self-blinded speakers of such rich and ornamented self-consciousnesses at last being dragged out into the light to gasp, blink, and cringe.This is part of a trilogy, continuing obliquely into Ghosts before coming back to Athena. It has been compared to Beckett's masterful and dauntingly fearsome prose trilogy of novels; while Banville shares with Beckett a fascination with style, the former's works are perhaps more accessible, an ideal preparation and inspiration of Beckett's own bold encounter with pain and hope. Both authors write to discomfort, prophets for a secular age, but both concerned with our fragile and stumbling humanity, whether murderers or victims, that all share."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"When I read the Book of Evidence, I understood that I was experiencing a masterpiece. Clearly, Banville deserves a place not only in the cannon of Irish literature but in the greater western cannon as well. Stylistically, the writing is nothing shy of stunning. Likewise, the characters are fleshed out and three-dimensional. Lastly, the social, philosophic, and literary observations show the mark of true insight. Mix Dostoevsky and Camus with a little Beckett and Proust and add Banville's own originality and you have the above work of genius."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"Freddie Montgomery killed because he could. This one liner economically but eloquently nails the issue at the heart of John Banville's splendid novel, &quot;The Book Of Evidence&quot;. The horror that Freddie's act of murder evokes is not so much that he killed but he killed because it was expedient for his purpose and because he failed to glimpse even the first sign of humanity in the victim he so cruelly and senselessly batters to death as he makes away with the loot. If for one moment he did, the dastardly act would have been avoided. The novel, written as a confession to us readers, suggests that it took his arrest and conviction for him to recognize the meaning of his action. Punishment is justified and meted out because he broke faith with society and is ostracized for it. The moral bankruptcy that Banville depicts in Freddie isn't a fantasy. It is an unspoken condition a society finds itself in, even as its inhabitants go about pursuing their goals with no larger purpose than to attain them. The amorality at the heart of Freddie's story is never more pointedly suggested than in the chilling scene of a menage a trois signifying an unholy alliance among the threesome (Freddie, Daphne and Anna) early in the plot. This scene is unforgettable for its sense of foreboding and evil. Banville has written several superb novels including the underated &quot;The Untouchable&quot;. His literary craft is truly awesome. Simply astounding. There is no better writer of contemporary fiction today. Read &quot;The Book Of Evidence&quot;. It's wonderfully entertaining and insightful. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"This was my first John Banville book. After reading countless reviews of his other books that were somewhat scathing, and hearing highly positive reviews from my girlfriend, I wasn't quite sure what to expect.Banville's writing has the feel of the \\"classics.\\" Literary, beautiful prose, descriptive metaphors (can someone explain why using metaphors is often frowned upon?) and he paints a vivid picture that is breathtaking and truly takes you to \\"another place.\\" He really is an excellent wordsmith.The characters are very interesting and easy to relate to (which is quite a feat considering how little they actually speak.)I guess the only thing that I'd warn readers about (and it seems to be the case in many of his books based on Amazon cust. reviews), is that not very much happens in his stories. The plot of this book could easily be broken into 3 or 4 events at best. Now I'm not one of those spy-novel readers who expects the story to feel like an action film, but it is somewhat disappointing that given Banvilles wonderfull style and voice, that we don't get to see a bit more on the plot side of things.Also, I've heard people refer to this story and it's main character as \\"chilling\\". I don't see that at all. If anything it's quite the opposite. Banville shows how a somewhat ordinary (albeit slightly OFF and very self-centered) individual can casually become a killer. To me that's the main point. But I certainly won't be losing sleep over this criminal.Overall, great book. Highly recommend it. Especially if you like \\"literary\\" prose."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"Patients who are truly mentally ill have a disadvantage. They've lost their point of reference in what you or I would call &quot;reality.&quot; So, as a psychiatrist, when I approach a patient like this, I know how to get them to tell me the truth. Simply...I engage them in conversation. The more we talk, and the more I listen to what they have to say...the more *I* become their reference point. In essence, I just &quot;walk&quot; along with them. Step by step, by not disputing their &quot;facts&quot; or showing undue concern over anything they say--in truth, by my showing genuine interest in them as a person--we move closer and closer to the core of their experience. Eventually, they will speak plainly, not realizing how out of the mainstream what they're telling me really is. Herein is the starting point of *all* therapy. Or, as in the book at hand, herein is the basis of criminal prosecution.Banville's book is a startling confession of a murderer. As he rambles--as he loses track of the mainstream---he gets closer and closer to an accurate description of what really occured. I suspect, perhaps, that some of the other Amazon reviewers were a bit &quot;let down&quot; by the ultimate revelation. You don't think that's what Banville intended? The killing is finally portrayed as utterly banal...stupid...pointless. The confessor has *no* clue as to the seriousness of what he's done. He is completely locked within his own perspective. This is about as far as you can get from the seductive &quot;media violence&quot; everyone complains so much about. And yet...why is it so much less compelling? Well, you can struggle with that on your own as you work your way through THE BOOK OF EVIDENCE.Banville is one of Ireland's top contemporary writers. His books are not for those who would prefer New York Times best-sellers, or a &quot;good&quot; Hollywood movie. They are complex, they have depth, and they take you to somewhere other than the usual endings. And this is one of his best!"},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"Freddie Montgomery doesn't really set out to kill Josie Bell, but it happens anyway. This whole novel is a harrowing presentation of \\"evidence\\" about his crime - about his life and the events leading up to the murder, as well a description of its aftermath.I can't describe this as a happy book, but it is a remarkable one. Banville's use of language is original but clear; his characters are strikingly delineated though almost none of them are sympathetic.There are literary echoes, too - the Greeks, Camus, T.S. Eliot - but you wouldn't have to know these authors to appreciate the novel. I would describe it as Gothic, in the sense that it deals with the grotesque, and you keep reading if only to find out what new dreadfulness is around the corner. (No, it is not gory.)Like the aforementioned authors, the novel poses questions about what it means to be human, and ultimately the questions will have to be answered by the reader. I can see why it was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"John Banville's Book of Evidence is a dark tale of an 'everyman' who is so disconnected from himself and others, he is capable of a heinous murder. Banville's prose is simple and eloquent and although I don't empathize with the main character, Banville makes his profound alienation comprehensible. Excellent read and I look forward to more of this author's work"},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"Once upon a time, the American Music Club's Mark Eitzel once noted that you can't look your murderers in the eye. \\"But you can always spot them from a mile away. They'll do anything you want, they'll do anything you say,\\" he went on to add, as if murder was somehow an act between two consenting adults, that you can give a tacit okay to something so very final. The decision is less important than the act.In this book, our narrator (he's a protagonist only in the strictest definition of the term) talks about the murder he commits and when asked why he did it, he says it was done because he could. And not because he had set out seeking to murder someone, but to his eyes the events had conspired and arranged themselves to the point where the very outcome was inevitable. Out of all the possible paths, it was the only one ahead. So he took it. And someone dies as a result. As it turns out, he's okay with the murder, not as okay with someone being dead.But \\"The Book of Evidence\\" is less about the murder itself than the person who commits it and what it says about them. And Freddie Montgomery thinks long and hard about what it says about him, and not entirely liking what he discovers. Writing from prison, he submits what he calls his book of evidence just before he's about to go on trial. He has no interest in saving himself, whether because he thinks it could be interesting or perhaps because he's curious about lost causes. So he narrates what could possible be the events leading up to the murder in question, then his flight and eventual capture. Maybe. The idea of the unreliable narrator is only brought toward the end, but it lingers over everything. We assume he's telling the truth because he's telling the story. But without any objective evidence, we have no idea whether he's making it all up. We only have him to go by and after spending two hundred pages with him, we can't say for sure he wouldn't lie just to make himself look better, more thoughtful, less moral. Does he see himself as an amoral monster, or is that purely what he is?Two hundred pages of a murderer talking about himself doesn't sound on its face like it could be interesting but Banville makes it work by having prose that lesser writers would kill for. His voice is unswerving through Freddie and there's a certain compelling rhythm and tone to the novel that makes him fascinating. His questions become our questions, simply because he seems so wonderfully complicated. Is he remorseful, or does he just feel bad that all of this is terribly inconvenient for him. At times he seems to brood mightily on what he has wrought, noting that the only thing that would make up for his crime would be to bring her back to life. Other times he feels sorry for himself, as if he was driven to this by forces beyond anything he could control. And maybe they are. The book on some level operates as a journey of self-discovery with a man who never thought himself capable of murder, then finds out that he is and isn't quite sure what to do about that. So he ponder, he analyzes, he reflects. He probably lies to us and what we might decide are lies tells us even more about him. He murders because it's the easy way out, because he has a streak of amorality that he didn't realize existed, he murders because she's there and the moment is right. All of these may be true. He comports himself to be learned and cultured but just like any of us, he is driven by petty impulses. He owes people money and needs to find a way to get money fast. With all avenues thwarted, he turns to stealing. He kills someone and then flees, indulging in bouts of drinking and hanging about, purely killing time until the police finally get around to finding him. He glorifies in what happened to him, seeing it as a respite from life, something he deserves, an unfairness. All of this is true. Someone is dead and it awaken something in him. It numbs something in him. Both of these are true. He kills because the moment was perfect. He kills because it was inevitable he would do so some day. He has no idea. Everything is true. All the reasons, all the clues, all the justifications, all the petty dodging and rationalizations, the what-if and the what-could-be, it's all true. It has to be, or else Freddie Montgomery has no reason to exist.There's more than a few elements of Camus' \\"The Stranger\\" here, but Banville's prose throbs with a chilling gle, grounded in this place without finding a true home. Freddie is too close to his own subject to be clinical about it. Banville goes beyond the tired suggestion that a darkness inherently exists in us all and perhaps notes that we're all victims of ourselves, ultimately. Every day we're alive we're committing crimes that we're leaving evidence for, in big ways and in small and sometimes those crimes are in small injustices and sometimes they are as subtle as a blow to the head. Freddie Montgomery discovers a surprising revelation about himself and looks for evidence of it in his past, finding no hints of the paths he would eventually take. There's precious little warning and in that he feels sorry for himself. And who wouldn't? Which of us wouldn't like to know where our future would take us, so at least we can avoid the jarring shock. There's a truth in it that goes beyond the act and if there's anything we can learn from this it's to pay attention to the abrupt turns your life is capable of taking, at the exact moment when you're not looking."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"Banville's Montgomery occasionally reminded me of Raskolnikov, but not often enough. (I won't repeat the novel's premise because previous reviewers have done a remarkably good job on it. I read this bk on a close friend's recommendation, it came with no pedigree, other than what's on the book cover: shortlisted for the Booker Prize, and the winner of an Irish prize that I'm not familiar with. Since I'm only reading prize winners this summer, that qualified it. Also, get this, it was a gift from the people of Dublin to the San Jose, CA library.) So I didn't know I was actually reading a wanna-be classic.I thought the writer's style was remarkably compelling and I think that's what kept me reading, because it was not Monty's plight. Monty, from his jail cell, is writing what turns out to be a book length confession as he awaits his murder sentence. The book itself is dense, like a journal with no dialog, just his dogged narrative, broken only when he interrupts his own thoughts. I totally enjoyed that device for telling this story.But to the story itself, I had no sympathy whatsoever for this total jerk. His sense of entitlement and overbearing manner was unfathomable, but something kept telling me that people like him actually exist. Maybe that's why I kept reading.I'm not sure where the notion that Monty was an ex-scientist came from. (See other reviews.) What I remember of his background was that he was a math student at Berkeley when he met Daphne and eventually married her, but from his own account, it didn't appear to be a love match. Apparently his dad was funding his education abroad, and perhaps continued to fund his life in general, which appeared to be one of penurious leisure somewhere off the coast of Spain with his wife and child. A man of manners but no job or ethics or morality, he gets into a financial jam that eventually risks the lives of his wife and child.So he dashes home to Ireland to see if he can get mum to give him some cash so he can literally free up his family from a loan shark. Things go badly at home so he comes up with a plan to steal some artwork, which he also thinks really belongs to him (that sense of entitlement again). That plan goes even worse and now he's murdered somebody.That's when we begin to see the similarities between him and Raskolnikov. He is nearly undone by his shame, I guess. It's not remorse that works him over to the point where he cannot run away, even though a family friend lends him the money to take off. He holes up with said friend and waits for the inevitable moment when he will be captured.But remember, this tale is recounted from his prison cell, so he has had time to embroider the details into what could be considered sympathetic. We could ask ourselves if he was mentally unstable and thus explain his behavior that way. We could ask ourselves if he felt some remorse and was therefore worthy of our compassion. Or we could question whether it's society's fault that landed gentry or even pseudo landed gentry like Monty exist in the first place.So the bottom line here is if you are left asking yourself questions like these at the end of a novel, perhaps the novel was worthwhile after all. I still cannot say that I would place this book among the greatest classics ever written, but it is definitely close."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"Freddie is the best example of a person who does not understand the consequences of his actions. He just keeps on drilling a deeper hole for himself everywhere he goes, and getting more people invloved in his insensitive doings. He has committed an ugly, cold hearted crime for no reason at all. He can't even explain why he did it, and all his confessions show that he does not even find any wrong with what he has done!!!Banville style of writting gives you the best picture of the different personalities involved, the human reaction to panics, and more so how cruel and unappreciative mankind can be.A thrilling story, your always waiting for when the truth is going to be discovered, how far Freddie can go with his cold attitude to such a crime, and what will be his attitude in court."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"I shan't write a lengthy blow by blow review of the plot, I merely thought I might add that if you have read this book and enjoyed it you might be delighted to know that Banville's &quot;Athena&quot; is a sequel to &quot;The Book of Evidence&quot;.

I say \\"unreliable\\" quite consciously, because Freddie Montgomery says as much throughout the novel, another in a long line of remarkable fictions from John Banville, perhaps Ireland's finest living author. As Freddie relates at the end of his tale, \\"I thought of trying to publish this, my testimony. But no. I have asked Inspector Haslet to put it into my file, with the other, official fictions . . . [H]ow much of it is true? All of it. None of it. Only the shame.\\"And what is Freddie Montgomery's story? An educated and brilliant academic, he married a young woman, Daphne, whom he met while teaching at Berkeley. He left academia for a dissolute life on a Mediterranean island. He became indebted there to apparently dark and unseemly characters, left his wife and young child behind, and returned to his family home in Ireland to obtain enough money to repay his debts. While in Ireland, he committed a brutal and seemingly inexplicable murder, fled the scene of his crime in a kind of \\"Lost Weekend\\" of drunken binging and obsession with his dark deed, and, ultimately, is apprehended and imprisoned. He writes the dark, powerful, obsessive interior monologue of \\"The Book of Evidence\\" while sitting in prison awaiting his trial.The reader is never quite certain what to make of Freddie Montgomery. He is, indeed, a disturbed and disturbing narrator, someone who kills an innocent woman for no apparent reason, with chilling sang-froid. He bludgeons her with a hammer and then wonders, as if he were the victim: \\"How could this be happening to me-it was all so unfair. Bitter tears of self-pity squeezed into my eyes.\\"Freddie Montgomery's narrative is lucid, but it's not clear that he is entirely sane. There is complete lack of feeling. He seems a psychopath, or worse. Perhaps he's simply mad. Perhaps he is commenting on himself when he says, \\"Madmen do not frighten me, or even make me uneasy. Indeed, I find that their ravings soothe me. I think it is because everything, from the explosion of a nova to the fall of dust in a deserted room, is to them of vast and equal significance, and therefore meaningless.\\"There is a cold anomie that pervades Freddie's actions, his reflections, his feelings. It reminds the reader of \\"Crime and Punishment\\" or \\"Notes from Underground\\". But there is also a dark humor and a sleight of hand working here that is absent from the great Russian master. Perhaps Irish sensibility is creeping in, perhaps just the penumbra of the post-modern.

Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"A beautifully written and twisted little tale reminiscent of Camus. The way in which Banville presents violence and explores his themes through the killer's thoughts is eerily provocative. Freddie's remembrances of the act are like memory itself: incomplete, foggy, amoral and without any apparent logic or motive. Drunkenness is an apt and recurring symbol for this particular state of consciousness.A type of existential randomness is presented so convincingly that many readers may become fearful that, at some level, they too might be capable of something equally horrid if the wrong circumstances presented themselves. Freddie's thoughts and reactions after the deed are especially moving. Nature, village life, great and mundane events happen not just very much like before but exactly as before. The villain is then left alone to ponder the greatness/insignificance of his actions. The partial redemption is the mark of a true artist."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"To a time, in my case anyway, roughly two months ago when I first undertook reading this marvelous book. Now I didn't follow this up with study, didn't probe for the accuracies or inconsistancies of this unconventional narrative--no, I moved on to something else I liked perhaps even better (I wrote a review recently for Oscar and Lucinda, by Peter Carey, where I also reference Banville, so this is a mere presumption of recent consistancy in tone--). But The Book of Evidence is a masterpiece--a true, glorious masterpiece of Western Literature that one day will likely be noticed in the speech in ten to twenty years time when John goes to Sweden to accept his Nobel Prize. It is among the most gorgeously written examples of English prose and tells a baffling, frequently maddening story with twists and turns and riots all told by a detachedly engaged narrator who is the victim of all the horrible happens. This is a tragedy where there is laughter, this is a brutal, satiric comedy complete with tears. Here is a story about everything that could go wrong when you've reached the middle of life and find yourself unsatisfied and bored. This is a story about intellectual pretention and general human contempt. The Book of Evidence actually seeks to test the reader to see how much graphic confession they can take from a man who is admittedly offensive before they experience pity. This is a magical tale about failure and unfulfilled expectations, about self-acuity and self-actualization and the shudderingly realized moment when one admits they are corrupt.Something that one day, when I am feeling old no doubt, I will dredge up again to hear the glorious song of a man who is worse off than I--"},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"I read this as a book group selection.

Without exception they each have provided unique reading experiences. &quot;The Book Of Evidence&quot;, is not currently available and that is a loss for readers. It is certainly worth hunting down at the library or as a used book, as it again demonstrates the range this Author is capable of writing within.Virtually the entire work is in the first person and takes the form as testimony, or perhaps a confession. The crime that is the subject of the tale is particularly gruesome, and like the events before and after the crime is shared in great detail. The word sardonic has been used to describe the character and his actions, and while the word is appropriate it is not all encompassing. Mr. Banville has not brought a colorless perpetrator to our attention, rather one who is articulate, witty, and pathetic as he is inept at his crime. Nothing is simple with this man even his name is an event, Frederick Charles St John Vanderveld Montgomery!There are digressions from the main topic of his crime and they range from the amusing to that of approaching intoxicating. There is a point when the subject focuses on a Dutch Painting. What begins as an aside turns into a small tale of its own as the image and the circumstances that he believed brought about its creation are shared.When the end of the book arrives Mr. Banville provides a flexible conclusion allowing the reader to define what he or she believes is the truth. The testimony appears straightforward, however by the end what portions of his confession are written, spoken, or recreated in his own mind are anything but clear.This is another great piece of writing by an Author who does not seem to have the wide audience his work deserves."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"That this book is out of stock is a miserable shame (hopefully just a printing oversight).

The young, indolent, arrogant contemporary American prose writers should take a look at what the Europeans (Banville, Grass, Saramago) are doing if they want to see how to salvage literature from the self-referential, cookie-cutter idiocy in which it wallows."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"Message from hell indeed, as per one contemporary review. Beautifully written memoir of a psychotic killer, channeling a banal Raskolnikov, dizzily seeing the abyss looking into him rather than the other way around, as posited by the author. Existential in that not much happens, except the murder, and what does happen makes no ordinary sense, but Banville unfolds the narrator's meandering account with elan. Prelapsarian and then some, the author suggests; but one needn't be a prelapsarianist, nor a psychiatrist, to be engulfed in the prose. A murder something like Leopold and Loeb i.e. premeditated senselessness. There's no social consciousness thus Banville essays a sociopath, even as the narrator is riveting in his insanity."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"Freddie Montgomery, is an alcoholic intellectual work-shy scion of Anglo-Irish aristocracy. He is witheringly sarcastic about the lesser intellects he is forced to associate with. He is also a murderer.As Nabokov's Humbert Humbert said \\"you can always depend on a murderer for a fancy prose style\\" (at least in literature, the real ones I've known were not great stylists). Some other murderers' stories that come to mind are Dostoevsky's \\"Crime and Punishment\\" and Camus's \\"L'Etranger\\" and Simenon's \\"The Man who Watched Trains go by\\" (l'homme qui mirait passer les trains). Banville isn't quite up to Nabokov as a fancy writer and isn't quite up to Simenon as a starkly realist page-turner maker, or up to Camus or Dostoevsky as a philosopher but this is entertaining and brilliant. ."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"Why have I put off reviewing this book, which is rightly regarded as Banville's breakthrough novel, while reviewing (almost) all his other books? Perhaps, as Freddie would say, because I could. - Some of it has to do with the fact that certain other reviewers and critics regard Athena and Ghosts to be a continuation of this book. I don't concur with this assessment, for reasons stated in reviews of those books, and I wanted to give these books their just due as integral works on their own without a reference to a review of this book. But here I go:What makes this book such a wonder? First, there's the sumptuous, poetic language on display in all of Banville's work - At times I felt as if I was reading a Conrad Aiken poem - that makes for a feat of literary seduction unparalleled. Indeed, if there is one adjective I would use for Banville's stylism, aside from poetic (perhaps redundant anyway), for readers with a keen ear for the use of language, it is, without hesitation - Seductive. This seductive style, luring the reader into Freddie's mindscape, goes pari passu with the philosophical underpinnings of the novel. In plain speech, determinism is very seductive in its own right. There is no free will here, no choice, and Banville's great feat here is to have seduced us into a mindset where we can very easily imagine, mutatis mutandis, doing exactly the sort of thing Freddie has done, murdering. This is what's so frightening about the novel: We come to see ourselves, like Freddie, as the playthings of inner and outer forces over which we have scant control, as playthings of the gods, so to speak.Putting the book down, one wonders if, really, there is not much more to our place in the world than, as Freddie puts it:\\"....The ceaseless, slow, demented drift of things.\\" P.135A very eerie book indeed."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"I had to read this book with two other individuals for a British Literature class in my junior year in high school. Then we had to act out a 45 minute memorized presentation that included character analysis, plot summaries and critical reviewership. I can honestly say that the language is beautifully descriptive and lyrical, though it does get tiresome when you're forced into reading the novel. The story itself was somewhat difficult to understand in the sense that the Tragic Hero's actions cannot be as easily explained as....let's say the ones in BRAVE NEW WORLD or HAMLET. But perhaps that is the point- to present a character who does not fit the typical expectations of the audience. One would have to scrutinize from all sorts of angles to get the full gist, unless they enjoy the unsettling headaches that accompanies the reading. The other partners in my group didn't like the book that much. But it won a Booker Prize so maybe us young teenagers just don't get it. By the way, there is no dialogue, so that means it just feels like one extensive, endless (though entirely poetic) monologue."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"Banville in The Book of Evidence writes pure narrative, that is, no dialogue, action told rather than shown. This, of course, is the opposite of what we hear from writing teachers and in critique groups. Yet, it works beautifully, underlining the old adage that in art one can do anything, so long as it's done well."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"A genuinely good and thought-provoking read; well, it's Banville telling you a story, you wouldn't expect anything less. Freddie, the main character, a cad, a bounder, a slug. A parasite who so bored with himself has exhausted his privileged life by feeding off a circle of friends and family who so cared for him, they let him make their lives sad and tragic as a result of him living his life. Worse yet, he's an intelligent and perhaps talented individual, who with some semblance of a work ethic could have easily made those lives around him better for knowing him. Banville's writing is hard to put down once started because it flows seamlessly and causes one to lose himself; engrossing it is. Why four stars and not five ... I don't know, it just stuck me that way. But, with a little nudging I could be pushed into a five-star rating. It's more me being a curmudgeon than Banville's tale not being a five-star read."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"The Book of evidence is a dark, deep novel following the narrator, Freddie Montgomery, as he tells the reader about the events leading up to him being arrested for the pointless murder of a servant girl. Freddie is described as an experienced, quite sophisticated 38-year-old with questionable morality. He is a former scientist who has been living abroad for a long time but now returns to his family home seeking money after getting into trouble with debts. His mother has sold the collection of paintings that Freddie thought of as the one thing with value from his home, so he tries to find them and recover them. This is the trigger that makes all the bad things happen, climaxing in him killing the girl, who was a servant in the home that Freddie tried to steal one of the paintings from. He then escapes in the house of a family friend named Charlie but is eventually arrested. The novel ends in the same way as it starts - with Freddie sitting in jail thinking about the series of events leading up to him landing in prison. This summary of the book can also be more briefly described with Freddie's own words, \\"My lord, when you ask me to tell the court in my own words, this is what I shall say.\\" (p. 3, The Book Of Evidence, John Banville)When reading the novel, I immediately think of it as raw, poetic and with a great amount of philosophy woven into it. Banville's style of writing is spare but still very expressive and you can feel the psychological penetration that is used to suck you in as a reader. Banville must have a burning interest for philosophy and poetry as it is reflected so well in his writing style. \\"He was my friend. Such a simple phrase, and yet how affecting. I don't think I have ever used it before. When I wrote it down I had to pause, startled.\\" (p. 33, Banville) Given the book is philosophical and in many ways ambiguous and interpretative, it leads you into speculative thinking.It is not clear if Freddie is entirely sane or not, but there is not a lot of signs of empathy or feelings at all in the narration and if you murder someone cold-bloodedly without feelings of guilt or remorse, you could get the sense that he is a psychopath or a schizophrenic. It could be that Freddie is talking about himself when he in the novel says, \\"Madmen do not frighten me, or even make me uneasy. Indeed, I find that their ravings soothe me. I think it is because everything, from the explosion of a nova to the fall of dust in a deserted room, is to them of vast and equal significance, and therefore meaningless.\\" (p. 94, Banville)Freddie also has the name of \\"Bunter\\" for his \\"other self\\", which you can interpret as being his other personality, also a sign of him being a schizophrenic. But still, I don't think that he is schizophrenic or a psychopath. Freddie strikes me instead of a perfectly sane human, who in a state of moral decay does something that any of us, given on the circumstances of course, could do. I think that Freddie's other self, Bunter, came to life in him so that he didn't have to feel the regret and the probable anxiety that he feel about the killing and the other things in his life that he wasn't proud of. It was \\"Bunter\\" who did the bad things, it was also Bunter who was fat. We get introduced to Bunter in the beginning of Freddie's story as his \\"fat\\" self, \\"Yes, m'lud, you see before you a middling man inside whom there is a fattie trying not to come out. For he was let slip once, was Bunter, just once, and look what happened.) Bunter comes back later in the novel, when Freddie doesn't want to feel the guilt that he feels and blames Bunter, his falling morals, for his faults.\\"But no, things were too far gonefor stopping. Perhaps that is the essence of my crime, of my culpability, thatI let things get to that stage, that I had not been vigilant enough, had not been enough of a dissembler, that I left Bunter to his own devices, and thus allowed him, fatally, to understand that he was free, that the cage door was open, that nothing was forbidden, that everything was possible.\\" (p. 151, Banville) I am sure that we all have a bunch of \\"Bunters\\" inside of us. To be able to kill someone you don't have to be mentally ill. Since the beginning of time, human beings have been the most dangerous creatures, the only breed that kill for fun. Freddie's arrogance (\\"I wanted my share of this richness, this gilded ease\\" p. 83, Banville) makes you disrespect him, but he is no monster, he is very much human, just like anybody else. That's what makes it so frightening and terrifying.As a \\"general reader\\" not used to read this kind of text that to me is intellectually academic and quite challenging, I still found Banville's novel to be surprisingly easy to follow and beautifully shaped. I enjoyed it and gave in to the artistic feel of it, its elegance and complexity of theme being interesting and new to my world. I respect Banville's visual language; he weaves all our senses into his text. The story becomes very much alive. \\"I pushed her away from me and swung the hammer in awide, backhand sweep. The force of the blow flung her against the door, and her head struck the window, and a fine thread of blood ran out of her nostril and across her cheek. There was blood on the window, too, a fan-shaped spray of tiny drops. She closed her eyes and turned her face away from me, making a low, guttural noise at the back of her throat. She put a hand up to her head just as I was swinging at her again, and when the blow landed on her temple her fingers were in the way, and I heard one of them crack, and I winced, and almost apologised. Oh! she said, and suddenly, as if everything inside her had collapsed, she slithered down the seat on to the floor.\\" (p. 114, Banville)The narration is Freddie's way to explain what happened, why he murdered the woman. He does plead guilty, but it is still important to him to how things happened. Freddie is almost too articulate, self-aware and amoral. But he is also more human and less monster, at least to me."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"I came back to Banville for one reason only; his writing is superb. This novel demonstrates his brilliance through a narrative filled with humor, evil, indifference and pathos. \\"The Book of Evidence\\" is just that. It is a document based upon the narrator's confession while in court. Banville uses this vehicle well in describing an almost everyman who without care seems to live his life as if he were just outside of it and looking in. Although thoughtful and careful while confessing, the narrator seems to leave those traits behind throughout his life as if he were passing through it. His relationships are all tenuous and leave him with nothing of which to hold on. His sanity slowly loses its grip as well via his inability to cope with reality through desperate actions he takes in hopes of remediating a debt which was in and of itself bereft of any thought. A great read with great lines from Banville once again."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"Freddie Montgomery, the unreliable narrator of John Banville's The Book of Evidence, bears a strong resemblance to Nabakov's Humbert Humbert in that they both are drawing the bars of their prison cells in their narratives. The inspiration for Humbert Humbert was the anecdote about an ape that was given charcoal and paper. He drew the bars of his cage, inspiring the creation of Humbert Humbert, the narrator of Lolita, and one of literature's greatest characters.Banville's Montgomery goes one step further, though. Montgomery's quest is one of identity, not unlike the outliers' in Cormac McCarthy's universe. \\"To do the worst thing, the very worst thing, that's the way to be free,\\" Freddie informs us. In this thinking, Freddie is not alone. After committing a gratuitous murder, Macbeth is alluded to as Freddie scrubs at a spot of blood that will not be washed away.Freddie's quest for freedom leads him to a conversion to Buddhism (awakened mind in Sanskrit) after his metamorphosis into a murderer is complete. In recognition of his awakening mind, after a police inspector queries Freddie: \\"Self-made man, is he, he said, is this Behrens?\\" Freddie's response is: \\"Oh inspector, I said, aren't we all,\\" a direct allusion to the Buddha's teachings on karma and self.As is the case with Humbert Humbert, the reader is not quite sure how to take Freddie's story. With a tall glass of skepticism, to be sure. But it's difficult to completely dismiss the outlandishness that defines an outlier, as most should be able to identify some element of truth in them and their actions.And that uncertainty, like Humbert Humbert, or Raskolnikov (Freddie's post homicide feverishness owes a debt to the protagonist of Crime and Punishment), or Cormac McCarthy's universe of outliers on a quest for identity, is what makes The Book of Evidence ring true."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"the story reminded me of agatha christie's book title 'murder is easy'. the book is about an upper class indolent man - freddie. he has come back to ireland from the mediterranean island that he has made his home. he has to raise money to return to the leader of a violent gang of criminals whom he has cheated. his wife and son are still at the island.while trying to rob a painting from a neighbour, he is interrupted by a house maid, whom he murders.freddie's narrative is full of ambiguities - is he homosexual or not? does he love his wife and son or not? does he hate his mother who has taken to living with a stable girl after freddie's father dies? did he mean to kill the girl? can a well educated upper class man show such bestiality to another human being? the murder was unplanned and was not traced for a while- is murder so easy? is it only the police and the legal system that is to be dealt with after a murder and not one's conscience? are all the amorous exploits which freddie recounts normal, if there is no moral frame work?the ease with which freddie recounts the murder as well as his darkest, innermost secrets to the judge, forms the entire book. the narrative is dark, the contrast with everyday events is chilling, a masterly tale by banville."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"The plot is a bit plodding, but I don't think intricacy was the author's intent. Mr. Banville is wonderful with words and metaphor, and does a good job describing the many contradictions of a man searching for a reason to be."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"I really dislike it when publishers put too much information on the back of book, outlining too much of a plot from the get-go. I prefer to let plots unfold naturally while reading, and while it is established pretty early on in the book that Freddie is in jail following a sinister crime, we don't read about the act until after 100 pages or so. Banville is more concerned about the man than the crime. He is guilty; Freddie will let no one misunderstand that about him. But why does he do such horrendous things? Why does anyone? Does anyone really know what they are capable of? This novel reminded me in some ways of Richard Wright's \\"Native Son\\" in that the protagonist is not a sympathetic character in a lot of ways. He's not a good man. But... there is something else there, something that makes the reader care about him and his motives, even while shaking a castigating finger at him at the same time. I really liked the way Banville told this story, through the use of an ongoing monologue, with almost no dialogue whatsoever. It's like Freddie is sitting across the table from us, talking to us as a trusted friend, confessing his secrets and shame and accepting the consequences. While the peripheral characters are not clearly defined, we do get a clear picture of the main character, and that is the point. This is the world from the point of view of a man who one day finds himself in the role of criminal. Banville captured this eerily well. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Book Of Evidence","review":"John Banville is a little too clever for his own -- that is, for his main character's -- good. His writing is so full of excoriating, corruscating (to use a couple of adjetives he'd probably like) English cynicism (yes, I know he's Irish, but the Irish intelligentsia have adopted more British sensibilities than they'd probably care to admit) that his character's occasional attempts to show some humanity are painful in a way I don't thnk the author intended. That is, they're ridiculous. This is often a problem in first-person narratives where the voice is extremely sardonic. Read it for the voice alone, don't try to think of it as &quot;Dostoevskian,&quot; and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Not Nominated: Movie Posters (The Illustrated History of Movies Through Posters Series)","review":"After a long delay, the latest volume in the Hershenson-Allen behemoth series of movie poster books, &quot;Not Nominated,&quot; is finally here.This latest enterprise, in my mind, can truly be called, without apologies, a &quot;reference&quot; volume, possessing qualities consistent with what I associate to be the purest definition of what this word is supposed to mean.The critical aspects are these: Beyond printing each &quot;year&quot; on the vertical edges of each page, this volume isn't all about images. It lists Oscar winners. It lists every film that was nominated for Best Picture. It illustrates, in wonderful color, posters of films that in most cases, were ROBBED of a Best Picture nomination. But the editors keep going. They list &quot;honorable mentions,&quot; a concession that the panelists on its selection committee (for which I was honored to be a member), did not always agree with the choices that ended up in your book.I'm conceited when it comes to Oscar. I'm a professional writer who happens to be an amateur film historian, who, in 1972, was a winner in the San Diego Union-Tribune's Academy Award history contest, having studied this subject obsessively, watching every Oscar telecast since 1962. So it's obvious why I would disagree with my fellow panelists on a number of selections, and in such cases, why it was a lousy feeling to see some of my choices &quot;overruled&quot; and put into the &quot;Honorable Mention&quot; category, or worse, not even listed at all. Yet the selection process was completely fair.Some choices were obvious and expected, e.g., &quot;Singin' in the Rain,&quot; &quot;The Third Man,&quot; &quot;The General,&quot; &quot;Queen Christina,&quot; &quot;City Lights,&quot; &quot;Pinocchio,&quot; &quot;North by Northwest,&quot; &quot;Rear Window,&quot; &quot;Some Like it Hot,&quot; &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany's,&quot; &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; and &quot;2001.&quot;But some choices were baffling. How can anyone, for example, leave off films like &quot;The Seven Year Itch (1955),&quot; &quot;Duck Soup (1933),&quot; &quot;National Velvet (1944),&quot; &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945),&quot; &quot;Black Narcissus (1947),&quot; &quot;Key Largo (1948),&quot; &quot;The Miracle Worker (1962),&quot; &quot;Two for the Road (1967),&quot; &quot;A Man and A Woman (1966),&quot; &quot;Glory (1989),&quot; &quot;The Commitments (1992),&quot; &quot;Fearless (1993),&quot; &quot;Dead Man Walking (1995)&quot; or &quot;Three Kings (1999)?&quot;And some selections, forgive me, were overrated. What's a film like &quot;Dracula&quot; doing in there? &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; yes, but has anyone tried to sit through &quot;Dracula&quot; in its original, un-musically scored version without unintentionally laughing? A film that stands the test of time does so without falling back on the post of the technical limitations of any era. Is the monetary value of the film's poster and/or its standing as an iconic title greater than the merits of good old-fashioned story telling? Dracula is a classic, but a Best Picture nominee it wasn't, nor should it have been, any more than &quot;Blazing Saddles,&quot; despite my tremendous affection for the latter.What about &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; over &quot;Pillow Talk?&quot; &quot;How to Murder Your Wife&quot; over &quot;The Flight of the Phoenix&quot; or even &quot;Cat Ballou?&quot; &quot;A Funny Thing Happened to the Way to the Forum&quot; over Billy Wilder's &quot;The Fortune Cookie?&quot; Perhaps the worst was seeing the ponderous &quot;Far From the Madding Crowd&quot; selected over Stanley Donen's underrated &quot;Two for the Road&quot; and &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; knocking off Bogdanovich's enchanting, &quot;Paper Moon.&quot; And the panelists who, in apparently sufficient numbers, were responsible for putting garbage like &quot;Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls&quot; even on the &quot;Honorable Mention&quot; list deserve 50 lashes with an well-oiled, leather whip.Debating cinema as art (as opposed to posters) makes for great fun, and this is why this book is worth buying and talking about. But I was most happy with four selections in particular that were associated with the agonizing process the editors' chose to make this book historically credible.The first was Ernst Lubitsch's &quot;The Shop Around the Corner (1940),&quot; that wall-to-wall Margaret Sullavan-James Stewart howler that still holds up as being done one of the greatest romantic comedy films from Hollywood's Golden Age. The second was &quot;Say Anything (1989),&quot; writer Cameron Crowe's first directorial effort. The third was Terence Malick's haunting &quot;Days of Heaven (1978).&quot; But the fourth, the one that brought the most joy, was the panel's selection of David Lean's wonderful 1945-46 collaboration with Noel Coward, &quot;Brief Encounter (1946).&quot; I can only count on one hand the number of people I know out here on the West Coast who have seen this near perfect 86-minute film. Yes, I disagreed with some of the choices, but this particular selection confirmed that the editors did their homework in their efforts to create a credible cross section of non-Hollywood industry historians to join their &quot;jury.&quot; I applaud them for selecting this movie despite the higher profile titles released the same year, such as &quot;Gilda,&quot; which even though was among my selections, I was only mildly disappointed to see &quot;missing the cut.&quot; The latter is high grade &quot;B&quot; material compared to &quot;Brief Encounter.&quot;Moreover, I applaud the editors for assembling one of the finest pictorial books ever published about Oscar history, featuring posters associated with films that were shamefully overlooked by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Admittedly, not all of the posters feature great art, but the point is to document history. I hope there will be a second volume featuring the films that at least made &quot;honorable mention.&quot; For this first volume (which no one in publishing history has ever done in terms of subject matter), panelists were limited to listing just five &quot;losing&quot; films each year. But we know that some years it was feast or famine in terms of quality.Combining great images with great history, if Hershenson and Allen continue to keep the quality as great as this, they'll be publishing forever, and not just to the narrow band of hard core movie poster collectors who DON'T make up the greater body of book buyers in America."},{"Title":"Voices into Choices: Acting on the Voice of the Customer","review":"As a Research Fellow with the Procter &amp; Gamble I purchased over 200 copies of this to provide a training framework for our people in Product Development positions worldwide who have responsibilities for understanding, and more importantly effectively translating the consumer's desires into breakthrough products.

Its renderings of the human figure are cartoonish, and no instructions for esoteric closures and construction are provided.However, the Holkeboer directed her opus toward the theatrical costumer: an individual who must cobble together a volunteer staff, construct garments for modern bodies, and adapt to quick-changes between scenes. The patterns are necessarily basic; the cuts are nearly authentic; and the suggestions of embellishment design save the costumer much time. This book is not some tome to be displayed on a shelf; it belongs in the studio, its spine creased, its cover dog-eared, and its pages scribbled with measurements and notes. This book is a workhorse. An added bonus is its illustrative use of labels for describing many weird terms, among them: simar, barbette, picadils.I have found in no other book of scaled patterns but this one, the instructions for THREE methods of enlargement: optical projection, grid method, and radial projection. This book also includes headgear, specialty costumes like kimono, ecclesiastical garb, and a LION! This book also prevides a wonderful equity of both men's and women's clothing which is unfortunately not represented in the body of dramatic literature. (Why are there so few women's roles? But I digress.)The introduction and final chapter contain essential information on fitting and draping (remember: you must add your own seam allowances) and millinery and corsetry. I'd have given this book another star if I felt that it did justice to constructing corsets -- these items are too complex to build from Holkeboer's 1/8&quot; = 1&quot; scale. But she is absolutely correct in providing undergarment patterns if only to emphasize that they are necessary for achieving a true period look. Also, this book needs either a durable sewn or spiral binding to lie flat for usage. The glued softcover is impractical.This book cannot function as the only book in a costumer's library; supplement your collection with costume books on period styles to achieve variety in design. As far as PfTC being indispensible to a costume shop, I don't recommend buying a copy of this book; buy TWO!"},{"Title":"Patterns for Theatrical Costumes: Garments, Trims, and Accessories from Ancient Egypt to 1915","review":"This book is the most comprehensive, single-volume collection of historical patterns (from Ancient Egypt through 1915) available today for men's and women's costumes. While the pattern designs are very simplistic, present little detail on closures or embellishments and present only general instructions on construction, they are functional and very easy to make, represent nearly authentic cuts and effectively achieve the intended essential look for their specific period.Each pattern in the book is presented in three sizes, and for each individual piece of a complete garment a label is often attached, giving its historical name and a brief description of its appearance or use. As a bonus, patterns for specialty costumes (fantasy, religious, Chinese, Japanese, and animals), undergarments, hats, wigs and masks are included, and its Introduction explains, in a step-by-step format, costuming techniques such as enlarging patterns, fitting designs, and draping.This book can also serve, with just a little imagination, as an infinite source of ideas to help you create your own patterns, although you will have to refer to other books on period specific costumes to give your work finishing details like ornaments, trims, and other accessories.The only weak point of the book is its glued soft-cover binding, which is completely inadequate for the spine-creasing use to which it's sure to be subjected.If you either work for the theater or just enjoy making your own costumes, you will find this book to be an indispensable part of your library.--Reviewed by M.

Volmar"},{"Title":"Patterns for Theatrical Costumes: Garments, Trims, and Accessories from Ancient Egypt to 1915","review":"I have to agree with the other reviews, this book is great for Halloween costumes, general period silhouette, and for the novice costumer. Instructions are not included, and seam allowance is not included in the patterns. Patterns are 1/8 scale unless otherwise noted (so they must be enlarged), and in sizes S-M-L (But I question the grading).I teach Period Costuming from this book, and as a instructor, this book can be extremely frustrating at times.The illustrations that accompany each era's patterns do not always reflect the pattern pieces.My students enlarge these patterns by hand or take them to Kinko's to enlarge. As a patternmaking instructor, I give the patterns from this book a \\"C\\" grade. The patterns are not trued, seam lines are not walked, and skirt, bodice and sleeve patterns are not balanced. My students spend as much time correcting these patterns as they would starting from scratch with a set of blocks.But it is a great instruction tool showing differences in silhouette and cut over the centuries."},{"Title":"Patterns for Theatrical Costumes: Garments, Trims, and Accessories from Ancient Egypt to 1915","review":"I've been a costume designer for over 25 years. 18 years ago I picked up a copy of this book. Little did I know what a Godsend it would be to me over the years. This book is great for the costume designer, who has a small budget, a big cast, a flaky volunteer crew, and a month to put together a peroid show. This book is to be used and doggear with a broken spine. I costume six to ten shows a year, and this book is always at my side. The simple drawings give directors a quick idea of the period, the patterns are amazing and easy to draft.I will often times give my costume interns a copy of this book for a going away present. It is an invaluable resource. One warning, it is not for the picky historical reinactors. This book is for the &quot;down and dirty&quot; theatrical costumer."},{"Title":"Patterns for Theatrical Costumes: Garments, Trims, and Accessories from Ancient Egypt to 1915","review":"A good book to use as a starting point in the building of costumes. It gives great detail on how create masks, millinary, drafting a pattern, radiating a pattern and so on. Gives a good basic idea of the styles for specific periods and the names of the different pieces. The historical accuracy is also very good too. Nice variations on how to give a different shape to sleeves, and hems and decorative borders that are accurate for the period. I have created sucessfully the early 16th and 17th century costumes as well as early mantles. Sizing is not always true to modern sizes and some adjusting may be neccessary. I really enjoy this book and it is often the first place I look in getting ideas for a new costume.Stephanie Carrig"},{"Title":"Patterns for Theatrical Costumes: Garments, Trims, and Accessories from Ancient Egypt to 1915","review":"I chose 4 stars for this because it Should come either spiral bound or with some other plastic binding. I ended up takeing it in to OfficeMax and get it bound with spiral binding. The binding it comes with would not allow the book to lay flat on a photocopier. I could not get a accurate copy, and therefore 800% was not giving me a true shape. However other than the binding this book is great, it is Just patterns though, no assembly instructions. The more complicated pages would be easy for a intermediate, and the simple underclothes would be a great starting project for a beginner. I would buy this again, you get great value for your money, even if you end up getting it bound (binding cost me about 5 dollers). This book would be great for any one; Teachers, theatre costume people, SCA garb, Halloween, ect."},{"Title":"Patterns for Theatrical Costumes: Garments, Trims, and Accessories from Ancient Egypt to 1915","review":"I recently discovered that I had lost this pattern book (probably loaned to someone who also loved the book) and just couldn't do without it.

We work in the amateur theatre industry, mainly dealing with period costume. Often we are called on to create some garment from a particular period and we usually run straight to this book to get our ideas. I especially like the fact that it shows costumes from SO MANY periods in history. Anything else wirtten by this author, I would buy without hesitation."},{"Title":"Patterns for Theatrical Costumes: Garments, Trims, and Accessories from Ancient Egypt to 1915","review":"This book was very detailed and contained helpful information. While a begining sewer probably would not be able to scale the patterns up correctly, a seasoned sewer shouldn't have any trouble. If nothing else, you can use this as a refferance comparing modern patterns to their originals. This even contains a section on making corsets, wigs (the fake-looking kind, tinsel for example) and masks! Great buy, I love it!"},{"Title":"Patterns for Theatrical Costumes: Garments, Trims, and Accessories from Ancient Egypt to 1915","review":"This simple book is the ultimate on basic construction in period costumes for the stage from ancient Egypt to the early 20th century. This goes through history and shows for each look the following: male and female sketch of the final costume, labels that name important parts of the costume, undergarments (where relevant), scale patterns on each piece shown (except some hats), decorative patterns to help with the selection of trims, and instructions on how to wear (when needed). There is also a section on pattern drafting and draping methods, sizing, millinery (hat making), and special costume pieces (hats, wigs, corset sizing, animal faces, masks).My book is worn and torn though I care for my books like some people do fine china. It is the most useful reference for a costumer, and as a designer, it is important to see what goes behind a design. The designs cover a narrow enough amount of time to show distinct and fairly subtle changes, while remaining general enough to give the feel of an era, but allow complete creative license. (And think of how much you save by not buying dozens of patterns, many of which lack the accuracy for shape found in this book!)"},{"Title":"Patterns for Theatrical Costumes: Garments, Trims, and Accessories from Ancient Egypt to 1915","review":"I have not tried to use the patterns, but I know this book is a textbook for a historical costume class so it must be good."},{"Title":"Patterns for Theatrical Costumes: Garments, Trims, and Accessories from Ancient Egypt to 1915","review":"The problem with this book that images are cartoonish, and you MUST have a decent amount of sewing experience to use it. That being said, it DOES say it's for theatrical costumes so one can presume that the costume master/mistress has the experienced needed to full appreciate this book as a resource.I used this book to help design all the garb for my 1990 wedding at a Ren Fair, and was not disappointed. I bought this as a gift to my teenaged daughter, an avid costumer. She's enjoying it too."},{"Title":"Patterns for Theatrical Costumes: Garments, Trims, and Accessories from Ancient Egypt to 1915","review":"I am a medieval reenactor and I found this book to be perfect for me! However I am not the best seamstress, so I found the patterns a little difficult to follow. But using this book as my guide I was able to find the correct styles, accessories, and designs that were used in very specific time frames. It lists every time frame and many regions so no matter what your looking for in costume design you will find it here. If you are a knowledgable seamstress you'll get a lot out of it!"},{"Title":"Patterns for Theatrical Costumes: Garments, Trims, and Accessories from Ancient Egypt to 1915","review":"This is my favorite pattern inspiration book. It does just what it says it does, which is to give you the basics upon which to build your own inspired designs. When I think of an item and cannot think how it might be constructed, nine times out of ten this book will give me a way to figure out the answer.This book isn't for someone looking for patterns to use correctly, but those looking to make their own patterns. I highly recommend it to that purpose."},{"Title":"Patterns for Theatrical Costumes: Garments, Trims, and Accessories from Ancient Egypt to 1915","review":"No matter how many costume books I look at, I always end up with this one.

It doesn't require a lot of experience in pattern drafting, but you'll do better if you have done some drafting--or at least some pattern alterations. If you're looking for detail and authenticity, go to Janet Arnold or Norah Waugh."},{"Title":"Patterns for Theatrical Costumes: Garments, Trims, and Accessories from Ancient Egypt to 1915","review":"This is a good basic costume pattern book.

It covers the major design trends over a wide historical range of time. The individual pattern pieces are well drawn and labelled and clearly specify the placement on the fold or the edge of the fabric. The costumes are straightforward to make but maintain the authentic line and shape of each period without the myriad details that deter many would-be sewers. Each accompanying illustration of the finished costume has helpful hints for appropriate accessories and trims to allow for creativity. The drawings and instructions on how to drape, fold and wrap long lengths of fabric are very clear and helpful, particularly for Ancient Egyptian, Greek and Roman garments. A copier can enlarge the drawings to size, but I have found my home enlarger is perfect for the job. I highly recommend this book for those who want authentic looking costumes without the complicated and frustrating time-consuming sewing details. The results are comfortable for the modern wearer. It is also just fun to look through."},{"Title":"Patterns for Theatrical Costumes: Garments, Trims, and Accessories from Ancient Egypt to 1915","review":"This book is an excellent resource for basic period costumes. It is relatively easy to copy the patterns onto a grided template, as long as you can use graft paper. If you are looking for historically acurate information, you will want to use other resources in conjuction. Also, if you are a begining sewer, this will not give you the how-to directions, but as far as pattern books go, this is a good one!"},{"Title":"Patterns for Theatrical Costumes: Garments, Trims, and Accessories from Ancient Egypt to 1915","review":"This book does not attempt to provide patterns for exact reconstructions of historical garments. However, for the theatrical person or someone just getting into more serious historical costume, this is a good place to start. The patterns provided are not traditional sized patters, so it assumes the ability to draft and adapt a basic pattern shape. The patterns given (at least for the medieval period) do give results which duplicate the basic looks of the period, without introducing some of the grevious errors of many books of this type. It's meant for practical use, so its usefulness as a research resource for documentation of a particular style is limited."},{"Title":"Patterns for Theatrical Costumes: Garments, Trims, and Accessories from Ancient Egypt to 1915","review":"This book is wonderful, although basic knowledge of garment construction is required.

You may have to do a bit of improvising, and it may be a bit time consuming enlarging the patterns, it's best for quick costume construction. Major alterations may be needed to create incredibly historical costumes."},{"Title":"Patterns for Theatrical Costumes: Garments, Trims, and Accessories from Ancient Egypt to 1915","review":"Basic tailoring, garment construction, and pattern drafting skills are recommended when using this book, as stated in its Forward. That said, it's a useful tool that simplifies the designs of a given period and suggests possible variations and embellishments on that theme, persuant to creating basic and/or theatrical costumes. I found the 1/8th &amp; 1/16th scale patterns very easy to use."},{"Title":"Patterns for Theatrical Costumes: Garments, Trims, and Accessories from Ancient Egypt to 1915","review":"The drawings in this book are amazing. I think this book is probably for a very experienced dressmaker because there are no individual instructions for each piece and a lot of fitting knowledge is required.

It's good for getting a feel for the silhouette of the period and some insight into pattern shapes--I haven't used the patterns inside because they have no scale or instructions. Some accessories are also shown.

I have FOUND my answer by reading this book. It isn't magic, it isn't &quot;hocus-pocus&quot;, it is identifying ME in my world, and taking a year to re-discover what makes me tick, what made me dream, what made me ME so many years ago. In the process, I'm already becoming a better mother, wife, friend, &quot;employee&quot; ... A MUST READ!

As a wife, full-time working mother of a four year old and all around self-inflicted super woman, I had a &quot;sense&quot; that a small part of me (okay a huge part) was slowly drowning in that turbulent sea we call everyday life. I trusted &amp; loved my mother enough that if she felt it was important to give this book to me - than perhaps I better read it. I couldn't have anticipated the amazing transformation my soul would undergo. Through reading this book I was given the tools to find a center again that was in me, rather than outside of myself. I have a renewed anticipation of the wonders my life has to offer me. I have now purchased four copies to give to my closests friends, including my mother. I truly feel that it is that crucial and rewarding for all women to read this book.If you THINK you need to regain your spirit at the start of this book you'll KNOW you need to by the end.Be prepared to have a few good crys and to have a weight lifted from your shoulders, namely the world.

She says some women might just want to rest! The Gift of a Year is just a great book to get you enthused about what you can do with your life in an easy, everyone can do it, sort of way.

It is suitable for any woman, any age, because who hasn't asked themselves \\"What do I do next?\\" Ms. Kirschenbaum guided me to the answer - the one that was exactly right for me and I have no doubt she can do it for anyone at any time in their life. This year, I turned 50, closed a store I had in Michigan for 6 years, saw my son (age 19)go off to college at NYU and was helping my daughter (age 17) prepare for a summer internship in Marine Biology in Eleuthera, Bahamas, followed by a year abroad through FSU in Panama City, Panama. My babies flew the coop and for the first time ever, I had no plans in my life. I searched for all the empty nest syndrome books I could find, but not one of them seemed exactly right for me. I don't have that syndrome. I just didn't know what I wanted to do with the \\"second half\\" of my life. I had already had my career writing and editing for newspapers, raised the kids, worked at a bookstore before opening my own and now what? I always liked to create with arts,crafts, etc., but had no time to do it while running a store. Enter The Gift of a Year - approximately two chapters into this gem of a book, I decided...I was going to spend my year creating one thing every day. It might be artwork, an article of clothing, or simply cupcakes! In that instant my attitude changed and I became alive again. I bought a notebook in case I thought or heard of something profound that I wanted to save, I made a new salad recipe from the tomatoes in my backyard and then...I passed the book on to my friend who is in much the same situation. I insisted she take the time to read it, skim it and even offered to have her sit back and I would read it to her...she is that stressed. So, my eternal thanks to Ms. Kirchenbaum for giving me the insight to look forward to the next however many years I have and I now rise with gratitude for the next twenty-four hours I have upon me.

First, she really articulates how it is that women (this book is directed to women - though I'd love to see the guys get one of their own) can easily find themselves feeling as if they are not really present in their own lives. Even the most fortunate and grateful among us (that would be me) can wind up with that \\"Is that all there is?\\" feeling, and wondering how that could be. But even better, she shows you how to get to the solution...your solution is unique as you are, and, and least in my case, was amazingly easy to find. Seriously, within hours I went from feeling like I was sort of plodding through a lot of my life, to knowing exactly how to give myself the energy and passion I was craving.I love how the author addresses challenges that are very common for women without any \\"poor us\\" victim language. This is a down to earth, practical, \\"Let's get this problem solved\\" approach that is amazingly powerful.I am SO grateful to have found this. I've given four copies to friends (so far)."},{"Title":"The Gift of a Year: HT Achieve Most Meaningful Satisfying Pleasurable Year your Life","review":"Sometimes it just takes a year to regain one's self.

This is no dry textbook: the author obviously has a deep passion for his subject matter and a natural gift for storytelling, both of which come across in an easily readable, almost breezy prose style. In an interwoven series of stories of greed, arrogance and shady dealings &#65533; some well known, like Enron and WorldCom, others not so well known - the author gives even the novice a comprehensible education in computer forensics and accounting concepts without \\"dumbing down\\" or oversimplifying these topics. Though the techniques used by the investigators and described in this book reflect the state of the art at the time the investigations were conducted, the human weaknesses and strengths that underlie the use of technology both to perpetrate and uncover misconduct are timeless, and they are ultimately the real subject matter of this fine book. For what it has to say, and for way in which the author tells these stories, this book ought to be required introductory reading on college campuses and in business and law schools. In fact, anyone who is interested in real-life crime drama, in computer and software technology and high-tech sleuthing, or in the rise and fall of the \\"dot-com/dot-gone\\" economy, will enjoy this book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The New Forensics: Investigating Corporate Fraud and the Theft of Intellectual Property","review":"A must read for everybody in the corrupt world we live in today. It influences everyone of us.The book gave me, the man on the street, an insight into the investigation of forensic auditors into corporate criminal activities. It was a real eye-opener to see to what extremes mankind will go to satisfies his greed. The way in which it is done is not only clever, it really is brilliant in its simplicity. But for the forensic investigators to reveal these frauds are even more brilliant.Joe Anastasi explains how the forensic investigators use modern technology to uncover corporate fraud in a way even I, an illiterate in this field of work, can understand. For the first time I comprehend some of the work, pressure and ultimate excitement of tracking down the criminals.The book reads like a suspense thriller, the most scary part is, it is real life and not fiction!"},{"Title":"The New Forensics: Investigating Corporate Fraud and the Theft of Intellectual Property","review":"A real page turner! I loved this book! I thought it would be dry and technical, but it was surprisingly accessible. It was very breezy. A fun and very informative read.Thanks to Joe Anastasi for writing this book.

This timely narrative captures the real life world of high stakes forensic investigators as they try to unravel webs of corporate deceit. This is a must read for any one curious about today's financial headlines, what they really mean and the excesses of the Board Room."},{"Title":"The New Forensics: Investigating Corporate Fraud and the Theft of Intellectual Property","review":"Security literature is filled with titles on procedures, processes, and details of performing forensic investigations. Despite its title, this book is not another one. Equal parts autobiography, mystery, biography, and action thriller, the book is an overview of the cases and characters with which the author, a forensic investigator at Deloitte and Touche, has been involved.In chapter after chapter, the reader receives a high-level view of the tools and technologies used in forensic investigations, then learns the inner workings of specific corporate frauds. These cases range from garden-variety frauds to cybercrime.One fascinating chapter explores the disposition of a bank account dormant since the Holocaust and how forensic investigators cracked the case 60 years after the fact. It describes how a large group of investigators went to Switzerland to determine the beneficiaries of dormant World War II-era Swiss bank accounts. The chapter details methodology used to retrieve documents and to discover what was hidden and who was entitled to it.Geared for management-level readers without much technical background, the book spares the reader byte-by-byte details on forensic evidence gathering and handling. Story after story gives readers a very accessible account of how investigators detected fraud, misuse, and a wide range of other corporate criminality. With its real-life drama, the book is both an enjoyable and instructive read."},{"Title":"The New Forensics: Investigating Corporate Fraud and the Theft of Intellectual Property","review":"I found this a very good book, strong in fact and obviously fictionalised for legal reasons in others.

The style of writing allows you to go inside the minds of corporate fraud offenders. In order to do the crime it fosters accomplices along the way. The amazing thread is that the criminals have their scheme planned out but they forget one critical element, there's always someone that can find the trail that's left behind. Computer fingerprints.

In the format for a novel, the author took me on an exciting and informative ride in the world of corporate forensic investigation."},{"Title":"The New Forensics: Investigating Corporate Fraud and the Theft of Intellectual Property","review":"I loved this book! I knew absolutely nothing about forensic accounting, and never thought I'd want to.

But that is not the only issue here. First, the subject is supposed to be investigating corporate fraud. As another reviewer noted, however, the only subject covered is computer techniques. The actual tracking of the fraud never really appears in any detail. I was expecting a tale of actual processes and insights into actual crimes; however, the book stops short at the recovery of information from computers. The interesting part would be how one piece of info leads to another and suggests other places to look. But nothing is looked at that closely, so the excitement is lost. I also agree with the other reviewer that the relevance of the dog-mauling case is tangential at best. Even in chapters with strong subject matter, such as the investigation of the swiss handling of jewish acounts, the prose is lifeless and conclusory; it does not follow the trail of the adventure."},{"Title":"The New Forensics: Investigating Corporate Fraud and the Theft of Intellectual Property","review":"First of all, I expected this to be more about investigating fraud than about pulling apart computers for use as evidence. I don't think it is, but I'm not sure. I didn't finish the book.I lost patience after about three chapters. In the Forward, the author explains that much of the book is \\"fictionalized.\\" He explains that he started with a few names, and that led to dates, places, events ... I found myself wondering whether this shouldn't just be treated as fiction.Unfortunately, it's not very compelling as fiction either. After devoting the first several chapters to the travel, lifestyle, and hardware concerns of a fictional computer forensics team descending on the offices of some fictional executives, the author delivered what I assume is a somewhat fictionalized account of the California dog mauling case that was in the headlines several years ago, but only at the periphery of my attention. I'm not sure why the author goes there. I think it's because one of the documents used in the case -- the author implies it was an important one but it seems fairly tangential -- was first found on a computer.Maybe it comes together later.

Some will recognise similarities between this review and my review of volumes one and three. This is because the authors have retained the same, quite excellent, format - only the names of the ships are different. Whereas others might have listed the ships across those 3 books by period (for example, the 50 earliest ships in volume one and so forth), these books benefit from having a cross section of early and later vessels in each tome. In this way we have another selection of some of the greatest passenger ships of all time.From the Savannah of 1819 to the Shalom of 1964, Braynard and Miller combine to bring another 50 ships back to life by providing a short and fascinating story for each ship. Complimented with historic photographs - many of which do not appear to have been previously published, this is a very good product. Whilst I have seen many pictures of the fire which destroyed the Morro Castle, for example, there is a particularly telling image of the charred decks and scorched lifeboats still in their davits which I had not seen previously.The four-funnelled German ship Kaiser Wilhelm Der Grosse (King William the Great) is afforded a full 6 pages in which I found a particularly fascinating small detail. The idea for her creation (along with an overall expansion of the German Navy - both military and merchant) came after an official visit to the Spithead Review of the Royal Navy in 1889. With the mightiest display of warships in the world - all lined up in neat formation, the Kaiser was so impressed he ordered an immediate expansion of Germany's naval might just as soon as he returned home. How the history of Europe might have been so very different had he never been invited!Altogether, another extremely informative book and one which will provide those with an interest in the subject with considerable enjoyment as they work through the potted histories of each ship. From a research viewpoint, these books are essential additions to the library of any ship historian because they contain sufficient information - information you can trust!, about so many great ships. As such, they provide a ready reference source for those occasions when they need to digress from the main topic of one vessel and mention some factor or anecdote in connection with another.NM"},{"Title":"Fifty Famous Liners 2","review":"This contains information about 50 famous ocean liners.

It's the kind of books you read and then read again because they left you with a pleasant feeling at the end. Here is the synopsis:\\"Yolande's desperation knew no bounds. Up until now her life was as perfect as any princess in a storybook. A landed countess, blessed with beauty, intelligence and wealth, she lived in a magnificent castle on the edge of a dark, mysterious forest. But the fairy tale abruptly became a nightmare when she was promised in marriage to the Marquis de Montereau. Yolande had heard a great deal about the Marquis: he was the most notorious rake in all Paris. He might be willing to marry her for her estates, but he would never love her. Knowing she would rather die than wed a man she hardly knew and certainly despised, Yolande saw only one way to appraise her future bridegroom and resign herself to marriage. She would go to Paris impersonating a woman of less than perfect virtue. She would force the Marquis to love her as a woman-not as the owner of a priceless castle.\\"This is certainly not the typical heroine we find in Cartland novels: to begin with, she is rich. Secondly, although she is orphan, her grandmother is living with her and loves her (so there is no room for the I-need-to-escape-because-they-hate-me part). And in third place, she knew all about married men having mistresses because his father had one! And he told her about her, nevertheless!The books is full of interesting situations, is easy to read and keep on reading once you started it - not that finishing it will take that long. And it has a page, just one page, where I read what I have never have read before, nor I read after: he loses control and intends to take her by force! Why? Because he thought she lied when she told him that she loved him. The truth is that she was very sad he asked her to become his mistress when she thought their love was greater than life and he would want her as a wife - that's why she wasn't very enthusiastic of the plans of their future together.\\"\\"You are not playing with me? If you are - if you have lied about your love for me - I think I will kill you! Are you lying?\\" He was kissing her demandingly; his mouth held her captive as he picked her up in his arm and carried her through the curtains, then the Marquis threw her down in the low coach.\\"You are mine!

And in this coverage the unilaterally significant importance of those who bring us news and information has become even more apparent and poignant. Consider how much we would know if there were no newspapers or magazines, television, or computer? No word, but word of mouth. How much would we actually know?The burden and responsibility of being a bear of 'word' is awesome, not to be taken lightly or too seriously. Just taken. It cannot be black or white, there must be gray. It cannot be one dimensional, voices of all must be heard, considered, discarded, reviewed, discussed, concluded.In a book of 255 pages, Wayne Dawkins tells the shaping of America's history through heroes often unsung and maligned - this country's black disciples - the journalists. God is this book good.I sobbed over what Dawkins has taken the time to give us. Knowledge of who we are and how we were shaped and why. An easy read, however, like the blues and a smooth glass of wine, you find yourself wanting to savor the importance and humility and arrogance contained within these pages.Sorry if I gush. But in a world of reality tv, celebrity stalking, and other superficialities, as you read and reread this book (yes, I'm going to pick it up again) you begin to ponder the positive and negative role these writers and other journalists take positively and negatively shaping our world And more importantly the role we play or abdicate in this surreality.Truly a historical and underrated tome.

From the author's extensive use of letters and chronological events, a real man emerges. Lewis is not canonized and his very real struggles with loyalty to relationships which clearly wore him down give a broader perspective to his ability to write clearly even amidst chaos in his own life. Clarifications in regard to his relationship with the older woman \\"mento,\\" authors Tolkein and Williams, as well as his relationship with his brother and his wife Joy frame the developement of his mind in regard to his writings. In addition,the events surrounding the relationship with Joy Gresham are clearly discussed, which helps clarify several innacuracies found in the movie Shadowlands. The closing chapter is deeply moving and demonstrates the effect Lewis had on his students, especially those who did not share his faith."},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"I have a mixed relationship with biographies. They seem either deadly dull to me or become one of my favorite books. This one is one of the latter, and I couldn't hardly put it down. The author has an obvious command of not only Lewis's life but also the subjects of Lewis's expertise (and I love nerdery like nobody's business). I also liked very much that the author is present in the text (\\"I....\\")--nothing's more boring than a collection of facts, after all, and this gives the work a nicely personal feeling, like a lecture in a small room by a favorite professor."},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"This was a great book and very readable. Entertaining throughout, and teaches you a lot about the life of Lewis."},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"I sometimes wish I could do half-stars when rating products here, because I see 4 stars as \\"pretty darn good,\\" and 5 stars as \\"absolutely incredible.\\"The Narnian by Alan Jacobs is a spectacular book, but not without a few small flaws in my eyes.It took a little while for it to get interesting (though that may have been on my end as I'd just finished a sci-fi novel before starting this one), and early on I was annoyed by Jacobs' hypocrisy in analyzation of certain aspects of Lewis's early life. He first mentions how Lewis repeatedly insisted that his praying and wishing for the healing of his terminally ill mother when he was a young boy was NOT his first significant religious experience despite appearing so. Jacobs insists over and over that Lewis is either not being fully honest with us or with himself, because how could it not have been? That's annoying in its own way, because much of the book discusses how deeply self-analytical and self-critical Lewis was, especially in understanding his past; but then just a few pages later Jacobs insists that another Lewis biographer was in error or beyond his bounds when that biographer insisted that Lewis's harsh recounting of his father's personality was \\"merciless,\\" because not only did his brother, Warren Lewis, share the sentiments, but because Lewis would know better than we would. That also is the first appearance of several digs at other Lewis biographers, almost as if Jacobs feels he's in competition with them (which he may well be in some sense, I guess). The one he digs at the most (and is the one referenced a second ago) is A. N. Wilson. It does seem that Wilson was far off base with many of his conclusions about Lewis, but then I only know about them through Jacobs' words.But while he takes shots at other biographers, he also does a similar give-and-take on analysis of Lewis's writings. I'd be dishonest if I didn't say my favorite one of those was when he (Jacobs) completely tore apart and smashed author Philip Pullman's objections to the end of The Last Battle for being as ridiculous and unfounded as they are.Beyond those aspects, though, you have a thorough and engaging and honest narrative of the life of C.S. Lewis, all with the approach of understanding how his life influenced what he wrote. From the loss of his mother at a young age, to his relationships with his school masters and tutors, to his rocky relationship with his father, to his bond with his brother and an old neighbor, and on to the relationships he had with various dons at Oxford and members of the Inklings (Tolkien, Charles, Havard, etc.), as well as as much perspective as possible into his decades-long relationship with the mother of an old pre-WWI friend, Jane Moore, and into his life with his wife, Joy Gresham.Lewis is treated with reverence and respect in this biography, and while I get the feeling that Jacobs is also a Christian (enhanced by the fact that he's a professor at an American Christian college), he treats Lewis's Christianity objectively (though his diction is definitely that of someone who knows Christianity from within). After reading it, I have a deepened respect and understanding of this great author and thinker. Absolutely recommended."},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"This is how one writes a biography. It is warm, insightful, detailed, personable, readable, and wity. Golly, it is great! Readin conjunction with Gresham's \\"Jack's Life,\\" one may almost smell Lewis' pipe and hear his voice. I only hope the author will relent and write more on CSL."},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"Alan Jacobs is a professor of English at Wheaton College, where the largest collection of CS Lewis writings and correspondance has been assembled. So, in addition to the natural talent and warmth that Jacobs brings to the subject, he is also arguably better equipped in terms of access to the private correspondance of Lewis than any prior biographers, and this results in a book that is both riveting and revealing.The book itself is a refreshing look at a man who in my mind has been an enigma of the 20th century. American Evangelical Christians have elevated Lewis to almost a level of sainthood in large part because of the impact of his writings in the area of Christian Apologetics. This is despite the fact that most evangelicals would be hard pressed to acknowledge that CS Lewis would be questioned as to his fitness to occupy a pulpit due to his personal habits and relationships.While past biographies have (almost ironically) themselves become apologetic works defending the apologist, this work takes an approach that I found refreshing. Without diminishing Lewis' importance and impact upon 20th century Christianity, Lewis is seen both sympathetically but with a full acceptance of the conflicts within his life and development.Stylistically, rather than working through a purely chronological progression of his life, this biography takes Lewis' life in subsets or themes which works very well in highlighting the contrasts in particular areas of his life without the continual cross-referencing and returning to themes that a more traditional approach would entail.Overall, an excellent biography and opportunity for the reader to place Lewis the man into context, juxtaposed with his writings without ignoring or trying to rationalize away the complexities of who he was as opposed to all he wrote.5 starsBart Breen"},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"An excellent book!

His relationships with his father, his mother and her early death, his brother Warnie, Professor Kirk, Prof. Tolkien, the mysterious Minto, and Joy Gresham all have influenced in varying degrees his works, and Jacobs has done an excellent job connecting them to Lewis' writings. It was a very delightful and moving read as one gains some insight into a man whom many have admired since he began publishing his works. This book brings about a deeper respect for Lewis, his works in theology and apologetics, and his work in adult and children's literature. It is a must read for any student of Lewis, and any true friend of Narnia."},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"Jacobs' volume is a valuable contribution to Lewis studies; much more than a re-presentation of otherwise already well-known material. Written from a literary perspective; solid and highly readable (a nice combination). Informed and informative. Perhaps because of its particular focus, this book not quite as personally vivid a presentation as the Sayer or Green/Hooper biographies. It is conversational in style at times, but not gratingly so. Not hagiagraphy in either personal or literary senses. The only major drawback would be the format of the end-notes; neither numbered nor keyed to pages, but simply listed in order by chapters, they take much, much longer to check than other note forms. Good interaction with with other writers on Lewis as well as contemporary controversies on Lewis' writings. Definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"I received this CD set from my sister for Christmas, and having just recently listened to the WONDERFUL Chronicles of Narnia Audio Theatre productions by the Focus on the Family Radio Theatre company (PLEASE GET THEM - THEY ARE INCREDIBLE!), I was glad to get this CD set...although at about 9 CD's in length (and then seeing that it was abridged) I thought \\"Wow, that must be a long book\\".I wondered if it would be dry and stiff, yet Jacob's obvious VERY THOROUGH research (even quoting various books and authors that influenced Lewis so you can see what Lewis was referring too) moved along well, without being boring, or putting me to sleep.Matter of fact, I listened to them often after pulling some serious overtime and even though I have an hour drive home, this CD set kept me engrossed the entire time.If you like Lewis, or want to know more about this man and his life, or if you just like a true and detailed account of how God can reach, save, and use us, His creations, then this CD set is well worth the purchase."},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"Clives Staples Lewis (1898-1963)was born in Belfast to an Anglican family. His father Arthur was a lawyer; his mother died when CS and his brother Warnie were young. The boys were lonely and Lewis relied on imagination, reading and writing to spend his days.Lewis later became a soldier in World War I experiencing the horror of the trenches. He lives with the mother of one of his chums. Mrs. Moore (nicknamed \\"Minto\\" lived with him until herdeath. Lewis was a faithful attendant who cared for the womanmany years older than he.Lewis was an Oxford Don with a brilliant mind and a ready pen. He published over 35 books in his life including the classicNarnia books; \\"The Screwtape Letter\\"; \\"The Abolition of Man\\"\\"Mere Christianity (originally broadcast during World War II onthe BBC) and a series of science fictions novels. He wrote countless letters,essays and lectures. He is a great writer anda great Christian author in our age of skeptical disbelief.Lewis was influenced by the Inklings group of intellectuals who would meet weekly in Oxford. Such writes as Tolkien and Charles Williams influenced his style. Roman Catholic Tolkien helped in the conversion of Lewis.Alan Jacobs is a young scholar from Wheaton College who has written a good book on Lewis. Not only do we follow the life of this author but Jacobs delves into his beliefs (some of thismaterial will be hard to follow for a reader who has not delved into the Lewis books),The book was well worth the time, concentration and joy it took to read it."},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"I started reading Alan Jacobs's The Narnian under the impression that it was an intellectual biography. It is certainly that, but it also packs in a lot of traditional biographical information as well as a great chunk of literary biography. In other words, it's a far-ranging, well-rounded book on Lewis's life, imagination, and contributions to literature.Jacobs thoroughly covers Lewis's entire life and makes time for all of Lewis's literary and scholarly work. I had read Lewis's Surprised by Joy and to read a biographical account of the same events, without the pseudonyms for the terrible schools and teachers Lewis had, was enlightening. Jacobs also helps to fill in some of the gaps Lewis intentionally left in his autobiography, such as the events of his service in World War I. Jacobs does a very good job examining Lewis's growth as a person and a thinker and balancing it with the more traditional biographical material, such as places visited, friendships made, schools attended, books written, and relatives and friends lost. Whether he's looking into Lewis's life or imagination, Jacobs never loses track of either. It's an incredibly difficult task for the biographer of a person who spent so much time in \\"the life of the mind,\\" and Jacobs accomplishes it admirably.Having already been familiar with the outlines of Lewis's life and body of work, I especially appreciated The Narnian for two things--the time given to the difficult topic of Lewis's relationship with Mrs. Moore, the mother of a friend killed in World War I, and the sections spent on Lewis's excellent but less well-known scholarly work on medieval and renaissance literature. Mrs. Moore, with whom Lewis had a sketchy relationship prior to his conversion but whom he had vowed to look after in the event of his friend's death, has sometimes been used to slander Lewis. Jacobs provides--within the limits of our knowledge, since Lewis was notoriously tight-lipped about his duty toward her--great detail and context to the relationship and its development, especially in the aftermath of Lewis's conversion (Mrs. Moore was and apparently remained a staunch atheist).The sections on Lewis's scholarly works are especially good and should spur more people to read books like The Discarded Image or The Allegory of Love. Lewis's thinking on God, art, and literature were inextricably bound up with his love of medieval and renaissance literature, and discussion of his books on those topics is sadly lacking even among Lewis's fans and students today.The only problem I had with the book is minor--some of Jacobs's sentences are simply too complex and convoluted. You can get lost in them. The book by and large is an easy, brisk read but in perhaps one or two places per chapter his writing collapses under its own weight. Again, a minor problem, but one you should be aware of so you don't get discouraged when encountering it. A few reviewers have pointed out perceived problems with the book, such as Jacobs's supposed reliance on Wilson's flawed biography, but since Jacobs never quotes Wilson without correcting or totally discarding what Wilson has to say, I can hardly see the merit in this objection. Throughout the book Jacobs shows good critical sense in the treatment of his sources.If you're looking for a good introduction to Lewis's art and thinking I have to tell you to read Lewis first. But if you've already done so, this is an excellent place to start digging into the many layers of Lewis's imagination.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"Alan Jacob's write a very interesting book, normally one starts at the beginning of the life and ends with the person of interest's death. Not so for Mr. Jacob's here in \\"The Narnian\\" we are treated to a thematic and literary biography of Lewis. This means that chronology eventually takes a back seat to the story Jacobs is weaving.I commend to you George Sayer'sJack: A Life of C. S. Lewisas a straight forward biography written by a friend of Lewis'. But while Sawyer tells you about what happened to Lewis, Jacobs' seems to try to delve into Lewis mind. Granted, this can pose problems, because it is after all speculative.Alan Jacobs does seem to esteem Lewis highly but is not afraid to go where he believes the facts lead him. And as a small caveat, that would be my minor criticism with the book - in that Alan Jacobs does in my mind step a little further than the facts would lead us (such as C. S. Lewis as Miss Moore's relationship).I listened to the audio recording done by Jacobs as well and thoroughly enjoyed it. I can't recommend this book any higher as a great insight into a great man. I find the more that I study C. S. Lewis (whatever one thinks of his books) that you enjoy the man (and all his flaws) and only wish to lead a life with the same amount unashamed joy that he did."},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"This is a very good biography of C. S. Lewis. Jacobs is a skillful writer and has a great knack for weaving Lewis' own writing and ideas into the events of his life. He brings out the greatness of Lewis' mind and character without hiding his flaws or failing to point out what he thinks are some of his half-baked or somewhat parochial ideas. The thorough research that has evidently gone into writing this book is skillfully crafted into a fascinating narrative; very enjoyable reading. Jacobs convincingly debunks the more bizarre speculations of A. N. Wilson's unfriendly biography (particularly those surrounding his debate with Elizabeth Anscombe--see also Victor Reppert's essay in ch. 21 of Bassham and Walls' book, \\"The Chronicles of Narnia and Philosophy\\" for more on this.) and fills in many gaps that other biographers have left. If you only have time to read one story of Lewis' life this is a good one. I highly recommend it. But you should make time to read two.Jack: A Life of C. S. Lewis, by George Sayer, is written from the perspective of a personal friend is a good companion to this one. You'll find some good stories in there that Jacobs leaves out. Sayer gives a better picture of Lewis' relationship with Joy Davidman, for example. Those who fault Jacobs for trying too hard to psychoanalyze Lewis have a good point. But his tone is speculative in these parts, not conclusive, cautioning readers to draw their own conclusions rather than put too much weight on his. One thing Jacobs helps to do is balance the view that many have of Lewis as a rationalist with his more passionate side. Lewis highly valued reason and logic in making sense of his beliefs and his \\"mere Christianity\\" but passion and imagination also seem to have played an important and necessary part in realizing those beliefs for his own life and in living them out."},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"There are many books about magic worlds, some even excellent. I love the works of E Nesbit, Edward Eager, J. K. Rowling, J.R.R. Tolkien and others, and enjoy rereading them from time to time. It's very pleasant to hang out with old friends and reground for an hour or two; but ah, there's nothing like the thrill of falling back into Narnia. As \\"The Wind in the Willows\\" was for C. S. Lewis, Narnia has always been a refuge for me. I wore out the public library's copies of the Chronicles of Narnia before I was ten, and having been banned from checking them out again, have since gone through three sets of my own. I'm substantially older than ten now and find the books just as fresh now on the two thousandth reading as the first.I believe that much of whatever is good in my character comes from the difficult lessons Edmund and Eustace learned, the resolution of Diggory's dilemma when he was tempted to steal a Narnian apple to heal his dying Mother and Aslan's repeated admonition of \\"No one is told any story but their own\\". When my parents died, the journey to Aslan's country in \\"The Last Battle\\" gave me enormous comfort, and still does. I say all this both as a long overdue \\"thank you\\" to C. S. Lewis, and because I suspect others feel the same.Yes, Lewis was a formidable scholar, intellect, and Christian apologist; prolific writer, gifted teacher, loyal friend and all around neat guy, but the charm and accessiblity of the Narnia books is his greatest contribution to nontheologians and nonacademicians. In other words, most of us.The Chronicles of Narnia were not written until Lewis was in his fifties, and Dr. Jacobs has done an admirable job of explaining why they couldn't have been written any earlier. The death of Lewis' mother, his emotionally unavailable father, painful school experiences, the horrors of WWI, his amazing scope of reading while pursuing multiple Oxford degrees, the often brutal world of academic politics, the influence of the Inklings, and a somewhat unconventional domestic life are all frequently discussed landmarks on the way to Lantern Waste, and are well-told here, but unlike any other Lewis biography I've read, Dr. Jacobs documents how the spiritual journey that began with Lewis' conversion to \\"mere Christianity\\" in his thirties, with its accompanying generosity of spirit, graciousness, and belief in miracles and joy all contributed to the gift that is Narnia. The reader is not required to take Dr. Jacobs' word for it--the evidence is there, in letters written and received before and after 1928.What a monumental task it must have been to write a balanced biography of C. S. Lewis. It's hard enough to write a review. \\"The Narnian\\" is not dry, nor cute, nor sycophantic. It is respectful, fair, and a rewarding read. It neither ignores the more inexplicable parts of Lewis' life (which are no one's business anyway) nor his critics, disappointingly Philip Pullman--to whom I'd just like to say, \\"Bless me, what DO they teach them at these schools\\"--the very last way you'd describe Lewis is as having a \\"mean, narrow little mind\\".For those of us who discovered Lewis through Narnia and were driven to explore his other works in hopes of finding a way through the wardrobe, this is our book. \\"The Narnian\\" comes as close as anyone can to the essence of Narnia and C. S. Lewis. As a child, I frequently looked for a physical door opening into Narnia and for an intellectual door as an adult. That door is well illuminated by Dr. Jacobs."},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"Most of the Biographies of Lewis are written by Christian Admirers and attempt to paint a saintly portrait of him. Real Christians know as Lewis would have admitted that none of us are without sins and blemishes. Most biographers skim over the times that Lewis thought Christianity was Humbug and gloss over some of his behaviour befor and after his conversion. Jacobs is the first biographer I've seen who gives us Lewis warts and all mostly using the Narnian's own words from his correspondances over the years.I would reccomend it for anyone who has an interest in the life and thoughts of the great 20th century apologist."},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"Alan Jacobs is an English professor at Wheaton College, home of the Wade center, the largest collection of original Lewis writings and extant works in the world (as well as the inspirational wardrobe and Lewis' Beer mug). It shows. It becomes obvious early on in this text that he is intimately familiar with Lewis's writings and letters. It is robust and well documented while being readable and interesting and well worth the pages. I brought it with me on a recent visit to Oxford and found it made the university come alive with the formidable specters of Lewis, Tolkein and Charles Williams.A couple of other thoughts:-This is, without a doubt, a sympathetic biography (a friend of mine called it \`gushing') and Jacobs sticks up for Lewis against all his detractors. But he also deals plainly with less savory his subjects life (the nature of his relationship with Minto and his falling out with Tolkein) and in all is an able biographer.-There is some repetition of letters and quotes. I this found helpful rather than redundant as different stages of his life and thought were tied together, but it is worth noting."},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"Dr Jacobs does a great job of drawing together the disparate strands of Lewis' life so that at any moment we are constantly re-assessing his positions and his influences. When the 1950s arrive, Jacobs steps slightly out of stricty chronology by first exploring almost every other aspect of Lewis' writing (the Narnia books, the breakup of the Inklings, the strain with Tolkien, and the women who threw themselves at him) before he introduces Joy Gresham into the mix, which is a refreshing and novel way of telling a man's life story.His defense of Lewis against various charges of sexism, misogyny and racism is well argued, and he is happy to admit where his best defense is to tell the truth, that Lewis had some pretty bizarre theories especially about women and about sexuality! He will make you laugh as he discusses Lewis' famous remarks (from MERE CHRISTIANITY I think) about how Europeans are neurotic about sex and the way you can tell is by re-imaging how unerotic striptease acts would be if food was being unveiled rather than body parts. On the other hand his counterargument (that in Orual, in TILL WE HAVE FACES, Lewis did create a female character of impressive psychological complexity) brings us right back to the centrist position with which he seems most comfortable.Jacobs is eminently readable. Even when his attention turns to the so-called \\"problem of Susan,\\" he is never less than fair to even Lewis' more vehement critics. However you can see him trying to distance himself from the DARK TOWER controversy, as he refuses to discuss the book saying that there have been some questions about the DARK TOWER manuscript. C'mon, Alan, what's your take on that? Not that it's important in the face of such a masterful biography, but, you know, just wondering."},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"Books about Lewis are a dime a dozen, and it hard to know where to begin when trying to find a concise but accurate biography that is not soaked with naive adulation or excessively absorbed detail. InterVarsity Press alone has published 10 titles in the last 5 years on various topics ranging from his philosophical arguments to his literary work to his mystical imagination. Several biographies have already been written by authoritative eye witnesses such as Walter Hooper, George Sawyer, and the son of Lewis' late wife Douglas Gresham. Why would the world need yet another Lewis biography? A.N. Wilson gave it a try by attempting give a more \\"honest\\" account of Lewis' defects, but was met with scorn by those who knew him best. Jacobs has the advantage of writing with a generation of time's distance from the vantage point of a twenty-first century literary scholar, where at Wheaton College, he had access to the largest collection of original and extant copies of Lewis' writings to date.The most interesting part of Jacob's biography is the division of Lewis' mind into two poles: the rational philosopher and the imaginative storyteller. Lewis often lived between this tension with some conflict, but embodied them with quite a bit of unity. He came to reject his atheism on the basis of the logical need to postulate a kind of assumption, a first cause if you will, but his conversion to Christianity was a more \\"storied\\" affair that was informed to a large degree by the poetry of Tolkien.That life is more than what we can see and that there is a reality that is bigger than we can perceive is fundamental to Lewis' thought. This may be obvious to the most nominal reader, but the depth of how profound Lewis thought it to be is awe-inspiring. Delight and wonder fill the mind of the Narnian as well as reason and orthodoxy. So it should be with everyone who calls themselves Christian."},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"I've heard Mr. Jacobs speak on two occasions: first on Personal Lives on CNN (bookTV) and secondly, on Mars Hill Audio. The author is well read and very thoughtful. I enjoyed the talks more than \\"The Narniam.\\" However, the book does a masterful job of showing how different themes that were dear to Lewis permeates all his Lewis's writings. Jacobs allows us to see how the scholarly work, the apologetic works, and the fiction inform each other because of the common themes.The book trips through time a little bit, so it is a little confusing at times, but on the whole it is very readable. He tries to dispel the myths and criticisms about Lewis's life with mixed results. He is very charitable to A. N. Wilson, whose biography of Lewis I detest. He does show where Wilson is wrong and right in his estimation. The book did provide some details of Jack life I did not know. It also has a nice detachment from Lewis that the biographers who knew Lewis personally do not have. He brings light on Lewis's relationship with Joy (Lewis's wife) that is sorely needed.I don't think Lewis would like this biography very much. It delves into the Lewisian thought processes and psychology in creating the books. I pretty sure that makes Jacobs guilty of personal heresy in Lewis's definition. I think Jacobs is also guilty of chronological snobbery in some places.However, in spite of all these small misgivings, the book is very informative and entertaining. Jacobs's literary background brings depth to this study. Jacobs gives me different perspectives on Lewis's life, philosophy, and theology I never had before. Lewis's humility and sense of duty is a challenge to me. I strongly recommend the book."},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"This may be the only book to treat all of Lewis's major works, to sketch the shape of his imagination. Jacobs portrays Lewis more fairly than most, and puts his works in the larger context of the scope of his thought and his reaction to modernity. There are many facets of Lewis's life and work, and Jacobs constantly turns the gemstone that we might better see them all."},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"CS Lewis was a fascinating Christian apologist in the 20th Century, who made his mark as a philosopher, teacher, and children's author. He is first and foremost a Christian, and it is from this perspective that Christian biographer Alan Jacobs examines him. The focus is on how Lewis's beliefs are reflected in his writing, and how his relationships influenced his character. I bought it to learn more about the reasons behind Lewis's Narnia books, and found it to be suitable for this. It is not a highly engaging read, being rather scholarly, but Mr. Jacobs has done superb research and the book is an important piece of work for anyone who wants to learn more about CS Lewis and his motivations.Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"I'm no Lewis scholar but I am a thoughtful reader. Despite the fact that any biography can always be somehow better, I think Jacobs has done a fair job. As one who has read a decent bit of Lewis' work with little biographical background, this gave me a good sketch of his life. I'm sure others will disagree with various details but you have to start somewhere if you want to enter the discussion. Give it a go!"},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"When I read A.N. Wilson's biography of Lewis a few years ago, I didn't want it to end. When I finished Jacob's, I was ready for it to be over. Though a decent stylist, his discussions of Lewis's thought become tedious, straining out gnats while missing some of Lewis's most noteworthy theories. Using the Chronicles of Narnia as his recurrent touchstone weakens the book since the Narnia stories do not represent Lewis at his best. Jacobs mentions that Lewis's OXFORD HISTORY OF ENGLISH LITERATURE is his best book, but then fails to tell us hardly anything about it. In fact, comprehensive analysis of most of his books is entirely missing. (Ironically, Lewis's first two books of second-rate poetry receive more attention than most of his much better books.) Instead, Jacobs picks bits and pieces out of various books in order to construct Lewis's thinking on various topics that Jacobs thinks are important.Jacob's retelling of Lewis's childhood is also disappointing, relying heavily on quotes from Lewis's own autobiography, SURPRISED BY JOY. One might as well simply read Lewis's own account--which is far more witty, insightful, and well written than Jacob's pale rehash.Although Jacobs thinks he's being hard-nosed and honest about Lewis (e.g. revealing Lewis's youthful desire to spank women and the high probability that Lewis was having an affair with a married woman old enough to be--and whom he called--his mother), in reality Jacobs is Lewis's devoted protector. Lewis's sexism and racism are underanalyzed and brushed aside. Many of the glaring weaknesses in Lewis's Christian apologetics are never mentioned, let alone scrutinized. The book hides its special pleading, but it's still there. It's aimed at the Christian evangelical audience that already wants to canonize Lewis but needs a serious biography to complete the task.Despite these weaknesses and irritations, I mostly liked the book, and that's because I like Lewis so much (most of the time). When Jacobs quotes a letter I have not read before that throws new light on Lewis or lets us hear new melodies from Lewis's wonderful voice, I smile. The many quotations from Lewis's writings revealed a virtuosity in prose writing that I had never quite realized before. And Jacobs includes several warm scenes in the book--especially the last paragraph of the penultimate chapter.The genuine kindness and self-giving nature of Lewis comes through clearly. Jacobs is also sensitive to an important point: Lewis's writings do not become interesting or significant until he becomes a Christian. Becoming a Christian truly made Lewis a better and more profound person.Better written, more balanced, and more comprehensive than some books on Lewis, Jacobs is a good response to Wilson's biography which--though more stylish, witty and insightful--suffers from some misjudgments and self-serving cuteness.I just wish the book answered one question: Where did the odd photo on the cover--of Lewis standing at attention in a full suit covered with a robe--come from?"},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"One would think that with the title, THE NARNIAN, you would find some relationship between C.S. and THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, but the author writes few details of that relationship that would make interesting reading. Instead, Jacobs goes off on tangents that have no relationship to Naria nor THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA. The book relates mostly about the relationships between other authors and Lewis, main Tolkien. I wanted to read about C.S. Lewis as the \\"Narnian.\\" No new information, unfortuantely!"},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"Alan Jacobs, you did your homework for this one. That becomes apparent by the end of the introduction. I think I have probably read everything still in print about CSL, and what I appreciate about your book are the following: Your data is correct; there are no hazy vaguenesses ignored, all are fully \\"admitted\\" (I refer to events in the life of CSL about which biographers have always had to guess); and \\"put-downs\\" by modern authors, such as Philip Pullman, are answered. (That last mattered to me especially, as I resent terribly PP's reference to Narnian \\"drivel.\\" Pettiness prompts me to remark about some of PP's own drivel, but I digress.)Mr. Jacobs also handled the Joy Gresham era masterfully, considering how Hollywood, and the BBC, have managed to change it into something it never really seemed to be. Mr. Jacob's account, though admittedly speckled with his own personal guesswork, seems so much nearer the mark, so much more in keeping with the sense of CSL's personality we get through the previous bios.Well done, Mr. Jacobs!"},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"The Narnian is a literary/theological biography of C.S. Lewis. Although it covers the basic facts of Lewis' life as competently as any other biography, the real strength of Jacobs' work lies in the fascinating discussions of Lewis' thought processes and religious/literary development.Jacobs makes no bones about his deep admiration for Lewis, which makes his work seem rather defensive when dealing with Lewis' critics. At times this defensiveness seems justifiable, especially when it is employed against critics like Philip Pullman who obviously haven't studied Lewis very thoroughly. At other times it seems rather overdone, as when Jacobs abruptly dismisses J.R.R. Tolkien's (one of Lewis' closest associates) critiques.This is nevertheless a very satisfying work which will illuminate much for people who seek more information on Lewis' life, work, and theology."},{"Title":"Narnian","review":". . . about this review -- and really wanted to give this book a fourth star. I just could not bring myself to do so, however!First, I want to thank the publisher of \\"The Narnian\\" for the complimentary copy sent to me.I, myself, have been a serious student of Lewis, having began reading his works more than 30 years ago (and an even more serious student of Tolkien, having begun reading HIS works more than 26 years ago.) I have given lectures and presented papers on the subject, and include a great deal of both Lewis and Tolkien in the classes I teach. I will probably be using this book as a secondary -- \\"SECONDARY\\" -- reference work in some of my classes. To this reviewer, it fails as a primary source.\\"The Narnian\\" was presented as a \\"literary\\" biography. As such, I expected a great deal more literary criticism than actually appeared in the book.\\"The Narnian\\", it is to be presumed, was supposed to place Lewis within the context of his great fictional creation -- the land of Narnia. Unfortunately, this was not the case.The author, in his introduction, suggests that he will pass over much material which one might find in a traditional biography in order to concentrate on more literary concerns. Whether he succeeded in concentrating on literary concerns is for the reader to decide -- but he DID include most of the pertinent biographical information of Lewis' life -- the enormous majority of it having been presented elsewhere.There were some things I learned from this book, much to my delight.1) I was greatly interested to learn more of the background behind \\"The Abolition of Man\\" -- a text I require for my Introduction to Theology students. I will be substantially adding to my lecture notes thanks to what I learned.2) I was greatly interested to learn of the background behind Lewis' debating partner with regard to \\"Miracles\\". I was under the impression that she was an atheist -- and was intrigued to learn that she was a practicing Catholic.3) I was greatly interested to learn of the long correspondence between Lewis and an Italian priest -- now up for Canonization! I'm sure that Lewis must be pleased!This being said, there were some significant detrations to this book, which prevent me from giving it a higher rating.1) I'm uncomfortable with the author's use of previous biography. The biography of Lewis used most often, is A.N. Wilson's biography -- arguably the worst of the three most often cited. In the Introduction, the author praises the work of Walter Hooper (another major detraction for me) but the work by Green and Hooper is hardly mentioned. The best of the biographies -- \\"Jack\\" by George Sayer (who knew Lewis well for 29 years) is never mentioned -- and Sayer himself is only mentioned a couple of times in passing. In other words, the biography of the man who knew Lewis the best and the longest, is the biography which is ignored.2) The author gets the relationship between CS Lewis and JRR Tolkien just plain wrong. It is fashionable these days to suggest that the friendship between these two men \\"crashed and burned\\" beyond repair -- and this is just not the case. Yes, their friendship went through several stages -- and had cooled off considerably toward the end of Lewis' life, but the author uses terms like \\"diseased\\" and suggests that the friendship ended completely upon Lewis' marriage. This is just not factually correct. Tolkien was, indeed, hurt and disapproving of Lewis' marriage -- but Tolkien's wife and Joy actually became good friends. Tolkien considered Lewis' death to be an \\"axe blow at the roots\\" and was one of the few present at the funeral.3) In \\"The Abolition of Man\\", Lewis criticized the authors of \\"The Green Book\\" for engaging in amateur philosophy -- when they were supposed to be teaching English grammar. I submit that the author of \\"The Narnian\\" engaged in amateur pyschoanalysis when he was supposed to be providing literary criticism. I found his analysis of the relationship between Joy and Lewis to be tedious at best and condescending at worst. This is an especially egregious example of where the author should have consulted George Sayer's writings. Sayer was present at the very first meeting between Joy and Lewis, and was probably closer to the situation than any other of Lewis' friends.4) Readers of my other reviews on Lewis will recall that I am particularly suspicious of Walter Hooper and strongly question the authenticity of some of what has been published by Hooper under Lewis' name. Indeed, over the past 20 years, much has been written on both sides of this debate. Questions of authenticity were raised only once in this book -- and dismissed with a sentence -- and without naming Hooper's chief detractor. Katherine Lindskoog's contributions to the study of Lewis and his writings should have at least been mentioned.5) There are several instances in which careless factual errors are made -- errors which any reader of \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" will quickly pick up. For someone, like the author, who has spend a quarter-century studying Lewis, this sloppiness is inexcusable.So there it is: a reasonably good effort, which I have praised when appropriate -- but also with significant flaws which seriously detract from the overall effort.Three stars."},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"Does the world need another biography of C. S. Lewis? Probably not. Jacobs admits even that he did not need to write one -- it was his agent's fault. Still, he does a generally excellent job in this book. As another life-long reader of Lewis, who had already read several biographies and almost everything by Lewis several times over, I learned quite a bit from this biography. Having sampled several Lewis biographies, like a fan of Hamlet who waits impatiently for Polonius to appear on stage, one gets to like and enjoy reading about other characters just as much -- Lewis' brother, Warnie (who wrote at least one pretty good book, too), the dramatic character he married, and all those incredibly bright friends he hung around with and swilled beer. (A reprise, perhaps, of Chesterton's friendships with Shaw & Wells etc.)What I really liked about this book was the good sense Jacobs brings to the project, and his own deep reading in many of the works and people that inspired Lewis. He swerves nimbly around the road-blocks that tumbled Wilson. True, he might have consulted Sayer. But he more than makes up for the occasional error in judgement or lapse in biographical expertise by offering frequent insight into dozens of works that were so much a part of Lewis' thought world. One gets the feeling that Lewis would have enjoyed talking with Jacobs.Jacobs is careful to maintain a critical distance from his subject, (some fail here) though he obviously admires him much, which keeps the book from becoming cloying. One area I did not think that worked was the rather tiresome pages in which he takes Lewis to task for (essentially) failing to conform to 21st Century orthodoxy on sexual equality. Some of us (like Lewis) go to the books of another era precisely to take a break from the stale pieties of our own. And it is ludicrous to identify Orual with Minto -- could any two women be less alike? -- Jacobs almost lapses into cheap psychobabble here. But if a writer sheds important light on a subject, and does so with style, I am inclined to forgive him a few such lapses.An obviously well-informed reviewer below finds more to complain about. I agree the title is a bit deceptive: the book is only occasionally about Narnia. I didn't think Jacobs was that far off, or negative, on the later Tolkien relationship. Nobody can know everything. Jacobs knows a lot, and pours much careful thought into this biography. It's also a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"The subtitle for the book is \\"The Life and Imagination of C.S. Lewis.\\" There is quite a bit about the life of this writer; however, the background seems more on the psychological than the biographical. This doesn't make a bad book at all, but it may not be as straightforward as some would like.There are a lot of parts of Lewis's life that I wasn't familiar with, and all that was provided here. There is a quick mentioning of the Inklings and Lewis's friendship with Tolkien. However, getting everything out of this book is not easy. I am not familiar with all of Lewis's works, which makes following this book a little more difficult. Given the extent to which the author here draws parallels to Lewis's life, the reader of this book needs to do some background research.In different parts of the book, the author highlights theories from other authors about why Lewis did what he did. Towards the beginning, he explains why those authors may not have come to the right conclusion. This is interesting. Towards the end of the book, the disagreement with other authors becomes almost shrill. It was a little off-putting and made reading uncomfortable.Overall, if you, like me, have little background with C.S. Lewis, this book will provide a good explanation. If you want to get the most out of this book, then you need to be more than familiar with his writing, the different Narnian Chronicles as well as his Christian writings."},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"As a life-long fan of C.S. Lewis, I was delighted to find this biography of the beloved author. Alan Jacobs has dedicated his biography of Lewis to the aspects most important in the author's life; therefore, it is not a straight-forward, chronological telling. Rather it is a mixed dish of biography, criticism and a little speculation into the life of one of the twentieth century's greatest writers and defenders of the Christian faith. This biography gives readers the best opportunity to meet the man who was C.S. Lewis; the Oxford don, the defender of his faith, the man for whom you could \\"never get a book long enough or a cup of tea big enough to suit\\" him.There is much about C.S. Lewis that remains an enigma; there are aspects of his life that even those closest to him (such as his older brother Warnie) weren't given access to. And for such a famous, public figure, Lewis was happiest when he was left to himself, with a good book and a cup of tea. Much about him also seems contradictory; Lewis was a devout atheist who gradually came to believe in God and practice the tenets of Christianity, not necessarily because he wanted to, but because (intellectually) he knew that it was true. He would devote the rest of his life to defending his faith and instilling its virtues throughout his writings.Lewis' writings are prolific and diverse and Jacobs has paid homage to all of them in his biography, by intertwining Lewis' life with his writings. Jacobs is frank when he comes to a topic that is mere speculation and thorough when examining the well-known facets of Lewis' life. \\"The Narnian\\" is an enjoyable read, best for those who are familiar with the wide array of Lewis' works; not just the Narnia tales, but his apologetics and his science fiction. The writings and the worlds of C.S. Lewis have sparked imaginations the world over, and will continue to do so as long as his legacy lives on; and as long as there is a child reading and encountering another world for the first time, the imagination behind the man will be at work."},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"It is a shame that someone whose style of writing is as fine as Jacobs should nevertheless produce a book of sloppy scholarship and questionable pronouncements. On the plus side, Jacobs writing style is lively, he creates fine links between Lewis's written works and people/events from Lewis's life, and he gives interesting interpretations of Lewis's works in all the various literary genres in which he wrote.However, this book receives a two-star rating for several reasons. First, the scholarship is sloppy: numerous factual errors are sprinkled throughout the book, everything from incorrectly labeled photos to wrong dates to incorrect medical information. (One can't help but think that the proofreaders at HarperSanFrancisco were sleeping on the job.) Second, Jacobs seems to be of the A.N. Wilson school of thought in which a biography is an attempt to psychoanalyze the dead by rummaging around through their literary productions and making pronouncements on the inner life (that are not uncommonly contrary to what the biographical subject claimed while alive). Third, while some of Jacobs' theological pronouncements were sound, there were others that seemed naive or just plain muddle-headed. More than anything, it was apparent that while the author has been reading Lewis for a long time, he hasn't read as widely as someone writing a biography should, for several of his opinions would be altered if he knew more about the subject (e.g., Jacobs writes, \\"The Pilgrim's Regress was C.S. Lewis's least successful book as he himself knew\\"; but in fact, Lewis did not acknowledge this to be the case; moreover, while some people thought the book unsuccessful, others thought well of it, including folks such as Norman Pittenger, A.N. Wilson, or J.I. Packer, the latter of whom thought it was the single best thing Lewis ever wrote. Certainly it was not the least successful of Lewis's books in terms of either sales or public opinion.)Between the numerous factual errors, the lack of sufficient research, the theological absurdities, and the amateurish psychoanalysis, this book would have greatly benefited from some rather heavy-handed editing. The best I could say about it is that it is a decent-though-heavily-flawed book. Bottom line: if you want a reliable account of Lewis's writings, go with Walter Hooper's superb \\"C.S. Lewis Companion and Guide\\" or \\"The C.S. Lewis Readers' Encyclopedia\\" (ed. by Schultz and West); if you want a fine biography, read George Sayer's \\"Jack: C.S. Lewis and his Times\\". While Jacobs does do many things well, I'm afraid my pronouncement of \\"The Narnian\\" is a statement of Samuel Johnson's: \\"It is more from carelessness about truth than intentional lying that there is so much falsehood in the world.\\""},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"Alan Jacobs does a great job in his biography of Lewis. A professor at Wheaton College in Illinois, Jacobs is extremely fair in his portrayal of Lewis. He does not gloss over the darker events of Lewis's life. Jacobs helps the reader connect the events that eventually led Lewis to a faith in Christ and to a career as a Christian apologist and writer.Jacobs elaborates on the symbolism of some of Lewis's work, and explores many of Lewis's friendships with other well known people of his day including Tolkien. Tolkien had a great deal of influence on Lewis's journey of faith and to a lesser degree his writing.Another aspect of the book that I appreciated was that Jacobs answered all questions I asked as I read the book. He ties events together clearly to illustrate the way Lewis thought. This biography does not delve much into his childhood or his marriage. Although, the author mentions specific events which he believed help shape Lewis's general outlook on life and his writing."},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"This is a fascinating look at the man and the Chronicles: well-written, fun, imaginative, brilliant. Jacobs interweaves Jack's life with events in Narnia, to get at the deeper meaning of the story and of Christian understandings of God and hope and human destiny.Jacobs has a keen appreciation of the role myth and story play for us all, and how the Christian message can be seen as the realization of the longing for a TRUE story that makes sense of our lives and our world. In this he follows Lewis & Tolkien & Chesterton: Life is an adventure, for us and for God, and our story can only be understood as part of God's story.A book rich in wisdom, insight, and love for Narnia. Far superior to anything else written about Narnia and Lewis."},{"Title":"Narnian","review":"Alan Jacobs' book is insightful, outstandingly written and thoughtful. Due to the movie, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, one had to suspecta fresh horde of books would be printed and old ones re-printed and re-packaged. Being a fan of Lewis' works and already having quite a library of Lewis \\"stuff\\" I knew some would get some Lewis \\"stuff\\" for me (I can always count on Lewis, Batman, or Steelers gifts, and it is a great life). My Godfather got me Jack's Life and my wife gave me this one. Both these books compliment each other as Jack's Life is an intimate version of Lewis and this book is a biography, but not in the usual sense of a chronological narrative.First, this book is more concerned with themes in Lewis' life and imagination than he is with strict chronology. This keeps the pace going, and why in one respct it reads like a chronological tale (at the end of the book, one will initially remember reading the life in chronology), in other ways, it is anything but, because one will remember certain themes that are prevelant in Lewis' life and works (his imagination, Christian transformation, and friendships).Secondly, Jacobs also debunks many Lewis myths (C.E.B. Anscombe debate and the Mrs. Moore affair). Why not making hard fast conclusions, his overall pitcure moves the reader in a direction that captures the life and works of Lewis. I find it fascinating that Jacobs focus much time as Lewis of a man of honor and connects this to his love of literature (old books) and Christina transformation. Leiws was a dedicated man to his country, fellow man, \\"pen-pals\\", friends, and God. We observe the strain on his friendships at times and the strain on his life.A great book."},{"Title":"Fate of Man in the Modern World","review":"No one is safe from Berdyaev's wrecking ball. One minute, he is blasting communism and its repression of ideas and speech, and the next minute he is blasting the 1920's American system of unfettered capitalism. Berdyaev eventually settles on a middle ground that I would describe as a moderate religious socialism. He constantly works to defend the less fortunate, and reminds us that in America, totalitarian government is being replaced by totalitarian corporations. People are described as repressed by the wealthy and the elite, and forced to work harder than they should have to. This repression is similar to that encountered by people in communist states, only coming from a source other than the government. On the other end of the spectrum, Berdyaev criticises the communist forms of repression with equal vigor. It is refreshing to see a truly unbiased political theorist, who, instead of patriotically clinging to an established system is willing to point out drawbacks in all systems. By highlighting all of these drawbacks on both sides, Berdyaev prevents the political pendulum from swinging too far in either direction, and, guided by a religious ethical sensibility, steadies it somewhere in the middle."},{"Title":"Fate of Man in the Modern World","review":"the philosophy of religion"},{"Title":"Getting There: The Epic Struggle between Road and Rail in the American Century","review":"Of all of the books that I have read pertaining to railroad history, &quot;Getting There&quot; is head and shoulders above all the rest. The author provides a well written and generally balanced account of the competition between rail and highway transportation in the United States from about the 1920's forward.By 1920, the powerful presence of the robber barons of the late 19th century had disappeared, and the railroads were in a state of disarray and disintegration as a result of the heavy demands being placed upon the system, and the benign dictatorship of the United States Railroad Administration (USRA) who took over and ran the railroads during WWI.In addition, the railroads were required to operate under onerous and restrictive rules and regulations imposed by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) as a result of the excesses of the 19th century. And the railroads had little support from the public because of these past sins.Into this scenario arose highway competition, by and large developed with public funds. And without controls such as imposed on the railroads. In contrast trucks and busses were allowed to operate unfettered. So a trucking company could operate freely between two given points and change rates and service at will. While a railroad operating between those same two points would have to go through the cumbersome ICC process.Author Goddard provides a concise and well documented picture of this competition between rail and highway, a competition which continues to this day.I highly recommed this book to anyone who is interested in a serious look at our overall transportation system. But a word of advice: Check the condition of your pacemaker first. This book is not recommended for someone with high blood pressure. I guarantee that you will come away absolutely furious at the foibles of our national transportation policy."},{"Title":"Getting There: The Epic Struggle between Road and Rail in the American Century","review":"A well-written readable, and mostly objective picture of how highways, through massive government investment through the construction of the interstate highway system, steadily became the dominant mode of transportation in the US. The author concludes that, with deregulation and improvements to Amtrak, railroads do have a promising future despite the historic imbalance."},{"Title":"Getting There: The Epic Struggle between Road and Rail in the American Century","review":"The author knows a lot about railroads- about their history, their operation, and their economics. And it is this knowledge which makes this book a good (and informative) read.But, it is not at all balanced- rather, it is all too obvious that the author really likes railroads and really doesn't much care for motor transport.And, therefore, he seems to \\"cherry pick\\" his facts- not that any are false, just that they're incomplete. For example, he notes that Amtrack's subsidy is tiny compared with highway subsidies- which is true, but, he neglects to note that Amtrack's subsidy *per passenger-mile* is enormously greater. Nor is he about to point out that NYC's extensive subway system actually uses more energy (again, per passenger-mile) than a commuter's car.Nor does he identify the real reason why, outside of a few very congested areas, the public consistently chooses to drive rather use public transportation- and, no, it's not the government subsidies. It's because transit (local or inter-city, present-day or \\"golden age\\") is almost always a 3-seat solution: there's a branch line to the mainline, the mainline, and then another branch line to your destination. And therefore it takes too long, and is too inconvenient, and (dare I say it?)becomes too costly and inefficient. Without the ability to offer a door-to-door ride, those who can will almost always choose to drive.But, the author does know lots about trains- and that (if you can ignore the anti-highway bias) still makes this book a worthwile read."},{"Title":"Getting There: The Epic Struggle between Road and Rail in the American Century","review":"I may be a little biased in my review of \\"Getting There\\", since my grand uncle Roy and my grandfather John Fitzgerald (pages 123-137)played such a significant role in the transformation from the trolley to the bus.Interestingly, this expansive transportation network was created by American entrepreneurs with no public funds and ran at a profit that public transportation doesn't seem to be able to do today.This was accomplished during the the Great Depression era and may be a more poignent lesson today during our current economic times."},{"Title":"Getting There: The Epic Struggle between Road and Rail in the American Century","review":"I ordered this volume on Oct. 19 and haven't received it yet.

I was pleasantly suprised to find that the rest of this book is as superbly researched and detailed as Peebles' glimpse into the testing of foreign equipment.Peebles discusses, in amazing detail, the developments of such famous aircraft as the U-2, A-12, SR-71, F-117, &quot;Have Blue&quot; and &quot;Tacit Blue.&quot; Peebles also delves into the history of the less-glamarous unmanned platforms such as the trisonic D-21 (&quot;Tagboard&quot;) and various models of the Model 147 Firebee, used extensively in Vietnam.This book is a must for anyone interested in black project aviation. It is well written and thoroughly researched, and is engaging to both the causal and technical reader."},{"Title":"Dark Eagles: A History of Top Secret U.S. Aircraft Programs","review":"A wide ranging historical survey of once classified material. We know we're not getting the whole story, but the author has enough to satisfy. From stolen (actually borrowed) Russian jets and unmanned space probes, to our own unmanned D-21 Mach-3 spyjets, the authors go for it all. Some of the information is pretty suprising (the mysterious Col. Tomb, thought killed in the now legendary Vietnam airwar dogfight with Driscoll and Cunningham, may have been misidentified) while other stories seem tedious (like the use of Hound-Dog cruise missiles as first generation remote spyplanes).

Peebles may be a bit shy on the technical details, but he has documented the history of the U2, SR-71, F-117 and other, lesser-known craft very well. He also does an excellent job of piecing together and tracing the origins of various legends and rumors that are passed around as if they were fact, like the mythical &quot;Aurora&quot; aircraft.One small detail: In the SR-71 section Peebles refers to the problem of titanium panels being corroded by &quot;pencil marks&quot;, and the footnote identifies the source as a public lecture. Ben Rich's book, &quot;Skunk Works&quot;, states that it was &quot;Pentel&quot; pen ink that was the problem.

Granted, you must have a little understanding of military aircraft. If you would be unable to decipher between a P-51 Mustang and F-4 Phantom, it may be too much.Peebles writes with colorful narrative on some of the US's most astonishing and mysterious aircraft in the last 50 years. Included in his book are chapters on the first US jet (XP-59A Airacomet), the spy plane Francis Gary Powers made famous (U-2 Aquatone), the birth of the stealth fighter (F-117A), 'borrowed' MiG's flying in the Nevada desert, reconnaissance drone vehicles, the Star Wars-like A-12 Oxcart, as well as the current Black Project plane - Aurora.In each chapter, Pebbles writes on what precipitated the need for a new secret aircraft, how the craft took shape behind closed doors, its test flights, and how it performed in action. He includes a plethora of colorful stories on how the U-2 was named, how a US Navy aircraft carrier was 'captured' by the US Air force, and tales of gorillas smoking cigars and flying in the southwest desert.Pebbles also goes into great detail about two controversial topics of today - Area 51 and the Aurora. Throughout the book, Peebles gives the history of Area 51, how it originated as a base at Groom Lake all the way up to the flying saucer tales of today. Conspiracy theorists will be disappointed as well as many Black Ops devotees looking for proof that the Aurora exists.In conclusion, I thought Peebles book was a great, intriguing look into some of our nation's biggest secrets of the Cold War that's also a quick read (only 292 pages of text) and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Dark Eagles: A History of Top Secret U.S. Aircraft Programs","review":"This book is a must for any aviation buff.

It was rich in beef and grain, and from its exit at Harper's Ferry a Confederate force could attempt to capture Washington from the rear. This happened time and again. When Grant began his great drive on Richmond to end the war in 1864, he needed to assure that a rebel force did not slip around him through the valley to again threaten Washington. Sheridan was ultimately assigned the task of assuring an army could find no sustenance there. \\"If a crow tried to fly across the valley it would starve to death, \\" he boasted to Grant.This book is part of a series of 12 short volumes on the land war published in 1882-3. It took congress twenty years to finally allocate funds to all the documents and communications sorted through. Americans could at last have an inside look at who actually said or did what, and when.While that massive project was still underway, the publisher of this series persuaded highly qualified people - most of them participants -- to produce a quick readable history in light of the new information.M.F. Force (\\"From Fort Henry to Corinth\\"), says, \\"The main source of information is the official reports of battles and operations. These reports, both National and Confederate, will appear in the series of volumes Military Reports now in preparation [by] the War Records office in the War Department.\\"Alexander Webb (\\"The Peninsula\\") adds \\"To be of any practical use, all history, and particularly military history, must be gradually sifted and reduced to small compass.\\"Jacob D. Cox (\\"The March to the Sea - Franklin & Nashville\\") sums up purpose and limitations: \\"The class of readers which has been most in mind [includes] includes the surviving officers and men who served in the war. [My] aim has been to supplement their personal knowledge by the facts ... of recent research. To give unity and symmetry to the ... campaigns here told, by examining each in the light of the plans and purposes of the leaders on both sides. The limits assigned... made it necessary to choose between the narration of incidents which would enliven the story, and that fullness to strictly military detail which seemed necessary to make the several campaigns clearly intelligible, and to enable the reader to judge, with some degree of satisfaction, the character of the operations. ...the effort to do so will give to each a broader understanding of what the great game of war really is.\\"This is what these short works accomplish in spades. With good maps at hand, the text is easily followed, often with amazement at the sorts of things that can and do routinely occur on campaign and in battle. We see armies so pestered by the random and unforeseen that one wonders how anything is accomplished.But the above assumes good maps - and here the books fall short.Cox: \\"The maps ... are reduced copies of the official surveys made by the engineers of the army. ... In reducing them it has not been possible to preserve all the details of the original... The reader is presumed to make reference to an ordinary hand-atlas... To have illustrated the text by larger and more elaborate maps would have thwarted the purpose of the publishers to put the series within the reach of all.\\"You do need more detailed maps that supplied in most popular military atlases. There are several solutions. If the maps in a particular volume are printed clearly, they can be enlarged on a Xerox machine. Alternately, simply google under Images for, say, \\"Wilderness, 1864\\" and you'll likely find an amazing variety of choices to print out.Back in the 1880s, the full sized official government maps were available in a large folder. These were photo reduced to a still legible size, and presented in color, in an 1891 oversized book titled \\"The Official Military Atlas of the Civil War.\\"B&N; reprinted this book in 2004, photo-reduced 10% (to 13 x 16 \\"). You can get a used copy on Amazon for $20.00. The only odd thing is that all maps are placed completely randomly, apparently whatever will fit where. You have to consult the appropriate index, which will list all plates (facing pages) containing a relevant map.* * *To give a sense of the value of these books, (1) I've posted some of my personal maps from these books. When a caption isn't attributed, it's mine, warts and all.(2) You find remarkable eyewitness observations such as this in Palfrey's \\"The Antietem and Fredericksburg.\\" The Union having been defeated at 2nd Manassas must move to block Lee's attempt to cross into Maryland or Pennsylvania. The fastest way for these haggard troops to do so is to march back through Washington and then west.\\"Washington and its environs presented singular sights in the early days of September, 1862. The luxury and refinements of peace contrasted sharply with the privations and squalor of war. There are few prettier suburban drives than those in the neighborhood of Washington, and no weather is more delightful than that of late evening there, when a cooler air comes with shortening days. As the shadows lengthened in the golden afternoon, well-appointed carriages rolled along those charming drives, and by their side the ragged, dusty, sunburnt regiments from Pennsylvania trudged along. Rest, cleanliness, ice, food, drink, every indulgence of civilized life were within reach, but our hands could not be stretched to grasp them. ... The carriages returned to their stables, the fair ladies returned to the enjoyment of every pleasure that Washington could confer, but the Army of the Potomac moved steadily northward to bivouac under the stars or the clouds, and to march again in its tatters through the dust and the sunshine, through the rain and the mud.\\"(3) The actual communications among commanders is fascinating.(4) Basically working through these books with maps is a quick read, but also has the fascination of working through a book of logic problems. The essential information available to commanders is in your hands also.

With an array of supernaturral characters (devils, gnomes, hobgoblings, prophets, imps, saints, and demons) Singer fulfils a mosaic of fantastic imagination, colored by a rich folklore, addressing moral issues that concern the child and the adult as well. Stories such as &quot;Zlateh the Goat,&quot; &quot;Popiel and Tekla,&quot; &quot;The Power of Light,&quot; amongst others, have a universal appeal because they address eternal questions. For Singer, now matter how young a child might be, he is a philosopher and seeker of God. An adult will surely enjoy these tales, and if he can share them with a child then his pleasure will be doubled!"},{"Title":"Stories for Children","review":"I had read Isaac Bashevis Singer in high school and enjoyed him. I picked up Stories for Children at the library and read it to myself straight through and found it very enjoyable. I thought my 4 and 5 year old might like it too so I read Zlateh the Goat since we're getting a lot of snow. You have to understand that basically the author has transcribed oral legend onto paper. It's the difference between reading Shakespeare and watching Hollywood doing Henry V. I have never so vividly experienced this as when I read the this story to the kids. They were rolling on the floor when the goat says Maaaa. At the end of the story the author ends one word short. Both kids shouted it out. I completely missed it when I read the book to myself silently."},{"Title":"Stories for Children","review":"I sometimes read these to my sick and elderly dad at bed time. He loves them. When he's not doing well, is worried about his health, is afraid to close his eyes, the stories work their magic. As I read, he sometimes clucks, murmers \\"oh, yes,\\" and makes other happy and endearing sounds--just great to hear. If he's still awake at the end, he goes to sleep, fearlessly, with a smile on his face."},{"Title":"Stories for Children","review":"As Singer noted in his 1984 Foreword, \\"in the beginning was the Logos, the power of the word.\\" He had never believed he could write for children, but editor Elizabeth Shub convinced him otherwise in the early 1960s. Twelve volumes of children's books followed, from which these 36 tales are gleaned. Young readers should remain eternally grateful.This collection opens in Chelm, the village of idiots young and old. Even the people have funny names--Gronam Ox, Dopey Lekisch, Zeinvel Ninny, Shmendrick Numskull and Feyvel Thickwit. The way they speak and act is still funnier.Gronam, for example, would have been a happy man, but for the elders who regularly visited--to whom he regularly spoke nonsense. His first wife Genendel would reproach him, to which he replied, \\"In the future, whenever you hear me saying something silly, come into the room and let me know. I will immediately change the subject.\\"She refused. \\"If they learn you're a fool, you'll lose your job as head of the council.\\" Instead, each time he said anything silly, she offered to hand him the key to their strongbox. \\"Then you'll know you've been talking like a fool.\\"That year, the town met with a scarcity of sour cream, which was sorely needed for the coming Pentecost, a holiday on which the townsfolk normally ate a lot of it. Gronam had the solution. He proposed making \\"a law that water is to be called sour cream, and sour cream is to be called water.\\" Given the wells full of water, he noted, all the women would have barrels full of sour cream as a result.Sender Donkey, Treitel Fool and their most foolish compatriots all heartily approved. So the new law was written. But Genendel shortly appeared with the strongbox key. When Gronam explained their arrangement, the elders grew enraged. How dare a woman suggest she knew better when wisdom or silliness had been spoken.They in turn changed another law: When Genendel believed Gronam's pronouncements silly, she should give the elders the strongbox key and let them decide. If they disagreed, she would double their portions of blintzes, cakes and tea. From that day forward, Gronam spoke freely, and Genendel hardly said a word: She was not about to serve blintzes generously.Then there is Shlemiel, also of the fabled Chelm, and as fine a businessman as the town could offer. He married Mrs. Shlemiel, whose father gave him a dowry, with which he bought a goat in Lublin. But en route home, he left the goat tethered to a tree while he went into an inn for some brandy, chopped liver and onions and a plate of chicken soup and noodles. The innkeeper (not surprisingly) switched his old blind billy goat for Shlemiel's milking goat. Lots more fun and some Chelmnick wisdom followed.Readers also encounter \\"Shrewd Todie and Lyzer the Miser.\\" The former had a wife Shaindel and seven children and never earned enough to feed them. He had such poor luck working at trades that he decided if he should make candles, the sun would never set. During an especially cold winter, Shaindel told Todie that if he could not get something to eat, she would go to the Rabbi and get a divorce. \\"And what will you do with it,\\" he asked her. \\"Eat it?\\"Lyzer meanwhile was so stingy, he'd let his wife bake bread but once every four weeks: Stale bread was eaten more slowly than fresh. He left his poor goats to feast on his neighbors' thatched roofs, rather than feed them. He preferred to eat his dry bread and borscht on a box so that his upholstered chairs would not wear out. And he never made a loan, preferring to keep his money in his strongbox.One day, Todie asked Lyzer to borrow a silver spoon, promising he would return it the next. Not one to doubt holy words, Lyzer loaned the spoon and was pleased the next day when Todie returned it, plus a silver teaspoon, explaining that the spoon had given birth. Todie was honest, and had to return both. He repeated the exercise twice more.At last, Todie came to Lyzer to borrow silver Shabbat candlesticks, which Lyzer gladly loaned. Todie sold the candlesticks, bought his wife and seven children a feast and on Sunday, returned to Lyzer, reporting that his candlesticks had died. \\"You fool! How can candlesticks die,\\" Lyzer screamed, dragging Todie to the Rabbi. \\"Did you expect candlesticks to give birth?\\" the Rabbi asked. \\"If you accept nonsense that brings you profit, you must also accept nonsense when it brings you loss.\\"Others stories are less silly. We meet Peziza the imp who lived with her friend Tsirtsur the cricket an old stove, where they shared gay, devilish, frightening, and delightful stories on long winter nights.And Rabbi Leib, who escaped the evil works of Cunegunde, a witch whose son Bolvan robbed the merchants on the roads and hid his stolen hoard in an invisible cave--rendered by his mother's evil magic.My favorite is \\"Zlateh the Goat.\\" Rueven instructed his son Aaron to take his pet to the butcher to pay for the struggling family's Hanukkah feast. Heartbroken, the heartbroken boy heeded his father and set out, but was overtaken by a snowstorm. I cannot tell what happened, but the tale warms hearts to the core.Like all Singer's work--these 36 agile stories offer spirit, life and the supernatural--with humor glinting at their edges. Children love them, be they young or old.--Alyssa A. Lappen"},{"Title":"Stories for Children","review":"I enjoy reading these stories to my kids as much as they enjoy listening to them. These are truly wonderful and riveting stories by a master, who's as comfortable writing about the old country as he is describing quaint Jewish life in Manhattan as an immigrant. Diverse, enchanting tales of everyday life, here and there, of magic and supernatural heroes of the shtetl, and of the all-knowing people and elders of Chelm. All told, the stories are the story.One caveat: a few of these stories have sexual allusions which may be (or should be) beyond the grasp of kids under 10, though most of these stories can be enjoyed even by single-digit young people."},{"Title":"Stories for Children","review":"This book is SUCH fun. I laugh until I'm threatened with incontinence when \\"The Day I Got Lost\\" describes the day of Professor Schlemiel's surprise birthday party and his schlemiel dog!!!! A collection of vignettes set both in Poland's prewar ghettoes and the recent in NY Upper East side. Funny, poignant and wonderful. I have my own copy and have BEFORE my kids were born, but have purchased copies for many loved ones and associates. He's gone, it's true - but his stories live on and on in this classic and in ALL his works. Singer correctly states how the Bible stories are the best for entertaining youngsters since they all have beginnings , middles and endings an he cut his teeth on these same stories. Who cannot love the crickets, dybuks and goats named Zlateh? One needn't be a Jew to love Singer's 'Stories for Children'. An aging Italian lady can be an ardent fan just as easily - and IS one."},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J. FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"[...]This book is very interesting and full of adventure, when I started reading this book I couldn't put it down the excitement of Sally's life was amazing and it remided me of my own.Sally J. Freedman is the main character of this book she is about 11 years old and she is curious about life's journeys. Sally is Jewish and she has some questions about her religion that you can find out if you read the book. Sally has to move to Miami Beach because her Mom is very conscientious and doesn't want her family to get sick from the cold weather in New Jersey.When Sally leaves New Jersey she has to take a train because her Mom doesn't like to fly. Sally's father, Arnold, has to stay in New Jersey because of his business. Sometimes Arnold gets to go to places like Cuba or the Goodyear Blimp. Sally gets to take one of her friends. Sally's brother, Douglas, gets to bring one of his friends, but Sally's Mom, Louise, is scared. She thinks that something bad is going to happen when she is on the blimp, but Sally's grandmother, Ma Fanny, doesn't want to go either.Near the end of the book some thing really unexpected happens but you will have to find out for yourself by reading the book.I would reccomend this book to anyone especially girls who love to learn about life. It teaches about religion and superstition but sometimes Sally makes up her own stories about what she thinks about the people around her are like there was one person who she thought was Aldof Hitler but the rest is a mystery."},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J.

It was published in 1977 and I would give it a 10 out of 5 rating. The author is Judy Blume.

After she gets to Florida she has no trouble making new friends.Sally loves to write! She writes stories about her being a great detective or being friends with her favorite movie star, Ester Williams. Sally also writes letters. She writes to Mr. Zavodsky who she thinks is Hitler under disguise, and she writes letters to her friends and her dad back home. I loved this book! Sally is someone I feel like I can relate to and is very funny. I think the moral of the story is that it is good to try new things and that it pays off to be curious!"},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J. FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"In the winter of 1947, 10-year-old Sally J. Freedman and her Jewish family (consisting of her parents; grandmother, Ma Fanny; and brother, Douglas) move to Miami Beach, Florida, from New Jersey because of her older brother's poor health. Here Sally's imagination runs wild--she believes one of her neighbors, Mr. Zavodsky, is really Adolf Hitler in disguise. She even creates numerous short stories in her head, including one where she confronts Hitler himself, as well as one in which she saves a distant relative named Lila from a grim fate in Dachau.Being separated from her father, who she calls Doey-Bird, also makes it more difficult for Sally to adjust in Florida. Yet he tries to make time for her, even though he remains in New Jersey to work. Eventually, Sally does make friends with a few of her classmates and even fantasizes about dating her own \\"Latin lover\\", Peter Hornstein, who is in her class.\\"Starring Sally J. Freedman As Herself\\" was one of the first books I ever read by Judy Blume, sometime in middle school I believe. It also happens to be one of my favorites by her.

FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"Many young people, upon hearing the name Judy Blume, immediately think of the 'Fudge' books or Blume's famous 'Are You There, God? It's Me Margaret?'-- 'Starring Sally J. Freeman As Herself' is a book that is often overlooked. Some kids might be wary of a piece about a girl growing up in the 1940s, but aside from references to the war ending and 40s pop culture, Sally is just your average 10-year-old; no different than 10-year-olds you might find today. She has a terrific imagination, loves to play games, swim, hang out with friends, dance, dream of being a star, and occasionally think about boys. Sally is one of the sweetest, most interesting little characters you'll ever read about in children's literature. The book flows from one of Sally's adventures to another. Once you get into it, you won't want to put it down. Older readers (teenagers and above) might enjoy the advanced humor that younger readers may miss. All in all, a great book, one you can read again and again."},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J. FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"Much like Betty Smith's A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Starring Sally J. Friedman contains a portrait of an era. The novel contains more than mere descriptions; I could actually feel what it was like to live in Miami right after World War II. Sally's neighborhood, the school, the beach...all were so perfectly created that I felt that I was there, spending time with Andrea and Shelby along with Sally.Probably the descriptions in this novel are so apt because this is largely an autobiographical tale. I read that Judy Blume really did spend one school year in Miami with her mother, brother and grandmother, and that many stories contained in Sally J. Friedman really happened to Judy Blume.The novel realistically addresses true concerns and fears concerning adolescence. While most people no longer worry about one of their neighbors turning out to be Adolph Hitler, children often fear things that they learn from newspapers. Their understanding of current events is often one-sided and uninformed, as they are shielded from all the facts by well-meaning adults. They fill in the gaps with their imaginations. Additionally, kids and adults alike have concerns about fitting in, keeping and making friends, and mortality.I especially enjoyed Sally's relationship with her mother and father. Her mother is a worrier...to the point that she lets much of the joy in life pass her by. Her father is more free spirited, and tries to explain to Sally why her mother behaves the way that she does. One beautiful scene in the novel occurs when Sally's dad explains that one can worry so much, that they don't enjoy what they have when they have it. Sally struggles to be more like her father, while appreciating the concerns and motivations of her mother.While this book paints a picture of an era, it contains smart prose and human insight that is timeless. As all good historical fiction does, it teaches us something about the past while involving us in a story that is universal."},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J. FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"I used to read many of Judy Blume books as a teenager, but this book together with Blume's \\"Deenie\\" have remained dear to me till this day, around 20 years later. I think there is something about this book that is able, so I feel, to address young readers and adults alike. I will not write about the content as so many people have done so before me, just about my thoughts concerning this book.Sally is looking at the adult world with open curious eyes, not always able to understand grown ups and the grown-up world. The adults in the book, on the other side, are so much better understood by me today, their characters (so well defined) and their efforts to try and raise their children according to the best of their knowledge and what they deem important in life.This book is dear to me for many reasons. First of all - the characters are so Jewish I immediately feel its close to home. I am talking about the ever worried mother, the constant haunting of the holocaust, the conversations, the Yiddish expressions... and especially my favorite character in the book which is Ma Fanny, the lovely grandmother. I love this book because of the adults efforts to build a sheltered world for the kids who are, as the mother and grandmother say \\"all my life\\" and thus sometimes protect them too much from the outside world. Because of the good yet real family relationships (\\"you are worth a million...more even\\"...) and the accurate portrayal of the family life. Sally is such a funny lovable character and her inner portrayal is rich and trustworthy."},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J. FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"Starring Sally J.

FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"I read all of Judy Blume's books when I was in junior high (I'm a ripe old 28 now), and this is the one that made the most favorable impression on me. It isn't concertedly racy or titillating, the way many of Blume's other books are; it's innocent, yet honest and certainly not overly wholesome or dull. What I liked most about it was that it gave me a bit of an education of what it must have been like to be a Jewish child around wartime; as a Catholic born in the 70's, the premise seemed almost exotic to me. Loved the book, and reading the other reviews has called up many pleasant memories!"},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J. FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"Apparently, this book is loosely based around part of Judy Blume's life at age 10, back in 1947, in Miami, just after the war. She states this in the beginning of the book. Not sure if all of it is accurate, but Sally seems to have a pretty charmed life. Black maids, trips to the beach, even a ride in the Goodyear Blimp. And her dad's a dentist. Sally herself is a sweet little girl. I enjoyed reading about the 40's pop culture references in the book such as fashion, movies and music as well as how they spoke. Sally is very hung up, obsessed even, with Adolf Hitler, it being not long after the war ended in 1947. Sally is Jewish, as is Blume, and Sally is terrified of Hitler and enjoys making up stories about Hitler with her friends.One reviewer complained of Sally and her brother discussing their parents \\"doing it\\", and how it wasn't age appropriate reading for a 10-13 year old. Not sure what alternate universe she's living in, but most kids know what sex is in the year 2011. Too bad she shut the book off, she might have liked the rest of it. It was one sentence in the book. It's a Judy Blume book for Christ's sake, not an Anne Rice novel.All in all I enjoyed the book. Sally seemed a little spoiled though and it was annoying."},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J.

My favorite part is when Sally gets stung by a Man O' War, and Douglas and Sally become better friends throughout the book. Whenever I don't know what book to read next, I pick up Sally J. It's a quick read for me, but I always feel so happy by the end of it. There are no more words I can say for this book- just read it, even if you think you're beyond Judy Blume books. You won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J. FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"To some Judy Blume has been called a controversial author. To others, she is merely another author who happens to have published many books. To those others, she is the author of the great book &quot;Starring Sally J. Freedman as Herself&quot;.Most of us who have read this can see Sally in ourselves; she's the child that's still stuck inside us. Spirited, happy, and not afraid to try new things that much - she's Daddy's little &quot;adventure girl&quot; forever - and lovable. Her friends seem to be the best friends we had as children; and her brother, although going through changes, is that pesky older brother who we loved and teased back then.Anything about &quot;Sally&quot; can bring back a flood of things we did as children: going to the beach and simply floating around in inner tubes, trying hard to get an A in penmannship, and playing old games with grandmothers and your parents. Sally seems to do it all with total grace. Playing the &quot;initial game&quot; and going out to go bike riding we haven't done for a long time.Reading this book, I wished that Sally would be my best friend. I may have been only twelve and a half, but I wished Sally could be my best friend... Sally with her immigrant grandmother, Ma Fanny, her dentist father, her wary mother, and the irresistable older brother Douglas. If only we could now have the joys Sally has. We do.

Anyways, I should get on with the synopsis of this evergreen story coupled with touches of humour.When Sally's family moves to Miami Beach in the winter of 1947 after the World War 2, Sally is excited and nervous at the same time. It will be a new adventure, but she worries about how often she will see her father, who has to stay in New Jersey to work. She also worries about fitting in with the crowd at her new school. These worries don't stop Sally from creating her wonderful, imaginative stories. One minute she's a famous movie star like Esther Williams or a brilliant detective; the next she's kissing the Latin lover of her dreams- her classmate Peter Hornstein with dark flashing eyes. And what about the Freedmans' neighbor, old Mr. Zavodsky, who looks suspiciously like Adolf Hitler in disguise? Sally vows to take revenge as she believes that it is this man who killed her relatives Tante Rose and Lila in a gas oven. On top of this, she is in her \\"tweens\\" learning about breasts and pecularities of puberty.There are so many things to worry and wonder about.

Luckily for me, she always did.I remember 'Sally J....' as being one of the bigger books I'd ever read, and one of the ones I carried around with me for days on end, sneaking a page or two during recess or in the cafeteria. I even remember having to hide my borrowed copy of 'Forever' because it had, what at that time, was a totally foreign subject matter.... s-e-x ! These days, I still don't hesitate to pick up a Judy Blume novel when it hits the shelves (or the pages of AMAZON.com). But on those rare, quiet, rainey Saturdays when all the house cleaning is done, I'll still pull out &quot;Superfudge' or 'Deenie' or 'Tales of a Forth Grade Nothing' or 'Otherwise Known as Sheila the Great' , and have a high old time flashing back to my younger years. Judy Blume is greatly responsible for forming me into the voracious reader I am today, and I can't thank her enough."},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J. FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"Sally J. Freedman has plenty of stories in her mind - one minute she's a detective and next she captures Hitler! She has all these stories in her head while her real life is going on!For one year Sally, her older brother Douglas, her mother, and her grandmother move down to Miami Beach (while her father stays in New Jersey). They did this because Douglas got really sick and after he got better the doctor said it would be good for him if he went down to Florida.Sally goes to school there and does things that normal a 5th grader does-that's what makes Judy Blume's books so unique. They are all about fictional characters that could be like anyone.I am definitly going to read more of her books!!!By Elayna B"},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J. FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"This a captivating story about a girl's life when she goes to Miami Beach in the winter with her family. Sally will most likely lock you into this story. Judy Blume really did it this time!"},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J. FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"I remember reading this in elementary school a million years ago and fell instantly in love with Judy Blume and her writing. Always worth a read."},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J. FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"My mother gave me this book when I was in the fourth grade (I was 10). I've always loved it, and my daughter read it this past school year, when she was in the 4th grade. It was her introduction to Judy Blume who I consider to be the consummate tween/young adult author. My mom gave it to me so I would have some understanding of what the world was like when she was my age, and by contrast, I thought my daughter would enjoy knowing what life was like when her grandparents were children.The parts that other parents mention about the use of the term \\"doing it\\" didn't even cross my mind - and if my daughter noticed it, she didn't mention it. Like the other reviewer said - it's 2011 and kids know about sex. Of course, if they don't get the allusion, they don't get it...and big deal if they do - if I remember correctly, she's referring to her parents \\"doing it\\" which should in no way encourage sexual promiscuity, if that's what one is worried about. That said, I'm sure some of the book went over *my* head when I read it as a ten year-old. This is certainly not a book parents should shy away from. It's great fun and a good history lesson for tweens and teens."},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J. FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"I am 73 and I absolutely loved this book. I couldn't put it down. I always assumed Judy Blume's books were for teens. After reading Sally Freedman I am now going to read all of Judy Blume's books. Sally is a wonderful character, someone I would love to meet and become friends with. Judy Blume did a wonderful job of describing Miami Beach in the 1940s. Thanks for a wonderful read."},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J. FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"This is a wonderful book for older children and teens. I am 13 years old and this is one of my favorite books! A must read for children who love reading Judy Blume books!"},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J. FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"This was always one of my favorite books by Judy Blume. I'm sure others would pick Are You There, God, but this is the one I found most relatable and interesting. I was stunned to realize that Sally is only 10 (this must be my third or fourth time reading it and I just now caught it *headdesk*). She has her moments of immaturity, but I went through the book thinking she was at least 13. No matter the age, though, I'm sure plenty of children can relate to her. This is a historical fiction book, but the way it reads, you really couldn't tell. There are references to WWII being over and Hitler, but it's still just another girl living her day-to-day life. The characters are all lovely and Sally talks to them in a very engaging way, letting us know simultaneously about her world and theirs. The one nitpicky comment I have about this book is the excessive use of ellipses. Too many conversations had those triple dot-dot-dots and it did mess with my concentration at times.Rating: 5/5"},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J.

FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"I wasn't very happy with this purchase at all. I thought I was getting a book with one cover and got another. This book was one of my favorites as a child. So I wanted that full memory. Instead of a detail filled cover I received a book with a plain old orange over. The only reason I chose this seller was because they were advertising the book with the cover that I wanted. Disappointment."},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J. FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"This book is not Judy Blume's best work, but its good for a boring summer day. It is about a girl named Sally who moves to a new home in Florida, leaving her friends behind. That's pretty much it. It tells how she adjusts to her new home and tries to follow her dreams of becoming a ballerina. This book has no plot, detail, or consistency. The only historical aspect is a couple of references to World War II. Like we haven't had enough of THOSE books. Here's a tip, just save your money and borrow it from the local library. The plot is so inert, I cannot even remember anything to describe almost. If you had to choose between reading this book and watch Lawrence Welk with your parents, go for Lawrence Welk, there's more action in a segment of that than there is in the entire book."},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J. FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"My daughters and I have read or listened to many Judy Blume books and they have read many others. We have enjoyed them all. We picked this book on tape up at the library to listen to on a car trip. I was somewhat concerned about some of the language that was being used in the book and then became very concerned when the young characters started discussing their parents \\"doing it\\". At the second reference to \\"doing it\\" we turned off the tape. I was sure I must have made a mistake about the audience this was intended for. I read the back of the tape box again and it stated that the book was recommended for listeners ages 10 to 13. I don't know about other parents, but I definitely don't think the subject of \\"doing it\\" is appropriate for 10 to 13 year olds. I was very disappointed with this. Up to this point I had trusted that any July Blume book designated for juveniles would be of age appropriate subject matter."},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J.

This is the worst book ive ever read and i read a lot. Judy Blume is a good author and i was really disapointed in her when i read this book.It also has a stupid ending.

The war has just ended, and her family is going to spend the winter in Miami to help her older brother Douglas recover from a bad kidney infection.Miami's full of wonderful new things for Sally, including warm weather, knowledgeable older friends and a totally different style of living. But at the same time, a shadow seems to linger from the war, involving things that Sally doesn't quite understand and which no one will explain to her. So, she's forced to try filling in some of the gaps herself...which is met with sometimes hilarious and sometimes heartwrenching effects.For some odd reason, this is one of Blume's least-mentioned books; although, it's certainly one of her finest."},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J. FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"In this book,which I really liked, I really connected with the girl, Sally, who grows up in 1947. She is 12 years old and says the wrong things at the wrong time. Sally, her mom, her brother, moved to Florida while her dad stays in their homestate, New Jersey. So Sally has to make new friends and get a long with her new classmates. The funniest part of the book was when Sally daydreams and makes up stories about Hitler, Latin lover, Lila, and of course the famous Ester Williams of the 1940's. This is a really great book.

FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"When I first heard about this book, i thought &quot;okay, sure I'll read it.&quot; But throughout the book, I found myself laughing and chuckling out loud at some of the things that happened in this book. I loved the way it was exquisitely written with tons of imagination. I loved how Judy showed the letters written to her father-Doey-bird, Mr. Zavodsky-supposed Adolf Hitler, and her best friend, Christine-who later changes her name to Chrissy. Many issues are brought up in this book concerning skin color and religion. I think that fact that Sally's family was Jewish gave me a little incentive as to what the religion is seeing as the world shuts its eyes when it comes down to religion. Also, the subject of colored and white captured my attention with the white woman pulling Sally away from the &quot;colored&quot; drinking fountain and lectured her about catching a disease. Another issue that comes into play is when Sally and her family are on the train and Louise, Sally's mother, sort of voices her opinion about why she shouldn't bother the colored woman and her baby and then having to explain why they were gone the next morning, grabbed my attention and made me understand that in a 10 year old's mind, race and religion are nothing and what it all comes down to,with Sally, is that imagination is everything!"},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J. FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"As a Blume fanatic as a child, this was always my favorite. Sally lives inside her over-imaginitive head and views the world accordingly. Lively, suspicious yet innocent, Sally is a handful! I read a biography of Blume, where she states that all her books are fiction except Sally, which is a loosely-based autobiography. A must-read for all young girls!"},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J. FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"Starring Sally J. Freedman as Herself is a book about a 10 year old girl, Sally, who has a wonderful imagination.The story takes place in 1947 and sally, who is a Jewish little girl, begins to think a lot about World War 2. She even believes her neighbor is really Hitler. This book is also about being a young pre teen and growing up. I would reccomend this book to all girls who are 10 or 11 years old. Before reading this book, girls should know a little about World War 2 and Hitler."},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J. FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"I highly recommend that you read the book, Starring Sally J. Freedman as Herself. I think that you should read this book because I thought that it was very exciting reading about how life was during the war in the 1940's. I never really thought about how life was so different, and how the technology today is so much better than it used to be. I was very surprised to find out that they didn't even have a TV because it had just come out. I was even more surprised at how they found other ways to entertain themselves such as: playing outside, playing cards, reading books, and playing with friends. This book was very exciting, interesting, and it was very well written. I recommend this to children between the ages of 9 through 14. This is a great book and I hope that you will read it!"},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J. FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"This is such a good book! I think it's funny too!

FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"Starring Sally J. Freedman as Herself is about a Jewish girl growing up right after World War Two. It talks about Sally's relationship with her family and friends, about her struggles with moving to a different state and about the recently-ended war. While the issues in this book are a little shallow, it very realistically portrays Sally and the various other characters."},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J. FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"I love all of Judy Blumes books. But this is one of my favorites. It Is about a girl named sally. She likes to pretend she is a famouse actor. I won't say any more cause that would spoil the book."},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J. FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"I chose this book because the other books that I saw looked boring, and this was the only book the drew my attention. Once I opened the book I did not like it. I have to say, the first few pages were kind of boring, but once I got going I couldn't stop, its the kind of book that you hate to love. I love Judy Blume books only because she writes thing that are realistic, and at this point I am loving her books. This book is strange because she thinks that a man named Mr. Zavodsky is Aldolf Hitler in disguise, and my goodness this girl lopves listening to peoples' phone calls. It is also weird because I have never heard of Man-O-Wars. Have u? Well if I have interested you in any way, then you should really read this book."},{"Title":"STARRING SALLY J.

FREEDMAN AS HERSELF","review":"Well, first off, I'll tell you that at 14, believe or not, this was the first Judy Blume book i've ever read. I mainly chose this book becuase im into 40's pop-culture and fashion, and, well, I liked the cover. About that. Sally looks a bit older than she turned out to be on it(I thought she may have been in her early teens...), so I thought this book may be suitable for my age group...As it turned out, she was a little imaginative 10 yr. old girl who made up stories and dreamed of being a ballerina...BUT, I still found it to be a fairly entertaining book, but which had no real plot to it. It really turned out to be a kids book. I sort-of think of Sally as the Anne of Green Gables of the Late 40's...I think maybe Tiger Eyes may appeal to me more..."},{"Title":"La Novia Oscura (Spanish Edition)","review":"Es un buen libro pues nos transporta m&aacute;gicamente y con una insuperable descriptiva a lo que debi&oacute; ser realmente la vida alrededor de un pueblo latinoamericano en los principios de su experiencia en el &aacute;rea de la explotaci&oacute;n petrolera.

The moniker \\"short and sweet\\" applies to it well.What Dunnington has basically done is choose many examples of positions and games where pawn play has decided the day. For advanced players, the book is more entertaining than educational, but for fairly new tournament players, it shows that pawns should not be taken lightly. I would even say that this book has left some lasting influences on my play today, as I gained an appreciation for pawns--the pawn is my favorite chess piece. I am not claiming to be a pawn-play expert, but it does strike me how poorly some Class B and A players use pawns in their play!Imaginative pawn play can definitely make a difference in your results. This is not an indispensible work, but it is well done if you choose to get it.

Yes - she left it open for a sequel when, at the end, the skeleton hides something other than the celtic cross - but isn't that what good books do - take you down more paths and leave story lines open?

Fallam's Secret appears to be a quickly slapped together story without much of an ending (she appears to be leaving the door open for sequels). Denise also tries to weave in her usual \\"isms\\" into the story - Environmentalism, Socialism, Feminism, but their role in the plot is uneven and often forced. For example, as a native West Virginia, I am not a big fan of surface/strip mining...but the inclusion of it in the book did nothing to further the plot or to explore the issue.Worst of all, her character development is way off this book. Denise's strength in writing has always been great characters: believable, well defined and explored. At the end of the Fallam's Secret, I found myself not caring at all what happened to the characters (and definitely not craving a sequel).I can't recommend this book (unless perhaps you wait for the paperback and read it at the beach)."},{"Title":"Fallam's Secret: A Novel","review":"Giardina is a favorite author, having written on a number of fascinating topics in her novels. Fallam's Secret takes a different approach, one that involves wormholes and time travel with a new twist, given recent scientific advances.When Carlo Falcone comes to West Virginia in 1918, he is poverty-stricken. After WWII he returns to West Virginia, purchases a plot of land on Fallam Mountain, where he builds his family home in the style of his beloved Italian countryside. One Christmas Eve, a tragic fire destroys their home, killing Carlo's wife and five of their children; only Carlo and the baby, Lydde, survive. The mother's body is found in the ashes, but the other bodies are never discovered and there is no reasonable answer to the absence of the children's bones. Consequently, Carlo spends the rest of his life searching for his children, leaving Lydde to be raised by her aunt and uncle.Lydde grows, attends school and graduates from college, where she develops a lifelong love of Shakespearean Theater. Lydde is an actor, living in London, until she reaches a certain age, at which time she takes a position as a teacher. Her Uncle John begs Lydde to return home, hinting of an important discovery there, but unwilling to divulge the details prematurely. Unfortunately, she doesn't come home until her uncle's funeral.Lydde searches through John's personal papers until she finds a key and specific directions for passing through an opening in a cave John stumbled across years earlier. Following the very specific directions, Lydde falls through time like Alice down the rabbit hole, turning up in a village in 1657 England, where she meets her Uncle John, alive. Surprisingly, both are younger, Lydde in her early twenties. John explains about \\"wormholes\\" in space and \\"thin places\\" where one dimension may be accessible to another, all explained by quantum physics and imagination. No longer wild theories, such possibilities are seriously considered in the world of physics.The story is believable through the first half of the book, but once Lydde finds herself in 17th century England, the tale turns into a fairy tale. Lydde's adventures work well enough until morphing into a romance novel when she meets the man of her dreams, a sort of Robinhood redux. Thereafter she enters into a passionate, fated romance, one made possible by the gift of a younger, fresher physical body. Lydde makes a critical decision about traveling through time and the future of her love affair, but the story is, at best, formulaic.The plot device is not as interesting as I have come to expect from the accomplished Giardina, although historically accurate. The premise is interesting: time travel, wormholes and contiguous worlds. Still, the author offers no conclusions, giving the reader, instead, a simple tale of romance and escapism.

Being that it was published in 2003, maybe there's still hope for a follow up; she can't leave it with the skeleton still in the cave!!! I just can't imagine them getting so close and then failing. On the edge of your seat page turner! ENJOY"},{"Title":"Fallam's Secret: A Novel","review":"I finished this book and the only reason that I finished it was because my library was closed. This book waivers across too many genres. It is about time travel and explores the ideas of paradox, wormholes, and the math involved. But I have just gone as deep as the book did in these areas. Then it changes to a fantasy book, then a 18th century religious-political book, then finally a love book. At no point does this book really suck, but at no point does it really stand out.I found that it read really slow and at the end of the book it sounded like Ms. Giardina got tired of the characters and finished the book.I am not angry that I read the book but I also cannot suggest the book to anyone."},{"Title":"Fallam's Secret: A Novel","review":"I liked Ms. Giardina's story. Set in south-central West Virginia, Ms. Giardina weave the history of the area with the local roadside tourist attractions and creates an entertaining story. Lyddie, with her obscure beginnings, returns home when her beloved uncle (and guardian) dies. While going through his belongings, she finds a key to a red door, located in a local tourist attraction. As she explores the underground cavern, and yes, is transported in time to 17th century England, she unlocks the secrets of her family and her passions.Appalachia has a mysticism that appeals to many people. Fallam's Secret tells a story that contains the mysticism, the grit, and the integrity of an isolated group of people."},{"Title":"Fallam's Secret: A Novel","review":"I read reviews that compared this to the Oultlander series. Although set in Puritain England, it does have a fiesty heroine falling for a very unenlighted man. The writing is pedestrian and the plot obvious. Read her first novel &#34;Storming Heaven&#34; to see what she can really do."},{"Title":"Fallam's Secret: A Novel","review":"I did not purchase this book. I found it on a table at the library with other books about Time Travel. I grabbed this one up on a whim because it sounded good. I'm glad I checked it out to read. It was hard to put down. I like a good time travel book. I have never heard of Denise Giardina before and just now I finished reading Fallam's Secret and am sad to learn there isn't a second book to pick up where this one left off. I want more! What has happened to Noah and Lydde? Do they make it to Virginia? What did Uncle John discover when he came through the Mystery Hole with Bounder for the last time? Does he find another worm hole and find Lydde? Don't leave me hanging! I don't want to use my imagination to determine what happened. I want Denise Giardina to write another book to continue on with the story... pleaaaaase! Double darn that there isn't a part two but I still enjoyed this book. I'm glad I read it."},{"Title":"Fallam's Secret: A Novel","review":"I picked up this book from the free shelf at our local library. The only reason I snagged it was because it mentioned time travel. So I was incredibly surprised to discover a novel of beauty, sorrow and depth that reminded me of a mix between the Time Traveler's Wife and Robin Hood. This is not a romance. It is a drama about a woman who lives an empty life as an actress, then gets a 2nd chance to live those years again, in a different century. There is a lot of fun time travel bits with her and her uncle crossing into 1657, and then people from that era crossing into the modern world. And there is always the underlying question in the book of if it really is the past, or if it is just an alternate world, since many people from our current world appear in the 1657 world. But regardless of what time or world she lives in, Lydde struggles with the same issues of Faith, of gender roles, and of Love. I thought the issue of personal faith was addressed beautifully in several areas of the story. And the ending, the last few paragraphs alone, was fabulous! You are left wondering who the skeleton in the cave really is - what metal did the uncle find? Was it Lydde's ring? Was it the lighter? And if it was Lydde's ring, does that mean that she died and Noah wore her ring on the chain with his cross? Or was the ring on the skeleton's finger, and that means Lydde wore Noah's neckace? I loved the open ending, although I hated it as well!"},{"Title":"Fallam's Secret: A Novel","review":"As I started reading this novel, I was struck by the many similarities between Fallam's Secret and The Outlander Series by Diana Galbaldon. Given the choice, I would strongly urge someone to read The Outlander series instead. As a reviewer before noted, Diana Gabaldon's books really give you a feel for the past and more insight into the characters. Fallam's Secret so closely resembles The Outlander series, that I was able to predict many scenes and the end of the book. If you have already read Diana Gabaldon's books, go ahead and read this and see if you come to the same conclusions."},{"Title":"Fallam's Secret: A Novel","review":"In my opinion (and what is a review but an opinion?), this book is not the greatest. It seemed to me simply to be a rehashed telling of Outlander by Diana Gabaldon. Girl goes back in time, girl falls in love with a somewhat rebellous character, girl stays in the past. This book lacked the detail of Outlander and seemed to gloss over historical details as well. It is more of a romance in a historical setting, with little to no details as to food, dress, customs, etc. It doesn't give much detail as to how a person from present times would have trouble adjusting to the past. Indeed, it seems to slide right past all that.Also, this book leaves you hanging at the end, feeling unfufilled as the story does not come to a conclusion. The book was long enough, but by ending as it does the reader almost feels cheated. If I were you, I'd try Outlander instead. If you've read that, you may want to read this one, just for kicks. The similarities will either amuse or frustrate you, as they did me."},{"Title":"Beside the Sleeping Maiden: Poets of Marin","review":"BESIDE THE SLEEPING MAIDEN was given to me as a gift. It's a beautiful book with poems by many of the talented poets who live in Marin County, California. The anthologist, C.B. Follett, is a poet and an artist; and she has applied both those qualities to the production of this volume. The book has a luminous jacket and various drawings among its poems. The wonderful, thought-provoking but eminently readable poems float in a sea of white, so one can see and think about each one separately. This makes it an excellent book for people like me who always try to read and do too much. I can open it up anywhere at random and spend either a little or a lot of time with it. In fact I like BESIDE THE SLEEPING MAIDEN so much that I've bought several copies and given them away as gifts. ...Susan Terris"},{"Title":"Beside the Sleeping Maiden: Poets of Marin","review":"C.B.Follett's &quot;Beside The Sleeping Maiden&quot; is cause for rejoicing.

The books however were a little smaller than what I anticipated since the last time I reviewed these same books was at a local library, but nevertheless I was impressed that the books did come in a compacted design. For what better way to show off the design tool called the Modulor by placeing a picture of it on it's very own jacket that comes with the books. You feel as if the whole box set is some sort of handy carpenters tape measure to carry 'round with you.The inside of the book is full of explanatory remarks about perfecting, creating and applying this human scale ruler which incorporates the practical use of what is termed the Golden Section and thereby adhereing it to his/your own building designs. For those of you who are avid Golden Ratio/Section seekers these two books are a great gift idea and a great collectors item.The books also include many letters too from his colleagues who critique and sometimes try to disprove his modular idea, that it really works.I have included pictures to show you the overall appearance of both books and its smart jacket design. Therefore I say an excellant choice and would recommend to college students, Architects, and all those versed in the Arts in general"},{"Title":"The modulor;: A harmonious measure to the human scale universally applicable to architecture and mechanics,","review":"Le Corbusier fans and students know the couragous contributions this great architect gave the world. Le Modulor is the tool with which he created his great works and belived that this tool is accessable to all. A tool that assists the designer to ensure proportion is always (if not most of the time) correct, true, and beautiful. Le Modular addresses the philosophy behind the tool and discusses the usablity of the tool.Another excellent book is \\"Geometry of Design: Studies in Proportion and Composition\\" by Kimberly Elam. It is short on words, adequate on images, and terrific at explaining in an elemental way the use of proportioning tools."},{"Title":"The modulor;: A harmonious measure to the human scale universally applicable to architecture and mechanics,","review":"Le Corbusier had been working for some time on his Modulor system using these French decimal measurements but without much success. Then one of his collaborators, Py, said: &quot;Isn't the height we are working with rather a French height? Have you ever noticed that in English detective novels the hero is always six feet tall?&quot; Le Corbusier continues: &quot; We then applied this standard. To our delight, the graduations of a new Modulor, based on a man six feet tall, translated themselves into round figures in feet and inches&quot;.

But, some very witty barbs, particularly about women and patriotism, and self-seeking nations. Nothing, simply nothing has changed on that score since 1923, when this book was written. The Irish, the Serbs-Croats, Russians, Turks, and Greeks, all is the same. Woman disguised as man - shades of \\"The Crying Game\\" or \\"M. Butterfly\\" in reverse. But no sex."},{"Title":"The yellow knight of Oz,","review":"Like so many others, I was captivated as a child by the OZ series of L. Frank Baum. I had all of his books and knew that others had been written after his death because they were always listed on the end leaves. Unfortunately, they were out of print. No longer.As a general rule, Ruth Plumly Thompson's Oz books are nowhere near as good as Baums. This volume is no exception but is her best work so far. She does a good job of evoking the magic of Oz in her books but, too often, the stories are rather simplistic and fraught with coincidence. They are enjoyable but pale in comparison to the original. This work, \\"The Yellow Knight of Oz\\", is good enough to be ranked with Baum's books.Thompson frequently alludes to many of Baum's characters and they often appear in her works but she has created some new characters of her own as well. Judging by how often Sir Hokes of Pokes appears, he must have been one of her favorites. In this volume he takes center stage. In fact, all of the Baum characters are just peripherals. It may be that working entirely with her own creations has improved the quality of her work. This story is certainly the best of hers so far.Sir Hokus goes off on a quest. He is joined by an American boy. After a number of adventures, he clears up some early history of Oz and restores 2 kingdoms. He finds a nice wife for himself along the way.Like all of Thompson's books, this one satisfies a need for more things Ozzian. In this case, it does so with a refreshing flair and is an ejoyable read."},{"Title":"The yellow knight of Oz,","review":"I loved it! Thompson mixes traditional epic fantasy with Ozzy silliness to create another glorious Oz book. Good for reading to your kids, if you have any. If you don't, it,s still a good choice.

Unfortunately, &quot;Regional Foods of Southern Italy&quot; did not live up to my hopes and expectations for two reasons. First, many of the preparations are too complex to reflect the simplicity of southern Italian cooking. The ornate recipe for &quot;caponata,&quot; a simple, delicious Sicilian classic, is a good example. Second, the prose is seriously overwrought, and constantly deterred me from enjoying the rich historical and cultural material the author compiled for this book. In all candor, there are other books about southern Italy, its cultures, and its foods that are superior to this one in both content and style."},{"Title":"Regional Foods of Southern Italy","review":"This is an extraordinary book. I have never had a &quot;cookbook&quot; like this one and have come to treasure Marlena De Blasi's work. Like the other reviewers, I would agree that this is not a simple, &quot;learn the basics of Italian cooking&quot; cookbook. It is, however, well worth the time spent learning about these recipes and their cultural context. Ms De Blasi succeeds in connecting the reader with the spirit, with the essence, with the history and the context of cooking in Southern Italy. Each recipe, or group of recipes, is preceeded by wonderful descriptions of where, when and how the dish was made over the centuries. It give the reader a feel for the people who developed these recipes over time, and the forces that led them to create. I have read the cookbook cover to cover and found it delightful. Surprisingly open but a great pleasure as you get to know Marlena and her husband. I have also cooked about 2 dozen of the recipes. Some are somewhat complicated but nearly all turned out wonderfully. Some of the greatest successes are the seafood (particularly mussels done several different ways and a roasted rockfish/sea bass) and the many (often simple) pastas. Regional Foods of Southern Italy is a rare, and invaluable, find."},{"Title":"Regional Foods of Southern Italy","review":"In the world of sugo gia pronto (prepared pasta sauce) and frozen TV dinners, there are subtly scented dishes that were prepared in the meticulous way by women whose lifestyle was much more different from ours. Not to romanticize the times past too much, but there is no doubt that some of the traditional cuisines are in the danger of extinction. Not that many young Italian women even know how to prepare proper caponata, not to mention more elaborate dishes. As someone who lived in Italy, I am well aware of this. I must say that I thank my grandmothers who instilled in me the love of cooking and love of life.Onto the book... I admit that Marlena's prose can be a bit overwrought, however after making some of the recipes from her book, I am smitten. I loved caponata (time consuming, no doubt, but what marvelous flavour! Subtle, delicate, with the right degree of sourness and pungency.) Do buy the book, if only for this recipe. Her pasta sauce recipes are great and many are very easy to put together. I would not recommend this as an introduction to Italian cooking, however any Italian food lover should have this and her Northern Italy counterpart in their collection. Mille grazie, Marlena!"},{"Title":"Regional Foods of Southern Italy","review":"What a wonderful book! The stories associated with the recipes are just amazing. Especially the story of Elisabetta, the seventy year old restaurateur--who began her career at the age of sixty-one--that told the author she has just come into her stride. The Polenta with Braised Pork and Roasted Red Peppers recipe that was included with this story was great.If you have an opportunity to purchase this book, and you have the time and patience to allow some of these recipes to develop you and whoever you serve will be richly rewarded. There are recipes of seafood, pasta, pork and lamb. Some of the recipes are quick and simple, with simple ingredients. Some of the recipes require more ingredients, as well as time. However, my book is marked with post-it-notes on many recipes that I cannot wait to present to my family."},{"Title":"Regional Foods of Southern Italy","review":"Anyone interested in traditional regional recipes of Italy would enjoy owning this book. As the Italian Food host at BellaOnline, regional Italian cuisine is a special interest of mine. It is very evident as one reads through each chapter that Ms. Blasi has put a great deal of time into researching the southern regions of Italy, it's people and their cuisine. It is much more than a mere cookbook as great care has gone into describing each region which is encompassed in it's own chapter containing a brief bit of the region's history.As each chapter unfolds, Ms. Blasi shares with us the traditional specialties of that region, with page after page of delicious recipes. I particularly enjoyed the recipes used to celebrate the major Italian holidays.Although I found it disappointing that this book contained no photographs or illustrations, which would only have enhanced my opinion of this book, I was pleased that the majority of recipes called for every day ingredients. There are a number of game recipes, but on the whole, most recipes could easily be created by the average individual who shops at their local grocery or Italian specialty store.I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in regional Italian cooking and it's history. However, it is probably not the best book for someone looking for a basic Italian cookbook."},{"Title":"Regional Foods of Southern Italy","review":"Was interesting and helped me understand the way food was approached for my trip to Rome.

If you are looking for simple, rustic, italian recipes, there are plenty of other books to chose from.

December comes soon and it's winter on the farm. She has saved the sunflower seeds from the flower she has planted and feeds then to the birds.I liked the illustrations in the book. They were bright and colorful and added lots to the text.This is a wonderful picture book for kids and a great resource for teachers when teaching about plant life and the four seasons."},{"Title":"The Happy Hollisters on a River Trip (The Happy Hollisters, No. 2)","review":"I wrote my original review for this book back in the August 2005. It was somewhat difficult to obtain books in this series at that time. Since then, Andrew E. Svenson III, grandson of the author, and other family members have been working to re-release the Happy Hollister series for new generations. This book is now available as a paperback and a Kindle edition. The paperback has all the original illustrations.The Happy Hollisters are somewhat of a relic of an era gone by. The family consists of five children, Pete, Pam (Pamela), Ricky, Holly, and Sue, and their parents Mr. and Mrs. Hollister. The family pets include Zip, a collie, and White Nose, a cat, who has five kittens in this book. Mr. Hollister purchases a store called The Trading Post, which sounds similar to general stores in days gone by.Throughout the series, the children solve mysteries, usually as a family. In this book, the children befriend a boy named Bobby. Bobby is living with Farmer Gillis, as his mother went out west to earn money. She had promised that as soon as she had earned some money she would return for Bobby. Farmer Gillis was mean to Bobby, making him sell cookies and vegetables. When Bobby wanted to have a little fun, Farmer Gillis yelled at Bobby. Farmer Gillis told Bobby that he was ungrateful.The Hollister children learn that Bobby's grandfather, Moses Twigg, disappeared and that Bobby and his mother were unable to find him. The children also learn from a local banker that Moses Twigg had money in the bank that had been there for 19 years. If the money remained in the bank one more year, it would have to go to the state.It is not long before Bobby disappears, and everyone, the police and the Hollisters included, are out looking for Bobby. The Hollisters travel in their Uncle Russ's new boat on the Muskong River (which seems to be an imaginary place) to see if they can locate Bobby. The adventures they have will delight younger children.The Happy Hollisters series remains a reasonably good, if somewhat outdated, read for younger children, perhaps from ages 4 to 9. I suspect that by age 9 most children are entranced by pursuits that are more modern. In addition, many children may consider families of five children to be somewhat unusual and that may take some explaining. These books may be an excellent way to introduce children to the changes that have taken place in our society over the past half century.While the original hardback books have become somewhat difficult to find, as I noted above, this edition is available once again as a paperback and a Kindle edition. With continued interest, perhaps the Svenson family will be able to reprint the entire series and entertain another generation or two of children. Even if my grandchildren do not find these books interesting, I still love them!I hope you enjoy The Happy Hollisters. They are a reminder of a simpler age.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Happy Hollisters on a River Trip (The Happy Hollisters, No. 2)","review":"As with all the Happy Hollister books ,I loved reading it over and over.

This is especially so for those who enjoy very lengthy and detailed descriptions of basic physical actions. Parodies of scholarship and learning are central, a humanist which supposedly puts Man in his proper place, an unending listfulness which finds catalogues too can be a source of delight, characters for whom our sympathy does not matter profoundly as they seem more allegorical representations than real characters. The genius of a mind inquiring for itself and mocking what it has been endlessly retold. Out of this skeptical , ironic, vast intelligence comes a comic masterpiece I have always found almost impossible to read, and honestly to my own limitation, not that funny at all."},{"Title":"Dreams of the Soul: The Yogi Sutras of Patanjali","review":"I give this book a TEN because it has aided me in my ownspiritual journey.

These interpretations in some instances stray far from the sutra meaning. In other instances, the cross references with Christian and Biblical references may help those not familiar with things Eastern. There is no reference to the original Sanskrit words and roots that I find essential in understanding the meanings. I believe that this is a good first book for those who have little exposure to Indian scripture. I would hope people would find their interest piqued enough by this book to go deeper."},{"Title":"Dreams of the Soul: The Yogi Sutras of Patanjali","review":"The observation that the Taj Mahal, depicted on the front cover, is an Islamic monument and not a Hindu one, is certainly correct, but I think its use at a cover for a translation of the sutras of Patanjali is brilliant. The Moghul emperors of India, one of whom had the Taj built, were mostly Sufis and dedicated to finding principles commonly held by ALL religions in their domain, the major ones being Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, Jain, Christianity. For the author to explore these common links within the text of this book in the context of the sutras is useful for those just starting to explore the underpinnings of Yoga philosophy or the roots of Buddhism. His new-agey, faux-history of Atlantis and its supposed connection to culture, language, and scriptures of India in the introduction can be easily dismissed. Yes, Barbara Miller's translation is superior, but this one is not at all bad."},{"Title":"Dreams of the Soul: The Yogi Sutras of Patanjali","review":"Why are Patanjali's classical Yoga Sutras suddenly called YogI Sutras? How can somebody mis-spell a classic? Imagine calling Milton's 'Paradise Lost' as 'Paradise Loser'. Weird. Or may be not. May be it's plain ignorance.Most egregious in terms of the ignorance begins with the use of an Islamic tomb (Taj) on the cover of a most sacred Hindu classic. Yes, in spite of countless Hindu motifs, pictures, and sculptures being very easily accessible. Did the author ever hear of AUM?Hindu spiritual practices were brutally punished by the Islamic conquerors as what they called \\"false religion\\" of non-believers and the practitioners slaughtered by the thousands. No offence meant to a practising Muslim yogi, if any at all, but why, say, publish a Bible with a picture of the Kaaba at Mecca on its cover?Stop muddling up. If one does not know, then learning instead of writing is often a better option. Barbara Miller and many others have done good jobs in translating the timeless Sutras. Spare this wacky Shah Jahan school of Islamic Yoga."},{"Title":"Notre Dame Golden Moments: 20 Memorable Events That Shaped Notre Dame Football","review":"This is a great book for fans of the Fighting Irish.

(Though I wonder why some of the footage from later years looks like practice film instead of TV broadcast tape.)The book is the best part. It doesn't just give a play-by-play of each game, but talks about the interesting stories leading up to and after the games.Seminole fans, stay home."},{"Title":"Notre Dame Golden Moments: 20 Memorable Events That Shaped Notre Dame Football","review":"I was thrilled with the book!

THe part I like most is when they made up. Simple things like how Daniel knew that Blaine loved him massaging his scalp, and how the the author managed to impart to the readers the closeness and the sense of fatalistic familiarity and mutual dependency of a couple who were meant to be for each other is just so ah .. so romantic :-).The character Blaine and Daniel were just so endearing to your heart that you wish they were real.I am helplessly romantic guy, so if you are just like me,please, this book IS FOR YOU!"},{"Title":"I'm Your Man","review":"Even if this book is out of stock, I highly recommend to everyone who enjoyed the previous books in this \\"Manhattan\\" gay series to read I'm Your Man. I read it after reading what could be considering a sequel, When You Don't See Me, the story of Nick, Blaine's nephew that right in this book comes to live with his uncle Blaine, but that is in the final chapters and so, if you don't read it in order, you have some spoilers (exactly as I did now, but that is a minor one).Basically I'm Your Man is the obvious sequel of It Had To Be You, the book where Daniel and Blaine meet and fall in love. It's a good book, a nice and comfortable romance, with a right dose of sex, but not overwhelming; like all the books in this series, it's more important the net of friendships that develops like a flood, overwhelming everyone who falls under it. They are all living between Eau Claire, small town, and Manhattan, big city, but apparently there is no difference, sometime Manhattan is as small, and butchering, and gossiping, like Eau Claire, if not much.One of the most interesting things, at the same harder to remember if you don't read the book one after the other, but also comforting, like you are meeting with old friends, is that everyone seems to be the boyfriend/girlfriend, or former boyfriend/girlfriend, of someone else. When I'm Your Man starts, Blaine is living the aftershock of his breakup with Daniel: they fought over some stupid argument, and maybe helped by the stress of both jobs, but also by the stress coming from being in that stage of life when you have to stop be boyfriends and you have to become partner, they didn't manage to overcome it. Blaine wonders from friend to friend, and sometime this lead him to have sex with some of them: I think Blaine is searching comfort, and family, something he wanted with Daniel. One of these men is Ethan, former boyfriend of Martin, best friend of Daniel; one of Blaine's best friend is Adam, partner of Jeremy, ex-boyfriend of Daniel; Blaine accepts to be the sperm donor for Gretchen, who will start a relationship with Gwendy, Daniel's sister... see? Everyone and everything link Blaine to Daniel, and so, even if they are not together, I really didn't feel the sadness of the breakup, it's not like the authors spoiled the happily ever after of It Had To Be You, this was only the obvious sequel, and the development of Blaine's character. Even if he was Daniel's partner in It Had To Be You, that book was all about Daniel, and Blaine needed his space and story.I really like this series, since the characters felt real, even if they are soap opera actors, guru of the advertisement, or super top models... their lives are not all glittering, and they have the ordinary trouble that falling in love gives. They love and fight, they make peace and mistake again, and every time it's not like in a \\"romance\\", but like it could happen to you; only that for them, maybe there is a paparazzi ready to shoot them and plastering they face on the media.A little warning, I read When You Don't See Me before this one, and it did spoil me a bit the final; plus that book was good but sad. Between this and that story there are years, not only in the storyline, but also in the release dates of the book. I think the authors changed, in many ways: as writers but also as men and women. So you have the idea to read all these books, read them in order."},{"Title":"I'm Your Man","review":"At first page I could not believe we were going to follow Blaine Dunhill for this full book. During the first book, \\"It Had To Be You\\", Blaine was a main character and during book 2, \\"He's The One\\", he faded to the background. I was worried because I was not sure I wanted to be a part of Blaine's drama again. I however by the end of the first chapter was in love with all of my family of characters again. I cried with Blaine and even learned a few things about myself. I do not think you can understand how the team of writers that make Timothy James Beck (4 writers) can make these characters attach themselves to your heart until you read the three books in this series. I am sold on this writer and will be happy to take any journey with them. I just hope they bring back the Wisconsin/New York family I love sometime in the future.I say this is a series that is a true gay soap opera with plenty of romance and inner soul searching. Please pick these books up for the summer and enjoy as much as I do."},{"Title":"I'm Your Man","review":"OK, I admit to being a bit of a snob. Not that I am in to high art, but I always liked to think of myself as above the new glut of mass market gay paperbacks. This series of books, and you should read all three, proves me wrong. They are well written and highly entertaining. I was compelled to move on from one book to the next, and was disappointed when I hit the end of the series.Then came the real mindblower. At the back of this entry in the series, it comes out that the author of the book is actually authorS! Four of them who write together via mail. I wish I had known this before hand, as I would have looked for changes in voice - in retrospect, it all feels seamless.Go for it, and have a good time."},{"Title":"I'm Your Man","review":"I'M YOUR MAN is the third book published by that talented foursome known as Timothy James Beck. The three novels detail the lives of several friends, most of whom live in New York City, but are originally from Eau Claire Wisconsin. IT HAD TO BE YOU concentrates on the budding relationship between Daniel, a recently retired female impersonator, and Blaine, an up and coming advertising executive. HE'S THE ONE focuses on Adam, a hunky computer wiz, and Jeremy, a struggling actor and a former lover of Daniel's. In I'M YOUR MAN, Daniel, and Blaine, are once again the primary protagonists.The story, this time around, is told from Blaine's point of view. Blaine and Daniel have broken up and the split was anything but amicable. Each said horrible things to the other, and both are terribly bitter. Of course they still love each other madly, so moving on for both is proving extremely difficult. Daniel, currently the most hated/loved villain on daytime's popular Secret Splendor, is filming a TV movie in Hollywood, while Blaine continues on in New York. Blaine is a mass of battling emotions. He really misses his ex-boyfriend, but he remains angry over a deception he feels Daniel perpetrated on him. He wants desperately to get on with his life but his feelings for Daniel just won't go away. When a mutual lesbian friend, Gretchen, suggests Blaine have a child with her, Blaine struggles with his decision. He and Daniel wanted to raise children one day and he feels guilty about going ahead with the plan on his own.With humor and compassion, I'M YOUR MAN, deals with many issues facing the 21st century gay community. Family relationships, gay families, child rearing, transgender acceptance, public outing, and personal honesty and forgiveness are all tackled with equal sincerity. While slightly more idealistic in nature, I found I'M YOUR MAN to be reminiscent of the best of William J Mann, a personal favorite. There is an underlying honesty here that is rare in popular gay fiction.In each subsequent installment the characters have evolved and grown, as have the writing chops of the authors. I'M YOUR MAN maintains the romantic warm tone of its predecessors, but it's definitely a deeper and more involving read. I heartily recommend all of Timothy James Beck's novels, but especially this emotionally fulfilling joyride."},{"Title":"I'm Your Man","review":"I've been waiting for a year with something akin to baited breath for the release of I'M YOUR MAN, even though the preview I read in the paperback version of HE'S THE ONE made me a little nervous (more about that later). I'm happy to say that I'M YOUR MAN was definitely worth the wait.I'M YOUR MAN is the third novel by Timothy James Beck (actually four authors: two named Timothy, one named James and one named Becky) that focuses on a group of gay men, most of whom have migrated from Eau Claire, WI to Manhattan. The central characters in this third volume are Daniel and Blaine, who were also at the heart of the first novel, IT HAD TO BE YOU, but with two major differences. Unlike the first book, which was narrated by Daniel, we see everything from the perspective of Blaine. And unlike the rollercoaster experience of budding love Daniel had in the first book, Blaine is dealing with a bad break-up with Daniel. (This is where my nervousness came in, because I loved Daniel and Blaine as a couple.)I would liken TJB's three novels with another favorite series of mine, Armistead Maupin's TALES OF THE CITY series. While twists and turns in the plot are not as frequent as with Maupin's books, you have witty dialogue and richly drawn characters, full of both grace and flaws. And in this third volume, the characters have grown and filled out to the point that one wishes they were flesh-and-blood people that you could make part of one's circle of friends. In fact, when I have gone back and reread IT HAD TO BE YOU and HE'S THE ONE, it has felt something like revisiting old friends.Also like Maupin did with San Francisco, TJB has made Manhattan a character rather than just a setting for the stories. As a New York City resident, I feel like I'm part of the story when Blaine bumps into Daniel at Whole Foods for the first time since their break up, or Blaine walks through Central Park, visiting his and Daniel's old haunts. Just as Daniel's subway experiences in IT HAD TO BE YOU and Adam and Jeremy's first meeting at The Big Cup in HE'S THE ONE lent a sense of realism to this frothy fiction, the attention to detail, I think, really brings this world to life. I also enjoy the pop culture references throughout the series, whether it's Daniel accidentally going into a Star Trek: The Next Generation-themed bar, Adam and Jeremy's \\"Evita\\" riff when they meet an Eva Per&oacute;n look-alike (hopefully the Patti LuPone \\"Evita\\" and not the Madonna version!), or Blaine's tendency to be reminded of commercials in certain situations.TJB's dialogue is witty and edgy at times, like Maupin's or Christian McGlaughlin's, but the sentimental and romantic passages or also well written. The dialogue rarely feels contrived; in fact, TBJ has a way of writing naturalistic conversation that still impart to the reader the exposition and plot points we need to know.But I think what I like best about I'M YOUR MAN (as I did with the previous two novels) is seeing the arc of the narrator's development. Blaine, who has been somewhat closeted in the first two books, is only a little more open at the beginning of this story, but he grows to accept and embrace his own sexuality and the diversity of his community. Yet TJB makes this growth realistic. Blaine has to overcome his own internalized homophobia and has trouble doing so at times. His reactions when his ex, Daniel, dawns drag hark back to his hostility and discomfort with drag and the men who dawn it. Yet at least now he knows it is HIS problem, not the drag queens' and certainly not Daniel's. But Blaine is a changed man by the end this story, and his story is both engaging and authentic. (SPOILER: I was also thrilled that Blaine and Daniel reunite at the end!!)I understand that TJB is at work on a fourth novel, but that this novel will not center on any of the characters I have come to know and love. While I welcome a \\"new universe\\" from these authors, I do hope they return to these marvelous characters again. After all, we haven't had a story from Jeremy's point of view, and I have a feeling that there could be an interesting story there (as long as it doesn't involve breaking up with Adam-I don't think I could take the heartache again!) And, hey, if it turns out that Jeremy shares my obsession with \\"Angel\\" and \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\\" that'd be another reason for me to love TJB's world. Until then, I'll have to keep satisfied by re-reading IT HAD TO BE YOU, HE'S THE ONE, and now, I'M YOUR MAN."},{"Title":"I'm Your Man","review":"\\"I'm Your Man,\\" the third book in Timothy James Beck's New York trilogy, is the story of Blaine Dunhill, a Manhattan advertising executive, and Daniel Stevenson, an up and coming TV actor. After a series of unfortunate misunderstandings, and regrettably nasty fights, they broke off their three year relationship. Blaine, still deeply in love with Daniel, is heartbroken.Beck revisits many friends from the two previous novels, \\"It Had It Be You,\\" and \\"He's the One.\\" Gretchen, their lesbian financial planner friend, had decided she wanted to become a mother before her biological clock ran out. She knew that Blaine and Daniel had discussed the possibility of having children, and that Daniel had put the baby idea out of his mind because of his busy TV taping schedule. Gretchen knew that Blaine still wanted children, so she asked him to be her sperm donor. Blaine wasn't sure he was prepared for such a big step, but he and Gretchen both wanted the same thing--a father willing to be active in the child's life.During a visit to Eau Claire, Wisconsin, his home town, Blaine sought the advice of friends, Adam and Jeremy. They reminded him that Gretchen was Daniel's friend first. How would Daniel feel about a child if there was the possibility of reconciliation? But, since he believed Daniel was no longer a part of his life, Blaine agreed. He and Gretchen decided not to tell their close knit group of friends about the baby until after the planned wedding extravaganza of their friends, supermodel Sheila, and photographer Josh.Timothy James Beck's plot is full of twists and turns, starts and stops. The author is so adept at character development that we not only knew each character well, we even felt like we knew what they preferred to wear and eat. We knew where they lived and what their apartments looked like, though the author never wasted extra words on tedious descriptions. We readers experienced corporate board meetings, location photo shoots, and we walked the streets of Manhattan, absorbing its atmosphere.\\"I'm Your Man,\\" far more than a simple reading experience, is a visit with old friends Daniel, Blaine, Gretchen, Jeremy and Adam, and others. We experience their camaraderie as we root for Blaine and Daniel to reconcile, but will they?Each of Timothy James Beck's novels is a complete and an enjoyable read in itself, but reading the novels in order of publication gives the reader insight into all the characters' backgrounds, and enhances the enjoyment of reading the three books. \\"I'm Your Man,\\" is another grand slam of a novel-a highly recommended five star read.\\"For a fun experience, visit www.timothyjamesbeck.com and meet all the characters."},{"Title":"I'm Your Man","review":"Hunky, cocky Blaine found the love of his life -- and threw him away by over-reacting to some news his honey should have told him himself. Daniel plays his cards too close to his chest and lost his honey when he withheld important information he should have shared early on. They were both thoroughly guilty for the break-up: one made stupid, inaccurate assumptions when he heard part of the information his honey withheld from him. Both remained deeply in love with the other, but neither had the courage to say \\"I'm sorry\\" and bring about the reconciliation. I was so frustrated with the inability of either to start the inevitable conversation and the dependency of the plot line on neither communicating well. Yet, by the end of the book, I'd decided that it was better that they didn't reconcile quickly, because the pain and aloneness forced Blaine to grow up (as Daniel told him to do). One of the joys of the book (in addition to the final scenes) was watching Blaine learn about himself and grow to be a big enough man to deserve Daniel at the end. I look forward to the future books in this universe."},{"Title":"I'm Your Man","review":"Okay, before I begin, I'd like to point you towards my reviews of 'It Had to Be You,' and 'He's the One,' and to say, simply, \\"Go; Buy; Enjoy.\\" It's not that you'd be totally lost reading these out of order (I came at the series ass-backwards with the ass book first, so to speak), but I would have to say that the third book won't have the same gut-punching beginning if you've not read the other two.Namely, the position of Blaine and Daniel as ex-boyfriends.It's not just that I've become something of a romantic since I actually manage to land one of those ephemeral 1% of sane gay men to date (no really, they exist!) - I read the other two when I was hip deep in single status, and they were quite an uplifting read. They had candy content, don't get me wrong (I mean, hello, everyone is described deliciously), but there were a few scenes that made me stop and think, which one doesn't often expect in fun reading. Most specifically, the \\"two saddest words\\" component of one of the tales ground me to a halt, until I finally found my own personal answer, and it has become a standard question I ask of people by the by.Geez - am I still talking about the other two books? Right. On topic.\\"I'm Your Man,\\" starts with Blaine being single, Daniel being his ex, and the reader absolutely stunned that Timothy James Beck could be so heartless as to make us suffer through the notion of these two without each other. Sadists. But, like any good romantic, that horrible shred of hope kept me going past those awful first pages (they-broke-up/they-broke-up/they-broke-up hammering in my head all the while) and I found - as usual - that Timothy James Beck delivered a solid bit of work.Blaine and his best pal Gretchen (also single, though in her case more repetitively and steadfastly so) decide that little swimmy Blaines and little ovulating Gretchens might be a nifty way to have child. The fallout in Blaine's life is a joy to read, as Blaine navigates a lot of what family is supposed to mean (and often doesn't). Blaine's a character you can slip into fairly well - his mental processes, though sometimes leaving you fit to smack his mythical head around for a few hours, make sense internally, and you can see why he is the way he is. It's also refreshing to read a gay character who isn't all that stereotypically gay conscious - the poor guy hasn't got a clue how to handle transgendered issues, has more than a little bit to learn about fashion, and can be more than a little bit ignorant. Even my usual slight friction with the perfectly sculpted super-hot muscle stud image didn't seem to rub the wrong way in this novel, which says a bit about how well he was written. Blaine goes to the gym a lot, so it's not like an Andy Schell novel where the hero fella suddenly has gym payoff when we've been with him every hour of almost every day and he's never even seen the inside of the gym.The long and the short of it (and more long than short, I admit, as I fear I'm gushing at this point), Timothy James Beck gave me what I really wanted most: characters. Daniel is still Daniel - but an evolving Daniel. Ditto Blaine, and Adam, and Shiela, and all the other host of characters that make up the Beck world.Personally, I'm ready for book four. I might even manage to read that one in more than a single day, to draw it out a little bit...'Nathan"},{"Title":"I'm Your Man","review":"it's been a year since i had the second installment, he's the one. i couldn't wait. i emailed timothy james beck and told me to wait for last quarter of 2004 for the 3rd installment. and the wait paid off...the 3rd book gave us the definition of love, hate, break up, guilt in the eyes of blaine dunhill. the alpha male who's an over achiever and always get his way. in this book, he and the love of his life, daniel, broke up. i was so shocked after reading the first chapter. i would never imagine them apart.i highly recomend this book to all people, from all walks of life who believe that love can conquer all, that love can move mountains. because it did, it moved me. :)"},{"Title":"I'm Your Man","review":"This is the third book. I could not believe it when I was reading that Daniel and Blaine broke up. I think that this book is true to life in many ways. I can really see this happening in the gay world. Even my straight friends could related to it.For a while I was mad at Blaine for not just telling Daniel how he felt. We go on this roller coaster ride with them. The part of the book that Daniel and Blaine go to the fundraiser that Blaines assistiant doesn't want him to go to made me cry. When the assistaint tells Daniel how much Princess 2DI4 ment to her. I felt like Daniel for a moment.I hope that the writing team of Timothy James Beck get the chance to write more stories about these friends. I feel like it's about time that there are gay novels for adults to read that are filled with characters that we can relate to."},{"Title":"I'm Your Man","review":"In this excellent third novel, Beck revisits many of the unforgettable characters from his previous works, \\"It Had to Be You\\" and \\"He's the One\\". For me, reading this book felt a little like going back home for the holidays and catching up with family and old friends.This story has all the charm, wit, and memorably well-written characters of the previous novels, but also treads into some new territory for Beck. We get to see many familiar faces through a different set of eyes. The main character of Blaine, first introduced to us in \\"It Had to Be You\\", is now going through a darker, more serious time of his life, having recently become single again. From his point of view, we see many of Beck's earlier characters, and many new characters, as Blaine comes to terms with his new status, and debates making a life-altering decision with his friend Gretchen.Without becoming too serious or weighed down, this story takes a realistic and slightly less lighthearted look at relationships...a subject with which Beck seems to have a keen understanding. I found it very interesting to see how he has grown as an author, and how his characters and their interaction with the world have grown with him.Absolutely worth reading, for T.J.B. fans and new readers alike."},{"Title":"I'm Your Man","review":"I'm actually friends with one of the writers, which is what got me started reading the TJB series. I've never been a big fiction reader, because the stories and characters don't seem REAL, but I found myself hooked on the characters in the first book, It Had to Be You, and have been glued to the books since then! You feel like you really know these people, and are affected by the outcome of the story. This is a great continuation of the story of Daniel and Blaine and friends, with heartache, longing, love, and all the intensity that keeps you rooting for these people, and I can't wait to see what they'll do next!"},{"Title":"I'm Your Man","review":"Being a silly romantic at heart, I kept postponing reading this book once I knew it was post Daniel and Blaine's break-up. But I love Daniel and just have to know his ups and downs even through Blaine's eyes. I missed Daniel's voice in \\"He's the One\\" and missed it again in \\"I'm Your Man\\". I did not enjoy \\"I'm Your Man\\" as much as I would have liked to. Partly because of the subplots. I skipped most of the parts on Sheila's & Blaine's career life and Blaine's and Gretchen'e effort to have a baby, which I found tedious. OK so I do not like Blaine betraying Daniel that way! I found myself picking up passages to read. Before this book, I have liked Blaine but this time finds this character annoying. I do not expect the protagonist to be perfect but his flings with Ethan and other \\"tricks\\" is plain stupidity. Daniel certainly deserves someone better. OK so I do not like the story line because it concentrates on the unhappy relationship between Daniel and Blaine. Luckily there is a happy ending or else I would not even have read it. You may call me shallow but I prefer to enjoy my books. However as a gay romantic \\"fluff\\" genre, \\"I'm Your Man\\" is better than most out there today. Still this is Daniel's world and I look forward to more of his story."},{"Title":"The cancer biopathy","review":"Wilhelm Reich's most detailed review of his experiments in the U.S. outside of his psychiatric practice. In this text he explains thoroughly HIS discovery of the Orgone (chi, prana, ki) and its origins (I emphasize HIS discovery because every person stands to discover something different as it relates to them). He found it to be a cosmic energy, all pervading, emanating towards healthy life, healing, and protecting. He used it in several documented cases to cure cancer (thus the title). He experimented with it in combating nuclear radiation (and made one of his leaps into metaphysics), stating that orgone energy and nuclear radiation are opposing forces (the manifestations of good and evil). This point is highly controversial and became a jump off point for his desires to show people what he had spent his life doing, and how his ostrisisation from the mainstream medical societies he once was a part of was un-called for. He and his staff encounter an unnatural resistance to disease, increased eyesight (no need to wear glasses), increased circulation, and other positive reactions to daily orgone accumulation. The very same accumulators are described in this book, and even more on the internet... what more to say? Wilhelm Reich is considered to be a quack by most people, and yet no one denies he actually cured the people he had in his care through the use of a 'box' (that used no electricity, and is only made of alternating layers of steel wool, and lambs wool), in which the patients sat for 30 min. to an hour. As always, read for yourself, find someone with an orgone energy accumulator, feel and experience for yourself."},{"Title":"The cancer biopathy","review":"The Cancer Biopathy is the second volume of Wilhelm Reich's The Discovery of the Orgone, following on from The Function of the Orgasm. Unlike The Function of the Orgasm, which is readable and quite interesting, The Cancer Biopathy is a deadly text. Its claims are implausible and it is a tedious chore to read. Reich describes scientific research he conducted, and various experiments he performed, research and experiments which apparently led him to conclude that cancer is caused by sexual frustration. I find Reich himself to be earnest and sincere. That does not convince me that his theories about cancer have any merit. Reich declares in the final chapter that, \\"The finding that cancer is a disease caused by sexual starvation will have to be taken seriously.\\" Reich wrote that in 1948, and in the decades since the scientific establishment has refused to do anything of the kind, no doubt with good reasons.(The book comes with an introduction by one Chester M. Raphael, an M.D. who alleges that Reich's critics reject Reich's claims about cancer because of their emotional, sexual, and psychological problems, a suggestion that on the face of it does not appear to be better supported than the counter-suggestion that could be made: that Reich's admirers accept Reich's claims about cancer because of their emotional, sexual, and psychological problems)."},{"Title":"The cancer biopathy","review":"Reich describes his chemistry work with orgone to create \\"bions\\" and relates his personal experiences with the orgone in his consciousness.

Great to have on your shelf!"},{"Title":"Friends and Lovers","review":"Helen Macinnes, best known for Cold War spy stories, uses her intense style of character study to detail this love-at-first-sight romance, complicated by sabotage from both families. David (a student from London) and Penelope (a debutante from Edinburgh meet at a vacation hideaway on an Irish island. Penny's family use ridicule and classism to label David as not worthy. Her questioning artistic spirit has never fully fit into family expectations, but David is viewed as the ultimate threat to family loyalty and parental discipline. David's family expect him to sacrifice all to become breadwinner in support of their own vainglorious pursuits. So the new couple carry on their romance largely in secret from their family, and school and workplace friends replace their family as supportive mainstays. Their developing relationship require each to rethink their goals and how they might reach them. Their growing maturity (very satisfying) brings realistic conflicts that speed them to the stories climax. A character-study driven romance."},{"Title":"Friends and Lovers","review":"This book is very different from Helen Macinnes' usual spy thrillers. It is a love story - but it is so much more. This is basically the story of a young impoverished student David who meets a girl from a more well off family and the barriers they have to overcome. The book explores the problems of developing and maintaining relationships, whether with family, friends, or lovers. Some parts seem a bit dated now but it's uplifting without being soppy. And the writing is excellent. Ms. Macinnes has a way with words."},{"Title":"Long Time No See","review":"This was NOT a return of the deaf man. (What book was he reading??)I won't give any plot away, as that would spoil the fun. I've read a dozen or more of the 87th precinct books, and this one was rather weak. I get frustrated with books that rely on a gimmick that gets revealed in the last 5 pages. I think that a novel should be rewarding throughout, giving out nuggets of the solution along the way, instead of making it impossible for the reader to figure out until the author pulls back the curtain at the very end."},{"Title":"Long Time No See","review":"This 1977 book is the 32nd in the \\"87th Precinct\\" series. This story is imaginary, the people and places are fictitious. [But you know it is New York city with disguised names.] Jimmy Harris was 20 when he was blinded in the war. He met and married a blind woman. One November evening his seeing-eye dog was chloroformed and he was murdered on the street. Detectives Carella and Myers caught this case. The Homicide detectives got there first; they were supervisors and advisors because they specialized. They could differentiate between a stabbing and an incised wound. Who would kill a blind man on a public street? Carella and Myers begin their investigation. The widow tells them nothing; later she can't. When they return the next morning they find another body and the apartment a mess from a search for something. What will happen to the seeing-eye dog?\\"Ed McBain\\" shows his writing skills in his descriptions of people and places. The police detectives follow their long established techniques. Interview all witnesses; they don't know what they are looking for until they find it. Since the body of Jimmy was discovered right after the murder and rigor mortis had not set in they knew the hour of his death. Can a dream or a nightmare be a clue to a murder (Chapter 8)? Chapter 10 describes an institution found in big cities. Most murders are committed by amateurs, not professional criminals. Can you believe the dramas about mental patients (Chapter 11)? People join gangs for protection in the city (p.188). Carella continues to follow leads. There is a break (Chapter 13). Carella finds a key clue (Chapter 14). There is a solution in the final chapter.This was a very interesting story, except for the ending. The outburst from the suspect seems out of character. The story of a nightmare seems too psychological for a murder mystery. It reminds me of a TV show where the solution occurs just in time for the last commercial."},{"Title":"Long Time No See","review":"readable, not really enjoyable. I have to really work hard at keeping up with the plot and stay interested in it"},{"Title":"Long Time No See","review":"For fans of the 87th Precinct, this one will be a welcome change of pace. The writing is still pure McBain--terse, witty, and in some areas, lyrical. The dialogue sizzles, all of our old boys in blue are back, and things feel like home again--the way they always do when you open one of the tales of the 87th. But home can also be a boring place, and sometimes a chance of pace and a twist here and there will remedy that. Well, twists and turns abound in this book, a departure from the previous 87 novels in its legnth, complexity of backstory, and nifty tidbits of info--from psychoanalysis to the training of the blind--to sustain readers' interests. The ending is classic McBain, blunt, to the point, and supremely satisfying. Not since &quot;Sadie When She Died&quot; has McBain produced so unique a novel in this incredibly durable series."},{"Title":"Long Time No See","review":"Ed McBain's books are ALWAYS interesting, different and engaging...highly recommended for anyone who likes police procedurals with well developed characters...good read!"},{"Title":"Long Time No See","review":"The true greatness of a hero can only be matched by the cleverest of villians.

Want knowledge to improve your credibility as a learning expert with others? Based heavily on cognitive research, this book from well-known expert Ruth Colvin Clark provides the rationale for sound instructional methods.The concepts and guidelines in Building Expertise are mature, widely-accepted, and most will be familiar to readers in the training field. The book's first three chapters explain in simple terms how the brain is thought to work during learning. Each later chapter focuses on a cognitive learning process and summarizes the methods that research has shown support it. With chapter titles like \\"Leveraging Prior Knowledge,\\" the organization of the book reinforces Ruth Clark's thesis. Her thesis is simple, but profound: it is instructional methods, not media, that influence learning. Some methods work better than others because of the way our brains function. Some methods work better for beginners than for advanced learners. The gems in this book are the occasional information on techniques that sometimes hurt learning and when to avoid them. While there are examples and pictures of training that follow the guidelines, this is not a how-to book. This book explains why and when to do something, not how to do it. For that reason, Building Expertise may be of interest to learning consultants and training managers, as well as to practitioners who want to deepen their knowledge of instructional design."},{"Title":"Building expertise: Cognitive methods for training and performance improvement","review":"As a high-school teacher I am finding this book an invaluable read. The combination of insights from educational psychology and practical examples of instructional design make this an essential read for all those who want to make their teaching more effective and who are dismayed by the many examples of poorly conceived e-learning that can be encountered on the web. I think this book is worth twice the price and deserves a very wide readership. It certainly amply rewards thoughtful and careful study."},{"Title":"Building expertise: Cognitive methods for training and performance improvement","review":"Every trainer should buy this book! For too long, the training field (and teaching) has had little research to back up the conventional wisdom. Now, thanks to the neuroscience revolution, trainers and educators are learning how the brain actually learns. That is why Clark's book is so valuable. It has changed my teaching and training."},{"Title":"Building expertise: Cognitive methods for training and performance improvement","review":"Dr. Clark takes an interesting stance - if you want to develop training programs know the science that supports your approach. If you're interested in developing training programs and want to understand the science, much of which is fairly recently developed, that supports one approach over another then this is the book. It starts by reviewing the foundations of building expertise. It then reviews the literature for learning events that are proven to build expertise. It then moves to the highest levels of integration and application of the various techniques into a structured learning environment. While it is surprising to realize our most important national activity - education - has had insufficient input due to the gap between science and application - Dr Clark is driving to reduce that gap."},{"Title":"Building expertise: Cognitive methods for training and performance improvement","review":"Ruth Colvin Clark lays out the basic theories and research findings from cognitive psychology and expands on their implications for designing effective instruction. This book is intended for instructional designers who want to learn the deeper theories underlying the methods of their profession. It is equally useful for cognitive scientists who want to keep their research relevant to educational practice.Clark begins with four foundation chapters which define expertise in terms of cognitive performance and derive instructional principles designed to foster the development of expertise. The next eight chapters describe how expertise develops given the basic human constraints of working memory, attention, and long-term memory contents and structures. The book describes how initial learning becomes valuable as it is transferred to performance. The remaining chapters describe how carefully designed instruction can motivate learners and develop expertise that is adaptive to solving a variety of problems in varied contexts.This book is well-written and draws on a reasonable sample of current research literature--although the author does oversample her own work just a bit. Plain language and an extensive glossary make the book's content accessible to readers with little background in either instructional design or cognitive psychology. The diagrams and flowcharts that illustrate complex theories and processes are particularly well done, exemplifying good instructional design by highlighting key concepts and minimizing irrelevant detail.Readers may also enjoyDeveloping Technical TrainingandGraphics for Learningby the same author, who practices as well as preaches good design in her work."},{"Title":"Building expertise: Cognitive methods for training and performance improvement","review":"This edition includes updates to her previous work that make the content more relevant to current learning science, more practical for application in a business, and easier to understand."},{"Title":"A Case for Aid: Building a Consensus for Development Assistance","review":"This book by the World Bank indicates how dramatic and lasting the progress against global poverty has been in the past 50 years. It also shows how dramatically the Bank's own understanding has risen, even in the past decade, of how to make its efforts more effective in relieving poverty and achieving other development goals. These two themes form the basis for the World Bank's visionary thesis: that eradicating much of the poverty, ill health, and illiteracy around the world is within reach.The World Bank is full of optimism. Then again, it shows good reason for this outlook. It outlines the substantial advances that have been made over the past few decades in poverty reduction and advances in health and education in the developing world, identifying the World Bank's role in these advances, as one component of a complex, cooperative effort. For instance, the Bank indicates that:* Over the past 40 years, life expectancy at birth in developing countries has increased by 20 years - about as much as was achieved in all of human history prior to the middle of the 20th century.* Over the past 30 years, illiteracy in the developing world has been cut nearly in half, from 47 percent to 25 percent in adults.* Over the past 20 years, the absolute number of people living on less than $1 a day, after rising steadily for the last 200 years, has for the first time begun to fall, even as the world's population has grown by 1.6 billion people.The book's main message is that foreign development aid is reaching a level of sophistication that translates into dramatic improvements in the human condition like never before. This aid is lifting people out of poverty, improving their health and education, and contributing to the stability and security of the entire world. As the book says, \\"Aid is not simply a transfer payment for the consumption of poor people, but an investment in improved policies and institutions. The best aid finances the costs of change, rather than the costs of not changing.\\"The Bank's vision is grand and inspiring. This is far more than a financial treatise; it is instead a bold blueprint for raising the human condition throughout the globe. With such reach, it touches on much of the agenda for foreign affairs, and makes for compelling reading for anyone concerned with international relations. As the Bank aspires, \\"we must make globalization stand for common humanity, not for commercial brands or competitive advantage.\\""},{"Title":"Finding Your Purpose as a Mom: How to Build Your Home on Holy Ground","review":"When I bought this book, I needed a focus when it came to motherhood.

For Renaissance Venice, the myth was that of the Most Serene Republic, built on a perfect foundation of justice, peace and the rule of law, established as the Christian heir to pagan Rome and protected by the saints. In this brief, elegant book, David Rosand shows how richly that political myth was embodied in the public art of the Venetian state, focusing on the paintings and sculpture of the Doge's Palace, the Loggetta of the Campanile, the Libreria di San Marco, and various of the scuola grande. Rosand does a superb job of teasing out all of the multi-layered mythological meanings and allusions present in individual works and in the relationship of one work (or even one building) to another. He also shows that these meanings, although not transparent to most visitors today, were easily understood by educated Venetians and foreigners (and recorded in their diaries and descriptions of the city) throughout the Renaissance. I saw many things that I had not seen before, and will go back to these works with a new appreciation of their meaning and function.This is not art criticism or art appreciation (there is barely a mention of anyone's technique or of aesthetic issues), it's real art history. Rosand's goal is to show how the artwork he considers functioned to both present the Venetian state's self-image and to persuade viewers to accept that image. Given Venice's important role as an early example of a modern state (one that viewed the state itself as an abstract concept, separate from the ruler, who is himself subject to the rule of law), we can still learn much from the methods that Venice used to envision and market itself.Rosand writes for an educated audience, but is readily accessible to non-scholars. He assumes a fair degree of familiarity with Venice -- if you do not know the Piazza from the the Piazzetta, or which facade of the Palace is the south one, you will occasionally find yourself confused. Nor does he stop to explain in any detail the Venetian constitution or the organization of Venetian society. This is a book to take with you on your second or third trip to Venice, or to read while planning such a trip. It does not pretend to be comprehensive, but will give you a real insight into one of the many beautiful threads that make up this complex city."},{"Title":"Myths of Venice: The Figuration of a State","review":"David Rosand is the Meyer Schapiro Professor of Art History Emeritus at Columbia University, a school where Schapiro himself studied and was then a professor for many decades. Those are very big shoes to fill, but it is clear from this book, if not from his others, that David Rosand has managed to do that. In fact, this book reminds me of Schapiro's 1935 Ph.D. dissertation at Columbia, published under the title \\"The Sculpture of Moissac\\"--not in substance or particularly in style (although they are both clear and elegant writers), but in the manner in which both manage to recognize and harvest huge amounts of meaning from things that most of us have simply taken for granted (to the extent that we have even registered their existence). Here Rosand examines some of the iconic structures of Venice--the Palazzo Ducale, the Libreria di San Marco, the Gallerie dell' Accademia, etc.--treating them as the huge collections of artworks that they are and analyzing the interrelated networks of imagery that comprise the \\"figuration\\"of the Republic, i.e., the visual counterpart of the narrative myths that were the foundation and sustenance of Venice's identity, both to itself and to the world at large. In this sense, \\"figuration\\" operates in both of its fundamental meanings: as ornamentation and as allegorical representation, and from the one to the other is Rosand's interpretive trajectory. The four myths he discusses are the \\"Miraculous Birth\\" of the city, traditionally \\"born\\" on the Annunciation in 421, with the laying of the first stone of the church of San Giacomo de Rialto: as God announced the conception of a Savior to redeem humanity from Original Sin, so did He assure our social and political salvation through the founding of a Christian republic upon the ruins of the Roman empire. The second myth Rosand calls \\"The Peace of Saint Mark,\\" the third \\"The Wisdom of Solomon,\\" and the fourth \\"The Appropriation of Olympus,\\" as Venice absorbed and adapted the pagan pantheon to its own purposes, beginning with its marine birth, as the familiar trope of Venus Anadyomene became Venetia Anadyomene. At 188 pages, including extensive notes, bibliography and index, this is not a big book, but it is so packed with fascinating information that it seems much larger. It is immensely learned, but Rosand wears his erudition lightly and gracefully; it's a kind of scholarly \\"sprezzatura,\\" a lot of hard work to make a hard thing so easy. This is a superb book; it wonderfully exemplifies the goal of the best art history: to make us see things we didn't know were there."},{"Title":"Myths of Venice: The Figuration of a State","review":"I do not appreciate when I have to fill this out with a specific number of words when one is enough; SUCCESS"},{"Title":"Myths of Venice: The Figuration of a State","review":"A handsome book from the University of North Carolina: hardback with dustjacket, navy linen cloth over boards with silver print, 188 pp.About 200 illustrations, including a section of color plates.Introduction, Index, and 25 pp of bibliographic information."},{"Title":"Sense of Direction : The Director and His Actors (SD 13)","review":"Read this years ago, then read it again.

First, it is very readable: you can sit down and read it for pleasure. I find that I like to dip into it at random and read a page or two about a given author or topic.The best thing about the book -- and what makes it unique -- is the authorial voice. D.C. Somervell gives a balanced, literate treatment of his topics, and adds occasional personal evaluations as wonderful little one-line zingers. You feel that you are having a conversation with a tremendously interesting person: someone who is knowledgeable, literate, intelligent, balanced, and witty. One of my favorite examples (despite its complex sentence structure, which is not typical!):&quot;[William] Godwin is one of those philosphical gas-bags who has been so long pricked and deflated, that it has become extremely difficult to reconstruct him in the dimensions he assumed in the eyes of his contemporaries.&quot;The book was first published in 1929, which makes it much closer to its subject than we are today, and the author is much more familiar with Victorian luminaries that once shined brightly, but now have dimmed, than we are today.

We selected it on recommendation from American friends.Although in theory the atlas looks detailed, comprehensive and well planned, in practice it's not as easy to use as it might have been. One major criticism I have is that instead of using a regular grid system mapping the USA from for example north-west down eventually to the south east with the same universal mile-to-inch scale, the designers have chosen to present the map pages alphabetically by state, all with different mile-to-inch scales. Rhode Island is one inch = four miles, Indiana one inch = 10 miles, California one inch = 18 miles, New Mexico one inch = 28 miles, and on it goes with no obvious logic except maybe to fit each listed state to the page size available.This means for example that if you are driving (as we did) through north-western New Mexico, into south-western Colorado, then into southern Utah and finally down into Arizona, instead of following your route logically from page to page you need to keep moving away from the page featuring the state you're just leaving and hunting for the map of the state you have just entered, then find out where you are, then go through the process again. The map scale in miles-to-the-inch changes with each new state, which is confusing if you're trying to get a regional perspective.Whilst driving through the eastern part of Utah we found the atlas next to useless, as the one page devoted to \\"Utah/Eastern\\" contains no fewer than six fragmented small-scale maps plus city maps of Salt Lake City, St George and Logan which makes it almost impossible to see where you are in the Monument Valley area with any kind of wider perspective.On the plus side, the atlas contains good information on each state: population, largest city, land area, highest point, and ranking in size/population. However, this information could easily have been presented in a separate section in the atlas and the country mapped in a more logical and useful way for the traveller.It's also quite large and unwieldy at over 15 \\" x 10\\" so not easy to use in a moving car and difficult to carry on foot, as it won't fit in a small rucksack. Many pages are used to display several different smaller maps with different scales, so even this large format is not really needed or used to its full potential. The spring binder is a good feature and ensures the pages won't fall out and turn easily, and can be folded back right over so one page can be viewed at a time.So in summary: accurate, reasonably detailed but not easy to use and could have been planned out better with more consistent scaling."},{"Title":"Rand McNally 2007 Road Atlas: United States-Large Scale (Rand Mcnally Large Scale Road Atlas USA)","review":"I thought that the large format would be easier to use but it splits up the maps too much (i.e., Colorado is split over two pages with another page for cities).

While it might be a little difficult to handle such large book while on the road, no one can deny that in terms of completeness, it has it all and a bit more. You might want to study your trip itinerary and making your own notes before departing, so you don't have to deal with it all the time, but don't forget to take this with you - in the trunk or in the backseat if you have available space - in case you get lost or decide to change ways.

Place names evoke memories of the long distances, the winding back roads, and the national parks that go on forever. State borders make me remember my silly posed pictures in front of the \\"Welcome to...\\" signs. The Hawaii map reminds me of the joke \\"Why does Hawaii have interstate highways?\\". I remember following the atlas on long road trips, reading out loud to my husband the towns coming up. Reaching a new page in the atlas meant progress was being made in the journey!

The spiral binding works nicely to find the correct page. Really the only problem with the atlas is of its own doing. The maps are so big that one state can't fit onto one page so the state is broken up over several pages. That is nice because it is big and there is more detail, but if you are in an area right on the border of where it is broken up it can be kind of confusing and a pain to switch back and forth. There's really no way to prevent it short of having a huge book or individual fold out maps. Really it more of a nuisance that anything.

It has a glued binding instead of the familiar spiral binding. That makes it nearly impossible to use in the car. Also the states are divided awkwardly and difficult to reconcile moving from one page to other half of the state on another page. Cities at the division are not repeated on the next map, so you need to find highways or follow guide marks to make the transition. It is not a good visual stimulus to follow.

California is so chopped up, it is unusable. Even Arizona is excessively chopped up and is not even connected to a Mexican map - how useful is that if you live in Arizona? Most people want a road atlas for long distance travel planning and use in the car. This one is organized for people who don't know their way around their own locale. I'm sure all the information is usable at some point, but you would likely have a traffic accident trying to follow these maps in the car and it would be no fun at all sitting and planning a long trip with these disjointed maps. The most usable map is the large US map at the front - but I could have gotten that for free anywhere. Don't buy this atlas unless you've seen it in advance.

No overlap on most pages where maps continue from page to page, with the occasional exception.2.

This is an excellent read both for train lovers (whom the exotic trains Theroux rides will captivate) as well as readers who enjoy travelogues. To be fair, this is less a travelogue than a series of vignettes covering Theroux's journeys through various Asian countries. Theroux makes no attempt to develop an understanding of the cultures he travels through but is content to describe the train itself along with a handful of anecdotes about the people he meets on each leg of his journey. Fair enough, this is not after all a sociological text but a travel diary of sorts.And it is in description that Theroux's strength lies. He has the ability to make an anecdote seem so real as to make the reader a part of the scene. The pace of the book varies with the stop and start of each journey and I guess every reader will prefer some parts to others. Plus of course, it is a bit jarring when one reads this book today, since the tide of history has greatly changed many of the countries Theroux traversed. Still, culture is slower to change than politics and that keeps much of the book relevant even today."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"One of the off-putting things about traditional travelogues is the litany of thing-descriptions (buildings, markets, clothes, hills) which just don't make for compelling brain food. Theroux focusses on people, and more specifically personalities. As an Indian, I can say that he captures the essence of different ilks of Indians with an incisiveness that I have not seen in any other American writer. I wish I had gotten my red, white and blue wife to read this before we visited. Many of her questions are answered episodically. Questions such as Why are some Indians so free with information about their digestive state? Why is an ailment worn like a badge of honor by some? Why do Indian travel guides always mention how far a book store is from your hotel? Isn't it admirable that somebody of such high stature is so unassuming? The incomprehensible extremes of know-it-alls versus humility amongst those with great erudition..He makes equally astute observations about Afghans, Burmese, Ceylonese etc., but I'll leave you to read the book to enjoy these.Some may find this book insulting, as it is fairly blunt about the people's idiosyncrasies. I for one do not expect literature to be politically correct (and vice-versa)."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"&quot;Train travel animate my imagination and usually give me solitude to order and write my thoughts: I travel easily in two directions, along the level rails while Asia flashed changes at the window, and at the interior rim of a private world of memory and language. I cannot imagine a luckier combination.&quot;The words are from Paul Theroux's book The Great Railway Bazaar, where he takes us on a train journey through Asia. The book has excotic chapters, starting with The 15.30 - London to Paris, taking us via The Direct - Orient Express, The Night Mail to Meshed, The Golden Arrow to Kuala Lumpus, The Trans - Siberian Express and so on. Names and places I dream of, and would like to go to - one day.Paul Theroux has been there, and he has been there with an open mind and his pen and paper to take care of this world of memory and language.This is fun reading. Some people call Theroux a rasist, but I don't agree. Theroux travels with an open mind and really see people and places where he goes. The way he shares his experiences with his readers is so rich and funny, you almost can feel the smell of the meal of old onions wrapped in a dirty piece of newspaper his travel companion is having, or you feel the dust in your eyes from the dry countryside you are passing.I bought this book at an European airport when I was out travelling, and has read it as a &quot;travel&quot;-book, reading on planes, railways, busses, in cars and so on. And my eyes have been opened to see the people around me - not as grey everyday fellow travellers, but as all different human beings. And from Paul Theroux I have learned that strangers are not actually strangers, but people who can show me more of a mixed world when I take the time to start sharing part of my life with them.Britt Arnhild Lindland."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"This was my first Theroux novel and I'm already hooked. Theroux's descriptions of the fascinating people he encounters on the trip--from prostitutes to statesmen--are truly captivating. Even better are his vivid descriptions of the incredible scenery he takes in on his trip from London to the Far East. Be forewarned: once you read this book you will be tempted to quit your job, grab a backpack, and head for rails. If you enjoy the likes of Bill Bryson and Tim Cahill, you will certainly enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"This is a journal of a trip covering the major rail routes available in the 1970s across Europe and Asia. Theroux, an American, sets off from London on a tour where the journey itself was the goal. He wanted to sit back, observe, and absorb the atmosphere of the trains. In the book, he details his experiences on the trains, tells us about his fellow passengers, and describes what he was seeing out the windows while the trains wound across the tracks from Paris to Italy, Bulgaria to Turkey, Pakistan, India, Ceylon, Burma, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Japan, and the Soviet Union. Occasionally, he stopped for a night or two in a hotel along the way, and he also tells us of his adventures at these stops.It's been years since I read a book by Paul Theroux. In the past, I found his attitude a bit off-putting. There's something about deciding to write a travel book, then taking a trip for the specific purpose of having something to write about that makes the whole genre somewhat useless. But now that I have traveled a bit more myself and have visited many of the countries that Theroux describes here, I can appreciate the accuracy of his descriptions much more. In traveling through a country in a few days by train, no one would be able to make enough observations to make worthwhile analyses of the culture or the society of a country, but that's not Theroux's goal in this book. Instead, it is the journey itself that he is describing- -the focus is on the trains, and the particular subculture of train travel. Theroux provides us with images of the trains themselves and the people one meets on them as he describes his experiences of months spent living on the trains.Theroux's best descriptions are towards the beginning of the journey. By the end of the trip, he is reduced to a drunken stupor and his observations dwindle in the steppes of Siberia. The only reason for including his final chapters in the book are simply for the sake of completeness, to get him home again. The section on Vietnam is a remarkable snapshot of ordinary life trying to continue between the '73 ceasefire and the '75 withdrawal. It is images like these that give this book its enduring value."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"\\"Paul Theroux is _so_ overrated!\\"It was a line I would hear over and over again during the past month I spent with 'The Great Railway Bazaar' every time I fielded the inevitable \\"So...what are you reading now?\\" question so popular amongst writers and journalists.Having finally finished the compact tome, I understand my colleagues' antipathy: Theroux makes it look so easy. Take a trip, write about it with lots of descriptive curliques and viola! money in the bank.Theroux has a sharp eye and a neutral without being self-effacing voice that makes for the best travel writing. He is a master of detail, meticulously recreating the sense of place and space. As a writer, he is superb. And yet...I also sympathize with the criticisms that he exploits a place, visiting only for the writing, dismissing the deeper truth and more complicated understanding for the lurid, the sensational, the scene and the steam.In 'Railway Bazaar' at least, Theroux at least makes no pretentions of being anything more than the passing observer. They are snapshots, vignettes viewed through a train window and filtered through half a bottle of gin. It is personal, and pretends to be nothing more. It also serves as a reaffirming paean to the joys of alcohol and travel.As a book, it has its stops and gos. Slow at the start, it picks up spead through Central Asia, finds its confident footing in South and Southeast Asia, and then flounders through Japan and Russia. At its best, it captures a time and place, such as Vietnam at the end of the war or bits of India. Perhaps I found those parts more coherent because I traveled similar roads some 30 years later, and found it interesting to compare how things have changed - and how they haven't.

Thanks, and note that a short review is not necessarily a bad review if it leads you to a great book.If you always dreamed of traveling, then do it the easy way by reading one of Paul Theroux's accounts of his travels. They are funny and insightful and grand adventures. Check out these lines:\\"The sad engineer would never go back to England; he would become one of these elderly expatriates who hide out in remote countries, with odd sympathies, a weakness for the local religion, an unreasonable anger, and the kind of total recall that drives curious strangers away.\\"Speaking of young foreign travelers, Theroux says:\\"Occasionally, I saw an amorous pair leave their compartment hand in hand to go copulate in the toilet.Most were on their way to India and Nepal, because\`the wildest dreams of Kew are the facts of KhatmandhuAnd the crimes of Clapham chaste in Martaban.'But the majority of them, going for the first time, had that look of frozen apprehension that is the mask of the face of an excapee.\\"Theroux has a great quote in the beginning of the first chapter--\\"The journey is the goal.\\""},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"What an amazing book. It is the first book I have read by Paul Theroux and I am hooked. The descriptions he gives of every situation along the way are such that you feel you are living the moments with him. Having travelled a little, I can relate to a lot of the references he makes. References to smells and sights and sounds which form memories. He is the final straw that has convinced me to travel the Trans Siberian. A great book."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"It hardly needs repeating that Paul Theroux is an exceptionally gifted writer. Moreover, this is a very skilfully written story, full of original and acute perceptions put across with wit and point. Theroux recounts a series of train journeys, interspersed with boat trips or aeroplane links where the rail option is not available, as for instance when making a sea crossing or in railless Afghanistan. In the course of this journey he has a number of lecturing engagements, presumably arranged in advance, for which I assume (although he does not say so) that he received a fee. I assume also that what took him away from his home and family for so many long months was not just the enjoyment of rail travel that he owns up to, but financial recompense for the book that he intended to publish as a record of his trip.Earning an honest living by writing, and by travel writing in particular, is a worthy and honourable pursuit. However when the people represented in the story are real people, and the incidents are true occurrences, and the statements recorded are what people really said, there are to my way of thinking certain standards of taste and propriety that should be carefully adhered to. Personal records of travel and encounters along the way are presented impeccably in, say, Germaine Greer's \`Daddy We Hardly Knew You' or in Peter Hessler's River Town and Oracle Bones. In these narratives the authors have reasons for being where they are and for meeting who they meet. These are accounts of research, investigation and exploration from which the books are a spin-off. They have not just taken a trip with a view to parading whoever they might happen to meet before the public at large, which is really what Theroux is doing here. Was the permission of Mr Duffill or Mr Molesworth sought before their statements and actions were made public? I doubt it somehow, but my idea of propriety doesn't even necessarily require that. The parties reported sympathetically by Dr Greer obviously knew what she was doing, but the personae she disliked would not have been consulted about what she intended to say about that them, and that is fine by me. What I am not happy about is going out on a fishing trip and subsequently dangling the fish on a line to be gawped at or derided. Some instances are worse than others. It is not particularly offensive to pillory the downmarket press of any country, such as the Indian weekly \`Blitz' which informed him regarding some rowdy individual that \`He was high and headstrong...Hurled abuse at some and then fisted a guest', in which the last verb is not used in a more recent sense but means \`punched'. I also can't deny that I was amused (rather guiltily) at the clever representation of his Japanese host's offer to show him the local Tiergarten \`You want to see tzu?' \`What kind of tzu?' \`Wid enemas'. Very smart, very clever, but coming from someone who spoke no Japanese more than a little patronising and de haut en bas.I think it is perhaps the chapter on Japan that brings out in particular the slight sense of distaste I feel for this book. Theroux recounts at some length and with some particularity erotic shows and publications patronised by placid-seeming middle-class Japanese. I confess I find the shows as he describes them somewhat disgusting, but in a rather detached way. What revolts me more acutely is the spectacle of the audiences themselves, and that brings to the fore in my mind the nature of Theroux's own narration. What exactly is he doing there in the first place? He is another audience on the next tier. Does he have some mission to tell the world about all this? Is he engaged in academic research? None of that, and he does at least show awareness of the issue, admitting that he is a bit of a drone amusing himself idly and in the process making rather free with other people's privacy for the entertainment of a paying public.All that said, the book still has plenty to recommend it. I felt that the later chapters are better than the earlier, which have too much sense about them of \`oh look at these people doing these things' and \`this guy said this three-quarter's of a page worth to me'. There was a sharp improvement starting with the chapter on Singapore, where Theroux's trenchant comments seem to me to be not only valid in themselves but also to satisfy one of my own requirements from a book of this kind by offering analysis and generalisation rather than just random detail. Also, the book was written in the early 1970's, and so is a reminder of an epoch. This was pre-junta Burmah, for instance. It was the time of the cold war. South Africa was still under apartheid although the availability of the industrial capacity of the Japanese obtained for them the status of \`white' from Mr Botha or whoever was in charge in South Africa at the time in question. Above all, it was the time of the war in Vietnam, and the vignettes of that ravaged nation as recounted by so talented and independent a storyteller made a vivid impression on one reader at least.At one point Theroux comments that travel narratives turn into autobiography. The books I have instanced by Greer and Hessler are certainly autobiography and rightly so. I only wish this book had practised what it preaches. Theroux gives away comparatively little about himself apart from his participation in a few dialogues, the purpose of which is largely to pillory his interlocutors, and I particularly miss precisely this sense of personal development which he himself says one should expect.There is next to nothing for railway geeks, but if I remember one thing above all from the book, it is the tantalising semi-description of the viaduct at Gokteik in Burmah."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"Like all of his non-fiction travel pieces, Theroux spends too much time congratulating himself on his courage and complaining about almost everything. However, he made this trip at a very interesting time in history (interesting to one born in 1962, at least). One has the sense that an era is ending in much of Asia. (It is unfortunate that he seems to have lost his notes on the trans-Siberian segment of the trip.) The perils that he encounters are a bit more imminent than those in his other books, and his skill as a writer makes the book highly readable."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"The author's recollections of the people he's met on the train seem to be mostly about how much they annoy him, or how happy he is to finally get a compartment to himself. He also seems to have gotten tired of the whole business on the last half of his journey, his trip across the Soviet Union. It's compressed into just a couple chapters, and really doesn't have the interest of the rest of the book"},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"I've read a bunch of his travel books now. I always find them fun to read. This one, however, I found a little more difficult than the others. To me often it was like a crazy quilt of scenes and I felt overwhelmed at times. I enjoyed learning about the Sikhs and northern India in general. But what do I know about the Biharis vs. the Bengalis? I formed pictures, but felt I didn't know what it was all about. Though after reading what he writes about India, I never want to go there. But then I found it so interesting to read about how the people of Japan are so entertained by violent sex with blood and murder. That young girl with the comic book depicting all that violence! Why is that so entertaining to them? Well, Americans like that stuff too. But I'd rather read about what it is really like than about some phony everyone is so loving to everyone else sort of thing. And I will never forget the one-legged man, hopping ahead so fast that Paul couldn't catch up with him. All in all, I am immensely grateful to Paul Theroux for his showing me all these things around the world while I am safely ensconced in my comforable easy chair at home."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"This is my favorite theroux,this is a journey we all want to make only nobody can write about it like mr.Theroux.One of the greatest travel books"},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"A great opportunity wasted.This is my first Theroux. I am envious for he had the opportunity to travel all around the world that too in train. But, I am disappointed to see such a piece of work from one of the famous names in travel writing. As an Indian, I know how interesting a long train journey is. You meet people from a cross-section of society, of different background, professions, lifestyle, religions, languages, habits and hopes. The author is satisfied with watching the mannerisms of people than understanding a bit of these.I find him to be a racist. Also, why does he mention about prostitutes so much, that too in a train journey? Rather than enjoying a trip of such magnitude, depth and scope, the author slips into complaining too often and has a certain contempt for anything non-western. With such a closed mind, I don't know why one should take the pain of travelling so much. If one needs to see and hear what he wants see and hear, better write fiction than travelogues.All said, the book is a good read if you don't think too much. His descriptions of the landscape are fantastic and his writing skills are beyond argument. Don't expect to learn about people, culture or lifestyle from this book. But you come to know about the great trains that ply in different continents. The contents are out dated, but still you can keep it in your shelf."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"This book may have been a pleasant read when it appeared in the mid 70's, but today, it is definitely unsavory. The attitude of Mr. Theroux toward non-americans is that of a visitor at a zoo. Toward women, it is somewhat worse. The info. on the trains is poor. I read the book to daydream of a trip to Burma, and I hope the country would be more interesting than what Mr. Theroux described 25 years ago."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"One of the cardinal and unwritten rules of travel writing is that the writer should enjoy what he is doing; failing which, atleast attempt to give some insight into what he dislikes. In this book, Theroux does neither.Most people in the third world do not see travel as a pastime as they do not have the means to engage in it for leisure. Facilites obviously cannot match those of the first world. Missing these simple points, Theroux comes across as insensitive and snobbish in his remarks. Though there is nothing wrong in pointing something that's lacking, there is no attempt at looking beyond the surface. In many chapters, you feel like asking 'ok, if this is so uncomfortable, why continue? why don't you take the next train home?'. In one ludicrous instance, he even complains about the name of a place!To his credit though, the author has an immaculate writing style and you can finish the book in no time. Many of his passages describing the scenery are rich fodder for your imagination and you can make photographs in your mind from his descriptions. I just wish he had more openness to go with his undoubted skills."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"I loved this book, and I love the new edition with Steve McCurry's picture on the cover. Finally, the quality of the cover matches the inside text!"},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"Despite it's previous bestseller status, I found this book to be quite slow and it didn't grab my concentration. Theroux traveled by train from England to Turkey, India, Singapore, Japan, several other countries, and back across the whole of Russia. The tone is rather arrogant and I was disappointed that most of his time seemed to be actually spent on the train, rather than in the places he traveled to. Reading about his many train companions and the train staff was not as interesting as hearing about the people on the street he spoke with. I found the chapter on Vietnam interesting, but his trip home across Russia found him horribly depressed, and his negative attitude clouded the details of an experience that so many others have recorded as marvelous."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"Theroux lives up to his bad reputation in this, one of his earlier works. In case other readers are unaware, Theroux is the sort of person who is capable of going to the effort of writing a poison-pen book about an ex-friend of 30 years -- in this case, V.S. Naipaul. This (other) book is entitled Sir Vidia's Shadow (1998), and in it Theroux went to great effort to depict his old pal's ugliness, greed, and hypocrisy.Expect all sorts of overwrought post-modern hysteria, drunkenness, and latent sadism in this book (two examples of these: a visit to a Japanese snuff film and a scene where Theroux shoves his way through a train station calling every misfortunate he meets 'Monkeys'.) Expect too to be exposed to some well-educated portraits which stimulate the mind and draw the imaginative sense into some scenes of intense clarity. These in themselves make the book worth it, especially if you like to draw pictures in your mind.I personally find this sort of writing to be ultimately depressing because it is literary, educated, and imaginative -- and unredeemable. Theroux uses language to keep the reader at bay just as much as he does to pull him into his world. I checked this book out of the library instead of buying it. I'm glad I can return it to its shelf for another reader to taste."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"Being from a country that's not so densely populated, I can relate to Theroux's view of some places on this truly great train travel. I'd never could have made such a journey myself! To me, the trains he uses are irrelevant compared to the descriptions of the stations, views from the train windows, and some of the people he meets during this journey. Liked this book quite much and after 1st reading it has occasionally been on my nightstand, just open this book anywhere and start reading... the tone is usually more gentle than the provoked thoughts one may have before trying to sleep."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"I've read all of Theroux's travelogues, but the sheer geographic scope of the travel chronicled in this book is most impressive. (If I have to take a favorite, it'll be \\"Happy Isles of Oceania\\", which is most memorable for how Theroux risked his very life pretty much throughout the book.) Theroux is THE proverbial Stranger in a Strange Land, i.e. someone who feels compelled to visit exotic places, but is almost never pleased to find himself there. His interaction with locals is often confrontational if not hostile, and his observations are usually acidic if not untruthful.For those who are especially interested in railroad travel, they should also read \\"Old Patagonian Express\\" and \\"Riding the Iron Rooster\\" to complete Theroux's railroad trilogy.It'd be worth contrasting his brief race through Japan via a Bullet Train versus Karin Muller's \\"Japanland\\", in which she chronicles her painstaking and often hilarious attempts at crossing the divide between Theroux-like outsider and the natives. Theroux never earned a right to pronounce judgements on the Japanese or their culture, but Muller did."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"This isn't just a book about an extremely long train journey, it's very much a Paul Theroux book. Those expecting detailed travel descriptions of the places he travels through will be disappointed. Cities are merely card board wall papers, the world in this book consists mostly out of cabin and restaurant train wagons where he spends his time talking to people, observing what he sees, taking notes, reading books and most likely writing new ones while at it. It's easy to get turned of by the fact that at times Theroux doesn't always seem to enjoy what he is doing and at times skips long passages for being ill, grumpy or just not in the mood, especially when nearing the end. It can also be explained as an honest account of being on a journey and being addicted to that. Theroux is very well in small details, self reflections, conversations with common people and keen observations and he isn't shy to comment on what he observes. He does that precisely and well written and only for that it's a pleasure to read his books."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"This book is one of the most under-rated I have come across. This is pocket book sized classic.Satyajit Ray captured romance of a train for generations to savour in a single shot for his \\"Pather Panchali\\". Mr. Theroux creates similar effect through his book.The author captures that feeling of existential living one gets on a train.His book is as good as any on India when he describes his travels on Indian trains. He truly competes with V S Naipaul for some of the best external perspective on India."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"An unique travelogue--A journey through Asia by trains. Theroux shines in his detailed narrations and vividly depiction of interesting people he met and all his fascinating encounters throughout his long trip. He travel by trains.

He observed their cultures and even made friends with some of the locals on the trains."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"Missed your chance to tour Asia by rail in the 1970's? Paul Theroux gives the reader the experience without having to endure the hardships. And there are many.As a boy, Paul Theroux seldom heard a train go by without wishing he were on it. After following his dream of exploring many countries of the world by rail, this book focuses on Asia and is considered a classic of travel writing.Things grey and dull leaving London turn increasingly bizarre as he continues East on the Orient Express, The Teheran Express, The Kyber Mail, on through India to Singapore and Japan, linking with the Trans-Siberian Express. The dedication he writes is \\"to the lost ones, to the cohort of the damned, to my brethren in their sorrow overseas . . .\\" The reader comes to understand what these grim words mean as his journey unwinds. He writes with a steady, tolerant eye, focusing on the extremely varied characters with whom he shares his club and sleeping cars."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"I've read most of Paul Theroux's travel books, including \\"Ghost Train to the Eastern Star\\". In \\"Ghost Train\\", he retraces parts of his 1973 trip 35 years later. Somehow I'd thought reading his earlier book would be a waste of time because, a.) the world has changed too much, and b.) he was younger and I supposed that he'd be purposely sardonic to set his travel book apart from more gushing chronicles. I was wrong on both counts. It was fascinating to read about traveling by train in Vietnam at the end of the war. Unbelievable really that he was that brave or stupid as to go there. I kept \\"Ghost Train\\" by my side and reread the chapters on Burma, Vietnam, and the Trans-Siberian railway to compare his observations. I highly recommend reading the two sequentially, in either order."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"When, some thirty years later, Paul Theroux repeated the journey that he had described in The Great Railway Bazaar, he declared travel writing to be \`the lowest form of literary self-indulgence.' His original journey in the early 1970s was a deliberate act, a ruse upon which to hang a book. The travel featured was nothing less than an occupation, whose sole product was to be collected and recorded experience. We, the readers, must thank him for his single-minded devotion to selfishness, for The Great Railway Bazaar takes us all the way there without having to leave the armchair.The journey began and finished in London. In between Paul Theroux took the orient Express to Istanbul and then crossed Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan before doing the length of India. He even went to Sri Lanka by train. Then there was Burma and a meander through South-East Asia. His account of smoking cigarettes in Vientiane will stick in the mind. Malaysia and Singapore were taken in, the latter clearly not being to the writer's taste. Japan was clearly a curious experience, but the Trans Siberia from near Vladivostok to Moscow seemed strangely predictable, its length being its major characteristic. Eventually, the final leg across Europe hardly counted, a mere step along a much bigger way.Any such journey can only offer mere impressions of the places en route, but such first impressions are always interesting in themselves, if not always accurate or justified. Thirty years on, some of them may even have historical significance. It would be a challenging task these days to cross the current Iran and Afghanistan by rail. And a contemporary journey would surely cross China, a route barred to the 1970s independent traveller.But it's the people met along the way that give the book its prime characters. We never get to know these people and we encounter them largely as caricatures, but it is the experience of travel that is described, and this experience inevitably involves a multitude of these ephemeral encounters. They are always engaging. We expect to be confronted with the surprising, the unknown and the little understood. We expect the experience to be recorded, whilst the mundane is edited out of the account. And furthermore, we do try to make sense of our often confused responses to the unexpected. This is why we travel: at its base it is a challenge.Paul Theroux does litter the trip with indulgence, however. There is a fairly constant search for alcoholic beverages, for instance. Furthermore, in several places there are encounters with and deliberate attempts to seek out the local low life. Offers of girls, boys, older women, wives, transvestites and every imaginable service are received. Sometimes, the services in question require some imagination. It is easy, of course, to sensationalise experience when it is sought at the margins of what a society dares to admit. In the case of Japan, where much of this material is located, it has to be admitted that the margins are rather wide.Balancing this crudity is Paul Theroux's constant desire to reflect upon his love of literature. Some of the material he recollects produces some wonderful insights, surprising juxtapositions and apposite comment.Travel writing might be pure self-indulgence, but this particular example of the vice transcends the purely personal. It feels like being taken along for the ride. Thus, like all good travel writing, The Great railway Bazaar is not merely an account of another's observations, it is nothing less than a journey to be experienced."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"The Great Railway Bazaar is a unique book, to me. I can't say exactly what is so interesting about it - maybe the variety of situations, scenarios and stuff. I could really see myself inside old trains among the lavish vegetation of India or Southestern Asia, the rough sea between Russia and Japan, or the Middle Eastern deserts. I've tried, but up to now I haven't found a book as interesting as this one."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"In The Great Railway Bazaar, the journey is the destination for Paul Theroux. Not concerned with checking off sites in a guidebook, Theroux winds his way across Asia and back again by train. I have often contemplated a similar venture. I believe it forces us to look away from the tourist sites and forces interaction with the people and customs that make up a culture, if only to pass the time.By doing so, Theroux encounters a wide cast of characters that are interesting and able to bring out some ugliness in the author. However, this is all too human. That's what makes this book, and Theroux's other travel work special.I see him as the antithesis to the hosts of shows like Globe Trekker, who can't stop from smiling and enjoying the job the producers of the show have done to get them into situations the average traveler mostly won't encounter. Where was the crap they had to deal with? Did they ever get mad at anyone? Did they ever get hassled? If the answer is yes, we never see it. But, Theroux adds all that to his work. I think that is the truth of travel, and is a better guide than most guidebooks around.This was the third travel book I have read of Theroux's and I wonder how I would have liked it if it was my first. With the other two (Old Patagonia Express and Dark Star Safari) you can tell he is a much more mature, if still misanthropic writer. I think I still would have enjoyed it, because it is a truthful narrative of a traveler on a long-term adventure with an unsure end. Perhaps that what makes this book so open and raw.I highly recommend The Great Railway Bazaar. It is a great travel narrative that provides some historical insight into train travel in Asia due to the changes that have occurred since the author wrote it."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"I recently read Ghost Train to the Eastern Star (which re-creates the trip described in The Great Railway Bazaar and comments on the earlier trip). Although I thought that the writing is better and more interesting in The Great Railway Bazaar, this book lacks the perspective on writing that makes Ghost Train to the Eastern Star special for authors.For many years, I traveled across the United States by slow trains (on a free pass) over 72 hours. I was always glad to have the trip end . . . except for that one time I met an interesting young woman (but that's a story for another time).I would find the kind of trip that Mr. Theroux describes to be unendurable. It's not surprising that he did, too. And that spoils much of the potential fun of this book.He is fixated on giving you more than you ever wanted to know about bad meals, poor ticket-buying experiences, missing visas, getting drunk, poor sanitary facilities, and unpleasant companions. Mr. Theroux takes himself very seriously. That's too bad. A little humor about his situation would have helped.From Ghost Train to the Eastern Star, it's not hard to know why: His marriage was falling apart and he couldn't really afford the trip. All I can say is that his problems show.Imagine instead that a poor person had been granted this same opportunity: It would have been like a magic carpet ride. Unfortunately, you take yourself with you when you are a travel writer.There are some good moments in the book. Occasionally, Mr. Theroux has enough knowledge about a country and its people to use his journey to comment in a helpful way about the culture. Most Americans will be fascinated to read about South Vietnam after American troops had pulled out and before the final reunification by force. In the early going, a fellow traveler makes the mistake of spending a little too much time at a station . . . with consequences that Mr. Theroux has some fun with.Japanese people may not like the portrait that Mr. Theroux displays of their nation. It has little to do with railways and railway travel.Fans of India, by contrast, may enjoy his relative enthusiasm for that populous and challenging nation.Sometimes the material isn't in the best of taste. I didn't really need to read about his investigation of the ladies-for-hire offerings in an Asian country."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"... and this book is indeed an old friend, for it is the work that introduced me - and many others - to Paul Theroux. It was this book that introduced me to Theroux's charming crankiness, his wickedly astute ability to size up a human interaction and make the most of it - almost like a young boy who starts to craft a \\"whopper\\" - but most of all, his uncanny talent for observing a scene for nary a moment and offering up visualization that stays in the mind's eye for ages.Here is Theroux's oft-quoted take on pulling into one of Europe's crown jewels: \\"Venice, like a drawing room in a gas station, is approached through a vast apron of infertile industrial flatlands, criss-crossed with black sewer troughs and stinking of oil, the gigantic sinks and stoves of refineries and factories, all intimidating the delicate dwarfed city beyond.\\"But there is more, just as artful, sometimes better:\\"...modernization stopped in Turkey with the death of Ataturk, at five minutes past nine on November 10, 1938. As if to demonstrate this, the room in which he died is as he left it, and all the clocks in the palace show the time as 9:05. This seemed to explain why the Turks typically dress the way people did in 1938, in hairy brown sweaters and argyle socks, in baggy pinstriped pants and blue serge suits with padded shoulders, flapping winglike lapels and a three-pointed hanky in the breast pocket. Their hair is wavy with brilliantine and their mustaches are waxed...\\"Or this: \\"Laos, a river bank, had been overrun and ransacked; it was one of America's expensive practical jokes, a motiveless place where nothing was made, everything imported; a kingdom with baffling pretensions to Frenchness... the more I thought of it, the more it seemed like a lower form of life, like the cross-eyed planarian or squashy amoeba, the sort of creature that can't even die when it is cut to ribbons.\\"Or: \\"The mountains had begun to rise, acquiring the shape of ampitheaters with a prospect of the China Sea; eerie and bare and blue, their summits smothered in mist, they trailed smoke from slash-and-burn fires... Now it was sunny and warm: the Vietnamese climbed up to the roofs of the coaches and sat with their legs hanging past the eaves. We were close enough to the beach to hear the pounding surf, and ahead in the curving inlets that doubled up the train, fishing smacks and canoes rode the frothy breakers to the shore, where men in parasol hats spun circular webbed nets over the crayfish.\\"\\"Railway Bazaar\\" has been derided by some for offering only a fleeting glimpse of various cultures from a train window and a quick layover; truth be told, that is what foreign travel consists of even for the most intrepid traveler who is not an anthropologist or social scientist. Theroux does a perfectly splendid job painting a portrait of a war-ravaged Vietnam where GIs and the locals have come to somewhat cynical terms with the denouement, and his vivid and disquieting depiction of the infusion of sexual violence into mainstream entertainment (theater and even comic books) in Japan is among the best I have read about this dark underside of that culture.And then there are the characters of his passing parade, the bit real-life players that Theroux shapes into larger-than-life caricatures. They are at turns annoying, stealthy, invasive, pedantic, morose and beatific, and Theroux breathes life into them - each a literary joy in his or her own way.Theroux has a wonderful knack for taking the last paragraph of his creations (many, at least) and crystallizing the mood of that work within a final sentence or two (think \\"Saint Jack\\" and \\"My Secret History\\"). He does that in \\"Railway Bazaar\\" and when the literary train pulls into the station, you want to step off quickly, grab a refreshment, then reboard for another ride.Old Friends like this do need revisiting every so often."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"Theroux seems like he's doing a phenomenology of travel here: recording the exotic vignettes of his railway journey, yet not creating a travelogue a la Lowell Thomas. His observations are keen, sometimes cynical; he certainly doesn't sugar-coat his descriptions for his audience's benefit.Is he the curmudgeon that his critics villify him as? Certainly YES! His acerbic wit and the intense depictions of the scenes are made possible because of his grumpy ways. Like I said: this guy does not sugar-coat things. He calls it like he sees it - that's why it's great writing. The \\"readable\\" factor transcends his complaining and occasional snap judgements that some reviewers misinterpret as him being a misanthrope.Theroux can evoke the images: the smell of rancid onions wafting from a dirty newspaper; the character profiles that put you right there in theoppressive heat; the landscape sketches that feel familiar yet are on the other side of the world. This book almost reads like literature.What about the \\"entertainment value\\"? - Doesn't get much better than this.Extracts: A Field Guide for Iconoclasts"},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"We travel not simply to escape ourselves and our own world but to better know others, and ourselves. There are certain travelers one thinks of DeTocqueville who in their journeying provide an understanding of the world they are seeing which is much deeper than any native has. There are travelers even fictional ones like Huckleberry Finn who make of their traveling a rich adventure in knowing places and their characters.Theroux in the few books of his which I have read has I am sorry to say never really seemed to me to get beyond the reported and incidental, the minor personal anecdote which does not illuminate in a deep way. Here he travels through a whole list of fascinating places but seems to go by them rather than through them.It may be true for Theroux as for Quixote that it is the road rather than the inn which is important and it is the sheer going and getting on which is most on his mind. But for this one reader what was on his mind , this trip anyway, was simply not interesting enough."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"Reading this book is like taking a trip to the past. The first edition of the book was actually printed in 1974 & many countries have changed since. U.S.S.R is no longer a communist country, Iran is \\"liberated\\" by Khomeini, Afghanistan is ruled by the Talibans, Burma is better known as Myanmar, Vietnam is rebuilding itself from the aftermath of Vietnam War, India is jumping upon the bandwagon on Information Technology to catch up with the rest of the world, Pakistan has a nuclear capacity to match its neighbour(India)'s counterpart, & so forth. Then, there are countries which are evolving or remaining stagnant such as Ceylon (Sri Lanka) which still has a divided racial problem (thus, problem with the Tamil Tiger guerillas), Singapore is still fast-paced & skycrapers dominate the landscape, Thailand a place for misadventures, predictable Japan with almost all Japanese behave in an orderly fashion, & others. The author didn't write the book to capture the political scenes of the time but writing about the feel, the smell, the essence of the places that he came across. There's no better way to achieve the feat by getting acquainted with passengers & staff that he came across in the train, observing the state of the trains they were in, how time schedules were adhered by the train authorities, the cornucopia of people from all facets of society that gathered at the train station akin to a bazaar. To my antonishment, despite the book was almost 30 years old, characters of the people in their respective countries remain almost status quo & thus, reading this book now is as relevant as reading it 30 years ago. Paul's description of the landscape is vivid & his talent in absorbing the mannerisms & slangs of those places are uncanny. The book would be even more fun to read if he provided a glossary of explaining foreign words which he never elaborated further other than mentioning them briefly. For example, the usage of Singlish, that is the Singapore version of English which required the addition of -lah towards the end of sentences, and -lah itself doesn't have any meaning to it would only be known to people of those region & I wouldn't expect readers from Europe would be able to grasp with that. Paul seems to put a lot of effort in writing about the India continent & for readers who yearn to know more about India, William Darymple's books shouldn't be missed. Still, an enjoyable book to read & a worthy companion for travelling purpose. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"One long railway journey from England to Turkey to India to Japan to Russia and back to England passing through various countries along the way. If you like to read about lands and their people, this book is not for you. If you want to experience the customs of Asian countries, you should skip this book. In fact, if you expect anything other than a description of a railway journey, trains and a few co-passengers, you are bound to be disappointed. When you have finally convinced yourself that you are going to get nothing more out of this book other than trains and passengers, you can settle down to read it and find it fairly enjoyable. Paul Theroux describes some of the passengers characteristic of each country well, but omits describing some of the customs and traditions of the people themselves which would have made better reading, thereby loosing the 'travel' flavor I was expecting."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"I enjoyed this book for its wonderful sensuosity, but found the author's superior and condescending tone frustrating. I found myself wondering why on Earth he took the trip if he wasn't going to at least try to appreciate the people and cultures he visited? Still, he took me on a journey I'll probably make myself and, while Theroux may not have relished the adventure, I did."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"A very enjoyable book, especially considering that not much really happens! I found myself wishing that he had explored a few places in more detail, for example, Bangkok gets only a few pages and few witty lines, but we don't get the flavor of the place..."},{"Title":"The Great Railway Bazaar - By Train Through Asia","review":"One question that might come to mind while reading this book is \\"Why?\\" Why in the world would one bother to travel all the way across Asia and back, restricting that journey almost exclusively to sitting in trains? Like P.J. O'Rourke, Theroux seems to be interested only in drinking and describing what a horrible time he is having in horrible places. He rarely stops to see anything, and even when he does those stops are very brief. Even the few genuinely beautiful places he bothers to see are often described in rather deprecatory terms (see, for example, his description of the Sikh Golden Temple in Amritsar as \\"a copper-gilt gazebo in the center of a tank\\"). The only places he seems to have liked at all were Istanbul, Peshawar, the Ashau Valley in Vietnam, and Kyoto (incidentally, one of the few bits of the book worth reading is his account of his meeting with the great Turkish novelist Yasar Kemal in Istanbul). Indeed, the attitudes he expresses about the people in the countries he visits are so appallingly and consistently contemptuous, with absolutely no attempt at understanding, that they border on the racist. The reviewers who refer to Theroux as a curmudgeon and a misanthrope are expressing mild judgments, in my opinion. The stars I am giving this are for the interesting descriptions of Vietnam (the one place where he seems to have tried to practise some empathy with the locals) and the underbelly of the Japanese soul. Michael Palin's light but enlightening \\"Himalaya\\"Himalayarepresents a refreshingly different approach from that of Theroux, as do the more serious books of Colin ThubronShadow of the Silk Road (P.S.), Jason ElliotMirrors of the Unseen: Journeys in Iranand Robert KaplanThe Ends of the Earth: A Journey at the Dawn of the Twenty-first Century. Interestingly, Theroux's book about travels in Africa,Dark Star Safari: Overland from Cairo to Cape Town, is also very good. Writing almost 30 years after The Great Railway Bazaar, the Theroux of Dark Star Safari is a much more mature and appreciative observer."},{"Title":"Guerrilla Marketing for Consultants: Breakthrough Tactics for Winning Profitable Clients","review":"Consulting is considered one of the most profitable professions, and is one of the last to remain unregulated. As a result, it attracts a variety of firms and people who often exaggerate their capabilities in an effort to gain attention and attract business. Authors Jay Conrad Levinson and Michael W. McLaughlin succumb to the same problem as consultants who promise their clients too much. The \\"breakthrough tactics\\" they advertise on the book's front cover never quite materialize and the promise deflates the sound advice they do provide. The first two-thirds of the book addresses \\"guerrilla marketing,\\" a term used to sell other books, but not particularly apt for the familiar tactics here. However, the authors provide a good rundown on some solid, well-accepted components of marketing, such as public relations, advertising, surveys, books, speeches, Web sites and 'pro bono' work. They teach good management, which can transform and re-energize these tactics. Things pick up a little in the final third of the book as the authors discuss sales techniques, including pricing, dealing with competition and preparing a proposal. We suggest this useful (if not warrior-like) book to beginning marketers and consultants, and to the owners of small consulting firms."},{"Title":"Guerrilla Marketing for Consultants: Breakthrough Tactics for Winning Profitable Clients","review":"If you buy this book expecting to learn about some startling new idea or theory, you are going to be disappointed. But what you will get are literally hundreds of practical, useable tips for professional services marketing. As a consultant, what I like about this book is that it gives me, all in one place, a reference manual that covers the whole spectrum of marketing and selling. This is one of those books that I expect will end up all dog-eared, filled with hand-scrawled reminders, and stuffed with post-it notes and page markers. I especially liked the chapter on pricing services -- that chapter should be read by every professional before they submit any proposal for work. It's the kind of practical advice that can save you a boatload of money.My only gripe is that the title is really not accurate.

The author covers all of the major topics from advertising to relationship marketing. The chapters on building a proposal and on setting fees are probably worth the price you pay for the book. The Bad: The primary author has spent a good deal of his career working for Deloitte - bringing in large multi-million dollar contracts. The vast majority of his advice is written from the point of view of a medium to large consulting firm. He constantly refers to your firm's staff or consulting team. This means that if you are a sole proprietorship/independent consultant...much of the advice is difficult to apply. In general, if you are on your own or running a small consulting firm...go with one of Alan Weiss' books.

Still, I questioned whether a self-employed private investigator could really employ methods developed for professional consultants. I found that I can, because I face the same challenges that any other business owner faces: sluggish or erratic growth; fierce competition; newcomers who are willing to undercut rates to astonishing levels; and clients who are in turn open to marketing or completely fed up with being targeted. The techniques put forth in this book are helping me to develop a unique approach that I am confident will, at the very least, win me an initial interview with a prospective client because I will not be seen as the \\"same old same old.\\""},{"Title":"Guerrilla Marketing for Consultants: Breakthrough Tactics for Winning Profitable Clients","review":"If you provide any type of consulting service then you need this book.

Based on this experience, it's clear to me that the essence of marketing for consultants is creating a kind of gravitational pull which attracts clients to you. Advertising and knocking on doors just doesn't work. McClaughlin and Levinson totally understand this--McClaughlin himself is a consulting veteran who spent many years at Deloitte. Their book is based on real experience, and it sets out a wonderful set of very practical things you can do to attract clients and establish your name in the marketplace.

The Israel fathered by American and European intellectualism? This child that is not Israel's child, is this all that is set to inherit the success of the fathers who scrambled and built the nation? Fima who is so close in age to Israel itself is paralyzed and inept, and worst of all aware of it. Perhaps most interesting of the subjects addressed in the novel is that of abortion. Although there is an attempt to portray with some realism the subject and emotion of abortion, it is the symbolism of the defeated Israel, the Israel that might have been, that is carried most successfully in the material. Not that this weakens the novel, it just carries the reader away from the personal and to the national. Published in 1991, Oz predicted correctly that a peace must be reached, but that it would have to be the butchers and the gangsters who broker it."},{"Title":"Fima","review":"There are many people who suggest that Amos Oz is actually a political activist, not a writer. In fact, I think he is both. He has very clear political views (and, incidentally, I completely agree with him and admire him for them) and is a very skilled writer, who has good ideas for fiction books and is able to lay them out in very transparent prose, which makes the result infallibly a pleasure to read. And not only a pleasure, but a food for thought.\\"Fima\\" is a book where at least two planes are immediately discernible. They are in agreement with the \\"double identity\\" of the author - one is a great critical view of Israel's political situation, with an acute analysis of nearly every fraction and orientation, the media, the traditions, the language; the second one is a great portrait of the main character, Efraim (Fima) Nisan who expresses all the layers of the first plane. Probably one of the greater protagonists in the contemporary literature, Fima has a complex personality, which makes him rather difficult to deal with. Difficult for his friends and family as well as for the reader - he is not easy to classify in any way, he is neither a hero nor a villain... If anything, he might be called an anti-hero of our times.A middle-aged man, Fima lives alone in an apartment in Jerusalem. He is divorced, practically lives off his father, who owns a successful cosmetics factory and at every visit slips some money into Fima's pocket. Although he missed nothing in life, being from a well- off family and having received a solid education in humanities, Fima cannot be called successful himself. At least not in the American sense of the word. I cannot blame the American readers who wrote the reviews below for perceiving him as a loser - by their standards he is one. He works at the reception desk in the gynecological clinic. Sometimes he does not show up to work at all. From time to time he writes an article to a magazine, mostly expressing his political views, proof- reads the scientific papers of his friends - professors, and helps the nurse at the clinic with more difficult crossword clues. Intelectually, he is missing nothing. Still, he is absolutely lost in his relations with people, in the daily life, a mess of animated and unanimated surroundings, he takes things as they come but does nothing with them. He ponders on every detail, every smallest event cause him to stop on his way or change completely the course of his day. Everything can be a beginning of a small philosophical treatise.Oz puts in Fima's mouth the criticism of Israeli political course, the never ending war with the Arabs, which are probably his own views, but being uttered by Fima, an absolutely passive being, who does absolutely nothing to change anything (in fact, he is an emotional parasite), they become a criticism of the Israeli left as well. In fact, I know a lot of people who opposed the system in exactly the same way as Fima does, by passive resistance and this helped them to stay sane and support the change when it came, therefore they are not completely useless. Nevertheless, someone else had to initiate the change."},{"Title":"Fima","review":"Amos Oz's &quot;Fima&quot; as translated by Nicholas de Lange is the story of Efraim Nison, son of a cosmetics manufacturing industrialist, and an intellectual and poet whose life never quite gets off the ground. He spends half his time working as a lowly receptionist in a clinic and the other half struggling to stay in one piece, if not boring his friends to death pontificating about the dismal state of politics prevailing in the modern state of Israel. He engages his family and friends but is succoured by them. His relationships with various women including his ex-wife are also frankly ludicrous. But Efraim's incoherent and wasted life cannot be interpreted as anything other than Oz's metaphor for the moribund state of Israel's moral authority after securing its own nationhood. He questions the hardline Jewish approach to its Arab neighbours today by drawing parallels with the mentality of the Nazis in the 30s and 40s. The lurking blood hound in man is humourously but no less chillingly portrayed in the episode with the cockroach. Dimi's shattering confession to Efraim about the dog is equally poignant. Oz, though cynical about the lasting effects of positive action on future generations, ends on a quietly optimistic note. &quot;Fima&quot; isn't exactly an easy book to digest. The symbolism is a little heavyhanded in parts, but the undeniable sense of humour in Oz's writing carries the book. Oz is in fine form for most of the way but gets distracted and loses focus towards the last third. Still, &quot;Fima&quot; makes an intellectually stimulating read and is definitely worth checking out."},{"Title":"Fima","review":"Amos Oz, along with David Grossman, are two of Israel's finest living authors. They craft good to great literature in its own right, and couple it with the twists and nuances that define the Jewish identity. Moreover, it is the identity of those who have chosen to forego the \\"diaspora.\\"I first recognized Oz's talent after reading a collection of his non-fiction vignettes of Israel in the \`80's, entitledIn the Land of Israel (Harvest in Translation). Fima is his first work of fiction that I've read. Reviewers have called the protagonist, Efraim (Fima) Nisan, a Jewish \\"Walter Mitty.\\" James Thurber, inSecret Lives of Walter Mitty and of James Thurber (Wonderfully Illustrated Short Pieces) (No. 1)introduced this term into the English language to denote a generally ineffectual individual who lives his life in daydreams and fantasies. Oz draws a fascinating portrait of this archetype, rooted in the Land of Israel. Fima is on the cusp of late middle age, working as a receptionist in a gynecology clinic, still surviving on handouts from his father. For sure, his fantasies involve women, especially the ones neglected by their husbands, who may or not be an easy \\"mark.\\" The novel is \\"dense,\\" with the personal insights of good literature, surrounding islands of scathing political commentary, which only a Jew \\"of the land\\" can readily and safely make. A couple of right-wing Israeli reviewers have inferred that Fima's ineffectual nature is an apt symbol for the entire Jewish Left. But before the politics, consider the depictive touches that require the turning on of the bathroom faucet in order to encourage what is only a thin trickle.As for the politics, Oz is clear-sighted, and pulls no punches. For example: \\"Although in fact it might be a healthy and wholly laudable sense of shame that prevented us from announcing simply: a Jewish solder has shot and killed an Arab teenager.\\" Rather, with the corruption of language that Oz denounces, it was a \\"plastic bullet\\" that killed the Arab, and only \\"presumably\\" by the Jewish soldier. Oz has Fima rant even, about the idea that Auschwitz should be a Jewish site. Instead, he would rather saddle the place with Christendom in general, and Polish Catholicism in particular. More scalding still: \\"Why the hell are we all brain-washed into believing that the concept of human equality is something alien to Judaism, a flawed goyish commodity, tainted Christian pacifism, whereas the muddle-headed mishmash brewed up by some messianic rabbi, the grandfather of Gush Emunim, who has cobbled together a patchwork of scraps from Hegel, Judah Halevi, and Rabbi Loew of Prague, is suddenly considered to be the pure elixir of Judaism, straight from Mount Sinai? What is this? Sheer lunacy!\\"Ah, and there is the perennial subject of, in this case, man's relationship with women: \\"We've had to put up with so much bull**** from the poets, with their Beatrices, their earth mothers, their gazelles, their tigresses... and all that nonsense. Let me tell you, being a man strikes me as a thousand times more complicated than that. Or maybe it's not complicated at all, all that lousy bargaining. You give me sex, I'll give you a bit of tenderness. Or an impression of tenderness.\\"Oz assumes his reader is well-read, and there are numerous references to the world's literature, and a bit more challenging (or educating) for the non-Jewish reader, to Jewish history and tradition as well. After all, how many non-Jews know what Rabbi Loew of Prague is famous (or is it infamous) for?A joy to read, with prose that \\"goes down smooth.\\" A solid 5-stars."},{"Title":"Fima","review":"I swear I was planning on calling this review \\"Amos Oz the Prophet\\" before seeing the similarly titled review :-) There are two types of good books in my mind. There's the thriller which you consume like a bag of potato chips and then its gone. Then there are quality gems like Fima which you read slowly, maybe over a period of weeks or months and you take in everything it has to say; within the food metaphor, these are like cheese cake or a 30 year scotch, you savor every taste. Amos Oz creates an odd main character to share his political take on Israel society about around 1990. He makes predictions that have become eerily true (topping the list is that a left wing leader who tries to make peace with the Palestinians would be killed by an Israeli...Rabin)."},{"Title":"Fima","review":"In Fima, Amoz Oz plays with an age old theme in Jewish literature: the over-intellectual ne'er-do-well who cannot quite get his life on track. In Yiddish, this person is known as a luftmensch (literally an air person): someone with big schemes and little ability to put them into practice. Add to this Efraim's (the Fima of the English title) physical dishevelment, his vacillation between gross worship and misogynistic attitudes toward women, and the picture is comedy without dipping into stereotype. Fima keeps his humanity in the novel, despite Oz's obvious play with a well-known Jewish stock character. Also in Fima one can sense Oz trying to come to terms with women: with the problem of women in male literature and with his own writing about them. Oz has seldom written well-rounded female character, and in Fima there is a tacit acknowledgement of this. The novel's title is a man's name, but really the book is about, in great part, an exploration of male attitudes toward women."},{"Title":"Fima","review":"Fima was my introduction to the writings of Amos Oz.

Fimaseems to be confused and quitte frankly , not really interested ofwhat he wants from life . He is obsessed though with politics .

Through insignificant ,onlyon the surface ,chats like the one with the taxi driver , Oz is tryingto speak once again about the vital need for peace in the area . Theproblem is that his book will bore someone who is not interested orinformed about the Middle East crisis and furthermore , it lacks acertain plot to keep the reader entertained."},{"Title":"Fima","review":"While Oz, the admirable peace activist, may have intended to symbolize the state of Israel with his loveable, yet senile protagonist, and while this symbolism rings true, he also succeeds in brilliantly depicting Israel's left or pro-Palestinian Jews as so seriously demented one wonders how society can fail to commit them to some type of institution, where, one hopes, treatment can be found.Even if the reader has no sympathy for the plight of our neighbors, our cousins, the Palestinian people, no feeling of remorse for the degradation and cruelty inflicted upon them by the IDF, by the end of the story, some sympathy/remorse will emerge. As Amira Hass wrote recently in Haaretz, it is difficult for us to criticize, never mind condemn our soldiers, for they are our brothers, our sons, our friends, and we know their experiences. We know their fear. Yet Oz, by calling himself a demented lunatic who rightfully ought to be committed, wins us over, somewhat. Perhaps, out of fear, we do go too far. Perhaps Hass is right - for the Palestinian degraded by \\"routine\\" inspections, the soldier is Israel - and we choose to ignore and disregard the Palestinian perspective. Yet even most of us in the \\"right wing\\" know that the Palestinian is not our enemy. Their \\"government\\", their \\"system of education\\", their censored \\"media\\" and of course Hamas - these institutions and the people behind them are our enemies.However, the Jewish left goes far beyond Amira Hass's reasonable suggestions. As Fima rightly understands, over ten years ago, even reasonable demands (such as an end to demolitions unless they've been proven in a court to have smuggling tunnels below them or to be homes that harbor terrorists, or an end to the degradation of Palestinians at checkpoints and an open door policy on anyone in need of medical assistance), demands most of us would otherwise be ready to agree to, fall to the wayside as our mouths hang agape, in shock at the absurdity that groups like B'Tselem churn out like McDonald's hamburgers - you know it's not kosher - in fact, you know that it's crap, but it's omnipresent. Fima argues with himself that if only the right knew that the left wouldn't go too far, wouldn't give it all away and leave us, again, with nothing, that we'd all give the Palestinians most of what they want (what Barak offered them) and that would be the end of it. And to some extent, he's right. But there would have to be some trust, and Israelis, well, we can't have any trust right now. Stop bombing our buses and cafes for a while, give us a chance to rebuild that trust. The interaction between Palestinians and Israelis does slowly build that faith, but when Barak offered up whole towns as \\"goodwill gestures\\" during Camp David and the Palestinians responded by bombing women and children, well, that trust evaporated and the warm area where it had grown froze over. Barghouti says that the Intifada arose from anger over \\"failed\\" Camp David accords mixed with indignation over the Temple Mount riots. Barghouti, get with the picture. We offered you everything you'll ever hope to get and you killed our children. An Intifada on Your Intifada. A massacre on your massacre. Do you know the Purim story, Barghouti? (Bush announced that there would be a war on Purim, this year) When the Persians thought they'd massacre us, we turned the tables on them. The same things happened to you. Do you think we don't know how many of us you'd kill, had you the power? Had you the \\"weapons of mass destruction\\"? We know, and that's why we don't ever want to let you have your own port, your own airport, your own direct path to importing the means of our total destruction. Take a lesson from Saddam's current experience, it's not a good idea to encourage suicide bombers. Now that such actions are condemned as \\"terrorism\\" and now that there's a \\"war on terrorism\\" - perhaps you should rethink your own dementia during the days of Ehud Barak and the Golden Opportunity. Your move to Intifada then makes George W.'s strategies seem pure genius. Your line of logic elevates Bush's to the level of Albert Einstein. Barghouti, Jewish Left, time to get some thinkers on your side. All you've got now is RainMan and the WaterBoy. So lost, like Fima, in distracted and disjointed thoughts on three thousand different topics that one coherent sentence seems like a miracle.Yes, Oz, you've wrung some sympathy from my heart. Some for the Palestinians and yet far more for our Jewish Left, who can't get it together enough to form a sentence, and get us all to agree to what we've all been ready to give for a long, long time.While the world is aware of how the Palestinian lack of a free press, lack of freedom of speech has resulted in a propaganda machine no more honest than your average reporting on al Jazeera, our Jewish Left swallows it whole and is blissfully oblivious. Like Fima, smiling widely while wandering aimlessly in the streets."},{"Title":"Child Pornography: An Internet Crime","review":"The book is very well researched and very well written. The authors explore not only the user of child pornogrphy on the Internet, but the psychology of collecting in general and the topic of computer addiction in general. They are quick to relate these topics to the topic at hand.The authors are cautious against making unwarranted assumptions. They recognize the difference between child pornography and child erotica. In reply to Mr. Mankoff's question, the authors do not assume that all porno collectors are molesters. In fact, they explore the question of whether or not porno prevents contact crimes.Just in case anyone is interested in using the book as a manual on accessing Internet child [...], the authors purposely omit any such information."},{"Title":"Child Pornography: An Internet Crime","review":"I haven't read the book yet (had to assign stars or this couldn't be posted) but I am curious as to whether the authors provide solid empirical evidence (not merely anecdotal) that the vast majority of those who download child pornography are also child MOLESTERS.

So if you've previously read The Warmasters, perhaps in the hardcover that came out 2 months after Changer came out in paperback (ouch) make sure you want the other stories.Changer is a decent collection in setting some of the series backstory: but Baen has some explaining to do about it's recycling IMHO."},{"Title":"Changer of Worlds (Worlds of Honor, Book 3)","review":"This book contains 3 short stories by David Weber and one by Eric Flint.

One of them is an enjoyable description of her first cruise.The story by Eric Flint was a confusing hodge podge of plots and counter-plots. It was resolved, but not convincingly. However, the story did tell about the life of one of the less important characters from an earlier story. That was interesting.Over all I recommend the book to those who love Honor.It seems that Weber is not going to give us another novel anytime soon.

He is the author of three out of the four stories of the volume. Again, this is filler material that serves as window dressing for the main series of novels but it is no less entertaining for that. In fact, I think this is the best of the 3 collections thus far.Ms. Midshipwoman Harrington - This is a piece by Weber. It tells the tale of Harrington's first tour of duty in space and clearly shows foreshadowing of the character she is to become. She is confident, capable and does not suffer fools lightly. In this story, her ship is deployed to Silesia to suppress pirates. The pirates turn out to be more powerful than bargained for and it is the young midshipwoman who saves the day.Changer of Worlds - This is another work from Weber. It is a short story which details the treecat's decision to colonize other worlds with the help of their humans. The central characters are Nimitz and his mate, Samantha with Honor Harrington putting in a cameo.From the Highlands - This story is from Eric Flint and takes place in the capital of the Solarian Confederation: Chicago. It seems that 2 thousand years have done nothing to mitigate the existence of an underworld. The story concerns a plot by a rogue Peep SS agent to kidnap the daughter of a Manticorian intelligence agent as part of a plot to cover up his own shady dealings. What he does not count on is the resourcefulness of the young girl, the tenacity of her father and the presence of another Peep who is so morally outraged that he takes a hand in the situation. This is a good adventure story.Nightfall - Another story by Weber, this one seemed at first to be a plagiarism of part of one of his later HH novels. It tells the story of the battle of wills between Peep Adm. Esther McQueen and the Rob S. Pierre government. As it turns out, some of the verbiage is lifted directly from the other book but there is a wealth of additional story as well. It chronicles the events of McQueen's coup in much more detail than the novel.These are all solid stories and well worth the time."},{"Title":"Changer of Worlds (Worlds of Honor, Book 3)","review":"Changer of Worlds is Volume Three of Worlds of Honor series featuring short stories set in the universe of Weber's Honor Harrington series. This volume opens with Ms. Midshipwoman Harrington, a short novel about Honor's probationary voyage as a midshipwoman. Midshipwoman Harrington finds herself facing Silesian pirates and a superior officer hellbent on destroying her. Weber's story Changer of Worlds is largely about treecats Nimitz and Samantha, with Honor putting in a cameo. Eric Flint checks in with From the Highlands (the only story in this volume not written by Weber. This story is of Anton Zilwicki, a Manticoran captain whose daughter is kidnapped and his efforts to rescue her. This is my favorite story in this whole volume. Changer of Worlds closes with Weber's Nightfall, about the internal struggle within the Havenite power structure during the last days of the Rob S. Pierre government depicting a battle of wills between Pierre and Admiral Esther McQueen. Altogether, Changer of Worlds is another fine volume of stories set within the Honorverse, deepening the reader's understanding of the universe of Weber's HH series, and I look forward to reading Volume Four: The Service of the Sword."},{"Title":"Changer of Worlds (Worlds of Honor, Book 3)","review":"This book contains several different stories, totally unrelated. OK, so they each mention somebody in one of the other stories, but that's a big stretch to make them connected. I kept expecting them to come together at the end, but alas, you never find out what happened to the snottie after her first cruise, except that she became famous. The cats' plans are spelled out, but then what ever happened to them? (Not even an oblique reference later on.) A kidnapped girl has almost nothing to do with the confusing political intrigue that she shares a quarter of the pages with. And a battle shapes up for control of a government, only to be wrapped up abruptly in one page.The stories don't stand on their own and they don't fit together between the covers of one book. Only read it if you have already read other books by the author and want to see some scraps from the cutting room floor."},{"Title":"Changer of Worlds (Worlds of Honor, Book 3)","review":"Reading someone elses review here, I have the following question..Is there going to BE a sequel to Ashes? Anyone knows please let me know at twilight@snowhill.comThanks tons! PS I can see Honor eventually becoming Queen herself... it seems inevitable and I would love to see the series come out with enough books to make that a possibility.."},{"Title":"Changer of Worlds (Worlds of Honor, Book 3)","review":"First of all, I should say that I loved the first Harrington books so much, I would probably buy any book with David Weber's name on it. Granted, some of the later works have been a little less stellar, but the overall story still has me hooked. Now, on to the contents of this anthology. Three of the stories are by The Man himself, so I will discuss those first.MS. MIDSHIPWOMAN HARRINGTON is a little piece detailing some of Honor's early exploits against Silesian pirates and Manticoran bigots. Solidly written, it will no doubt provide a base for future short stories or novels set before Basilisk Station.CHANGER OF WORLDS is the first Harrington story told from the point of view of the 'cats. In it we learn Nimitz and Samantha's real names as they visit Nimitz's clan prior to the birth of their 'kittens. This story verifies some of the theories floated in previous novels as to why treecats decided to settle en masse on Grayson.Like some of the other reviewers, I enjoyed NIGHTFALL as a stand-alone story. It describes in much greater detail Esther McQueen's aborted coup attempt. While I was glad to learn more about the incident, however, I feel that this should rightfully have been told as part of a novel format. Perhaps if it had been switched for some of the endless backstory in ASHES OF HONOR, I would feel better about both books.Finally, Eric Flint's FROM THE HIGHLANDS is a nearly uncredited gem of a story. (You won't find his name anywhere on the cover.) We get to learn what happened to Anton Zilwicki after the death of his Navy-hero wife; it turns out he became a spy and went to Earth. When his daughter is kidnapped, several convergent story lines spring into action, leading to political disillusionment, True Romance, rioting in the streets, an assassination or two, and a general warm fuzzy feeling. I would be delighted if Flint wrote more in this vein, especially if he returned to characters like idealistic SS officer Victor Cachat. This could also be a chance for a lot of Weber fans to check out more of Flint's body of work. I know I will.To sum up, the three Weber stories are fine appendages to his books. For the most part, they detail events already described in general. While they stand up fairly well as individual stories, they don't really compare to Flint's tale."},{"Title":"Changer of Worlds (Worlds of Honor, Book 3)","review":"((Initial revelation of potential non-disinterest: I am David Weber's elder brother.))First, while i think the cover's better than the one on &quot;Worlds of Honor&quot;, it's still not right -- those legs belong on a tree-antelope, not a tree-cat.&quot;But what's *in* it?&quot;, right?This is another anthology, featuring three stories by Dave and one by Eric Flint.The first story is &quot;Ms. Midshipwoman Harrington&quot;. ((For a couple of reasons - ease of speaking being a major one, tradition another -- i think i'd have said &quot;misdhipman&quot;, but it's Dave's call -- his world, his ranks.))The story of Honor's &quot;Snotty&quot; cruise, it fills in the background on remarks she makes during &quot;Among Enemies&quot; about having been on pirate-chasing missions in Silesia.As usual, with Honor onboard, what ought to have been a relatively routine cruise with a bit of action and not much danger turns into something else. ((I mean, finding out you'll be serving with Honor Harrington is like being a cop in a small town finding out that Jessica Fletcher is visiting...)) And Ms. Midshipwoman Harrington finds that she must rise to the occasion when disaster strikes. This story is a little more open and clear about the political maneuvering between the &quot;working&quot; Navy and the &quot;timeserving&quot; Navy (my terms) in which Honor's career is already inevitably enmeshed, long before she knows it or of it.Also it has a Villain. I'll be writing a longer review for my new website, wherein i'll go into my thoughts on Villains vs. Bad Guys in Dave's stories. (By my reckoning, Rob Pierre is a Bad Guy -- Pavel Young is a Villain. Wossname who was behind the Dome failure is a Bad Guy [though with villainous tendencies] -- his dupe who Honor kills is a Villain.)Second story is &quot;Changer of Worlds&quot;, which has been available for more than a year on my family website by David's kind permission; it's the story of Laughs Brightly, bondmated to Cloud Dancer, who returns to his clan bringing Golden Voice, his new mate.We know these people a bit better under other names, suffice to say. (Hint -- one of them is also known as &quot;Nimitz&quot;)(Skipping the Eric Flint story for right now, we get to Dave's third, &quot;Nightfall&quot;.)&quot;Nightfall&quot; is one of those stories that eventually has to be told in some form, if only as footnotes in some other work, i guess, but which i'd as soon not read. Despite the fact that there's a rather nasty little slice of spacewar let loose planetside in a major city, it's pretty much a static story of coup and countercoup and political maneuver.We aready know the fates, if not descriptions of the actual events, of a number of characters from other books. &quot;Nightfall&quot; is the actual events. I found it uninvolving and unneeded.Now, back to Eric Flint's &quot;From the Highlands&quot;, which is, i think, the best piece of pure storytelling more or less for its own sake in the book. All of the other three stories are there to plug holes in the canon, and read more or less like that.&quot;Highlands&quot;, while it chronicles events that may well be as important in the future history of Manticore and Haven as the other three, just reads like a story Flint wanted to tell; in which we look at the ways Gryphon's Highlanders are like Scotland's.Involving conflicting and complex loyalties personal, patriotic and political, it revolves around the kidnapping of a fourteen-year-old girl whose father, a Gryphon Highlander, is an Intelligence Analyst attached to Manticore's Embassy in the Solarian League's capital city, Chicago.Not just any fourteen-year-old girl; we've seen her before, when she was four or so, asking her weeping father if Mama had made them all safe from the bad Peeps. And she is everything her mother's daughter should be -- she's already working on escape from her kidnappers when first we meet her.Before the story is over, we will be involved with Helen's father, with her martial arts instructor, with Havenite and Manticoran Ambassadors and their respective Security Chiefs, a young Peep SS Intelligence Field Officer who faces a personal crisis of identity (he actually believes in the ideals of the Revolution), a dissipated Peep Marine Colonel who is rather more, various genetically-engineered &quot;super-soldiers&quot; and revolutionary former slaves and an expatriate, far-leftist Manticoran noblewoman, one of only three people kicked out of the House of Lords by vote of their peers.Stir thoroughly, apply igniter and stand well back till the flames die down.Serve hot.I give the book three stars overall; just the first three stories would have gotten four, just the Weber stories alone about three stars.Good solid reading till the next novel, but it goes by awfully dismayingly and disappointingly quickly, which is one of the problems of a fast pace."},{"Title":"Changer of Worlds (Worlds of Honor, Book 3)","review":"Changer is worth having, bottom line. Ok? It's on the keeper shelf, and I had to move my sagas (the real thing) to fit it and begin leaving room for the next set of Honor Harringtons. Now to what's good and bad.Again, I complain that the treecats are getting too cute. I'm sorry, David, but they just aren't plausible to me. Not because of size, or a great many other easy objections, covered with a certain amount of neatness in the &quot;teach them to sign&quot; part of Ashes of Victory. I just can't quite believe in them as written. Annoying, by the bye, because I really want to believe in the treecat sentience. Sigh. Their society doesn't feel workable, as it is shown. Granted, oral history can be remarkably accurate up to 500 years back, and sometimes, in traditional societies without literacy, there are feats of memorization that astound us urban, literate types. I am objecting here to feel - it's all too damn pat.So anyway, onward.I really loved Ms. Midshipwoman Harrington, even if I did nearly type in Hornblower. I liked the portrait of an incompetent and cruel superior, who needed to be worked around by the command. I'm glad they did. Honor gets to be a hero - we knew she had been from early in her career - and handle having command fall on her head in a bad situation in a beautiful bit of space combat. I loved that - the whole battle sequence was so well written I was literally holding my breath until spots began dancing before my eyes. Very, very good stuff!Nightfall answered my objection in Ashes of Victory that Weber shouldn't kill off major characters off-stage. I enjoyed it, though I admit that knowing the ending kind of took the edge of tension off it. I rooted for Esther McQueen. I did think Weber offed Rob S. Pierre a little to fast and casual, but it was well written and I wish the sequence could have made it into Ashes. Although given the length of that book, perhaps that was a good editorial decision on Weber's part.Does it sound like I've been holding off on commenting on Eric Flint's contribution? I'm afraid I have been.Now, to be absolutely fair: Flint's &quot;about the author&quot; description describes him as an unregenerate Trotskyist. Having spent my college career on the Soviets, and exploring the really interesting splitting of semi-Marxist sects in America, I have developed some very strong opinions, and they aren't flattering to the ideology and its true believers.It makes me uneasy to comment on From the Highlands because it was better written than many of Flint's other efforts, and he didn't editorialize quite so badly. Oh, yeah, he did editorialize and lecture the reader, mostly about politics and who should believe what. I liked the plot, I liked the writing (and I'm thrilled that Flint managed to restrain his verbal tics, this time out) and the action sequences. The combat was good.Now, my objections crystalized in the moment where Flint has the State Sec officer heroically standing as a true defender of the Revolution, hard as steel. ARGH! To reach a truly disgusting level of brutality, bring on the knights of the revolution. Anybody remember Felix Dzerzhinski besides me? Anybody remember what Trotsky did to restore discipline in the Red Army in 1920? The defenders of the revolution will cut your throat quite impersonally. Isn't that nice, to know that you were just of the wrong class, or in the wrong place?That style of politics, the Gryphon Highlanders one and all haters of their aristocracy, and willing to contemplate blood feud. The renegade noblewoman (oh, please, can we please lose the notion that this is somehow a great thing?) who views her class through that particular lens (let's not forget that the notion of a class traitor, once introduced, however positively, leads inexorably to the negative and justifies a lot of bad stuff)and the Solly masses being kept down, dumb, and ignorantly happy...ARGH! again.Look, it's not that it wasn't fun. But the century just past has made me wary as can be of ideology (I almost misspelled that on purpose but decided it would be too cute), and the notion that all a messianic movement needs is pure enough hearts willing to defend it. Flint managed to make a mess of my enjoyment of the story with this, and I wanted to cry. I wanted to just enjoy the story, and I got this.So much for my opinions. I'd give this a four if Flint had managed to restrain his politics."},{"Title":"Changer of Worlds (Worlds of Honor, Book 3)","review":"Like many others addicted to the Honor Harrington series, I was drooling over the prospects of savoring the latest addition to Weber's engaging feast of antics and action by a ballsy, totally entrancing heroine in futuristic space fiction.I especially enjoyed the riveting &quot;From the Highlands&quot; by Eric Flint that provides quite a different angle on the aggressive, covert machinations of a highly developed underground where a Manticoran aristocrat exiled to Terra supports a network of revolutionists who are involved in the power struggle between the Peeps vs the Manties on Chicago's embattled turf. Weber's story &quot;Nightfall&quot; recounts the treachery and tyranny of Oscar Saint Just before he finally makes the call to blow up and bring down the Octagon upon the heads of both colleagues and his arch enemy Esther McQueen. It offered another point of view in those final moments that preceeded Saint Just's own demise in &quot;Ashes of Victory&quot;.The other two stories were tantalizing tidbits of before and after Honor had &quot;arrived&quot; to the here and now in David's ongoing saga. I love his consciousness toward animals, especially when he develops his theme of highly evolved sentience in Honor's treecats and their nestmates on Sphinx. It now is impossible to consider one's own cats as merely, well, cats. As Samantha might say to Nimitz: &quot;Little do they know&quot;.Congratulations on your newly wed status and the joys of a honeymoon, David, however your fans are waiting! Thanks for the appetizers in &quot;Changer of Worlds&quot;, now, where is the main dish?"},{"Title":"Changer of Worlds (Worlds of Honor, Book 3)","review":"To those who haven't read any other Honor Harrington book, this book will give you four small and very different tastes of the Honor universe. You will probably decide that the other 9 novels and 2 short story collections are now on your wish list, but you don't need the history to enjoy these stories - they stand on their own (with the possible exception of Nightfall).Fellow Honor fans, I recommend this - Honor's universe keeps getting bigger and better.This books has four great short stories set in the Honor Harrington universe. I loved this book. I am waiting in eager anticipation for the sequel to Ashes of Victory, but this book is much more than filler in between novels. This collection adds depth to the Honor Harrington universe. The first story shows Honor early in her career, before the war started and before she was in a leadership position. The last story expands on an incident from the latest novel (Ashes of Victory) and shows the enemy from their own point of view. You get to see Honor and her universe from her Treecat's point of view in the second story. The third story by Eric Flint has characters who know of Honor only through news headlines but have her heart and drive.Honor is the main character in only 1 of the stories, but don't let that deter you. Laughs Brightly, Golden Voice, Helen, Anton, Kevin Usher and Esther McQueen were introduced before but now we get to see them in depth and detail. Cathy, Victor, Virginia, Bachfisch, Shelton, and Branch Leaper are new to us and their relationships add spark and more diversity to the universe Honor inhabits. (and possibly foreshadow upcoming events in the next novel?)Write, David, write! Write, Eric, write! (I hope you add another story in the next collection!) These characters show and make us want more of their drive for Honor!"},{"Title":"Changer of Worlds (Worlds of Honor, Book 3)","review":"CHANGER OF WORLDS includes four short stories and novellas set in Honor Harrington's universe.Best of the four is FROM THE HIGHLANDS written by Eric Flint. A Manticoran captain joins with renegade Havenites, antislavery solarians, and a disgraced Manticoran noblewoman to rescue his daughter from kidnappers. To succeed, he must fight ethnic supermen, the Havenite SS, his own command chain dominated by the Manticore conservatives, and the local police. Excellent.Honor fans won't want to miss Ms. Midshipwoman Harrington--the beginning of Honor's career and nearly the end of it as she must face a superior officer bent on destroying her as well as external enemies. Relying on her leadership and skills rather than on conveniently discovered superweapons, this is classic Honor Harrington on a small scale.From a historical perspective, Nightfall is essential to the Honor continuity. It deals with the internal struggle between Admiral McQueen and Saint-Juste and defines the direction for the Havenite government.Way below average is the title story--Changer of Worlds. The treecats are cute and smart and all but this entire short story is simply a dialogue between a bunch of cats. Nothing happens, no character development takes place. The story merely describes the 'cats' decision to send the new colony of 'cats to follow Honor. Yawn. Read it if you love those 'cats--it is thankfully short after all."},{"Title":"Changer of Worlds (Worlds of Honor, Book 3)","review":"I gave this book 5 stars because I couldn't give it 4-1/2, which would have been my preference. I thought all of the stories in the collection were strong, especially &quot;Changer of Worlds&quot; and &quot;From the Highlands,&quot; and I found all of them very appropriate offerings for those of us who have been following Honor from the beginning. Dave has said repeatedly that there will never be a novel set earlier than On Basilisk Station, so these short pieces are obviously where he intends to fill in the back story, and so far, I think, he's done an excellent job of just that. In addition, he and the authors he invites in clearly are also using the stories as a way to fill us in on what else is happening contemperaneously to the Honor-centered events we see in the novels. In this collection, this is particularly true of Flint's &quot;From the Highlands,&quot; which I thought was an extraordinarily good piece of work.While I suppose one should hesitate to differ with the author's brother, I found &quot;Nightfall&quot; stood very much on its own merits, not just as a piece to fill in around the novel. I can't disagree with the observation that it's something of a downer, but it also deals with what is in many ways the endgame of a revolution which has been a downer from the outset.One thing I rather regret is that the title story -- &quot;Changer of Worlds&quot; -- has been available on-line for so long. I think it loses some of its punch for those of us who were thoroughly familiar with it before it actually saw print. For those readers who HAVEN'T already read it, however, you have a major treat in store for you.And as for &quot;Ms. Midshipwoman Harrington&quot; ... What can I say? This is vintage Honor of the On Basilisk Station/Honor of the Queen variety. Not only does it fill in more background on the Star Kingdom's military build-up and the &quot;old boy&quot; aristocratic mutual support society which operated so strongly in the RMN before the war, but it's also a ripsnorting action tale that shows our Honor to best advantage.It's not as strong as one of Dave's novels, no. But it's a darn good read, anyway, and I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Changer of Worlds (Worlds of Honor, Book 3)","review":"A collection of stories about Honor Harrington, the heroine of the popular space warfare series, this book provides solid entertainment for the fans of Mr. Weber.A Weber story of Honor's first cruise, combined with a treecat's view of some of the series developments, plus the story of McQueen's rebellion, form the bulk of this collection. Eric Flint provides a separate story, more loosely connected but still in the world and times of Honor's series.Due to Weber's heavy contribution, this collection is more consistent and integrated than earlier Honor's World anthologies. --inotherworlds.com"},{"Title":"Changer of Worlds (Worlds of Honor, Book 3)","review":"Changer of Worlds (2001) is the third anthology in the Worlds of Honor series. This volume contains four stories, three by David Weber and one by Eric Flint. Only the first story is about Honor herself.Ms. Midshipwoman Harrington by David Weber describes Honor's middy cruise with the HMS War Maiden on pirate-chasing duty in Silesia. It proves to be rather more interesting than usual and the Salamander finds herself in the hottest of combat for the first time.Changer of Worlds by David Weber tells what happens one afternoon while Honor babysits the kits for Nimitz and Samantha.From the Highlands by Eric Flint discloses the actual events underlying the Manpower Incident in Chicago on Old Earth. It all starts when somebody kidnaps Anton Zilwicki's daughter Helen. That was their first mistake, but hardly the last.Nightfall by David Weber depicts the last days of the Rob Pierre government and the consequences of making assumptions.These tales fill in some of the backstory and show other points of view within the main story arc. They enrich the universe and allow minor characters in the main story to take center stage.Highly recommended for Honor Harrington fans and anyone else who enjoys science fiction stories about spatial combat, alien societies, special ops or political intrigue.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Changer of Worlds (Worlds of Honor, Book 3)","review":"I have read what is available of this book ...and all I have to say is this book looks wonderful.

His teaching emphasized the values of social justice and respect for Law. His deep connection with the Jewish tradition and his great love for American society combined to make him an advocate for what is best in both traditions. In these essays he writes of philosophers, and jurists, who contributed much to American life in promoting social justice. This is an exemplary work by an exemplary teacher of great moral integrity."},{"Title":"Nine American Jewish Thinkers","review":"Divided into three parts reflecting Milton Konvitz's range of intellectual interests, Nine American Jewish Thinkers comprises nine essays offering concise intellectual biographies of three philosophers (Horace M. Kallen, Morris Raphael Cohen, Sidney Hook), three American Court Justices (Louis D. Brandeis, Benjamin N. Cardozo, Felix Frankfurter), and three rabbis (Leo Jung, Robert Goris, Jacob Agus). The author brings a special value to his commentaries in that he enjoyed a friendship with six of the persons who lives and work he examines. Nine American Jewish Thinkers is so well written and presented that it can be readily recommended to both scholarship and the non-specialist general reader with an interest in Judaic studies, biographies, and intellectual life."},{"Title":"Terence: Adelphoe (Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics) (English and Latin Edition)","review":"The commentary is very helpful as it explains words that may have different meanings in Latin prose. It also explains how the grammar is evolving at that point in Roman history. It is the best play that Terence has ever written and it is definitely worth reading it in the original language."},{"Title":"Terence: Adelphoe (Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics) (English and Latin Edition)","review":"This is a review of R.H. Martin's commentary on Terence's Adelphoe (\\"Adelphoe\\" is Greek for \\"Brothers\\") for the Cambridge green and yellow series. In a nutshell, this play is about the conflict that arises between two brothers when their respective sons (who are also biologically brothers; the elder has been adopted by his uncle) begin to engage in scandalous behavior in the course of carrying on illicit love affairs. The conflict is essentially about whether a strict or indulgent parenting style is the best approach to take in order to raise well-behaved and well-adjusted children, and as the plot of the play develops the reader is presented with arguments for both views and with pointed illustrations of the effects of each parenting approach in action. It is a mark of the Adelphoe's sophistication that no clear and obvious answer to the question of which parenting approach is the best ultimately emerges from the play. Terence seems not to be aiming to convey simple moral lessons but to provoke his audience to reflect on the complexities of parenting, the relationship between fathers and sons, and the extent to which youthful indiscretions in love are natural and excusable. Of course, the primary purpose of this play is to provide humorous entertainment, and the play's wide cast of characters display a mixture of realism, relatability, and ridiculousness in their words and actions that is remarkably similar to what one sees in a good modern sitcom. And beyond the effective construction of characters and plot in this play, Terence's Latin is exceptionally elegant and beautiful, making this text one of the high points of Roman drama and one of the great achievements of Latin Literature.This edition of this 997 line play includes about 50 pages of Latin text with an apparatus criticus, a 40 page introduction, 145 pages of commentary, two brief appendices (one on Terence's appropriation of the work of the Greek playwright Diphilus, one on the meters used in lines 610-17), a 5 page bibliography, an index, and 3 pages of addenda that were added for the 2001 reprint of this edition (some scholarship published between the first edition of this book in 1976 and 2001 was added to the biblography as well). This book constitutes a very sophisticated scholarly treatment of the Adelphoe that nevertheless seems to strive to be accessible to a student with at least 3 or 4 years of Latin experience. The introduction provides a fairly detailed overview of the career and artistic vision of Terence, a discussion of the relationship of his plays to their Greek models, a literary analysis of the themes and questions raised by the Adelphoe, a short guide to meter and scansion, and a brief discussion of the manuscript tradition.The commentary proper is primarily concerned with making difficult lines or phrases understandable for the reader, and usually these lines and phrases will be rendered into a literal English translation. Most of the time, however, there is no grammatical explanation provided for the translation, and this perhaps makes this edition rather less than ideal as a second or third year text given that it does not really utilize and reinforce the grammatical terminology and concepts that second or third year Latin students are still in the process of mastering. For more advanced students, though, the lexical and grammatical help provided is more than sufficient for efficiently reading through the play, and the commentator's focus on the nuances of Terence's syntax has the potential to be very enlightening. The commentary also features frequent discussions of the parallels between elements of language and plot in the Adelphoe and corresponding elements in Terence's other plays, the plays of Plautus, and the extant fragments of Greek New Comedy. The insights into the play afforded by the commentary of the ancient scholar Donatus and references to problems of textual criticism are likewise brought in where relevant. The commentary on each new scene is generally affixed with a short summary or literary analysis that contextualizes the scene in the broader plot development of the play or within the broader conventions of genre and stage-performance in which Terence is working. The layout of the commentary is unusually elegant for this series. Each line that is commented upon receives its own distinct paragraph in the commentary, and this creates a helpful amount of open space that makes navigating the commentary very easy.On the whole, this is an excellent commentary of an excellent play that is essential reading for anyone with a good command of Latin and a serious interest in Roman drama."},{"Title":"Terence: Adelphoe (Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics) (English and Latin Edition)","review":"I ordered this for my son for one of his college classes.

However, my admiration is based on my discovery and appreciation of his first book, A Fabricated Mexican.In the high schools and community college classrooms I have roamed, I have cajoled thousands of students into reading books I chose or assigned under duress. Some enjoyed the books; others later bragged that they'd merely read Cliff Notes. Rarely did I see the kinds of responses that students had to A Fabricated Mexican, Rivera's story of Ricky Coronado's journey from being conceived in a plum orchard (the house was crowded, and \\"you know how mens are,\\" as Ricky's mother, \\"illiterate in two languages,\\" sighs) to embracing his bicultural heritage and reconciling the deep chasms within himself. Does he ride off into the sunset triumphantly? Yes and no.The complexity, poignancy, humor, and emotional draw of the book lead to the responses I've witnessed from my college students. I have seen them leaning against the walls of Founders Hall doubled over with laughter as they hold the open book in their hands. They confess in journal responses that this is the first book they have ever read fully and with which they have interacted and identified so completely. They bring their copies for Rick's autograph, and when he speaks about writing and this novel, specifically, to my classes, students are enrapt and ask deep, reflective questions. They are indignant for every slight and hurt that Ricky Coronado endured, and they are humbled by the vulnerability he offers so willingly and frankly: his relationship with his mother, his father's suicide, his depression, and his battles with the self-medication of alcohol, drugs, food, and self-protective alienation and aloofness. These are students of all ages and ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds.It seems as if Ricky Coronado touches everyone who shares his life as he struggles to accept a new stepfather, atempts to bond with siblings many years older than he is, ponders the mysteries of life's creation through observing his dog and seeking an explanation from his science teacher, tries out unsuccessfully for baseball many times though he'd rather be reading a book (something only lazy people do, according to his mother), outwits his brother, Nacho, through his entrepreneurial use of fast food, floats down a river on an inner tube with Nacho, whose lack of navigational skills lead to a police search, heals his battered soul at Lake Tahoe with the help of a kind sister, Monica, and her husband, a local baseball star, proves the nay-sayers wrong when they tell him he just isn't \\"college material,\\" and finds some peace as an adult, although it is often elusive and temporary. A storm, or at least a drizzle, often follows any sunset into which he rides before the sun creeps out again.And this is perhaps the strength of the book: Ricky Coronado's self-doubts, anxiety, and depression are countered by his optimism, a sorely tested faith in himself, and a strong will. Cherish this book and the character who will not leave you the same as you were before you knew him, Ricky Coronado."},{"Title":"The Hardy Review","review":"Increasingly, the real (and exciting) work of scholarship nowtakes place in the interstices of the established means of academicdiscourse. Journal articles (dare I say it) exist largely for reasons of career and professional advancement, rather than communicating ideas and knowledge. Were that not the case, most scholarly publications would already have gravitated solely to Web publication, and the truly remarkable profits of the journal publishers would be no more.Equally, academic conferences, now often anticipated by pre-prints no longer exist for the communication of knowledge by the reading of a paper. The exchanges of value take place before and after the formal business, through face to face discussions. However, until The Hardy Review we did not posses anything that reflected the real life way in which the business of scholarship is actually transacted.So, I appreciate, as an enthusiast, what it contains, but value more its message for the future of scholarship. The sections of symposium papers are valuable, because they make permanent -material (like the work at the 1998 Hardy Conference), that might at best have disappeared into the half-world of what librarians call 'gray literature'. And the publication of graduate student essays in the Independent Essay section serves much the same purpose.However, the true innovation, which marks out the Hardy Review, is the Dialogues and Interactive Resources section. This of course, exists in electronic format on The Thomas Hardy Association website. But I was struck by how differently I read the Poem of the Month and Forum discussions in printed form from the way in which I perceived them in the electronic original.What came across from the electronic original was the sense of debate and vitality, but I found it easier to roam backwards and forward through the debate, to juxtapose one idea with another in the printed version. I think that there has also been some judicious editing which would not have been appropriate initially, while the discussion was in spate, but which now helps to clarify the issues after the flood of ideas and comment have subsided.What the first issue of this remarkable publication made clear to me was what the future relationship of electronic and printed scholarly productions will be. The Hardy Review shows that future working, and working well. That is: the debate and flux will take place via the Internet, and probably mostly by email. But from that will emerge a work of record, and that will still be better read, largely for paratextual reasons, in printed page codex format.Of course, something like this was done in the nineteenth century, when the proceeding of learned societies often recorded the oral commentary from the floor. But The Hardy Review moves beyond this. Those oral contributions usually lacked substance by comparison with the power and force of the prepared written text. The prepared text was primary and the oral contributions secondary. But here the email debate, although carrying some of the oral immediacy, is still written text; transferred to the written page, it is unmarked by the oral/written shift that limited the earlier attempt to interpolate text and comment. All the material here exists on the same textual plane and it transfers easily and effectively to the printed page.Of course, anyone could have downloaded this same material from the internet site, but it would have lacked the editorial 'post-co-ordination', to appropriate another term from library science, which helps to clarify and frame the arguments.The Thomas Hardy Association site has been rightly recognized as a pioneering and highly effective venture. The Hardy Review shares those same qualities of innovation.

I am glad to see that Ramdoom House Audio Publishing group has decided to make this new series available in the audio format. I generally buy all the audiobooks having to do with Star Wars. This first installment in this series is quite good. Four Jedi teams including Obi Won and Aniken are sent to a planet which is being decimated by a toxic outbreak and its their job to bring calm and help with the evacuation. Aniken is tested here for he has to put is brash tactics aside and work together with the other jedi students. Of course there are inner conflicts and we see the beginnings of Aniken's desteny. I think Jude Watson has captured this aspect of Aniken right on. The story itself is quite good and has plenty of action scenes to keep the listener interested. Jonathan Davis who did a great job in narrating the novel version of Attack of the Clones reads this one as well. He manages quite nicely to give the slue of characters presented here a distinct voice. He is a nice addition to my audio library. The only minor complaint I have with this book is that there were no space battles; but the ground battles made up for it. I am looking forward to listening to Jedi Quest 2 now. In case anyone is interested there are now over 75 audio books in the Star Wars saga which encompass three different time lines. 1, the prequel years, 2, post Return of the Jedi, 3, The New Jedi Order; I have found all the books to be top notch in value and listen to them over and over again.

Especially because she didn't even know she had a sister! As she begins to investigate if her sister really exists, Hyo-Bin goes further into the realm of the supernatural when her psychic friend says that her case might be an example of \\"Bing-Ui\\" in which a ghost attaches itself to a person or object. Besides problems of the ghostly kind, Ji-Hwan's pseudo-girlfriend has had about enough of her man's interest in Hyo-Bin, and she's prepared to do just about anything to end that interest, including pulling out a knife to scare away her rival!I'm giving up on this series after reading this volume. The writer seems to have forgotten that the main plotline of the story is the supernatural element. What started in the second volume and continues through this one is the metamorphosis to a pretty much straight up school romance sans the horror. Left to their own devices, without any emotional buttons being pushed by the unknown, these characters are pretty boring. The entire school scene is repetitive and nothing you haven't seen in a million other shojo manga. Add to this that No's character designs look too similar, and after a while you begin to think you are watching wild giraffes, so extended are the character's necks and limbs. And what's up with the artist's obsession with plaid?! If No had created the universe, probably even the sun and planets would be plaid!

The book is alive with voices and scenes from the past -- I was especially interested to read how Tom Smith actually talked, and what he had to say about the Biscuit. The description of Seabiscuit's birth is really interesting; I found out that he wasn't even named for awhile, because his original owners were too busy with their more promising-looking colts! Little did they know...The race descriptions have a feeling of exhilaration about them, as if Beckwith can scarcely believe that he was privileged enough to see this great horse in action. And it's very touching to read what people of the time thought about Seabiscuit, and how the man in the street talked about him as if he were a well-loved personality, whose every win is celebrated, and every loss commiserated. You can really see just how important this fiesty little racehorse was to the country.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Seabiscuit: The saga of a great champion","review":"Anyone interested in the actual story of Seabiscuit and racing in general should own this book. Not only is it beautifully produced, it is an authentic account of a bygone era, the &quot;proof&quot; for the claim that Seabiscuit was indeed immensely popular in pre-WWII America. In fact, it is only because of that World War that Seabiscuit was forgotten for so long.This is the original story of Seabiscuit written by a track writer who knew the main characters personally, Charles Howard, Red Pollard, and especially Tom Smith. Beckwith's book is the source for many of the quotes made famous in Hillenbrand's best seller and in the movie, such as Tom Smith saying to Seabiscuit, &quot;I'll see you again.&quot; It is great to read these quotes in context. I also enjoyed the terrific line drawings by Howard Brodie--the one of Seabiscuit sleeping on his side is priceless!Beckwith's book was an important source of information for the story of Seabiscuit and it is so great to be able to go back in time and enjoy this moving story with all the excitement and energy of the moment it happened. Five Stars. I highly recommend it without reservation."},{"Title":"Seabiscuit: The saga of a great champion","review":"With all the popular hoopla surrounding the story of Seabiscuit, this new book provides an interesting &quot;contemporary&quot; perspective from writers who were alive and covering this amazing story at the time of all the action. This new high quality re-print of the original book provides an insight and a &quot;voice&quot; to the story which is simply unavailable to any writer today. The preface by Grantland Rice is worth the entire price of the book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Seabiscuit: The saga of a great champion","review":"I knew B.K. Beckwith personally, and worked with him the last ten years of his life at Santa Anita. He was our television commercial spokesperson for the Santa Anita Handicap for several years, recounting remembrances of Seabiscuit. He was a consummate horseman turned journalist and writer, and had been at Santa Anita from the opening on Christmas 1934. He also wrote &quot;The Story of Santa Anita,&quot; which was never published commercially, but used the same heroic and emotional Grantland Rice style that you enjoy in his Seabiscuit book. His memory was a treasure, and since he wrote this book contemporaneously with events, you can feel the horse come alive, as well as the people and the places. This is SO GREAT to have the publisher find this work of art, enjoyable for anyone who loves horses, or racing, of any age. The drawings by Howard Brodie -- who went on to great fame otherwise -- are superbly reproduced, and so are the historic photos. You can see the 'Biscuit's personality come through, especially when he's looking out of his personal railroad car at all the fans and cameras, and in several others!"},{"Title":"Seabiscuit: The saga of a great champion","review":"Good for all ages.Step back in time and stand with the crowds to watch the Biscuit fly down the track. Beckwith takes you there again as he did when he wrote this book more than 60 years ago. The writing style, the photos, and the fabulous drawings all help immerse the reader in the late 1930's time period. I particularly enjoyed seeing the real Seabiscuit and hearing what the owner, trainer, and jockey had to say at the time.If you enjoyed the movie and/or Laura Hillenbrand's book, you will treasure this wonderful piece of tangible history. I recommend this edition highly. Don't miss your opportunity to own this gem!"},{"Title":"Seabiscuit: The saga of a great champion","review":"Owner of Ponder Publishing Company, LLC, my first response after reading was \`I wish I had found Beckwith's story before this publisher did!' I was there! I heard Seabiscuit breathing. I saw him sweat, felt his determination, smelled the liniment. You could taste the air of early last century, to anguish and rejoice with one horse's determination to Keep on Keeping on, despite all adversity. Here, love touches a reader, as it touched the crowds who flocked to admire the Biscuit, in the flesh, his ample flesh.

Beautifully done by someone who knew the main characters well.Nothing to find fault with here. Terrific read."},{"Title":"Seabiscuit: The saga of a great champion","review":"Seabiscuit was my favorite book in elementary school and still rates high amongst a handful of favorites. Many times over decades, circumstances gained perspective by recalling the depth of spirit and perseverance conveyed so concisely by Mr. Beckwith. Seabiscuit's story is truly for all ages. I believe stories like this are a reason why people are prone to assign human emotions to animals or treat them like a best friend.As a child I often dreamt about having a horse, hoping I might even be fortunate enough to have one like Seabiscuit. I ended up with four, all of whom indelibly changed my life. I took care of them as if my life depended upon them; even sleeping with them in their stalls when I could get away with it. Bingo, Scamper, Scully and Crackerjack have permanent places in my heart. With them is a picture of Seabiscuit from Mr. Beckwith's book. They always gave their very best and showed me mine. Anyone who reads Seabiscuit's story will come to understand that the innate ability to recover and succeed resides in every person and all life. Opportunity to find and use that power of heart and energy is always available.I am infinitely grateful to Mr. Beckwith for recognizing and writing Seabiscuit's story and especially to my father for making a vital, life changing dream come true."},{"Title":"Seabiscuit: The saga of a great champion","review":"The photos and sketches are wonderful as is the timeliness (1940) of the writing.

I did a vanity search in Amazon not really expecting to find something I actually wrote! I wrote this paper for my NASA Internship Project just after finishing my undergrad degree in 1988. It's an interesting approach to estimating hardware fault latency. The methodology came from a brilliant prof at the University of Michigan whose work we sponsored. The only real contribution I made was to apply a statistical regression technique to estimating the CDF (cummulative distribution function) of the fault latency which took advantage of the fact that we know a CDF is a non-decreasing function. The regression methodology is not mine. Only the application of it to this problem.

Its use of insulting and denigrating language was in extremely bad taste. (Who can forget p.141, where it says, &quot;That's the shot you need to kill the faith-eating bacteria of the cults.&quot;?)There was little accuracy in this book.

Furthermore, the patronizing title of this book is insulting and assumes that evangelical youth are absolutely clueless about cults. While I agree with the authors that the doctrines of JWs and Mormons are false, I disagree with their presentation of the material. Don't waste your time purchasing this book - if you do you will be disappointed. If you would like your teens to learn more about the harmful doctrines of cults, have them read such books as Hank Hanegraaf's Christianity in Crisis or Walter Martin's Kingdom of the Cults."},{"Title":"What's with the Dudes at the Door: Stuff to Know When the Cults Come Knocking","review":"I read a full review of this book.From the quotes from the book I would not let my kid read this book.

Why? Because it is the preferences and prejudices of our youth that to a great extent determines the kind of adult we will become. In some cases this is good (your parents' instruction in morality) in some cases this is bad (Hitler youth). This book has targeted the baser side of this equation. The way this book teaches you to think and react to those of a faith different from your own is quite similar to the way other prejudices are instilled in people. It is the easy path to dislike those different from ourselves. That's why the nation is divided into two ideologies that walk in lockstep. It is quite another to think for yourself. If your desire is the latter, this book is not for you."},{"Title":"What's with the Dudes at the Door: Stuff to Know When the Cults Come Knocking","review":"I am wondering why those interested in other faiths do not investigate them for themselves. Why read a book of someone telling you what to believe rather than checking it out for yourself. I think that one of hte interesting differences in Mormons sharing their religion compared to other faiths sharing theirs is that Mormons never ask you to accept it based on someone else's opinion or advice. They ask you to ask God and get your answer directly from God. Also interesting to me is those that say Mormons believe in a different Christ. There is only one Christ that walked the streets of Jerusalem, that atoned for the sins of mankind and was crucified on the cross for claiming to be the son of God. Even Jews and non Christians acknowledge a historical figure named Jesus Christ.Catholics, Mormons and protestants may define his teachings differently but he is the same God. They are not worshipping two different Gods. That is just silly, it is the same Christ and the difference is just understanding his teachings and attributes differently, so I would love the argument to be dropped that it is a different Christ, it is the same son of God, it is just people understanding him differently. This book is condescending and I find it amazing that those claiming to be strong Christians would publish such a book that discriminates against others trying to find their faith and their God. I find it a book filled with hate and promotion of discrimination against other faiths rather than supporting our country of hte United states and the freedom of religion. The lives that have been lost of those promoting freedom to worship in our country sickens me when someone publishes such a book to encourage hatred and condescencion and rudeness to those who believe in a faith that works for them. What happened to tolerance? Why are other faiths so worried about Mormons? Do they think that individuals are not intelligent enough to ask God and get an answer for themselves. Have some faith in your parishioners that they don't need to be told what to believe but they can ask God and find out for themselves and live up to the principle of kindness and respect that I used to think was associated with Christianity."},{"Title":"What's with the Dudes at the Door: Stuff to Know When the Cults Come Knocking","review":"I *have* read this book, and it is nothing more than anti-Mormon propaganda written in a condescending style in an attempt to attract young people who can't see the ugliness for what it is.If you don't like Mormons and if you want to read something that will justify your own beliefs and if you don't mind the pain of watching an adult try to speak as he thinks a teenager would, this is the book for you.Everyone else should stay away."},{"Title":"What's with the Dudes at the Door: Stuff to Know When the Cults Come Knocking","review":"I know it states in the Bible in Luke 6:37- &quot;Judge not, and ye shall not be judged; condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned; forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: These people should uplift others not put something down when you do not have the full story.

That said, this book is accurate and fairly well written, though the language is a little dated. Anyone who claims that this book is not accurate and is untrue simply does not want to face the truth.

Maybe YOU would consider joining US tomorrow morning at OUR church. Then we could talk.\\" (Pg. 10)\\"Trying to read the Bible through 'Jesus Only' glasses can become ridiculous.

This strong personality claims special insight into God's truth and convinces others he knows what he's talking about. Founders of cults are usually good organizers but even better communicators. People gather round because of the force of their speaking and personality, and they manage to build a following.\\" (Pg. 102)\\"Historically we have an eensy weensy problem finding any evidence of the existence of folks called 'Nephites' or 'Lamanites.'

I have been reading many books on cults in the past years of my life to learn, who, what, and where they are. This book is very accurate on what it says. I enjoy reading it andit speaks the truth. Some of the passages can be taken out of context and changed in this book to sound as if it is bad, but you must read all of it to understand. This book is taken out of context just like the Bible is by cults. Anybody, child, teen, adult, who is interested in learning about different cults should know this is a good place to start. It explains cults in good terms. I would also suggest reading, &quot;So What's the Difference?&quot; It is a book that talks about all religions and which ones are cults. This book is good. It has some very good references to Bible passages."},{"Title":"What's with the Dudes at the Door: Stuff to Know When the Cults Come Knocking","review":"This book doesnt cut corners or try to sugar coat the truth. Mormons are NOT Christians, the Christ they claim to worship, is not the Christ of the Bible, it is the Christ thought up in the mind of J. Smith and further propogated by more lies to cover up the first. Mormons need to stop saying \\"That is not what we believe\\" and realize what the \\"church\\" itself teaches.This book shares the truth and I have used it in classes and educated many teens so that they can know the truth when an Elder comes by and uses all the same Christian words they are familiar with. Mormons claim Christians are going to hell and are apostate and yet they are trying to appear Christain. Amazing! I feel badly for Mormons becuase most of them are sincere and are lied to.

Someone in an earlier review suggested giving this to a high school or college student. My suggestion is, maybe not. It is more suited to a junior high audience. Out of perhaps 150 of my junior and senior high school students who read this book as a requirment for an apologetics Bible class (semester long), I would say about half would have given it 4 or 5 stars. A number of the students were honestly insulted by the way the authors tried to be &quot;hip&quot; in their use of slang. Unfortunately, the teens just don't talk like this anymore. (Maybe, like, 10 years ago the language was &quot;cool.&quot;) Based on this, I changed my policy and no longer have it as required reading, but I still offer it as a choice, and some actually gravitate to an apologetics book that is such easy reading.So, while this book may not be for everyone, I still give it four stars (even though I haven't read it cover to cover myself) because the information is very pertinent to those who are just now exploring their faith. As I tell my students, there is coming a time when it will no longer be OK to borrow their parents' faith. In fact, it is time to own their own faith. A book like this introduces some different philosophies that they will be inundated with in the not-so-distant future.

Alternative Sports Day focuses on cognitive activities instead of physical prowess and the students are divided into small groups. Adam has a turn at bat, so to speak because at last he is given a chance to shine!This is truly an outstanding book.

First published in 1928, certainly it is somewhat dated. Still, the setting is interesting, the mystery at least clever, and the characters range from impressive (Templar himself and Patricia Holm), to stereotyped but delightful ('Orace), to a little ctoo much P.G. Wodehouse/Bertie Wooster in many of the supporting players. That being said, MEET THE TIGER is a rousing debut, and this early Simon Templar is much harder and more resourceful than his later television incarnation, while at the same time his optimistic determination and rakish smile continue to amuse and delight. Charteris followed MEET THE TIGER with some &quot;prequel&quot; Saint short stories, and then perfected his hero in a series of novels about the encroaching war. A couple of other strong Saint novels (and several perfect short stories) followed, before the character lapsed into formula. Still, there were a few gems in those later decades-- and The Saint has been around a very long time. Still, MEET THE TIGER was first, and should be experienced."},{"Title":"Meet--the Tiger!","review":"\\"Meet The Tiger\\" (later retitled \\"The Saint meets the Tiger\\") published in 1928, was Leslie Charteris's first book in the Saint Saga (even though Hodder & Stoughton later pretended thatEnter the Saintwas, presumably because they weren't the publishers of the former).It's a useful (though not infallible) rule of thumb that if a book doesn't hook you by the end of the first page, it's not going to. Here are the first two paragraphs of \\"Meet the Tiger\\":'Baycombe is a village on the North of Devon coast that is so isolated from civilisation that even at the height of the summer holiday season it is neglected by the rush of lean and plump, tall and short, papas, mammas, and infants. Consequently, there was some sort of excuse for a man who had taken up his dwelling there falling into the monotony of regular habits &mdash; even for a man who had only lived there for three days &mdash; even (let the worst be known) for a man so unconventional as Simon Templar.It was not so very long after Simon Templar had settled down in Baycombe that the peacefully sedate village became most unsettled, and things began to happen there that shocked and flabbergasted its peacefully sedate inhabitants, as will be related; but at first Simon Templar found Baycombe as dull as it had been for the last six hundred years.'Not the greatest opening Leslie Charteris ever wrote &mdash; he was to become pretty skillful later &mdash; but quite respectable for a young man of 21 in only his third book. The character so introduced, of course, was to become the longest-running fictional hero of the 20th century.Even at this early stage, the Saint (plausibly from his initials &mdash; but you knew that) is a more well-developed, more travelled and certainly more eccentric character than his near-contemporary, Bulldog Drummond. There are few of the wilder parts of the world which he has not visited, and few of those in which he has not had adventures.

He deserted after a year in the Spanish Foreign Legion (Drummond would have been horrified at the idea of joining, let alone deserting).Likewise Patricia Holm, the Saint's companion in so many later adventures, is a much more interesting heroine than boring little Phyllis Drummond, who exists only to be kidnapped and rescued &mdash; someone whom the swine have got, or might get, and nothing more.The elements of the plot are pretty much the standard stuff of the day: a debonair hero for the reader to identify with; a million dollars in gold stolen from a Chicago bank by a mysterious mastermind known as The Tiger; a gang of ruthless criminals; and of course a damsel in distress. What separates this from the majority of such efforts is the way Charteris plays with these elements &mdash; tongue clearly in cheek, in places &mdash; and weaves a story that carries you along from first to last.

They're definitely best if read in the right order.P.S. For a list of -- and discussion of -- all Charteris's Saint books, see my So You'd Like To... Guide."},{"Title":"Runner in the sun: A story of Indian maize (Land of the free series, junion historical novels)","review":"A society under stress must change or be destroyed. A pre-columbian Native American village in the Southwest has endured many years of drought and has reached its breaking point. Will the external forces of nature or the internal strife of the people be the hammer that shatters the village? This question is explored through the eyes of a boy, named Salt in the language of his people. Salt survives the machinations of a powerful member of his tribe, then begins a quest to find salvation for his people. Ostensibly a novel for young adults, Runner in the Sun presents a complex metaphor to explore the forces of societal change within a familiar hero-quest plot. The story seems simple but has rich soil in which anthropological and linguistic fruit may grow. Even the boy's name, Salt, carries metaphorical depth. As the village's water evaporates in drought, what is left is the people's true essence--the minerals the water carried. D'Arcy McNickle's lifelong focus on the shape of Indian society and its relationship to its surrounding world are expressed in the mythic context of Runner in the Sun (which is also a plain good read, too)."},{"Title":"The Coming of Josephson","review":"Jess Josephson has a message he wants to share, so he offers twenty dollars to each person who will come and listen to a twenty-minute presentation. He can afford to do this because he is a wealthy building contractor. Soon he becomes a media phenomenon and soon after that he develops a cult following. What is his message? That religions have misrepresented God with scare tactics, that God is not in the business of rewarding and punishing, that people must re-evaluate their understanding of God.Well, you can imagine the response of organized religions (all kinds) and the powerful enemies who emerge, especially his arch-nemesis, the Rev. Johnny Deus, country-twanged televangelist. What will happen? Will Jess start a new religion? Will he even survive? Suspense builds rapidly to a totally surprising climax.The author is a fresh new writer with a delightful style. The book draws you right in and sweeps you along in its unlikely premise. The author writes wonderful dialogue and has a fantastic ear for local accents. You will come to care about these characters and what happens to them. A most enjoyable read and much to think about. I recommend Josephson highly."},{"Title":"The Before Columbus Foundation Fiction Anthology","review":"I, along with many others, was selling this in the Az Marketplace.

Gulzari Lal is a prosperous property owner and the easy-going and kindly patriarch. He has long been separated from his wife Sarla Devi, but is content with his mistress, the plump, wily and honey-tongued widow Kusum. She would like to marry him, but that would involve a divorce from Sarla Devi which her brother, Brij Mohan, forbids as an insult to his family's honour. So one strand in the novel is how Kusum attempts to secure her heart's desire.Another strand concerns Gulzari Lal's rather ineffectual son Vishnu who works in a desultory way in his father's office and who mixes with the \`modern' younger generation, to the dismay of his very traditional and limited wife Mala, an unhappy and lonely figure.A third strand is about a \`colony' of very poor people living in Bundi Busti, a slum area on the edge of the town, and who face eviction by property speculators: Gulzari Lal and Vishnu, though not wicked or unscrupulous by nature, become drawn in this scheme, while Sarla Devi, who sees herself as a social worker, is working hard to save them from eviction. She and another character in the book, Vishnu's friend Gautam, represent the ascetic side of Indian life, critical of what materialism is doing to modern India. There is also a mystical side to Sarla Devi.All these characters are well and richly drawn (Kusum in particular); they frequently quarrel, but as nearly frequently make up afterwards: it's sometimes a little hard to keep up with the complications of their relationships. And the Indian settings, indoors and out of doors, are of course very well observed."},{"Title":"Get ready for battle","review":"Slow start but engaging and entertaining novella which portrays Indian culture at the crossroads with western influence.

It's short (38 pages), teaches less than 75 vocabulary words, and does nothing to explain pinyin.

It also gives ideogram visual memory tips (relates the modern drawings to the pictures they're describing) which are quite helpful.

The book is the only thing worth buying in this kit, however, making the kit overpriced. The clay was like a rock, and even after soaking it in water for what seemed like ages, I found it difficult to use and mold. I threw it out and used Sculpey clay instead.The book is excellent, however. It talks about creating Goddess altars, gives meditations for each of the Goddesses presented, and lays out detailed instructions for creating the figures within. There are many Goddesses presented from many different cultures. Some of the statues are very simple to create, others require more skill, meaning it will take some time to grow out of the activities in this book.Buy the book, use Sculpey clay instead, and you've got an interesting activity for many meditative afternoons."},{"Title":"Create Your Own Goddess","review":"This is a lovely &amp; unique kit including a book, modeling clay, and modeling tool.

Truly unique &amp; inspiring."},{"Title":"The Columbia Anthology of Traditional Chinese Literature","review":"'The Columbia Anthology of Traditional Chinese Literature,' Edited by Victor Mair, is a very large book of over 1300 pages which offers the reader &quot;a broad selection of expertly translated texts from the widest possible variety of sources.&quot; The selection, which seems on the whole to have been very well done, has been arranged in five main divisions: Foundations and Interpretations; Verse; Prose; Fiction; and Oral and Performing Arts. Besides the familiar, readers will find here much interesting material they may not have seen before - for example: extracts from Shang Divination Records, Bronze Inscriptions, wonderful Buddhist stories, and so on.As for the translations, Mair tells us that almost all of them were done by &quot;professional sinologists teaching in American universities.&quot; These lightly annotated academic translations range in quality from the excellent work of scholars of the caliber of Burton Watson and Leon Hurvitz, through to the rather pedestrian efforts of the less inspired, in fairly equal balance. The selections are preceded by an interesting and informative 10-page Preface by the Editor, and a double-page Map of the Provinces of China.The book is rounded out with a table of the Principal Chinese Dynasties and Periods, and a Wade-Giles to Pinyin conversion table. Since this information is readily available elsewhere, neither of these tables are really necessary, though Mair is to be commended on his decision to employ a modified Wade-Giles system of transcription throughout the anthology, in preference to the &quot;extremely repulsive&quot; (Needham) Pinyin so beloved by most modern sinologists.Since Mair felt that they would be &quot;useless and out of place,&quot; no Chinese characters (sinographs) have been given for any of the Chinese names, book titles, etc. A far more serious omission is the complete absence from this book of an Index. We are given neither an Index of Names, nor an Index of Titles - not even a General Index in which they could been bundled together. We have not even been given a List of Contributors (there are over one hundred) except on the back of the dust-jacket where we learn that among the non-academic translators are luminaries such as Pound, Snyder, and Rexroth. This makes the book extremely difficult to use.Locating specific items involves repeated and tiresome searches through the 14-page 258-item Table of Contents. For example, Mair tells us in his Preface that because of its great popularity he has included some selections from Lin Yutang's translation of 'Six Chapters of a Floating Life.' But it will take you some time to find out where they are. And if, as I am, you happen to be interested in a specific translator such as Lin Yutang, since the translators' names are not shown in the Table of Contents, you will have to leaf through all 1300 pages to find their contributions. It will also take you a lot of searching to determine, for example, whether or not Lu Chi's 'Wen fu' (Essay on Literature) has been included in the book. So far as I can see, it hasn't - but I could be wrong. And if it hasn't been included, I wonder why?The book is stitched and well-printed in a readable font on excellent paper. Anyone who is looking for a comprehensive anthology of traditional Chinese Literature understood in its broadest sense, and in scholarly and exact (though not always inspired) translations with informative notes, will find much that is of very real interest and value in this book. I've enjoyed reading many of the selections, and have benefited from their brief and interesting notes.And Professor Mair is certainly to be more than commended on his decision to employ the older and elegant - though imperfect - Wade-Giles system of transcription, rather than the trendy and ugly - and just as imperfect - modern Pinyin system. But I do wish the book had included at least a General Index!"},{"Title":"The Columbia Anthology of Traditional Chinese Literature","review":"The Columbia Anthology provides a fascinating glimpse into the work of traditional Chinese masters and novices alike for those of us who are armchair Sinophiles. The book is broken into genres which satisfies the academic and offers enough raw material to be somewhat overwhelming, hence the difficulty that arises in most anthologies. However, it is impressive in both scope and simple, poignant beauty with revealing insights into the Chinese world of court gentry and peasants toiling in the fields. Somewhat akin to the Norton Series of Western literature, the Columbia Anthology is not a venture to be transversed lightly. But in toil comes the sweeter stuff of dreams and traditional Chinese literature is the world of heavy eyelids drifting into mystical worlds both human and otherwordly. This book is highly recommended but not if you have an appointment to keep shortly after straining your arm dragging this beheamoth from the front porch. Tread lightly into this wonderful world but, dear reader, please tred."},{"Title":"The Columbia Anthology of Traditional Chinese Literature","review":"Organized by genre rather than chronologically and with no index, complaints were made about the difficulty finding particular selections.Since i wasn't familiar with the literature, I wasn't searching much. In the table of contents poets are listed with their works, though their works are not all going to be in the same category.This is eastern thought with a much less aggressive way of looking at things so I wasn't sure what to make of it. Some Lotus sutra or buddhist text was pretty difficutl to read because i wasn't that interested in it. Other parables or stories were more humorous.These are just excerpts of longer pieces of fictional or possibly early historical writing. Mair will offer you 2 chpaters out of a hundred.

Here, the world is not a familiar, mundane, surface. In the title poem, &quot;Antarctica&quot; she demands, &quot;look me in the eye when I'm speaking to you.&quot; Once you pick up this book, you wont' dare look away.Whether you've lived in Santa Cruz, California a few months or a lifetime, Sirens' poetry will challenge you to see this city through new eyes,the eyes of a Rebel Angel: &quot;highway one veers away from the sea/snaking valley and river's jugular/church chimes charm the dreamer/save the sailor/drown the savior&quot; (&quot;Barn Swallows&quot;). The Rebel Angel lineage of poetry descends from an unbroken line of risk-takers and poet-prophets such as William Blake, Allen Ginsberg, Alice Notley, and Eileen Myles. This is the poetry I hunger for. This is necessary magic.In Sirens' poem &quot;Odyssea,&quot; we are given what we need to know &quot;how to talk heron and crow and coax the wildflowers from the ground they will listen to your stories and love you for your silences/they will remind you that you are wild and holy.&quot; There is the possibility of communication with what is natural and wise in the world(s) surrounding this one. I found that &quot;Antarctica&quot; is a metaphor for both the earth and the inner self; all those vast uninhabitable places where we find ourselves lost and without sustenance. We also long for these places as they force us to meet a deeper truth. This is wilderness that has its own presence and powers and is indifferent to our individual survival.Sometimes there are no answers; only memories, regrets or sex and dreams and desire. This is honest poetry; no promises of redemption unless you are in the process of reinventing the world. &quot;In the photo we are smiling but really our hearts were tearing apart like when you slice open a piece of fruit and you pull the halves away from the pit how what is whole suddenly finds something hollow in itself&quot; (Dead Wallendas&quot;).At the same time, Sirens is wryly humorous in poems such as, &quot;The Telephone Rang,&quot; &quot;Courage,&quot; and &quot;All There Is.&quot; This collection finds a vital balance that will appeal to poetry lovers, lovers of language, and new converts. And if you've heard Patti Sirens' performance of her work, you'll be glad, as I was, to find a full collection of poetry that carries its power on the page as well as one the stage.&quot;Amelia's Last Flight&quot; is an invocation and a prophecy, &quot;I believed there were angels/creatures of light who came from the stars/lived in the wet grass/crawled through the night grass/seeing with feral eyes/who were proud in god's eyes and maybe god's themselves.&quot; With the repetition if &quot;grass grass&quot;: and &quot;eyes, eyes,&quot; it is as if an ancient chant is summoning strength for the journey. This is the way to enter the next millennium. Are you going to creep into the future? Or are you going to put on your black boots and create revolution? Patti Sirens' book, Antarctica, is the initiation you've been waiting for."},{"Title":"The Chinese Garden","review":"Manning's nearly forgotten novel is among those set in girls' boarding schools. Rachel is a bright student who befriends one of the school's rebels, Margaret. They are surrounded by teachers who dress as men and act with stoney authority. Margaret brings a copy of \\"The Well of Loneliness\\" into the school, and eventually gets caught with another girl, thereby implicating Rachel in her activities. Rachel is faced with the hypocrisy of the school's staff and with her own growing sensuality, and ultimately must betray her friend or suffer her fate. What I found most remarkable about the story was Manning's use of complex metaphors paralleling the story of Adam &amp; Eve's ingestion of knowledge. It may be a dated story, but there's still much in which to delight."},{"Title":"The Chinese Garden","review":"Rachel is a young girl residing at Bampfield, a boarding school that regards its students as masculine and embraces independence.

Margaret is the 'rebel' who introduces her to the garden and tells her about a new book, 'The Well of Loneliness,' which is creating quite a stir because of its 'racy' theme.I won't give away much more, but naive Rachel comes of age in this novel.

In that work he recorded the story of thousands of witnesses, allowed them to speak in their own voices. In this collection of stories and prose poems Solzhenitsyn is not always at his best. But in one story, the opening autobiographical story he tells of his life in a remote central Asian village where he boarded with a peasant woman Maryousha who in her humility is taken by him to be a kind of saint. His depiction of the poverty cruelty and greed of this world is Chekhovian .In other stories Solzhenitsyn tells of the corruption of Soviet bureaucracy, and the distance the people seem to be from true religious life.His love of and search for the true Russia is an implicit theme of the work.It would have been helpful to have some kind of introduction to the work, some explanation of where the individual pieces stand in relation to Solzhenitsyn's work as a whole."},{"Title":"Stories and Prose Poems","review":"That this book was published in the early 1970s is no accident. It was at this time that Solzhenitsyn was at the height of his influence and virtually any scrap of nonsense he managed to get to a publishing house would be ravenously devoured and shat out in cloth and paper post-haste. That's why you can find a million used copies of the first volume of the Gulag Archipelago but hardly any of the second or the third. It's not to say that Solzhenitsyn is a bad writer- he's very good- but he was beholden entirely to the Western audience that never understood him except in the crudest sense and would buy anything he wrote simply because his name was on it.It's a shame that this book was published under such shady circumstances and without the prudent editing which would have been involved in a normal release, because some of the material here is quite good. Matronya's house is a charming provincial fable about the necessity of sacrifice, hard work and steely moral discipline to preserving civilization. The Right Hand is simultaneously tiny slice of Cancer Ward and a bitter rebuke of those who collaborated with the Bolsheviks during the Civil War. For the Good of the Cause is a tale drawn from his days as a teacher and Incident at Keretchkova (I'm positive I misspelled that) Station is a story of wartime Russia and the chaos, confusion, distrust and anger which engulfed it during the most hopeless moments of the German onslaught.Everything else is either middling or worthless. His maudlin Easter Procession is Solzhenitsyn's stubborn orthodoxy and mystic spirituality at its most unbearably preachy and every single one of the prose poems should have been sliced out and left for his Collected Works. Still, the book is cheap and if you're looking for a more nuanced portrait of Solzhenitsyn the man and less Solzhenitsyn the prisoner it can hardly hurt to pick it up."},{"Title":"A Celebration of Cats","review":"Roger Caras shows himself, here, as being completely an animal lover who also has considerable insight into human nature. Thus, this book comes from a broad and objective perspective. He doesn't favor cats above other domesticated animals, but treats them as equals to those others we have chosen as companions. And because he does have deep understanding of human nature, this book is centered specifically on the human relationship with cats.He isn't sparing in his treatment. He portrays the whole gamut of historical treatment of cats, not only the Egyptian worship of cats, but the deplorable practices especially in France which were unspeakably cruel towards cats. Our domesticated cats are traced from their wildcat antecedents, and then into the categorized breeds. All this is done with a sense of humor and with love and empathy for the feline species.The typical attitudes of people toward cats, those of both the extreme cat lovers and the cat despisers, are explored and debated. The statement is made that generalized stereotyping of animal species is just as inaccurate as similar stereotyping of people by race or religion. Each animal is an individual.Every aspect of our relationship with cats is explored, the history, the psychology, the biological factors, the mythology, breeding and cat shows, etc. He brings out the beneficial influences cats can have in our lives, but balances it with discussion of those who are well-meaning, but who should not have cats. Only in the final chapter does he go into stories about his own cat family.This is an excellant book and I recommend it strongly to all cat lovers and those who seek understanding of cats and of those of us who love them."},{"Title":"Ahora Te Toca a Ti Senor","review":"This is an excellent book of meditations, and you can apply it to your everyday life, as the good books for meditation are."},{"Title":"Ultimate French Beginner-intermediate (CD/Book)","review":"it is good book those who start to learn french on their own however the biggest drawbacks of the book are the topics are not so detailed. and the cds are just for learning limited conversations but not actual speaking."},{"Title":"Ultimate French Beginner-intermediate (CD/Book)","review":"Ultimate french Beginner is a gr8 book and it came in a pretty quick manner and in good condition."},{"Title":"Ultimate French Beginner-intermediate (CD/Book)","review":"It needs phonic spelling if the student does not buy the CDs / tapes.

In fact, I'll have to buy a new book soon since my old one is so worn out from nights of study and review. This set, to me, is so much better than Pimsleur. It all depends on what you wish to learn. Pimsleur is all audio, so from a purely conversion vantage it might be better for tourists, but it doesn't teach you the ins and outs of the language. Grammar is basic (sometimes non existent). This is the exact opposite. You learn the language properly, by learning how to build it noun by verb etc. It's the way that every child should be taught his primary language (but seldom is, hence Prof. Higgins' rant!). After completing this course (which, if you're studying it thoroughly, should be at the rate of a lesson a week), you will have all the tools you need to construct sentences in several forms of the past, present, and future, as well as having a very solid foundation for pronunciating (most students biggest complaint about French) correctly. I bought this set my senior year of high school to prepare me for college French, and I must say, I learned more from this set than I did all four years of high school French and the first year of college. If you really want to lay the ground work for French fluency, voici le livre!!!"},{"Title":"Ultimate French Beginner-intermediate (CD/Book)","review":"The Living Language Ultimate series is my personal number 1 choice when it comes to learning foreign languages, and this French version is no exception.The whole course is based around realistic dialogues, so you are learning spoken French all the way through the book. Of course you will learn to read it too, but the focus on the spoken language to the extent to which it is presented here helps you build up speech patterns.Each dialogue features certain language points that are covered in detail in the explanations that follow. These explanations are easy to follow, but extensive enough to give you everything you really need to know, rather than obscure facts and features of the language you are never going to need. In addition, cultural notes support each unit.The audio component is unique to Living Language, a far as I know. Of the 8 cassettes or CDs, 4 are for use in class, and contain only French. The other 4 are for use at those times when you are travelling, exercising etc. i.e. when you are unable to use the book but you are able to listen and repeat. The \`On The Go' recordings feature explanations in English, which support and reinforce the learning you do with the textbook. Far from being a gimmick, these recordings offer a unique element to the course, which allows you to extend your knowledge, even when you cannot learn in a traditional study environment.A further feature of the course is the advanced volume, which is based upon the same conversational approach as the beginner/intermediate course, and which offers the student the option to take the language further in a format he or she is used to, and therefore, comfortable with.Admittedly, Living Language Ultimate seems to cost slightly more than other self-study courses on the market, but they are well worth it, and with the Amazon special price you really are getting a bargain on a solid and well integrated language course, that will undoubtedly stand you in good stead whether you are a self-learner or a student of French.If you're serious about learning French, and you are only intent on purchasing one course, then I recommend this one."},{"Title":"Ultimate French Beginner-intermediate (CD/Book)","review":"Excellent self study course as is all of the ultimate series. If you are motivated and organized in your studies you can learn much from this course not only about the language but also how to use it which is most important. You will not need a teacher. In fact I have never known anyone to become truely proficient through classes. You must study every day. I would reccomend this course along with Barrons mastering. Barrons for the drilling method which may be old but us tried and true and Ultimate for the up to date diologues and vocabulary. Also listen to movies with french tracks and also the internet news in French can be invaluable in developing your listening comprehension."},{"Title":"Ultimate French Beginner-intermediate (CD/Book)","review":"I am French and I teach French as a foreign language. I highly recommand thsi method. It starts with simple dialogues which get trickier and trickier but very gradually. The voices, intonation and accent sound really authentic too. A very good choice !"},{"Title":"Ultimate French Beginner-intermediate (CD/Book)","review":"For the analytically minded language learner who really wants to LEARN the language, this course is probably the most balanced available. It is well laid out and presented in a clear, concise manner. There are plenty of practice problems. The text itself takes you farther than most beginning language courses and the advanced book (sold separately) picks up where this one ends. There is lots of audio--two separate series on the CDs, one following the book, the other supplemental (can be listened to while you are driving, exercising, or whatever).I like the Living Language books because they are self-contained and I don't feel as if I need to be working through other course books concurrently as I do when working through offerings from some other language-learning publishers. The only negative for me personally is that the vocabulary comes quite fast. I find myself getting way ahead in the grammar while being stalled with loads of vocabulary. This, however, is a personal weakness/strength issue and you may not have this problem. Other than that, I can't think of a thing that I don't like about this course.How does this offering compare with other company's offerings? I would have to say that Living Languages and Hugo are my favorites. Hugo is great for stripped down, no fluff presentation. I really like their stuff. But, they tend to be very intense and typically do not have sufficient practice problems. Living Language is more balanced and takes you farther with the grammar and vocabulary. I'd say the two are tied for my favorites. Teach Yourself also has some great offerings... but choose wisely, because they are not consistent and offer some real dogs as well. Living Language and Hugo have a consistent format and you know what to expect from all of their courses.Of course, this book will require study. It is not a \\"Learn French While You Watch TV and Eat Popcorn\\" or \\"French in Your Sleep\\" or \\"French in the Blink of an Eye\\" course. As long as you go into it knowing this and are willing and able to actually study and invest some time, you should have a good experience with Ultimate French. If you don't like to study and invest time, you'll have a great new dust collector in a protective clamshell sleeve."},{"Title":"Ultimate French Beginner-intermediate (CD/Book)","review":"For a beginner, the dialogues on the CD are spoken much too quickly! I would understand if they were spoken quickly one time to be able to hear how they would sound naturally. But then they need to be repeated more slowly so that a beginning student can try to follow along. Even the repetition phase of the CD (when you repeat after the native speaker) goes too fast. For intermediate french, this would work, but not for beginning."},{"Title":"Ultimate French Beginner-intermediate (CD/Book)","review":"As I write this, I'm a little over halfway through this program, and I am very pleased with it. The four CDs for use with the book are very clear and useful in helping to pronounce French correctly. The book is an excellent text-all points of grammar are explained clearly and plenty of examples are given to illustrate how to use the language correctly. The dialogues are easy to learn and very practical-they contain things that the average person would actually talk about when visiting a French-speaking area; topics such as food, shopping, buying train tickets, sightseeing, and so forth. The book also contains an excellent and useful appendix, which recaps points of grammar and has a section on letter writing.So why four stars instead of five? My main criticism concerns the \\"Learn as you Go\\" CDs. I do not find these terribly helpful. They contain extra phrases like \\"The chair is made of mahogany\\" that the average user is extremely unlikely to need, and that with no transcription whatever, so it's hard to say if you've repeated it correctly or not. I think the \\"Learn on the Go\\" CDs could have been put to much better use recording the many grammatical examples in the text. In their defense, they do go over the pronunciation of new verb conjugations as they are introduced, and that IS very helpful. The space on these four CDs could, however, in general have been much better used.The book does have a few minor flaws. For instance, in one early dialogue the year 1960 is said, at a point when only the numbers up to 19 have been taught (and in French, 1960 is said as one thousand nine hundred sixty). There are a few other things that would confuse a complete newcomer to French, though if you've had any exposure to French before the book won't give you any trouble. Even if you are completely new to French, I would still recommend this product. If you make it through the first few units it will go very easily afterward if you stick with it. Also, though the course is self-contained, I would strongly recommend getting a dictionary and a verb guide to go with it. Then you will have all the tools you need to learn basic French independently.This course's few flaws are far outweighed by its many good points. It is enjoyable to use and very informative. It demands effort, of course-like everything worth doing. I believe this is the best self-teaching course for French available, and I look forward to moving on to the Advanced set soon."},{"Title":"Ultimate French Beginner-intermediate (CD/Book)","review":"We are using this for our fast paced French refresher course through PCC's continuing education foreign language program. Though I recommend this as a good French text, it is laid out oddly. First, the dialogue is at the beginning of each chapter. These dialogues contain words which are probably unfamiliar to most students until they actually read the section. It is quite confusing to try and pronounce or read these unfamiliar words. I know that the authors felt it better to have students 'try' and read it, then learn the words, then go back to it, but it just doesn't work all that well. Even the instructor has us skip the dialogue until after we work through the chapter it pertains to. Also, the quizzes at the end of each chapter are rudimentary at best.Positives: there are charts at the end that contain many verb conjugations and lists of other important words. Each chapter is concise and gives the student ample material to work with while not overwhelming the student with endless lists. The paces is nice and the flow from chapter to chapter seems to follow a nice curve for actually learning the language, not learning a few phrases for travel. I would have liked more sentence building exercises, but for a $13 beginner to intermediate book, it covers a lot of material without getting too in depth.I highly highly highly recommend the following purchases, even if the instructor does not require them.French Grammar (Barron's Foreign Language Guides)- this is indispensable. This is the book which takes one from merely learning a few words and phrases to actually putting this all to use and building a good foundation for French speaking. It is inexpensive and worth 5x as much in my opinion. Only problem is that it is compact. But it packs in a TON of content and helps with sentence building.Merriam-Webster's French-English Dictionary- amazing bang for the buck French - English dictionary. Has some charts in the beginning, including a useful conjugation chart. But has over 80,000 entries and 100,000 translations. Pretty amazing for $6 or $7. I have the paperback because I don't really want to lug a kindle to class.These three books are perfect for getting started. Then you might try located a good CD resource. I don't recommend Rosetta Stone because of the exorbitant price (you gotta pay for all that marketing they do). Michel Thomas has a good course on CD that builds sentences, but at last look they were all 3rd party and cost $100+... not really worth it at that point. But if you come across it for a good price then buy it.Also it sounds goofy, but check out some of the kids picture books (even for an adult). The ones that have the pictures with the French word and no English translation. You can buy four or five of these for $5-$10 each and they are basically what Rosetta Stone is. See a picture of something and learn the French word for it, not look at an English word and translate it. Get it? Oh, and grab a couple of workbooks that are highly rated for practice.And also of note: the same holds true for other languages with the same publishers' items. I took Japanese and used Living Language, Barron's Grammar, and Webster's Dictionary along with some picture books and the Michel Thomas CDs and it was a breeze to learn with all of those useful tools. So even if it's Italian, Spanish, or another language, I expect these to be good items to purchase (in those respective languages)."},{"Title":"Ultimate French Beginner-intermediate (CD/Book)","review":"I checked out the \\"ultimate french\\" set from the library because I enjoyed the \\"Beyond the basics\\" course for Italian by the same company. I've found that Living Language is very inconsistent in the style and presentation among its various levels of courses and languages covered.This is one style I didn't like. It just plain turned me off from continuing on.There is one set of CDs that are supposed to go along with the book, and another set supposed to be used alone, independent of the book. I find this presents too much double coverage in a negative way: It becomes confusing, perhaps overwhelming to a beginner. This would be alright if the spoken and written lessons weren't also too quick from the outset. A pronunciation lesson would have been nice as a first lesson (I only recall a written one that seemed to be a preface in the book). The native speakers then proceed to speak at a normal pace and style for a native. At this level, at the beginning of a course, speakers should slow down and enunciate even if words are ultimately meant to have a slur from one to the next. I am sure that this course could be useful for those who have had previous contact with the french language; it seems that the \\"beginner\\" section of the course is really a review for intermediate learners.I'll try the Complete French (Teach Yourself series) book/CD; as a language tutor and student, the book follows a philosophy that I've found to be very helpful in learning. I'll review that if I ever use it."},{"Title":"Ultimate French Beginner-intermediate (CD/Book)","review":"I have no complaints with the book. I did think that it came with a CD, but it does not. Guess I was mislead by reading the reviews. But, its rough learning a language when you can\`t hear the words pronounced properly! I do not believe that a person could learn the French language properly by using this book alone. All you would learn is how to ms-pronounce words.

The situational dialogues and accompanying vocabulary lists are well-conceived representations of authentic language that a traveller might encounter in a foreign country. The CD recordings (which come in two sets) are, as always with the Living Language programmes, of a very high quality. The voices are clear, well-modulated, and at an appropriate speed. The explanations of grammar are concise, quite clear, and complete for an introductory course. My only recommendations for improving the courses would be (a) to dispense with the second set of recordings and replace them with material supporting (b) to increase the amount of exercise material, and (c) to include a suggestion that, as a learning strategy, memorizing the dialogues (an admittedly painful exercise) might help learners absorb the target language. I am under the impression that Random House has discontinued the Living Language \\"Ultimate\\" series in favour of marketing the latest edition of their \\"Complete\\" series. If so, this is a sad development for self-learners, since the former are/were truly superior."},{"Title":"Ultimate French Beginner-intermediate (CD/Book)","review":"This resource is excellent.

This replicates the way a child learns his first language, and may well work for some adults, but I need to know what a word \\"looks like\\" and I need to understand the logic behind a construction. Living Language combines written explanation and oral illustration very nicely. The advanced version, both French and Spanish, is very idiomatic and requires a good grasp of the material in the Beginner/Intermediate level. Because these programs contain both a book and CDs, they may be more expensive than some of the others, but they contain an awful lot of material.

A couple years ago I converted the cassettes for the beginner-intermediate and the advanced packages to mp3 and am now brushing up on the language before a long-overdue return trip to Quebec.What continues to impress me about this series is its comprehensive coverage of the language from beginner through intermediate and on to the advanced level. It is superior to the 2 semesters of college-level French that I took from a good instructor, more well-rounded than Pimsleur's audio-only focus, and covers nearly all the situations, circumstances, and social registers (informal, formal, business, etc.) in which you're likely to find yourself in the Francophone world. It's prepared me well for trips to France, Belgium, Senegal, and Quebec.Whenever I'm heading off to 'la Francophonie', I roll out this package, zip through the Beginner-Intermediate set in a few weeks, and then rest calm and steady among French speakers. You won't understand all the slang in Paris, and some Quebecois terms will first still puzzle you, but you will have mastered far more than the basics, be comfortable with most subtleties of the language, and most importantly you will have endeared yourself to many French speakers.I've checked other self-study courses at many bookstores (Chapters/Indigo, Borders, Barnes & Noble, etc.), but they all fall short of the gold standard set by this edition.

The themes are quite interesting, they are dealing more with real life than pure grammar.-: Vocab part doesn't include words I am using all the time when speaking with my friends in France (and it's not slang) so I would say that a good vocab book / website should be added to help learners."},{"Title":"Ultimate French Beginner-intermediate (CD/Book)","review":"When I put in the first disc for Beginning French, I thought I had put in the wrong one.

Since I am planning to go to graduate school in the Fall, we are taking this summer off and are planning a month long trip to France and Spain for a delayed honeymoon. We both have a workable understanding of Spanish, but since the bulk of our time will be spent in France we plan to take an intermediate class in the new year to prepare. This is the text recommended for our class.Things I like: Short lessons are helpful since we both work full time and don't have a lot of extra time to devote right now. It's nice to have a feeling of completion with each lesson. Also, the book is pretty inexpensive.Thing I don't like: Each chapter begins with a short conversation in French, but without access to the recorded conversation I have a hard time knowing if I am pronouncing words correctly. I feel like I'm either Americanizing the text, or that I sound like a really bad actor playing a Frenchman in an old Bugs Bunny cartoon. The CDs associated with the text are sold separately and raise the price SUBSTANTIALLY.

The plot is well-developed and the author gives equal attention to the deeds of all characters. The story - line moves slowly but firmly, leaving unanswered just a couple of questions. Though Book #4 is more tightly connected with its sequel than the preceeding books of the series, it is clearly the one in which the reason for the Battle against the Dark One is specified thoroughly. When making alliance of all eight books in the series - the frist three could be viewed as Introductory, and with Book 4 starts the real part. It poses questions to be resolved later -in books 5, 6, 7, 8, etc. and at the same time answers almost all vague story - line problems, which were left unanswered in the preceeding books.It's definitely better than all its prequels!!!"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I give this one 4 stars only because it seemed to drag a little more than the first three.

Then I read the second book, and while it was okay, it was not as good as the first. To make a long story short, I've just finished this book, the fourth in the series, and well...yawn, quite frankly, I'm getting bored. At first, the quirky characteristics of some of the &quot;people&quot; in the book added to their depth and made them &quot;real.&quot; But come on now!...what's the fascination with someone pulling on their darned braid every few minutes! I say just cut the darned thing off already so we can move on! I'm also sick of the frequent references made about how Rand Al'Thor used to be no more than...blah, blah, blah, and now he's acting like he's a Lord. If the characters haven't figured out by now that the guy has grown, then its a sad story. Now while I do have my gripes about the story, it's only fair to say that the book did have its interesting moments. In fact, some of those moments were darned good. Perrin came into his own -- or is getting there, and Matt had to get himself out of a few sticky situations. But it could have been better. In any event, since I checked book 4 and 5 out of the library at the same time, I'll give the 5th book a chance to grab my attention. My fingers are crossed for the best because Jordan is a decent writer. However, his tendency to bombard readers with just a little too much detail is slowing down what could be a very good story!

The shadow Rising goes further into character developement and extends the story into other possible lines. The fact that you never know exactly what will happen keeps the book(s) a good read.

The plot drags considerably as Jordan delves ever more deeply into local color and points of characterization that have either already been made, or are easily imagined by the reader.In fact, that's my chief complaint about this novel, which I found far less memorable than its predecessors: there's so much detail bogging down the story that ultimately, very little actually happens. While there was enough buildup in the first three books to allow for a fourth to wrap things up, instead we have new plot points, new characters, and a lot of other things that bring us no closer to the climax.I find myself thinking, as this series goes on, that Jordan should have taken a leaf from Michael Moorcock's Eternal Champion, and told us the stories of several Dragons, rather than just one"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Some would say that the fourth instalment in the wheel of time series, was a showpiece of Jordan's mastery of storytelling abilities, however I believe this was the beginning of the end of what could have been a fantasy classic. In the Shadow Rising, Jordan's fanatic attention to detail detract from the normal progress of a story. This has proven to be fatal to his series as we have now seen the series escalate to a unacceptable 7th book. Those that enjoy Jordan's style will not be dissapointed, as Rand continues on his prophesised journey to the last battle. Unfourtunatley this 1000 page book doesn't bring him much closer to his goal, that he was in the last book. I could have edited this book to around 700 pages by excluding annoying descriptions of inns, people, people's thoughts, and landscapes.

They did NOTHING in 980 pages.I just DO NOT CARE about the hair color and 'seductive eyes' of a merchant's wagon driver. Jordan may find it more beneficial to make Rand a little less crazy (what's up with the main character going bonkers? Nothing to do with his 'taint') and Moiraine a little less meddlesome than to prattle on and on about some very low cut dresses. That really annoys me. Nynaeve &amp; Egwene, if it's even possible, are even more annoying.I really can find precious little good about this book.PS: how many sinuous lines can one thing have in four pages?"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This novel is where the series begins. I think the first three novels could be read independently, similar to Tolkien's Hobbit, and still be enjoyed. However, The Shadow Rising, offers no real conclusion and begins the torture known as the Wheel of Time. I like the overall plot of this novel; I gave it five stars. The focus on Rand is good, but I don't understand how he has become so knowledgable and wise over the course of a year. The side story with Perrin and Faile has great potentail and the ending is awesome, but they way it is written makes me cringe when I read parts of it. Nynaeve and Elayne are my least favorite part of the novel. I honestly consider skipping all chapters concerning their part of the plot. And once again, Mat is my favorite character. Robert Jordan has created some annoying characters, but Matrim Cauthon redeems them. And the action in the White Tower is also well done, if not believable.What happens. The novel begins with Rand holding the Stone of Tear. He becomes involved with Elayne before leaving the stone for the Aiel Waste. One of the best parts of the novel occurs when Rand and Mat enter Rhuiden. He is marked as the chief of chiefs, and begins the unification of the Aiel. Rand also finds a teacher to help learn Saidin. Mat journeys with Rand to Rhuiden and stays with him after they leave. Mats memories return and his luck continues. Perrin leaves Tear to return to the Two Rivers to save his people from the Whitecloaks. Instead he fights Trollics and becomes lord of his people. In the wolf dream Perrin learns a lot about those twisted doors. From a child's game, &quot;Courage to strengthen, fire to blind, music to daze, and iron to bind.&quot; After reading this novel for the third time, I noticed that whenever Mat enters those doors, the snake people always make sure he was no musical instruments, iron, or devices to make light. Nynaeve and Elayne go to Tanchinco to find something that might hurt Rand and meet a forsaken. Egwene and Moraine accompany Rand to Rhuiden.This novel, as I remember it, is one of the last real good ones by Robert Jordan. I like the next ones, but I haven't waited years for them. I am rereading them on my way to Crossroads of twilight, and if book 10 is disappointing, I will understand why many readers complain about the later novels. But Book 4 is still fantastic, and while it is not imperative to read the first three before starting the fourth, the first three are the best, so I encourage you to read them first."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Robert Jordan is an excellent author and having unabridged audio cds of his stories are great.

When the timeline was moving at a pace that could be measured in weeks or months instead of hours? Well, if you have a hard time remembering any of those things, pick up The Shadow Rising, one of the last truly great Wheel of Time books. Now, as much fun as I'm having at the series's expense, I did enjoy the rest of the series and think that the most recent book, Knife of Dreams, was the best book in the series for a long time. However, The Shadow Rising is one of the last that really cooks. From the story of Emond's Field and Perrin to Rand and company's journey through the Aiel Waste there is tons of adventure, tons of answers, and tons of new questions. We see the Aelfinn and the Eelfinn for the first time, we see some of the Forsaken in greater detail, we learn the history of the Aiel (a fantastic sequence, perhaps the best moment of the series so far), we meet a whole host of new characters that are interesting, and by the end of the book we've finally taken care of a nagging problem: How is Rand going to get better at yielding saidin? Plot aside, Jordan is really at the top of his form in this novel, weaving enticing story lines without getting too lost in the details. As I said at the beginning, I'm still a fan of the series as a whole and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy fiction, but be warned, the next book is the end of the fast pace and from there they just continue to slow down until Knife of Dreams."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Join Rand, Mat, and Egwene on their journey to the waste and follow them in learning who they were and what their role is in life.

This story will keep you in a spell that you never want to end."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"In The Shadow Rising, things start to slow down. In fact, it often feel like the reading of the story must take longer than it took for the events to actually occur.Part of the problem is that Mr Jordan tells us nearly everything except when the characters make a bowel movement. Also, he regularly launches into pre-set spiels in which he re-describes something or someone who we've encountered numerous times before or re-explains something we've been told dozens of times (e.g., Loial sounds like a bumblebee, Perrin likes to think things through, wet bowstrings are bad, trollocs eat anything as long as it's meat, Aes Sedai never lie but ....). Every time a Tinker shows up, you may as well skip the next two paragraphs because they invariably describe first the \\"eye-jarring\\" wagons and then the even gaudier clothes. The format is nearly the same each time. This is especially noticeable when reading the novels one after the other, of course.A similar problem is that although Mr Jordan's world is large, diverse, and interesting, there is not much realistic diversity within a culture or group. Every Aes Sedai of the red ajah hates men, all the greens love men, the whites are arrogant without exception, the browns love books and don't notice the ink on their noses. All Domani women are seductive, and people from Tear use fishing metaphors. It gets to the point of ridiculousness when, even though they've nearly been destroyed by enemies, Tinkers are still cringing at the swords of the people protecting them. And the Aiel, who use spears and knives and are the fiercest fighters on the planet look disapprovingly at another culture's choice of weapon. Oh, come on -- get over it.Another device that's getting annoying is the technique of giving the reader (and other characters) information by having a character say something out loud that they didn't realize they'd said. Or stop in the middle of a sentence that they realize they shouldn't be saying. Or stupidly have an important and potentially damning conversation in front of someone who they just met.In addition, some of the writing is overdone. We occasionally hear of measureless steps, heartbeats that take centuries, moments that last forever, infinite slowness, bottomless drops, razor edges of something or other.Okay, that's a lot of complaining, but that's what happens when you read these books contiguously. You start to notice this stuff and it grates on the nerves. But, even so, the slowly advancing plot is still unpredictable and compelling and the characters are mostly enjoyable. The best parts of The Shadow Rising actually focus on the secondary characters of Siuan Sanche and Egeanin. I truly enjoyed their stories and look forward to hearing what happens to them.So, even with all my gripes, The Shadow Rising is still keeping me entertained."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book in the wheel of time series will suprise you in many ways. Rand now has the sword that is not a sword, one of the most powerful sa'angreal ever. But there's worry in the air because of the Forsaken, and Rand needs an army and fufilling another prophecy isn't having the exact results. So Rand does the unexpected and gets ahead of them all.A must for Robert Jordan and Wheel of Time fans. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Better than the Eye of the World, but not as good as the Dragon Reborn.

Not a whole lot really happens. Reading it and coming to the end, I realized that Jordan realized that he had a fantasy franchise on his hands and was going to milk it for all it was worth. Don't get me wrong the book is well written, there are some tense moments that get your blood racing. But there is no big monumental event like the first three books ended with. Yes there is the big meeting of the Aiel, but since when is the climax of a fantasy novel a meeting. The final two chapters pack in all the action or confronting multiple forsaken, which could have been built up more along the way. There is the trolloc attacks on Emonds Field, and the rise of Perrin as a warrior leader among his hometown people. However there are certain plot points that are beginning to wear on me: The Whitecloaks being so corrupt, yet none of them seeing that they are corrupt, the ever present fear of the Dragon and the One Power, and the fact that none of the 'good guys' can get it together and kill the 'bad guys'. When you have beaten a forsaken, just kill them, don't wait for a trial, when you have pure evil at your fingertips ready to be killed, don't let it walk free. I can see why most people I have talked to about this series give up around the fifth book.T"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Robert Jordan's \\"The Wheel of Time: The Shadow Rising\\" is definitely one of my favorite books in one of my favorite series.

It is believed that the Aiel are the people of the Dragon.This book is definitely a good read. I insist, though, to start with book one, \\"The Eye of the World\\". The Wheel of Time is definitely a good series rich with magic and adventure. The world of The Wheel of Time will come alive."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Shadow Rising is one of my favorite books in the Wheel of Time series (the 5th book, The Fires of Heaven, is a close second favorite). Note: I am assuming the reader has read up to the third book, The Dragon Reborn.In the last book, it ended with Rand being proclaimed the Dragon Reborn with the fall of the fortress, the Stone of Tear, in the city of Tear. Rand makes the decision to head into the Aiel Waste, to the city of Rhuidean (with Egwene and Mat tagging along, and of course, Moiraine), Perrin travels back home to the Two Rivers to help his village, Nynaeve and Elayne journey to the dangerous city of Tanchico to obtain an object that could be dangerous to Rand that the Black Ajah is after.I felt The Shadow Rising was aptly named for this book, as the Dark One's forces (Darkfriends, the Black Ajah, and the Forsaken) are all working behind the scenes to further along the the DO's machinations in the world.Again, I can't begin to express how amazed I am to see how Jordan foretold future plots and events from his beginning books into later books. Plot lines and events that get introduced here make sense in later books, and when I read this book the 1st time, I didn't catch it, but re-reading it I was able to see how certain events occurred to sow chaos and mistrust between the factions of the Light to prevent them from uniting. Each book has built on past books, but each new book in the series introduces more complexities and also intertwines with the overall story arc in the series.There is a lot happening in this book, the main stories are told from the point of view of Rand, Perrin, Nynaeve & Egwene with a few from Mat. You learn more about the history of the Aiel, and I really enjoyed the glimpse of the past into the Age of Legends. It was always something I wondered about when I read the 3 books previous to this one, the wonders and amazing feats that were accomplished during the Age of Legends. It was quite interesting to read about, especially the parallels of certain objects in the Age of Legends with our own world (for instance, \\"jo-cars\\" being cars, \\"sho wings\\" airplanes, \\"hover flys\\" helicopters, and the description of \\"tall, silvery buildings\\" can be nothing but something similar to a skyscraper).I also enjoyed how the Forsaken were given more page time in this book, and of course, getting more glimpses of Padin Fain who is still mad with his hatred for Rand and continues to cause trouble for him (sending the fanatical Whitecloaks to the Two Rivers).If there were any annoyances I had, it was the character of Faile, Perrin's love interest. She got on my nerves with the way she tricked Perrin and tried to manipulate him into allowing her to travel with him back to his home, and she continues to be one of my least favorite characters in the series. I think her traits are something the other stubborn women characters also have, can get irritating to read as well, with their erroneous thinking that certain of the male characters needed guiding by them and were clueless without women.This is something you see throughout the entire series, and I can understand how the women in this fictional world gained so much power over the men. It makes sense that women would gain the upper-hand, especially the female channelers (the Aes Sedai), as it was those of the male gender that broke the world and with no male channelers to balance out the power of the female channelers, you get a shift in power toward women. I think this thinking filtered down even into the general population, not just those who could channel, and so you get a world that views women as the dominant over men in many ways.Oh well, I've gotten off-topic of my review of the book.LOL. This book is one of my favorites!"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I wanted to give this a 3 3/4 or something, but this will do. I am reviewing these books as I read them..so here goes.Yes this books had some slow moments, but they are brief and the rest surly makes up for it. I loved the beginning in the Heart of Stone and the &quot;bubbles of evil&quot;..and I also enjoyed how Rands character has changed---realistically. He has all this new responsibility pushed on him..and he has to worry about going mad....so he's a bit edgy. Which I like cause it fits that he would no longer be the innocent farmboy he was. I could not put the books down during his scenes at Rhuidean. I enjoyed learning more about the Aiel and seeing some of the hints Jorden throws in that give you some insight into the rest of the series. I did notthink he told too much...because I still don't get some of those Aiel customs! But all the Aiel--Rhuidean scenes were well worth the readI enjoyed Mat..like usual! And I fully understand his reluctance to be around Rand...with him changing so much and with Mat having to go through his own problems. I really LOL during his talk with the fox people at Rhuidean...that scene was very exciting and left me wanting to know more about Mat's part in this. It looks like it is going to be big.Perrin at Two Rivers was great. I really like this character and I enjoyed his road towards being a hero...even if it's a reluctant one. I can see that he will also play a major role. I'm happy that Faile has calmed down...she was really getting on my nerves for awhile. But I enjoy her and Perrin's relationship...they remind me of the Honeymooners. These scenes were also great.As for the rest. Moiraine is really starting to get interesting...I almost feel bad for her. Egewene iis growing up and getting sterner..she annoys me the least. And I can finally begin to see her as a leader later on. Nyneave and her hair tugging entertains me as much as Mat..and Isee her mellowing a bit. I can see that sooner or later she is going to let go and be able to use her power to the fullest. As for Elayne..sigh. She's spoiled..but I expect that..but her treatment of Rand annoys me. I see where Jorden is heading here..so hopfully he gets to it soon.Min and the Aes sedai..this was a great twist..I can't wait to read more. Especially Logain. I also love Aviendha...even though I see her joining the Rand worshipers.Over all. I liked this installment..and will continue reading. I still think &quot;The Great Hunt&quot; and &quot;Eye of the World&quot; were the best. This series although slow at times (but that's all a matter of personal taste. Some people like detail..some don't.) still has my interest..mainly because i want to see if my theories about everyone are correct.

The Wheel of Time is a exceptional series that I recommend highly. If you can make it past the first few chapters of &quot;The Eye of the World&quot;, get ready for an adventure that leaves you spellbound and ready for the next book in the series.

It is discovered that the Aiel Clan chiefs are marked with a dragon upon making it through the sacred city Ruideian. Their secret name is the dragon's people.Rand, Mat, Eqwene, and some of the others follow the Aiel into the waste.

Twice the heron, and twice the Dragon. If he does fulfill another prophecy of the Dragon Reborn, does this fullfill the Aiel prophecies. You'll have to read to find out.Perrin, doesn't make the trip into the Aiel waste, but his is an adventure in his own. Fain goes after Rand by vowing to destroy the Two Rivers and all he loves. Perrin is the only one who can make the trip to save their boyhood home. Mat has his own destiny to fulfill, for he learns he must die in order to live again.

Always, there was some redeeming quality to it; some last lingering urge to finish it and see it through. I am not one to give up easily. I give all things a chance no matter how bad they seem.That is why I read \\"The Great Hunt\\" when I absolutely loathed \\"The Eye of the World\\". And found myself thoroughly surprised at how much better TGH was. When I read \\"The Dragon Reborn\\" I thought, 'If Jordan could focus more on his well-developed, interesting male characters and less on his females, he's got a fan!'Sadly, that is not the case with \\"The Shadow Rising\\".The book starts off with the same style of TGH and TDB (books #2-3). For about 2 chapters, I was quite pleased that I was holding book #4 in my hands after a week of no Jordan. However that quickly changed due to one thing: Jordan cannot write women.Why does Jordan feel that in order to create strong female characters, they must all be beautiful, haughty, challenging, petty and immature? How many times can one woman cross her arms under her breasts and glare at another? Whether it's Nynaeve snapping at Moiraine, Elayne snapping at Nynaeve, Egwene glaring at Nynaeve...They are all incredibly annoying.As if that is not enough, these under-developed female characters are each linked to at least one male character; I happen to like all the male characters. Nynaeve, for example, is romantically linked to Lan, the Warder. Why? Where on earth did this romance come from? Are we supposed to gasp with delight when Lan storms into a room and sweeps Nynaeve off her feet for a kiss? She is petty, short-tempered and mean, and carries a grudge against Moiraine that has no founding. He is barely conceivable as a person. As a friend put it, the old \\"Petulant Ice Queen somehow wooing the attentions of the strong, noble king\\" is one of the weakest, not to mention most clich&eacute;d, foundations for a romance ever laid.Jordan either knows very little about women or else knows very little about writing them. It is more than possible to create a strong female who is not young and pretty as Elayne, Egwene, Nynaeve, Min and Faile are. It is possible to show that they are strong without having them be defiant or quarrelsome. It is possible to show their passion for their ideals without having them \\"bristle with anger\\" anytime someone disagrees with them. I found myself continuously wondering if Jordan thinks all men perceive women this way; or just him.I think it is wonderful that Jordan has found a way to have equal male and female roles. I, however, would take the few strong and truly admirable heroines that Tolkien created (Galadriel, Eowyn, Melian) than these dozens of under-developed, catty women.I stopped reading this series, as well, because of the excess in descriptive words. Jordan needs to realize that over-doing it with the descriptions does not equal a richly portrayed world. Quality, man, not quantity. There are only so many descriptions of inns and common rooms, fireplaces and swords, arrows nocked and people sighing, a person can take. Two pages devoted to describing the shores of Tear don't make me any more excited about reading the book. I have seen ships before. Next time, perhaps he should concentrate on describing scenic beauty. That requires actual writing talent.Readers who think Jordan exceeds Tolkien are thoroughly misguided and I pity them. I am quite glad the professor is not alive to see his work being compared to that of an amateur, self-indulgent man such as Jordan who thinks his pseudo Olde Englishe, his over-the-top descriptions, his unnecessarily lengthy glossaries and his painfully under-developed female characters place him in the leagues of the fantasy greats. Jordan will never have the skill of prose that Tolkien had, nor will his series ever touch readers the way \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" did. However, if he cultivates his writing abilities and exchanges the excess description for better characterization, his series might earn some of the longevity reserved for the real great works of fantasy literature."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book is amazing. Simply put, it's time to buckle your seatbelts because you are about to learn so much about the world that the wheel of time takes place in. The cultures involved, the pasts of the people, everything. This is now an epic fantasy series, for sure.The storyline is great. The threesome of Rand, Matt, and Perrin splits and there are multiple threads to follow - each one equally satisfying but I find the POV that Perrin is in and Nynave's POV are more exciting. We also get more in depth glances and plot lines that the Forsaken are directly involved in. We see their thoughts and their actions outside the battle sequences from the previous books. Very interesting to be reading the plans and thoughts from both the light and the darkside concerning the same event.This book is phenomenal. It is long, maybe the second longest in the series, but that is not a problem in my opinion because it is so facinating and interesting. The only problem is the final action sequence, while cool, is not as spectacular as some of the battles in the finalBe prepared for character development, huge action sequences, twists and turns, and some great overall reading."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The fourth book of Robert Jordan's wheel of time is my absolute favourite so far. It cannot be denied that it has stiff competition - seeing that the previous three have been so amazing too. However, I still find this book the best. The series grabbed me from the first line... after that, I simply could not wait to get stuck into it.The fourth book is the longest so far (I have just finished it)... and like reading tolkien's lord of the rings and discovering the world of middle earth, you develop a thirst for finding out more. You crave to know. That is why I enjoy what some people (who must be uncommited to the series) claim to be tedious reading. I love Robert Jordan's moment by moment writing style, where he leaves no rock unturned as the characters progress. He has managed to write a story where I have found myself ranging from sad, to happy, to tears, to furious at him - thinking 'how can he do it!'.However, I know that he has his reasons and I am grateful for it - I know the story and it's development will continually shock me.Perhaps I am just not normal... but I have come to rely on his characters to provide me with the day to day nourishment that I need. I cannot stand to go a day without knowing something more... that is why his fourth book - The Shadow Rising - has been so great to read.A literary masterpiece, this book, which I stress MUST BE READ IN ORDER with the other books, is fantastic. We find ourselves quite taken up by all of the stories that are going on, his characters stories that are all tied together take hold of you one way or another.Often we may find ourselves reading a book and desiring to be part of the adventure - but rarely do we read a book and feel that we are in the adventure. Each night, when I turn off my light and switch on my lamp, I am in another place. Where that is, I can never guess until I fold back the covers and step in.Robert Jordan's series and particularly his fourth book THE SHADOW RISING have left no doubt in my mind that he is deserving of the title - International Bestseller.This book, and his series is a must read for those willing to be swept away to another world - for those who would like to REALLY live."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"...and what about that Shadow, anyway? ...Jordan decides to open this 1000-page monstrosity with 200 pages of the most boring, useless [material] I've ever encountered in a fantasy series. Things pick up after this, and, in fact, the final 300 pages of this book are pretty decent. But it's the ... first 200 pages, and the intermittently-interesting middle 500 pages that are the problem here, because Jordan's books need exciting, well-drawn plots to succeed. I mean, you're not reading Jordan for emotional release or vibrant characters. This is the first novel in the series that, in my opinion, does not succeed.Where to start with all of the problems... well I guess one good place is the awkward, space wasting technique of Jordan trying to fill the reader in on everything that has gone before, and creating artificial scenes between old and new characters that make this possible. It makes for a stilted, pointless read for anybody who *has* read the earlier books, and I would suspect that this is the majority, now that we're on book four. ...Another complaint is that even after this brutal initial 200 pages, the pacing of the book has slowed considerably. Now, I recall praising Dragon Reborn for its attention to detail and side-plots and ability to withstand Jordan's slowing of the pacing. Well, that falls apart here. Shadow Rising has few of the positives of Dragon Reborn, and instead could best be characterized as a sloppily-written, poorly-conceived example of what happens when a writer realizes that he has tried to do too much, but is powerless to stop himself.There are four main splits in the action after the characters finally leave Tear: Perrin and Faile in the Two Rivers; Rand, Egwene, Mat and Moiraine in the Aiel Waste; Nynaeve and Elayne in Tanchico, and Min at Tar Valon. This time around, Jordan does not have the magic that keeps the reader interested in all four plots at once, and the book is so gargantuan that unless you are a person who has nothing else to do for two or three days except read this book, details become fuzzy by the time you return to one of the plots after being away for awhile. Of the plots themselves, none is as interesting as any in books 2 or 3, although it's nice to see some more of Rand, albeit in another fish-out-of-water scenario (the Aiel). And Rand has changed so much (though they've only been out of the Two Rivers for about 14-18 months) that it's clear that Jordan has completely lost control of how to portray him.Of Rand in the Aiel Waste, could Jordan be any more transparent that he's read Frank Herbert's Dune series? I noted in my review of Book II that the Aes Sedai bear a very close resemblance to the Bene Gesserit, and now I see that the Aiel are ridiculously similar to the Fremen. I mean, all the way down to the ambiguously Middle-Eastern-derived names, he copies this stuff. Ah, whatever. Jordan never was very original, was he? Anyway, Rand's exploits in the Waste go a long way toward explaining a number of things started in earlier books, but it's not until near the end of the book that the action here really picks up (although the part where Rand is in Rhuidean *is* well done, ...).The best plot other than this is probably Nynaeve and Elayne in Tanchico, but that is unfortunately ruined by the presence of those two characters, especially Nynaeve. What a [poorly] drawn character Nynaeve is! She was always annoying, but by this volume, Jordan has reduced her to the sum of her cliches. So all you have is this whining, braid-tugging, order-giving, impatient, man-hating, insult-muttering horror of a woman. At least she's not involved actively with Lan (which I assume is soon to come), because as far as adding romantic elements to the plot, Jordan is completely out of his league. Because if you can imagine the cheesiest moments in ... romance novel history you'll have only an inkling of the pain of reading anything that has to do with Perrin and Faile -- which is also too bad, because I was kind of psyched to revisit the Two Rivers. In fact, Jordan's \\"battle of the sexes\\" theme dominates much of this novel, and he's SO bad at developing it that it really ruins a lot of what's going on.Well, time to finish this up before I choke. The last 300 pages pack in plot and action worthy of book II or III, but by then a lot is ruined. Will I keep reading? Sure, the books are free for me. But I'm very disappointed with book 4 and hope that this is not a trend that continues.And lastly, what's with the title? The other titles in this series were fairly accurate indicators of what was happening within the pages, but here it's a bit of a teaser. There certainly is nothing more regarding the Shadow going on here as in the other books, and very little of the Shadow is even mentioned until the final couple of hundred pages of the book. So, if you are a new reader, don't get your hopes up that Jordan finally introduces us to some aspect of the Shadow that he hasn't previously, or lets it concern more of the storyline. He doesn't."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"All the Wheel of Time fans say the same thing, that the first five or six books in the series are great, and the downward spiral follows after that.I don't get it. The first book was a lot of fun, despite the horrible Nynaeve character and the horribly boring Egwene. Book 2, The Great Hunt, was also fun, except for the increasing awareness of recurring quirks, like one character being flustered around another character of greater position or title (repeated on every page). Plus the female characters were grouped together for their own sub-plot---painful chapters you wanted to skip over. But the second book was good overall.The ominous clouds of Jordan's bad traits began raining in book 3, The Dragon Reborn. The Aes Sedai sub-plot was eye-crossingly boring, with all of those icy stares and blushes. The female characters \\"sniffed\\" twenty-three times (I counted). Nynaeve's habit of tugging on her braid was introduced, and she did it endlessly. Rand was left out of the book and the focus was put on these one-dimensional supporting characters. The women all hated men and the men were clueless and subservient around women. And the ending was the same thing for the third book in a row. And on and on...Things only get worse in the fourth book. We spend considerable time with the Aiel, who are all the same. Did you know that Tolkien's books are recommended by white supremecist groups as good family reading? It's because all the conflict is as simple as Good People vs. Evil People, and all the people of each race are identical. If you know one of them, you know them all. In The Shadow Rising, this is taken the Nth degree with the Aiel, these super-warriors WHO ARE ALL THE SAME. And the Sea Folk, too, are all identical to each other. Jordan is one of those BRILLIANT pulp-fantasy writers who creates a nation of people by giving them some cultural traits, like marriage customs, maybe a tattooing style, and calls it a day. Take away the names and you can't tell one from the other.The female characters are just as obnoxious and boring as ever, but now it's even worse. Now there's even more of them. Faile was a lot of fun in book 3, her debut, but now she becomes just another insufferable Robert Jordan Bad (or Bitch) Female Character (BFM). At one point, she's traveling with Perrin and calls him. \\"Perrin. Perrin, come here.\\" When Perrin rides up and asks her what she wants, she just turns to him and says, \\"Oh yes. I wanted to see if you could be taught to come when I call.\\" Gagh! How does Perrin respond? He just grinds his teeth a little. My god... And there are more BFMs, like Aviendha, another personality-less Aiel character, and Elayne, who gets more pages and a greater role for no clear reason.The male characters suck too. I just wanted to read about Rand being the Dragon Reborn and wielding his magic sword, but instead we have to wade through hundreds of pages of Mat, who still doesn't have a personality, and Perrin, in love with Faile for inexplicable reasons. Ditto Lan, in love with Nynaeve---why, no reader can understand.Have I mentioned the agonizingly boring dream sequences? Now it's a major thing in the series. Is there anybody out there who thinks, \\"Yay! Another dream sequence! I'm entranced!\\"Four hundred pages into it and I just couldn't go on. Rand is in this haunted city, his consciousness transported into bodies of Aiel warriors that have lived in the past (complete with cookie-cutter names, no personality, and indistinguishable from all other Aiel). I don't care about these spirits, dreams, Aiel, yadda yadda yadda.The Wheel of Time series doesn't even have great villains to be gripping antagonists. We just see the Dark Lord popping up again and again in dreams, saying, \\"Fear me and tremble! I'll crush you, you pathetic fool!\\" And I'm yawning. The guy never shuts up, and Rand is always kicking his ass.Have you noticed that the Wheel of Time world doesn't even have a name? It's actually just a continent, but not even that has a name. And if you look at the map, several nations don't even have names. It's all so dumb...This series is just pulp fantasy for thirteen-year olds. How does the Wheel of Time have such dedicated fans? Go find some good adventure fiction."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"You thought that the map, so frequent a fixture at the beginning of a fantasy novel or series, was just an orientation...didn't you? Thought that there were some places this series surely wouldn't go to--Tolkien never actually went to Rhun, after all--he only referenced it briefly as \\"where the stars are strange.\\" The Wheel of Time wouldn't spin me all over that bloody map, city by city, territory by territory, right?Think again, baby.Mr. Jordan is taking us to every single location on that map of his. As I got past page 400 of the Shadow Rising, I began to view the map with hostility. By the end of this book, I hated the map. How many thousands of pages have I already read, I griped to myself, only to find myself visiting half the cities on the map? So, what...5000 pages to go? A city per book?But my greatest fear is that he is going to introduce another world beyond the map sometime in Book 11, forcing me to tour 10 more cities in 10,000 other pages. I feel like I'm on tour with the Rolling Stones....I'm \\"past my prime but rolling from Baltimore to Boston, sugar...next stop, Baton Rouge...\\"Well, I can't get no satisfaction. But I tried, and I tried, and I tried, and in Book Four, I tried. Mr. Jordan, please--no more Visits to Places on the Map Because They Are There. I feel like I am reading Fodor or Frommer, not fantasy.Jordan has created an intriguing physical use of Power, strong female roles, and truly evil creatures that actually practice what Tolkien only hinted at. Donaldson is the only other fantasy author I remember that really nailed home how evil the bad guys can be. These are strengths of the work to this point.The work is in the process, however, of becoming ludicrously long. And that's really a shame."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Stone of Tear has fallen. Ishamael has been defeated by Rand. Be'lal has been balefired out of existence by Moraine. The Dragon has been reborn. So ended the previous book. Rand rules Tear but all across the world nations are at war and people are on the move. Now Rand must somehow learn to channel while all around him the Forsaken plot his downfall and others merely plot his death so the way things were can return.In The Shadow Rising, the protagonists of the series all find themselves in Tear for a brief interlude before they once again disperse. This seems to be one of the ways Jordan liked to write. Every so often the protagonists would come together before going off in small groups to different parts of the world. It made the narrative coherent for small bits of the book, but the dispersal mechanism allowed Jordan to explore his world building more. Not that I am complaining. The descriptions are informative, if overly verbose. Seriously, his editor should have done a better job. Still, the section on Tear is pretty good stuff. Trollocs. Battles. Kissing in corners. Not too many descriptions of dress materials. Lanfear makes an appearance and there is a lot of diplomatic maneuvering.Now Rand, Mat, Egwene, Moraine, and the Aiel head to Rhuidean via the portal stones. Rhuidean where Rand means to bind the Aiel to himself by proving that he is He Who Comes With the Dawn. Rhuidean where Mat must go or he will surely die. Rhuidean where Egwene will go to find answers from the Wise Ones about how she can become a dreamwalker. And Rhuidean where Moiraine will do what she must to ensure that Rand stays alive to face the Dark One. The parts of the book that take place in the Aiel Waste are some of my favorite of the entire series. In particular, Rand going through the ter'angreal that shows him his ancestors' past all the way to the boring of the hole during the Age of the Legends and the beginning of the Collapse. Those two chapters are probably my favorite of the entire series and the reason I give this book five stars. It is also here in the Aiel Waste that we learn about the customs and history of the Aiel. And what an interesting people, especially given the past. Here it is where we see Aviendha again (you met her in The Dragon Reborn). She is one of the new protagonists added to the series. Just be happy that there is really only one main protagonist added to the series here.I've purposely left out what happens to Mat and Egwene in the Waste because honestly, their plot lines are really not that important or that interesting. As per usual since The Great Hunt, Lanfear stalks Rand's dreams, wants him as her own, and plots to get him to be hers. New antagonists are introduced and the climax of the book occurs in Rhuidean against a Forsaken. And a chora tree gets hurt. Sadness.There are two other sections to the book. One finds us following Elayne, Nynaeve and Thom as they journey to Tanchico hunting for the Black Ajah. Forsaken in this plot line too - Moghedian. What does that mean to you? Nothing yet.The other plot line follows Perrin, Loial, and Faile in the Two Rivers where they journey to protect Perrin's home from Trollocs, Whitecloaks, and worse. It is here that Perrin transforms into one of the stronger leaders of the series. It is also here that Faile becomes even more annoying. How is that even possible when she was so annoying in The Dragon Reborn? You've been warned. Again.Oh and I suppose there is one tiny other section of note concerning Min, The White Tower and the Aes Sedai there. I suppose its important. ;)I've been keeping track of the sniffs in the book because Jordan has his women sniff way too much. Jordan does a lot of things way too much. For this book,Faile - IIIIINynaeve - IIIII IIEgwene - IIJorin - IMoiraine - IMarin al'Vere - IAdine - IBair - IMelaine - IILiandrin - IJeaine - IElayne - IILeane - IIRendra - ILanfear - IAnd for the four books so far,Nynaeve - IIIII IIIII IIIII IMoiraine - IIIII IIElayne - IIIII IIEgwene - IIIII IFaile - IIIIILeane - IIIIMin - IIElaida - IILiandrin - IILaras, Mistress of the Kitchens - IICook at Inn - IIMelaine - IIFemales in Crowd - IWoman in Fal Dara - ISuian Sanche (the Amyrlin) - ISelene - ISuroth - IBornhold - IWomen of Emonds Field - IVerin - ITavern Wenches at the Woman of Tanchico Inn - IAludra - IAilhuin - IJorin - IMarin al'Vere - IAdine - IBair - IJeaine - IRendra - ILooks like Nynaeve is clearly winning.

I had read the first three about a year ago, and recently picked up the second 3 in a set.Books with lots of characters and backstory are fine, but not to the point where you need a scorecard to keep track of whos who.There are 3 main male and 3 main femal characters. Then add the head bad guy, his 12 forsaken, their varios minions. Next add a boyfriend or girfriend to each character. Finally add various officals, and people who join the team, people from history, a dozen evil \`sisters' and you are looking at close to 100 characters.And just to make in more difficult, all the the ancient ones have multiple names, and several of the other character use aliases. The characters will use someones true or alias first or last name willy-nilly. I actually had to make a note sheet with all the characters, and who was in what group.Considering that the book is near 1000 pages, that is a much one os R.A. Salvatores Dark Elf Trilogy, but not nearly as satifiying. The story hops around between all the characters. Is so bad that at one point that the mother of one of the girls who likes Ran, one of the main males, meets a ex-wife of one of the Lords from when Rand was King of a city (for about 300 pages) and one of the 12 forsaken. There was an enitre chapter of them meeting.The story hops around so much that you barely get to no anyone. It wouldn't be so bad but the book is so tedious. There is so much bloat in the book that the plot crawls along.But the worst part of the book is its rampant sexism. Holy cow, if the author wrote a book treating women the way men are treat NOW would have a book burning party. The women are constatly making derogatory comments and treating men like slaves. (i.e. Male bodyguards are passed around from \`owners' and forced to marry whoever the owner says.) Everyone in power is female and they make rude and sexist remarks constantly.

I read this years ago, got bored with Jordan's increasingly poor writing, and quit for a while. Recently, marooned at the airport (due to the Colorado blizzards), I picked it up and settled in for what I hoped would be at least a long distraction. After all, though the later books stink (and everyone agrees on THAT), some still claim earlier books, like The Shadow Rising, are excellent (or even, \\"some of the best ever\\"!).Well, on second review, I have to say that this one is a stinker, too. Maybe we were all caught up in the hype about \\"the heir to Tolkein\\" or whatever drivel publishers and marketers put on the back of RJ's books. The reality is, this is an awful book, and the series just gets worse. Take for example the all-important (for Mat's character, anyway) scene where he enters a second ter'angreal door and ends up with a spear, a medallion, and a noose around his neck. I read the scene FOUR times, because I felt that I must have missed the part where RJ explains why all this happens--after all, the snake people in the doorframe seem to be reacting to Mat's requests....except that he never makes them. RJ just wanted to give him these items but was too lazy to actually make their acquisition make sense. It's typical of this series. Jordan has characters running amok and then creates an illogical, unbelievable quick action sequence at the very end. Since this happens at the end of the book, most superficial readers will think that the whole book is good, but in reality, the whole thing is dross. Imagine, for example, if you eliminated the scene (just a few pages, really, and in some cases a few paragraphs) where Rand defeats (Forsaken du jour) or X finds (item du jour). Without those, the entire book would be a clear clump of nothing. But by sticking just a bit in there at the end, he paints his \\"novel\\" with a thin veneer of plot/advancement--no matter how illogical.The Shadow Rising is more of the same Jordan junk.

Those who still love it are a minority for a reason. Robert Jordan can be even more perverted than most authors who allegedly describe sexual activity. While Goddkind's scenes are excessive, people like George R.R. Martin restrict it to a paragraph. Jordan writes about men who pursue women they think they love but throughout this series I have never seen a shred or act of true love. EVERYONE in his books is either handsome or beautiful (he emphasizes things like clothing, and treats people like scenery). He TRIES to make us feel happy or sorry when characters fall in or out of love, but no one really cares. He's trying to use ideas out of sitcoms like \\"Friends\\" or soap operas. Of course its a very bad attempt. Now, each book is an episode of the most boring series ever. All of Jordan's characters are the same piece of trash, recycled for each book. I don't care if he has a wonderful skill with words. Anyone could do that. A real storyteller would have a better understanding of human nature. A real writer could at least be more original. Jordan is failure.Nothing happens in the beginning. Or in the middle. Rand's story only gets exciting at the end. Forget Elayne's and Nynaeve's chapters. Take my advice: skip pages when you feel the even slightest desire to do so. Heck, skip whole chapters! I'll admit, the first 3 might be worth your time. But each book is 600-900 pages and for so much writing, there is not enough. And book 4 is when it crashes.I'm tired of the stereotypes. Literature has endured all these \\"heroic epics.\\" Everything is so predictable. They say Wheel of Time is \\"one of the best works of fantasy.\\" Just go ahead and read all those other contemporary novels like \\"Sword of Truth\\" or \\"Sword of Shannara.\\" Pathetic. All I can say is that this entire genre is going downhill, and without its classics, its just wasted paper. I hope all you Jordanites actually find something worth reading. So you can see how bad Robert Jordan really is. I never personally attached myself to this series and I am glad I didn't. Sometimes, stories of heroism are garbage. The most beautiful stories tell us our saddest and most realistic thoughts. I say get A Game of Thrones. Maybe George R.R. Martin can save the genre."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I've read this book before, in the early 80s. It was written by David Eddings and it was titled, \\"Pawn of Prophecy.\\" It featured the young farmer of unknown parentage who sees a mysterious shadowy cloaked figure trailing him at times--but it's always gone. It has a blacksmith of virtue and oh-so-practical values who doesn't like to hurt people or be called \\"Lord.\\" It has a mysterious dark-haired, beautiful sorceress who is very imperious, allows no nonsense, and can often be found brushing her hair before bed. It also has an old storyteller who has more skills and knowledge than others would believe--he's more than he appears. Oh, and there's a connection between the main characters and wolves. Jordan has ripped off most of these elements in this book but FAILS to cite his source, which to me makes this plagarism."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Wheel of Time series is \\"New Age\\" fantasy. Channeling, a new age technique, is the only form of magic in this series. The series GARBAGE! I've read much better fantasy than Robert Jordan. For example, Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series is 100 times BETTER than the Wheel of Time! I wasted my time reading the 1st 6 books, and I am glad I had the sense to stop there!

I think not."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book on its own is a good book, but looses out in comparison to the first two books. The tension and the pace of the first two books is lost, and the author takes this book through its plots and subplots in a more leisurely fasion. Tension is built up more for the next book in the series with a lot of unanswered questions as to what will happen. On the whole a definite buy for the fans of Wheel of time series, but I can see warning signs as that the standard may come down. The very fact of having 6 main charecters and numerous charecter who are important mean that the entire book jumps from one area to another loosing continuity. But the entire story is still good enough for me to buy the next book inthis series"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Shadow Riising is the best book of (The Wheel of Time) series. It is the best because it goes more in depth about the Aiel and how they originated and there customs,another reason is how he goes more in depth with the forsaken and explaining just how strong Nynaeve really is goingtoe for toe with Moghedien. The other things are finding Mat can pseak the old tongue and command a battle even thow he denys it he will hopefully accept it, and how Perrin and Faile eventually get married and defend The Two Rivers.

Now finally he might be able to use his powers in a new way but the only we shall if Mr. Jordan shall write it."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I'm reading WOT series for the second time. I would say that this book fits right in with the overall WOT series. If you have read the first two books and liked them, there's no point to review the rest of the books, as you will buy and read them because you're hooked. Now, as for this book, I'd say that it is most revealing of the series. We finally get to see some secrets revealed for a change! Aiel, Sea Folk, even White Cloaks all make more sence. Annoyingly Mat's problems are unresolved, but what the heck, can't have everything."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"With &quot;The Shadow Rising&quot;, Jordan proved he is a consistent story-teller. Unfortunately, his writing skills are a little weak. The most frustrating aspect of reading his work is that it simply becomes monotonous because he maintains such a plodding pace througout the book. I also found several sections annoying to read because of clumsy wording and structure. However, in contrast to the preceding three books, Jordan has a lot more to say in number four. As a result, he's forced to move faster and still keep it within 700 pages (sheesh!). The overall storyline is getting more interesting and the fight scenes are improving tremendously, but the characters still remain fairly flat and childish. I certainly wouldn't compare Jordan with Tolkien. The air of the story actually reminds me more of Roger Zelazny's &quot;Amber&quot; series, only with the plodding style of Jack Chalker."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I've now re-read the entire Wheel of Time(WoT) series several times. This book is, in my opinion, the best of the ones he has written so far(through Crown of Swords). Jordan, as always, does a fantastic job of building up to events, and making you suspect how they will turn out... and then coming up with something completely different. His descriptions are phenominal. There are several parts of the series that, quite litterally, bring me to tears, not only once, but every time I re-read it. This is the only series that gets the reader that involved. For those who have not re-read the series, it is _well_ worth it. There are so many clues and hints of what is to come that you never pick up on the first time through. Small details, nasty and intricate plot turns that get skipped on the first read. I've bought the entire series in hard-cover because my paperback editions were, quite litterally, falling appart. The first 25+ pages of The Shadow Rising are now somewhere unknown, as they have fallen out. While it was all but impossible to put these books down when I first read them, by now that compulsion is gone since, obviously, I know what is to happen. However, I find the books even more emotionally gripping as I read through them again and again. There are some parts that, after reading them, you need to take a long pause, and run through it again in your mind. A fabulous writer. An incredible series. If you have never liked Fantasy, this is the book to start with. If you already enjoy Fantasy, there is so much that is new an original that you will constantly be surprised. In a final note, if you like Jordan, try Terry Goodkind's the Sword of Truth series... It's not as good as Jordan, but closer than anything else I have read."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I thought I had sleeping sickness but the truth is this book is so boring, the instant I read a page I zonk out! I must admit I found the second and third books somewhat interesting, despite being completely predictable. But man, lets have some action! What fun is it to read about people travelling all over some bland world, while not having a single interesting conversation, and then having a quick battle at the end of the book? Come on, it got old in the second book, overdone in the third, and made me puke in the fourth. I'm not going to bother reading Jordans cut-and-paste plot any longer. Unless I need to fall asleep quickly, that is. Fantasy must be in a really pathetic state if this is the greatest series available right now. The writing is quite lame, the characters wooden, if it werent for the complex political world this book would get 0 stars. Oh wait, I can only set it as low as one. (Think I'll leave it at that). In Summary: Would make a great addition to any library containing Celestine Prophecy."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The writing is very corny, and gets worse and worse. Even the parts of the book that are supposed be interesting/engaging, the parts that really affect how the plot unfolds, are, most often, underwhelming to say the least.I really liked the prequel and book 3, the Dragon Reborn, but after reading this one . . . .I really have to consider moving forward with this series. . . .Very long, painful and boring."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I've been reading the wheel of time for awhile now, and every single one of them is good. I've just finishd th 4th book of the serie, and it ended with a city destroyed. Which city you ask, well it's in a place that you wouldn't think Matt, Rand, Nynaeve, Egwene, and Elayne would go to. Where's Perrin? Well in this book, he got fed up with Rand so he went back home. But he went back home for another reason, not just Rand. Two Rivers was being attacked, but by who? He left Rand and went with Loial, the ogier, and Faile, who wants to be with Perrin but always get annoyed but his stubbornness. Who does Rand face at he end, and how Rand barely go away with his life. Why did the girls leave to the Aiel? Matt is still wondering which way to go. Should he follow Perrin or fight with Rand? All of this in the 4th book. I personally enjoyed this book. It described some of the female characters in the book that sounds too good to be true. I was surprised with the final battle. I would think that Rand would be killed for sure, but of course something or someone came to save him. Even though all of these events happened, I liked what happen to Perrin. Going back home to try to save it. Fighting along with Rand's dad and his own. It was very exciting. Perrin is my favorite character becase if his golden eye. It just sounds so powerful. In conclusion, I really like this book, because it really take my mind ino another world. It's like a vacation, but not going anywhere, and I would recommend reading it in your spare time. Try not to read it as a school assignment, because it just take away some of the great imagination that you can get."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I admit it. When I first read 'Eye of the World', I thought the Aiel were a neat idea. A mysterious xenophobic group of people. But, as Jordan has done with so many things, he shreds the mystery. By the end of the book, the reader knows everything about the Aiel. I mean everything. Jordan spends at least 400 pages concerning Aiel.'..Shadow..' follows the by-now-familiar pattern of Jordan's books..an interesting beginning followed by a fast descent into mediocrity, then wraps it up into a mind-blowing final 100 pages.Sometime around the middle of this book, Jordan's constant use of the same phrases really started to bother me. He spends way too much time having characters upset with others...also the amused looks are way too much.Example: Character X (usually one of the Big 3) is teased/mocked/embarrassed by a supporting character (usually an Aiel). Character X's traveling companions always look on with a smile on their faces, enjoying X's discomfort. Jordan must have used this 15 times.Even more annoying though is Jordan's arrogant characters. The Aiel Wise Women are at the top of the list. They think everyone else is 'foolish'. Apparently they despise everyone who thinks differently from them. From there it's a short step to the rest of the women. They think all men are 'foolish'. Jordan's favorite term for men is 'wool-brained'. After about 80 instances in this book alone, I, for one, was very tired of it.Finally Jordan likes to have a character muttering under its breath..usually about something derogatory to another character. The first time it was funny. The next 15...no.Wrapping it up, 'The Shadow Rising' is not a great book. Robert Jordan is not a great writer. It is entertaining. As I said earlier, the final 100 pages are slam-bang entertainment. I couldn't put the book down (I even took an extra lunch hour to finish the book off). If you're looking for good fantasy, WITH good writing, check out Donaldson's Thomas Covenant books."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Shadow Rising of The Wheel of Time series is a really good book. The series itself is good. Each book describes the characters and what is happening with them. It explains their personal feelings and emotions. In his books you get into each individual character. In the Shadow Rising, it always has wanting to know what will happen next. It keeps you guessing, but not too much though. This is defenitely a good book to read. I suggest that if you were to read the series, to start at the beginning with The Eye of the World."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Robert Jordan did it again, another book that kept me looking forward to what was going to happen next.. If your considering buying Shadow Rising then you most likely have read the first three.. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because at the end, it gets REALLY easy to loose who's who with all the new people running around with Rand al'Thor.. And alot more story setup for what I'm assuming is going to go down in the next book.. (I'm starting to see a trend of alot of build up with one book and then action in the next, this one was much more the first rather than the latter) How ever, it was worth every minute I spent with it."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This does tie up a lot of loose plot ends, but, like all good novels in a series, creates more loose ends...teh only problem it does so in an anti-climactical fashion. This is one of the few WoT books so far that you're not in a big rush to get to the ending...the most significant elements occur in the middle of the book (Rand's association with the Aiel, Nynaeve, Elayne, and Egwene in Tanchico, the stilling of Siuan Sanche). I think this is best read with Book 5 as an accompaniment, but if you MUST read it alone, do. It's still a fairly good book. Good characterization, good plot, good continuation of the series. The reason it got only 4 stars is because all of the climactic points were in the middle and not towards the end."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I am now on book 5 of the Wheel of Time series, and I am beginning to see a repetition.

The Shadow Rising has plenty of scenes that tug at the memory years later, and Jordan's still trying to match the quality of this effect.Also Recomended: The Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling, The Left Behind series by Tim LaHain and Jerry B. Jenkins, The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkin, The Saga of Darren Shan series by Darren Shan, and the Remnants series by K.A.

Also, in the second book, it shows Rand holding the horn of Valerie like he will blow it, but he is't even the one whom blows it.

The plot is not weak, but the dialogue at times gets annoying. The Perrin storyline is by far the best. However, this book does not have a storyline which I despise completely, as this series sometimes does.

Tell us the lesson that we should...The fourth book was quite good, particularly those parts involving Perrin and Faile. I won't get into major plot details, as many others have already beaten me to it. But I do recommend this title. There are some fairly major changes to the overall arc that would leave one confused without this book.My only major complaint is the start, which took far too long. There were definately some good parts of that, but it would have been nice to get out of the Stone well before page 240. But that's really a minor issue.The real question for Mr. Jordan is, will it ever end?"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"What a great book! In some ways Shadow Rising marks a dramatic change from the first three books of the series. The pace of the narrative slows, while the complexity and richness of the WOT world expands dramatically. In my opinion Shadow Rising is the book that changed WOT from a five book series to a 12+ book series.After a dramatic beginning in Tear our protagonists break into three groups and head their different ways. The three major story lines follow Rand, Matt and Egwene to the Aeil waste, Perrin back to the Three Rivers, and Nyneave, Elayne and company to Tanchico. Each of the three threads is entertaining and well written, building to an exciting conclusion. We also begin to understand the bad guys better (Forsaken and Fain). The Rhuidean sequence and the finale of the Three Rivers sequence are two of the highpoints of the entire WOT series.Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"_The Shadow Rising_ is an excellent book. I am quite a latecomer to the World of Time series but having recently sped through Books 1-3, this one has definitely cemented my addiction to the series. I couldn't put it down! Rand has finally shown his full acceptance of his fate and is ready to perform his 'duties' for the world else the Dark One succeed. It is clear to readers that the fatigue and pressure of such a role takes its toll on Rand as he envelopes himself more and more into his own little world - to the extent that even we only see parts of his world and thoughts. Jordan has woven an excellent web around Rand - enticing us with small parts of his plans and thoughts as the Mighty Dragon Reborn - enough to weave the book with solid threads of mystery and to capture the readers imagination more. Perrin has similarly evolved to an acceptance of his place in the world and has a love interest. Mat is still up to his old tricks - observed by all to still be a gambler/pilferer and at times emanating a very selfish attitude. But he is strong taeveren as readers know, and it is not easy for someone like him to escape his responsibilities, and fate. Speeding through from adventure to adventure, answering answers to old planted puzzles, adding dashes of romance, elements of mystery, and magic catapults this book to its status an outstanding contribution to the genre of science fiction/fantasy. In my opinion, some of the weaknesses in this book are those that have stood throughout the series - the portrayal of women, painted too commonly with women all acting 'icy' towards men and amazingly impatient and disrespectful at times, and the element of romance - this has been stronger in this book and welcomingly so but Jordan draws an uncertain hand in depicting this and the romance is always fleeting, and dissatisfying. And just if I could? My suggestion - get rid of Nyaeve! (The most ill tempered, illogical, and irritating character) The fact that a man such as Lan loves her makes it worse Nevertheless, an excellent read and an enjoyable, thrilling one at that!"},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I'm just gonna say one thing... if you could give this book more then five stars, I would!

Jordan has it all in this book! Both sadness, and also happyness!

Almost every character starts in the same Place (Tear) then forces and fate separate them. Perrin Heads to Two Rivers with Loial and Falile. Perrin I feel has gotten the more of the boring chapters, But in this one he really comes into his own, I love everyone calling him Lord Perrin after how much crap he gave Rand when the Tahrien people started calling him that. Nyneave and Elayne travel with Thom and Julien travel south following the black Ajah and try to retrieve the stolen ter'angreals. Rand, Mat, Egweyne, Morane, and Lan travel with the Aiel to their Homeland the Waste. Those chapters are really interesting and have a lot of history of the Aiel, which really leads to the legend. And there's also drama in Tar Valon with Min and the Amyrlin seat, which has one of the biggest shocks in the entire book.What I liked about this book is it seems to jump back and forth between characters, and skips a lot of the filler where they are just traveling to a destination, there's still some, but not as much as in the last couple of books.This book flowed a lot better than the Dragon reborn the first chapter was a bit too long (50 pages) but after that the book didn't let up."},{"Title":"Shadow Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Book four is at least as good as the first three, and Robert Jordan created a world that actually seems like it could be real.

Author Robert Jordan changes things up for the second book in row, first with Rand Al'Thor's return as a major point of view character and the second with all the major plot threads did not end together in the same location as the previous three books had done.With Rand return as a major point of view perspective, we find him more confident in his role as the Dragon Reborn and learning to direct as well as react to events better than he had previously. Interestingly it is Rand, who had never interacted with an Tinkers or Aiel in the previous three books, that learns of their history as well as his own in the Aiel Waste. Along with Rand are Egwene, Mat, and Moiraine who's views of Rand's development round out the picture of a young man learning to use the One Power and if he is going mad or not. Perrin returns to Emond's Field with Faile, Loial, and three Aiel planning to turn himself into the Whitecloaks to save his village and family, by the end he has become a local hero and war leader. Then there is the hunt of the Black Ajah by Nynaeve and Elayne to the western shore of the continent only to find something even more dark than former Aes Sedai. And on top of all these major plots are the events taking place at the White Tower, the news of which hasn't reached any of the major characters.With all these plot threads and new locations, it would have been easy for this book to become a mess. However this book was so good that I found it hard to put down when I had to get back on the clock.
