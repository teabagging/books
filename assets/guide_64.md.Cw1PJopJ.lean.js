I highly recommend this book for anyone seeking an effective approach to learner-centered training.This book goes beyond providing a great survey of some of the most exciting learning games created. The author does a great job comparing the cultural differences between the \\"Games Generation\\" and its predecessors.I believe this would be a great book for managers working with employees from the Games Generation, especially those that question the generation's work ethic. Members of the Games Generation don't need work that is fun all the time, but it does need to be captivating. Getting stuck in a game isn't fun, but it is incredibly engaging.

Of course the same is true for gaming and the convergence of the two isthe altruistic message of Marc Prensky's book.Mr. Prensky's book points to the future with promises and warnings supported by a rich amount of research, as demonstrated by his footnotes and bibliography.We let the TV pass by without carefully planning how it could be a force for complementing education. Lets not make the same mistake with the net!This a wonderful eye openner for those that have underestimated gaming (play) and its importance to learning.Just the quotes at the beginning of each chapter make the book compelling and can immediately reveal opportunities in most scenerios. Each chapter is thoughtfully layed out with interesting examples/case studies and methodically introduces a group of concepts then builds to a thoughftul and often unpredictable conclusion.The book is rich with facts and statistics - some of them, while revealing the potential in redirecting gaming, are still frightening.&quot;Each day the average teenager in America watches over 3 hours of television, in on the internet 10 minutes to an hour, and plays 1 1/2 hours of video games.&quot;In fact this seems conservative to me, but if Marc is right, there is an incredible amount of untapped potential in reaching America's youth and this book is a deliberate first step.Finally a book both gamers and game designers can love, students can share, parents and kids can discuss and left and right brains can savor."},{"Title":"Digital Game-Based Learning","review":"This is an interesting book because it's not so much about games as it is about learning (maybe that's why one reviewer found it boring). For educators and instructional designers, this book is about how to motivate people to learn through pleasurable and challenging activity. Structuring learning activities with this in mind can benefit any learner-- corporate or classroom. Linear, computer or web-based learning programs are boring. Games provide a key to sustained learning-- motivation. Before you build another one, my recommendation is to read this book."},{"Title":"Digital Game-Based Learning","review":"Will all elearning vendors read this book and take note.....Content can be delivered in a format that goes beyond page-turning instruction, with interaction being limited to role plays and multi-choice questions......and the learner will still learn!This book really fired my imagination with the potential for using games as a way of imparting educational material.

You think that it's some type of scam to increase some type of video game's sales. But this is more like a Chicken Soup for the Gamers Soul. It tells many ways on how video games have educated people around the world. From foreigners learning how to speak English by playing English RPG's, to a kid who learned to drive by playing racing games.Mr. Prensky demenstrates how all video games require some strategic planning in able to beat the game. That brings up creative thinking for the younger video game players.This game lists off many reasons on why Video Games are NOT degrading, are NOT time wasting, along with many more reasons. The book got a star knocked off because the book doesn't stick to one main idea. It's a bunch of good, unique, brilliant ideas, however it's not a good idea to put two different unique idea's together. Not saying that this book should have came out in a series, but should have consisted of similar experiences in different chapters. The book covers a lot of bases, but not in a very professional way.Some examples that were sent in by readers are available in the January 2001 issue of Nintendo Power at newstands now.

If you were to read beyond the scope of what Marc is suggesting with game-based learning, you will also began to understand why the Gen X, Y, Z are what and whom they are. The diet they have been raised on and how they are built from it is an interesting study on this generation and to a certain extent, a cultural observation of their thinking, choices and being.Why do I say &quot;problems&quot;? For the simple fact that we sometimes don't understand the youth and we find that it is &quot;them&quot; that is the problem. Given the fact that we have been around longer and therefore wiser, theoratically, we should be wiser in finding new ways to reach them. Unfortunately, being around longer also means being more set in our ways and Marc is proposing that we teach by using games would raise a few eyebrows.While this book has addressed some of my understanding with learning with the younger generation, can anybody recommend me a book that will teach the older generation to learn new things without the eyebrows?"},{"Title":"Digital Game-Based Learning","review":"This book is excellent--well researched and beautifully written. A MUST READ for every education and training professional!"},{"Title":"Bucking the Sun","review":"Despite the claims of some of the misleading reviews (including the Editorial review at the top of this page) this is not a murder mystery in any way. Yes, two of the characters do perish, as is revealed in the first chapter of the novel (which is not in chronological order with the rest), but this plays an absolutely minimal role in the story. While the question of who ultimately perishes does linger in the back of your mind while Doig relates the multi-faceted story of the Duff family, this is not a tale of a family coping with death. This is truly an epic story which combines interesting, developed, and, most of all, distinct characters with an extraodinarily well described setting- an enormous New Deal project and accompanying lively shantytown set amidst grand natural scenery. The result is a novel which anyone (though especially someone with an interest in or affinity for the American West) should thoroughly enjoy."},{"Title":"Bucking the Sun","review":"I just did not like this book as much as I had hoped to. Doig writes wonderfully and he has a terrific sense of character and setting, but all too often the story lacked a sense of direction. The murder subplot seemed hardly more than an afterthought and I thought the book would have been much improved had it been more fully incorporated. I find the construction of dams very interesting, so I was really looking forward to learning about them while enjoying the story, but it did not work. I think the problem others have with the focus on the dam is that Doig never actually explains its construction in clear, understandable detail, a la Crichton. Its always just bits and pieces that never fit with a coherent whole. In sum, good, definitely not great."},{"Title":"Bucking the Sun","review":"Ivan Doig, as usual, writes great sentences and very good paragraphs. However, once he gets beyond 200 pages, the whole story drags. I liked his shorter books very much, and waited until I had several weeks of free time to tackle this longer work, knowing it would be slow going. It turned out to be even slower reading than I expected. Doig obviously learned a lot from Stegner about constructing long, complex sentences out of unfamiliar words ( or non-words on all too many occasions ) that have to be parsed carefully to suck out all the nuances of meaning, which works well for a short book of poetry but fails in a work of this length. After a while, the reader just wants the torture to end, but there is no way to hurry through Doig's convoluted poetry/prose. Doig's characters are at once totally unbelievable and exactly like my Scotch-Irish relatives, who are also unbelievable, or at least highly improbable in their actions and reasoning processes. In short, a book half as long would have been better.Charlie A Allen"},{"Title":"Bucking the Sun","review":"A fine novel worth your time, but definitely not a mystery book. Sure the first 10 pages describe a murder scene, but there's nothing to solve. Actually, it doesn't get solved, it's lived with, and really that can be said for much of what the Duff family experiences.All members of the family Duff are unique, as are their relationships. All are enjoyable with only the Scottish Uncle seeming a little too polished; his dialogue a little too precise. But that's a quibble because overall, Doig does very well with his characters. Throw in the dam as another major character and Montana itself, and you have a book worth your time; a great tableau of the 1930s Depression in America.And if you know what the cover of the first Life Magazine looks like, you know Fort Peck. Doig weaves many real events into his fiction including a visit by FDR, a major dam mishap, and a visit from a Life photographer."},{"Title":"Bucking the Sun","review":"&quot;Bucking the Sun&quot; starts with the discovery of two bodies and the promise of a mystery to be solved. I was hooked after reading the first chapter. However, the mystery reappeared once in the next 350 pages or so. In the meantime, I learned about dam building, New Deal projects , and Comunist politics of the era.On the plus side, Mr. Doig certainly knows his subjects well. He develops interesting characters and relationships and weaves it all into a complex novel.I was left feeling like I'd been teased with the mystery which turned out to be little more than a footnote. Also, I'd have to say I didn't find the author's style all that easy.On whole, though, the book was worthwhile and I'll try another of his works."},{"Title":"Bucking the Sun","review":"I appreciated the sense of place and time that was so well evoked. I admired the characters, thier complexities, and the overlapping and differences among their personalities. But I missed the warmth and the sense of the moment that I got from English Creek and Dancing at the Rascal Fair.I found many of the phrases, allusions, and figures of speech to be quite unnatural and unrealistic. I found myself doubting that anyone would talk that way. While the words chosen were interesting and evocative they didn't flow and contribute to my connection with the story and characters. In fact, I often found the manner of speech to be quite distracting.The dam was huge in life and in the story. I found that I could not easily follow some of the details about the design and construction but I also found that understanding the specifics was not necessary. What seemed to me to be important was the understanding that the dam was perhaps the major character in the novel with a life of it's own that grew in complexity as the structure itself built layer by layer. Much as the lives of the human characters interwove, unraveled, and were repaired."},{"Title":"Bucking the Sun","review":"I thought I would never finish this book. It was very disappointing, mainly because his other books were so great. This had a thin story as an excuse to tell about the dam project which is interesting, I guess, if you're an engineer."},{"Title":"Bucking the Sun","review":"I read this because my parents were at Ft Peck in 1933 where my dad worked as an engineer. My parents were &quot;very proper&quot; city people. My mother talked about living in a 24' X 24' construction shack, bathing in a wash tub in water heated from the stove, and hanging clothes to dry where they froze and the ice evaporated in the dry Montana air.This story brought their experiences to light in a unique way. The Ft Peck area in 1933 Montana was Wild West beyond my imagination. The author brings it to life, weaving a family life, the dynamics of the area, the happenings of the 1930 and a mystery into a wonderful vivid novel.I highly recommend Bucking the Sun to anyone interested in spending a few hours in such a story.Andy"},{"Title":"Bucking the Sun","review":"Like Fort Peck dam, Doig has fashioned a lasting and monumental achievement here. He has done what no dam engineer could--elevate the project to the level of metaphor. I LOVED this book--it's utterly compelling and pure poetry at the same time. I admit haven't read much Doig, but I recently listened to the audio book of &quot;Bucking The Sun&quot; read by Will Paton on a car trip, and even abridged, the book still has a tremendous impact. Long may Ivan Doig wave!"},{"Title":"Bucking the Sun","review":"Make room in the pantheon of great western American novels for Bucking The Sun. Doig's novel deserves to be included with the other master works: Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden, Stegner's Big Rock Candy Mountain and Angle of Repose, Guterson's Snow Falling On Cedars and Ferber's Giant.Doig begins with a mystery and a scandel, but masterfully, he does not over-emphasize the real story, the story of the Duff family. I found his mystery pacing something like a catch-and-release effect--once he caught me and had me reading, he released me to explore the family story.And the story has several layers that make for an enjoyable novel that will satisfy on many levels: The era of the 1930s, the inner-actions of the family, politics of the era, rich dialogue (Doig has a marvelous ear for language!) and of course, the mystery/scandel.Final advice: read it when you have extended time periods. This is for the readers who loves a grand-scale novel."},{"Title":"Bucking the Sun","review":"The Great Depression caused nearly every family in the U. S. to loose their money and possessions. Most of America was poverty stricken, having to beg for food and money from others who were barley scraping by. The president during this dark time in our nation's history was Franklin D. Roosevelt. He knew reform was needed so he started handing out government money creating jobs for the American people. One such example of Roosevelt's reform was the Fort Peck dam in Montana. Here Ivan Doig's Bucking the Sun sets the stage for the Duff family, and focuses on the relationships of the family with the dam and each other. The theme of nature, the personified dam and the symbols created by the family members becomes evident as Doig uses fragments of his personal history to create this epic novel which is often compared to John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath. The stream of consciousness, described by Doig himself as \\"poetry under prose\\", lets us know each character better so that we can clearly understand their actions. The novel opens with the makeshift town of Wheeler , finding a truck in the water with two dead and naked Duffs inside. From there the novel flashes back to before the dam was built and the government moving everyone off the land, including the headstrong and ornery Hugh Duff. Hugh does not like the idea of the dam especially because his oldest son Owen is the fillmaster on the project. For the first time the dam emerges as a person which influences and effects everyone's life that it comes near. Owen is obsessed with the project of the Fort Peck dam. He is so involved in it that he is willing to leave his new wife Charlene in order to work on it. This dam is the only thing Owen Duff really loves. When the Duff family, like millions of other, comes to work on the dam, Owen emerges as the voice of reason, seemingly the only stable person in the family. The river is a theme that ties everyone in the novel together and pulls the people towards the dam. This whimsical water is loved by some such as Owen and his younger brother Bruce, and hated by others. The Missouri River is what pulls the Duff family back together and even brings about new additions. Bruce and his twin Neil both find love on the river. The prospect of new jobs inspires Hugh's brother Darius to travel from Scotland to work on the bridge. Darius' politically troubled past also follows him to America at a time when workers were trying to gain a place for themselves and their unions, sometimes even through communism. This novel correctly depicts the essence of the Depression Era by following the colorful lives of the people who lived in it. It describes every type of people from ranch-hand, to prostitute, and even to left-winged communists. Bucking the Sun was very long and detailed with technical jargon. I felt that many of the characters were not as developed as they could have been. For instance, Rosellen's attachment to her writing was never fully explained. It seemed to me that she merely wrote because there was interesting things to write about, and she was never that hurt when her stories were turned down. The passages written about the family history were a burden to read because it rarely served a purpose, I know I could have gotten by without the excerpts. All in all the book was well written and it did provide an insight to the minds of the people who lived in America during the Great Depression. I would recommend this book to historians that want to get a mindset of the people of this era, but beware readers, this book is definitely uncensored."},{"Title":"Bucking the Sun","review":"I get so impatient with those who describe Doig as a &#34;western&#34; writer because his novels and memoirs are set in the west, and because he cares deeply about that land. His characters are universal, and he teaches us so much about the history, not just of the western migrations, but of the world, and indeed of the rise and fall of civilizations. I love ALL his characters, and not just because I am a &#34;westerner&#34; myself. His ear for dialog is flawless, and his characters are all people I know or would like to know. He deserves a wide readership, and will leave you with an understanding of and sympathy for human nature that will make the world a better place. If you're into creepy or violent, though, he's not the writer for you. His characters certainly aren't all wholesome, decent people, but even the ones you don't like, you will understand and feel some sympathy for. And he will sweep you away to a different time and place, usually the Montana of yesteryear, where life was elemental and people did what they had to to survive."},{"Title":"Bucking the Sun","review":"There's no detective here and not much bloodshed, but there sure is a mystery: what happened the night in 1938 when the bodies of a man and a woman, both naked, turn up in the cab of a Ford truck dragged from underwater at the Fort Peck, Montana, dam?They are both members of the Duff family, both married, but not to each other. That much we learn in the first chapter. Then Doig pulls back to 1933 and tells the story of the Duffs, Hugh, his three sons and Hugh's brother Darius, who turns up from Scotland about a quarter of the way through the story. And all five have wives - that's ten major characters Doig manages to distinguish.And always you are wondering, which two are the bodies in the truck?The background of the Duffs' story is the building of the Fort Peck Dam, a New Deal project for which Owen Duff is an engineer, a sister-in-law is a typist, and the other males are laborers. Owen's mother Meg is briefly a cook, her sister-in-law Proxy is, um, a hostess at a dance hall/bar, and one daughter-in-law is a hair stylist and another a waitress. (Which two ...?)Doig's study of history shows through in his handling of the political and economic threads: the small Communist group that one Duff supports, the loss of Hugh Duff's farm to the dam project (not a very good farm, but still), the two appearances of President Roosevelt at the dam. Photographer Margaret Bourke-White, unnamed, comes to take pictures for the new Life Magazine.But this isn't a didactic novel - it is the story of a family pulling together, pulling apart, doing the best it can in hard times, shocked by violence. By page 344 I had my candidates for the two bodies in the truck. And I was wrong on both counts.Doig is known for his stories of Montana and This House of Sky, his autobiography. Bucking the Sun shows he can write a fine historical novel and keep his readers wondering, who done it? why was it done? and, mainly, who is dead?"},{"Title":"Bucking the Sun","review":"This is the second Ivan Doig novel I've read. In \\"Dancing at the Rascal Fair\\" I learned a lot more about sheep-herding than I ever thought I would like, but like it I did. In fact, I loved it, 5 stars worth. In this book I learned a lot more about how those big Western dams were built than I ever thought I would like, but only 4 stars for this one.Doig is a wonderful popular historian, well worth reading on whatever topic he decides on. He took on a difficult story here. He got the history right but it's still a difficult read. Several times as I was reading \\"Bucking the Sun\\" I wondered if he introduced the mysterious Duff adultery/homicide at the beginning just to keep us reading to the end.I'll be reading more Ivan Doig, that I know. He has the knack of making history come alive, even when the history is as gritty as the story of the Great Depression and how people lived through it -- or didn't."},{"Title":"Bucking the Sun","review":"First, I admit it's been 2 or 3 years since I read the book but I still remember how much I enjoyed it and the way Doig captured the desperation and chaos of the WPA camps in a country in the throes of the Great Depression.True, it's not Rascal Fair or English Creek, but it's still a story well told."},{"Title":"Bucking the Sun","review":"Ivan Doig reminds me of Steinbeck, only funnier. He tells a \\"big\\" story butsticks tight to the little stories of his characters. My husband read this book, and itlooked boring to me on the surface, but now I am off to find another Doig book to read.Writers like this give literature a good name by telling a complex tale in a compelling andsimple fashion."},{"Title":"Bucking the Sun","review":"Like just about everyone else in the world, I love the English Creek trilogy, and especially 'Dancing at the Rascal Fair.' What's not to like? They are crisp, have good forward momentum, great characters, fun writing, and Stuff Happens. I love rambling and digressions, which Doig is famous for, when they add to the overall color, backgrounds of the characters, and build more fully the world of the story. Doig does this very well in all of his books.'Bucking the Sun' left me disappointed, like it tried to do too much in one book. There is a rule in theater, if a gun appears in the first act it needs to go off by the end of the second act. This book has too many unfired guns. The murder mystery itself doesn't even make sense, and the grand revelation at the end is a puzzling fizzle. The women characters are cardboard props, the communist radical uncle another fizzle. What's with his mysterious escape just before the dam collapses? How did he know, and why didn't he sound a warning? Did he have something to do with it? The various infidelities come out of the blue and make no sense.There are a lot of inherently exciting plot elements-- like the drama of thousands of families being forced off their land, and into good-paying but temporary jobs in shanty boomtowns. I think much more could have been made of this; it is a terrible tradeoff, and most folks would rather keep their land. It is not a trivial thing to force people out of their home, that's one of the worst things that can happen to anyone. There is a lot of drama in building the world's largest earthen dam, during the Great Depression no less. But for me the book never really took off or came together. It feels a few drafts shy of a final draft, it needed some trimming and coherence. But no Doig book is ever a waste; there is a lot to enjoy, and I will read it again someday."},{"Title":"Bucking the Sun","review":"The characters in this novel are well described and true to the character of Montanans.

Ivan Doig uses amazing description in his story of &quot;The first family of the Fort Peck Dam&quot;. I highly recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Bucking the Sun","review":"This book is the story of the Duff family and its experiences building the Fort Peck Dam in Montana, a public works project in the 1930s. The Duffs are a family of three grown brothers, their parents, their Scottish uncle, and the women who marry into the Duff family over the course of the book. Everyone in the extended family works in some role at the Dam, one as an engineer and the rest as laborers. Doig interweaves details about the mechanics of building of a dam into the story. The book starts with a murder that gets solved at the end of the book, but that turns out to be incidental to the story.I had a lot of trouble getting through this book, even though I usually find books with complex family relationships interesting, and even though I was somewhat interested in how a dam gets built. I'm not sure what it was missing, but I found that I never really got an understanding of the characters and what motivated them. I was completely uninterested in the resolution of the murder, and upon finding out who had done it, I found it under-motivated through the book. The book focused on the men in the family, and never really developed the women characters, which was especially disappointing for me. Maybe men who like things to be unspoken will like this book better than I did."},{"Title":"Grits: An intimate portrait of the Liberal Party","review":"Despite its age, there is no better guide available to the nuts and bolts of how the Canadian political system works.

This book is a good addition to any production systems (production inventory control, production operations management) class. It provides a good, basic overview of many of the principles needed for the production control professional. The main advantage of this book is that it has a diskette with it to allow practice of the principles. A tool called ProDSS is included to aid in many of the calculations using Excel macros. These calculations include forecasting and labor requirements. There is also a simulation to evaluate your decisions against a factory environment. However, you must have the instructor text with diskette to utilize this feature.I consider this text an excellent choice for the basics of production systems.

It sparks the imagination with interstellar travel, political intrigue, and romance, while at the same time being well-written and handily constructed. Also, it has survived the transformation from print to Kindle format amazingly well, unlike many of the other books I have recently purchased. Great read all around!"},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"I have a '67 copy of this book...much the worse for wear from many readings. Since she has gone on to expound on quite a few of her earlier works, I would love to see her do the same with this one. Sara &amp; Harlan are a great two-some and I still think of this as one of my favorite works of hers. Easily read, it is more than capable of standing alone. A must for any McCaffrey fan."},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"To understand what you're getting if you buy this book, you must understand that the author was attempting to write a science fiction *romance* novel, not a straight scifi story. That said, if you don't mind a bit of romance mixed into your science fiction, it's not a bad story, a pretty decent book.It's also Anne McCaffrey's first novel, and isn't as polished as her later works are.I enjoyed the book, and if you're an Anne McCaffrey fan I'm sure you will too. If you've never read any of her books before, though, I suggest you might want to start with one of the later, more popular ones such as &quot;The Ship who Sang&quot; or &quot;To Ride Pegasus&quot; or &quot;The Dragonriders of Pern&quot;."},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"I read this book after I had read McCaffrey's Dragon series when I found it used. I read it, kept it read it again, still loved it and had to scrounge around until I could find a newer less read copy as I wanted to read it again. I am glad it is being reissued. Another lesser known books of McCaffrey's that are good but more in the Romance Genre, The Mark of Merlin, Ring of Fear and the Kilternan Legacy. They are very dated but great stories. I noticed that they seem to have been reissued which is great as I need to pick up less used copies for my keeper collection. But back to Resoree, I wish there had been a sequel to this book."},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"OK, OK, so the plot has holes. Yes, the villans are straight out of a comic book. So what? The SF setting and plot are just the framework for a love story - and a very nice one it is, too. Unlike most books, the hero is secondary. Our heroine, Sara, is the star of the book. Intelligent, observant, and compassionate, she is thrust into a new and frightening world. To add to the confusion, she's always been ugly, but is suddenly beautiful. Who is the patient in this wierd hospital, and what should she do?Restoree could just as easily been set in Nazi Germany, or any number of settings. Irrelevant. This is above all a love story, and one you will want to revisit. It's a crying shame there has never been a sequel."},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"Several years back I wrote to Anne McCaffrey, and told her that Restoree was the novel that hooked me into science fiction. She replied to me, and let me know that it was her first novel, and that she had taken the title from words that describe a strong, independent woman. How sorry I am that I didn't keep the description! (Can you figure it out?)While you may find the novel lacking in depth, you will be drawn into a world where a woman can take control of her destiny, and triumph in the end."},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"I've read nearly everything Anne MacCaffrey has ever written, and most of it is excellent, but this -- her very first book -- is, in my humble opinion, the best she's ever written. The story line is compelling; the characters are richly drawn, and the world on which our heroine finds herself is believeably complex. One thing that sometimes annoys me about the later books by MacCaffrey is that they all seem to involve some sort of telepathic communication, of which this book is mercifully free. At the time this was written, no one would have been able to do it justice if translated to the movie genre; I would love to see someone from Hollywood pick up the movie rights now! \\"Restoree\\" would be a guaranteed smash at the box office!"},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"This is a good book, well written. It is just a little hard to stay in the book."},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"One of Anne's early books and one of her best. You won't want to put it down and then you will want to reread it when you're finished. Great fantasy with a touch of romance. Some reviews may say this book is unrealistic but why ruin a good book with realism. Fantastic read."},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"This was the first SF book that i read - and it remains my favourite. The story is underdeveloped, but the emotions expressed more than make up for it. The ending could have been better, but I believe that there is more than enough to make a sequel to. A great book."},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"This is the first story I ever read by Anne McCaffrey and I have been reading her every since. She writes the most compelling stories of strong women and strong men. I have read every book she has ever written but this was my favorite. Sara's determination and strength makes her a compelling character, but she also has humor,compassion and weaknesses. This book will always live on in my mind as one of the best ever written by anyone."},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"I found this book when I was in middle school and just beginning to read Anne McCaffrey's Harper Hall Trilogy. The book enthralled me instantly. I was unable to put it down until I was finished reading it. I am thrilled to see a Kindle version available. I could not wait to download it. I was a little apprehensive because a few of the other older books I had bought were riddled with grammatical errors and scanning errors. (t appearing as r and etc). I was delighted to find relatively few mistakes with this electronic version. The few I found were not terribly distracting and were not repeated through out the work like others I have seen.The story is solid and a quick read. I truly enjoy it and recommend it to anyone who likes light sci-fi fantasy."},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"I was really glad to see this available on Kindle since it's an older book. It's one of my all time favorites."},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"This is one of my favorite Anne McCaffrey books. I've read it several times and can't find my original copy so I had to order another one. This is very different from her dragonrider books, but no less entertaining. It's more of a love story, with a nice bit of suspense at the end."},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"It's great to see that this book has been re-issued. Restoree and The White Dragon have been my favorite books for the last 20 years. It's a thrill to see new 'dragon' books, but it would be awesome to see a sequel to Restoree! Sara and Harlan make a great team!"},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"&quot;restoree&quot; simply makes you think about government in general, imagine a surreal world of green oceans, and get nightmares of being eaten alive by monsters from outer space. i wonder if the makers of the movie &quot;alien&quot; had any idea about the &quot;restoree&quot;"},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"Mrs MacCaffrey's ability to kick life into a rather undeveloped story is astonishing. This is one of those stories you get a feeling the author has concentrated on and put a lot of emotional effort in, at least compared to later books. I aggree; this one is worthy of a sequel."},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"My admiration for Anne McCaffrey's work began with Restoree some 30 years ago. A girlfriend loaned it to me and I sat up all night reading it under a blanket with a flashlight. I must have read it at least a half dozen times before I returned it to her. I purchased my own copy, read it several more times, and finally loaned it to another student, never to be seen again. It was a love story, an adventure, even a political thriller. Above all, it was refreshing and entertaining."},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"An entertaining romp - romance, heros (and heroines), evildoers, mind-control, a plot to overthrow the government! Will it work? Enjoy seeing people overcome fear and personal prejudice for love. Well written"},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"It's worth reading but not at the Kindle price. No paper, no ink, no glue, no fuel costs, no Text-to-speech. Do yourself a favor buy a used paperback. Don't support the \\"Publishers\\" price gouging. No TTS, $3.99. with TTS $5.99 max."},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"Probably Anne McCaffery's worst effort. The opening conversation is impossible to follow until you have read most of the book and met the characters; then you can go back and reread it. The bad guys are anonymous monsters, and loose ends are left all over the place."},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"I was shocked at the lack of realism this book pounded into my mind. The idea of a human learning a new language and culture in less than 6 months was laughable. I addore Anne's other works, in fact I read all I can get my hands on, but this was drivel that I will more than willingly sell to a used book store. This was a sad, sad manuscript."},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"This is Anne McCaffrey's first published novel. Despite having been originally published decades ago, the story is only slightly dated. I think it shows how far ahead of her time she was when it came to depicting strong women in Science Fiction. The heroine and hero have attitudes that would not be out of place in a current SF book.This book has a bit of everything in it, alien abduction, political intrigue, battles against horrific aliens, and a romance. The heroine is an earth woman who somehow finds herself on an alien planet. She slowly returns to a normal mental state to find herself in some sort of mental institution, not as a patient, but as a worker! She soon realizes that the man she is caring for is being drugged against his will and decides to save him. From that point on she becomes entangled in the political intrigues of the planet she is on and will come to play a pivotal role in the salvation of the planet, both from dangers within and from space!"},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"\\"Restoree\\" is no literary masterpiece, but it's still great fun to read. It's the kind of book to curl up with when you want something relatively mindless but comforting and not too trashy. It's not McCaffery's strongest, but it's my favorite. The SF elements are a bit dated in concept and the characters are not too deep, but it all work wells in combination with the romance. The ugly duckling-to-swan motif is one that rings a lot of bells. The thought of waking up as a better version of yourself, saving the day, and in the process snagging the hero always has appeal."},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"Fans of Pern should be interested to read this early McCaffrey, published in 1967.This book features the strong-minded heroine Sara, who finds herself suddenly on another planet with a new body and a big problem. Sara becomes involved in the politics and intrigues of her new environment. Her better nature and her fear for her new love overcome the risk that she faces as an illegal and dreaded Restoree.The book stands up well after all this time. McCaffrey is a talented writer and the book does not read as either dated or stilted. It may not be for everyone (I preferred Pern myself) but if you like the genre, it could well turn into a McCaffrey favorite. It should appeal to McCaffrey fans, fans of Science Fiction romance, and romance readers in general. Although there are some mild sexual situations, it is safe and probably very enjoyable reading for younger readers."},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"This is one of the first sci-fi romance/adventures, with Sara being kidnapped by evil, man-eating aliens and carried away to a distant world where she finds adventure, love, AND a fabulous new body! This heroine is anything but weak, and guys, don't pass it up as a &quot;romance.&quot; There's plenty of action for you here too, with space battles and male characters who are definitely &quot;real men.&quot; Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"I really liked the Dragons of Pern series, and loved the Crystal Singer books, but none of them caught my attention like Restoree. I found myself absolutely unable to put the book down, even though it meant staying up into the wee hours of the morning. I read it again in the same week, which is unheard of for me. If you like McCaffrey, you'll love this."},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"I love this book. A new alien world, a homely librarian who is transformed into the widely admired and beautiful girlfriend of a world leader, a little romance, a happy ending, what more is there to ask for? No deep thinking or surprises in this romantic &quot;formula&quot; book with a sci-fi twist, just kick back and enjoy. I've re-read this book several times, most recently aloud to my 15 year old daughter, who also loved it. However, I suspect it could be catagorized as a &quot;woman's&quot; book, guys might not like it as well. My husband says &quot;too much feelings, not enough blood and guts!&quot;"},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"This was one of the first Anne McCaffrey books I ever read. Humorous, intriguing, well written, RESTOREE covers the story of Sara, a less than perfect young woman who suddenly finds herself whisked off of Earth and transported by the Mil for their own dark uses. Sara comes out of deep shock much later to discover, much to her surprise, that she is not the patient, but an attendant TO a patient. Overhearing a suspicious conversation about Lord Harlan, the man to whom she was assigned, Sara comes to realize that she has not only been dropped into the middle of a major mystery, but she's on another Planet altogether!What follows is a great Sci-Fi Fantasy adventure, complete with a bit of romance."},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"This is one of three books that a wonderful couple lent me in 1981 (as I was sick in bed with pneumonia in Bicester England). The other two were Terry Brooks break out novel \\"The Sword of Shanara\\", and CJ Cherryh's the \\"Pride of Channur\\". This was my first foray into fictional literature for fun since Jr. High School. If you have read any of these three books, you will understand why that illness changed my life forever.These three books are so well written that I had no choice but to fall in love with reading and start a tradition of averaging one book per week ever since.Restoree, is Sci-Fi, but be advised it is mostly romance... However, this isn't sappy romance; it is thoughtful romance with a very strong female protagonist.If you aren't familiar with Anne McCaffrey, Restoree is a very good place to start, (then go to The Ship Who Sang, The Crystal Singer series and of course the Dragonrider books (which were more hit and miss with me, but overall an excellent series).So here's the deal, good books can change your life, and this is a pretty darn good book!"},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"This was a great start to Anne McCaffrey's writing career. It hooked me from the very first. The reviewer who thought it laughable that Sarah learned the language in 6 months was very wrong. You can actually learn any language in less than that time by total immersion. This remains one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Restoree","review":"Anne McCaffrey is legendary in the field of Science Fiction and Fantasy. This novel, which she wrote in rebellion to all the insipid female characters she read in Sci-Fi at the time, is excellent. So, I ask, why has it never been released in hardcover in the US?All Laurell K. Hamilton's early books are being re-released in hardcover first editions. Even McCaffrey's \\"To Ride Pegasus\\" got the hardcover treatment years after it was initially released in paperback.

Many patients who suffer with intractable pain -- whether from AIDS or scoliosis -- will find it heartening and hope-inspiring. It clears up preconceptions and myths which are ubiquitous and extremely damaging to patients. It tackles head- on one of the oft-voiced Gut Fears in Prescribing, that of &quot;turning the patient into an addict.&quot; Concisely yet comprehensively, it pioneers largely uncharted territory ranging from pain that is never adequately treated becaused it is classified as &quot;nonmalignant&quot; to that old bugaboo, &quot;substance abuse.&quot; (A major point made under the latter heading is that people with substance abuse problems or drug dependency can still suffer pain!)While providing a high-level discussion of the many different options available to clinicians treating pain, this volume is especially stellar in its treatment of narcotic therapy for chronic pain. Along the way, it answers questions that may never have been asked but should have been, such as &quot;Why does my patient who says he's in pain look as if he isn't feeling anything?&quot; (Answer: This is a hallmark of chronic pain, the chronic suppression of reactivity to pain.)This volume is not a pharmacology treatise wafting about in the theoretical realms of academia. It is a report from the trenches. It tells real people how to deal with real pain, whether they are parents of toddlers or friends of seniors; whether they are health professionals, sufferers of pain, or both. Don't miss this one! -- It is a pragmagtically useful, exceptionally informative, all-round wonderful book."},{"Title":"Handbook for Pain Management, 1e","review":"Following an accident I suffered a spinal injury. The pain was profound and incapacitating such that suicide was actually an option. Although I went to \\"world class\\" pain physicians they offered little explanations or assistance and even less of the most important medication - hope. After years of experimenting on myself I came across this little miracle of a book. Not only was it the FIRST time I did not feel alone in my plight - but it was also the first time that I read/heard MY issues and options! The anguish over being \\"addicted\\" to pain medication further drove me to considering suicide. But this little book helped me see past the insanity of this logic to understand that chronic pain is just a chronic illness; like many others such a liver, heart or kidney issues that require regular mediations to manage the condition. My life turned around, I have one now. If you are in a similar situation get this book and keep it. And know there is no shame in having chronic pain, only in failing to find a way to live with it and live well. It is no surprise that a nurse wrote this book - I have found too many doctors have never suffered and don't comprehend what their patients truly need and don't take the time to research and find out. These authors did the research, took the time and have created a book that should be required reading for ALL in the medical field as well as those of us that need help to understand the condition and get our lives back!"},{"Title":"Hill Smoke","review":"What I enjoyed most about Hill Smoke is LP Holmes writing style. His heroes are noble and single minded, his youths are innocent, his old men wise, etc. This is the classic style of the action hero that we know and love, which reminded me of first Robert E. Howard, and also Edgar Rice Burroughs. It is also worth noting that this book is suitable to recommend to young readers. It is infused with respect for elders, law abidingness, and hope for a better world.There is a hint of romance but nothing less chaste than a stolen kiss, and while there are several fist fights, and shootings they are clearly described as the kind of actions either carried out by evil men, or to resist the same.Over all, highly recommended."},{"Title":"101 Things You Can Teach Your Kids about Baseball, 2nd Ed.","review":"101 Things is one of the better baseball books I have come across. It is obvious that Marsh knows baseball, and he presents information clearly. I also like the tone of the book -- although he discusses some of the fine points of the game, he doesn't get too technical, or talk down to the reader.The book has sections for different parts of the game (pitching, hitting, bunting/baserunning, etc). Each section then consists of one paragraph tips, with each tip rated as beginner, intermediate, or advanced. The drills are clearly labeled and placed next to the appropriate tip.Marsh writes at the end of each chapter, &quot;remember, it's only a game...&quot; But the game is much more enjoyable when coaches and players know what's going on. No one book can teach someone how to coach or play baseball, but this book certainly helps a lot."},{"Title":"101 Things You Can Teach Your Kids about Baseball, 2nd Ed.","review":"This is the first book of its type I've bought.

Buy this book and I'll see you in the playoffs!"},{"Title":"How to create a proposal that a foundation or corporation will fund","review":"I have been fortunate enough to share a love of baseball and a particular interest in the Mets and the Red Sox with Roger Angell, though I've not followed him into his current infatuation with the Yankees. As a result, I've not only read all of his books, his name is also one of the few whose appearance in The New Yorker's Table of Contents suffices by itself to get me to buy the magazine.Since 1962, which was fortuitously the inaugural year of the Mets, Mr. Angell has written several baseball essays a year for The New Yorker. There's always one on Spring Training and one on the World Series, then a couple of mid-season updates. The earliest pieces, covering the years 1962 to 1972, were collected in The Summer Game (1973). Subsequent five year chunks appeared in Five Seasons (1978), Late Innings (1982), and Season Ticket (1988), then came Once More Around the Park (1991), which mostly reprinted selections from those prior volumes, all of which are, disgracefully, out of print.Baseball has attracted an extravagantly talented assortment of writers but no one has ever written more beautifully about the intricacies and every day charms of the game than Angell, nor captured the idiosyncrasies of individual players in greater detail. It's impossible to match his prose, so let's allow him to speak for himself :* Any baseball is beautiful. No other small package comes as close to the ideal in design and utility. It is a perfect object for a man's hand. Pick it up and it instantly suggests its purpose: it is meant to be thrown a considerable distance-thrown hard and with precision. Its feel and heft are the beginning of the sport's critical dimensions; if it were a fraction of an inch larger or smaller, a few centigrams heavier or lighter, the game of baseball would be utterly different. Hold a baseball in your hand ... Feel the ball, turn it over in your hand; hold it across the seam or the other way, with the seam just to the side of your middle finger. Speculation stirs. You want to get outdoors and throw this spare and sensual object to somebody or, at the very least, watch somebody else throw it. The game has begun. -&quot;On the Ball&quot;, Five Seasons* Baseball's clock ticks inwardly and silently, and a man absorbed in a ball game is caught in a slow, green place of removal and concentration and in a tension that is screwed up slowly and ever more tightly with each pitcher's windup and with the almost imperceptible forward lean and little half-step with which the fielders accompany each pitch... Any persistent effort to destroy this unique phenomenon, to &quot;use up&quot; baseball's time with planned distractions, will in fact transform the sport into another mere entertainment and thus hasten its descent to the status of a boring and stylized curiosity. -The Summer Game* Since baseball time is measured only in outs, all you have to do is succeed utterly; keep hitting, keep the rally alive, and you have defeated time. You remain forever young. -&quot;The Interior Stadium&quot;, The Summer Game* The box score, being modestly arcane, is a matter of intense indifference, if not irritation, to the non-fan. To the baseball-bitten, it is not only informative, pictorial, and gossipy but lovely in aesthetic structure. It represents happenstance and physical flight exactly translated into figures and history. Its totals - batters' credit vs. pitchers' debit - balance as exactly as those in an accountant's ledger. And a box score is more than a capsule archive. It is a precisely etched miniature of the sport itself, for baseball, in spite of its grassy spaciousness and apparent unpredictability, is the most intensely and satisfyingly mathematical of all our outdoor sports. Every player in every game is subjected to a cold and ceaseless accounting; no ball is thrown and no base is gained without an instant responding judgment - ball or strike, hit or error, yea or nay - and an ensuing statistic. This encompassing neatness permits the baseball fan, aided by experience and memory, to extract from a box score the same joy, the same hallucinatory reality, that pickles the scalp of a musician when he glances at a page of his score of Don Giovanni and actually hears bassos and sopranos, woodwinds and violins. -&quot;Box Scores&quot;, The Summer Game* This is a linear sport. Something happens and then something else happens, and then the next man comes up and digs in at the plate. Here's the pitch, and here, after a pause, is the next. There's time to write it down in your scorecard or notebook, and then perhaps to look about and reflect on what's starting to happen out there now. It's not much like the swirl and blur of hockey and basketball, or the highway crashes of the NFL.Baseball is the writer's game, and its train of thought, we come to sense, is a shuttle, carrying us constantly forward to the next pitch or inning, or the sudden double into the left-field corner, but we keep hold of the other half of our ticket, for the return trip on the same line. We anticipate happily, and, coming home, reenter an old landscape brightened with fresh colors. Baseball games and plays and mannerisms-the angle of a cap-fade stubbornly and come to mind unbidden, putting us back in some particular park on that special October afternoon or June evening. The players are as young as ever, and we, perhaps not entirely old. -Once More Around the Park* There are baseball fans, it must be admitted, who don't like Tim McCarver's stuff. After they've listened to the celebrated baseball analyst working another World Series game, say, or a Fox Saturday Baseball Game of the Week, or a WNYW Yankees game, with Bobby Murcer, or, before that for many years, a Mets yawner or triumph with Ralph Kiner as sidekick, certain friends of mine have found fault. A few of them sound apologetic about it, as if they have failed Tim somehow; others plain can't stand him. Because I don't understand any of this, I have been at pains to listen to their whinings, which can be easily summarized: Tim McCarver likes to talk. He laughs and enjoys himself at ballgames. He makes jokes -- puns, even. He uses fancy words. He's excitable -- he gets carried away by the baseball. He's always going on and on about some little thing. He thinks he knows how the game should be played. He knows too much. -&quot;The Bard in the Booth&quot;, The New Yorker, September 6, 1999There are of course those philistines who dislike baseball, and even baseball fans who simply dislike this kind of myth-tinged writing about the game. For the rest of us, the essays of Roger Angell are a must.We've had a particularly tough winter here in New England--as I write, it is March 31st and we just got another foot of snow. But pick up any one of Roger Angell's books, turn to just about any one of his essays (though you might want to avoid a few of those in Late Innings, when he got caught up in the hysteria over rising salaries and free agency), read one of his descriptions of a play or a player and he effortlessly transports you into that Interior Stadium. There are really only two sports that live on in our minds : golf and baseball. In fact, many years ago I learned a trick to help you get to sleep if you're having trouble--as you lay abed, either play eighteen holes at your favorite course or figure out how you would pitch to your favorite team for nine innings. It's no coincidence that these two sports, which have lent themselves to most of the truly great literature of sport, are the two which can be summoned thus in the imagination.Roger Angell's writing is so evocative, it too seems to tap into your store of memories,--of players, plays, and games--enabling you to visualize most of the scenes he writes about. Writing in general, and sports writing in particular, just doesn't get any better than this.GRADE : A+"},{"Title":"How to create a proposal that a foundation or corporation will fund","review":"I'm only half-joking with my title for this review, but I think that speaks to the loyalty and intensity with which baseball fans follow their sport and favorite teams. That said, I say God bless Roger Angell for his insightful writings about the greatest of games. This book is an awesome and vital collection of essays, articles and stories that go beyond simple retelling of the games and innings and moments that are only the most visible aspects of the game. As a lifetime baseball fan, Angell puts into words ideas that I can only feel -- thoughts like, and I paraphrase because I've already lent the book out, &quot;Baseball is cumulative. It rewards the stayer.&quot; I think Angell is at his best when he waxes poetic as opposed to explaining pitching or catching mechanics, but even his lesser essays shine a light on the game that most baseball fans don't have access to on their own. There's only one other baseball collection which I think eclipses this one, and that is &quot;A Great and Glorious Game&quot; by Bart Giamatti, the former Commissioner and academic. Not surprisingly, Angell also recognized Giamatti's genius, and wrote about it while Giamatti was still alive and acting as President of the National League. The story is one of my favotites in this collection. This book is a gem, and even when he writes specifically about his love of the Mets or Sox, I know it's from a true fan of the game and appreciate how important the game is to him, and, in turn, to me."},{"Title":"How to create a proposal that a foundation or corporation will fund","review":"Baseball fans either get Roger Angell or don't. For some, he's too high-brow, looking down from his tweedy New Yorker perch writing long sentences about the Homeric aspects of Reggie or Yaz. For others, like me, he's an absorbing delight because of how well his writing fits a sport encompassing both speed and contemplation.Published in 1991, \\"Once More Around The Park\\" captures Angell in some of his best moments from the 1960s through the 1980s, which was his own long career peak as a sportswriter. The worst you can say about \\"Once More\\" is its sometimes excerpted format dilutes Angell from the more concentrated form found in earlier classic Angell tomes like \\"The Summer Game\\". But watered-down Angell is better than no Angell at all.Angell can write straightforwardly enough, demonstrated by his account of the 1969 World Series, \\"Days And Nights With The Unbored\\". The New York Mets' improbable victory there was aided by three key Baltimore Oriole hitters being held to one homer, one RBI, and a .163 average, he notes, and his shorter than usual write-up (just 14 pages) captures losing manager Earl Weaver in a reflective moment: \\"You've got to throw the ball over the goddam plate and give the other man his chance. That's why baseball is the greatest game of them all.\\"But for Angell, stats and locker-room quotes are a small part of the total feast. In his classic essay on the 1975 World Series, \\"Agincourt And After\\", he captures little moments other beat writers miss in getting to what everyone still remembers from Game 6: Carlton Fisk's homer. \\"What can we say of it without seeming to diminish it by recapitulation or dull it with detail?\\" Angell sighs, yet his narrative proves you can actually add to the moment by dissecting choice elements leading up to it.Even better was his 1986 World Series wrap-up, \\"Not So, Boston\\". The title comes from a palindrome a friend thought up watching that Series's Game 6. Angell here doesn't just get into the play-by-play of the amazing postseason that year, but the atmosphere and culture around it, of traffic slowdowns and commuters sitting in airport terminals skipping their scheduled plane flights to see the Mets finish off the Houston Astros in 16 innings. Reading that essay pulled me right back to that, the happiest time of my baseball-watching life.Other essays collected here are not season overviews but feature-type pieces. Some focus on aspects of the game like the baseball itself, or the role of the catcher. Others spotlight individuals like Kansas City Royals reliever Dan Quisenberry or new National League president A. Bartlett Giamatti (a humanities scholar and former Yale president).Not all click. The Giamatti piece reads a bit smugly in parts, two eggheads discoursing upon their love for baseball's more elevated aesthetic ideals. One long essay Angell wrote during the 1981 baseball strike features a semipro pitcher and his wife talking about their love of baseball at its less-plush margins; it's fine in parts but goes on too long.The best essay here for me, looking beyond my Mets' prejudice, may be the one about Steve Blass, who enjoyed two terrific seasons with the Pittsburgh Pirates and then inexplicably fell apart. Angell examines Blass's problem from all angles, with Blass himself a willing subject for study. No conclusions are reached, but the big takeaway for me is just how amazingly tough it is not only to be good but last in baseball.Angell has done both for a long time. The best way to have him would be with all his original collections (this draws almost entirely from four of them, \\"The Summer Game\\", \\"Five Seasons\\", \\"Late Innings\\", and \\"Season Ticket\\") in unedited form. But until I get them together, I'll hold onto this."},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider: Three Short Novels","review":"An excellent book- well delivered. This was a part of my book club selections - and the price was right for me. A look at the effects of the influenza during WW I"},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider: Three Short Novels","review":"This book by Katherine Anne Porter, originally published in 1939, consists of three short novels, each about fifty pages long. Though the three pieces vary in style and subject matter, they are all of exceptional quality and admirably showcase Porter's estimable talent for crafting short fiction.In the first piece, \\"Old Mortality,\\" two young sisters grow up listening to the family stories told by their parents' and grandparents' generations, which over time develop into a sort of mythology. The most romanticized character in the family saga is the tragic figure of Aunt Amy, who, praised for her beauty and perfection yet criticized for her free spirit, suffered from tuberculosis and died at a young age. Though written in the third person, the novel is related through the eyes of Miranda, the younger of the two young girls. As she grows into womanhood, Miranda begins to understand that the reality of the past does not live up to the romanticized mythology she grew up with, and that family, beyond its sheltering comforts, has a dark side as well.The second novel, \\"Noon Wine,\\" takes place on a farm in southern Texas. Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, despite having two young children, are growing aged and infirm. They cannot keep up with the farm work as they used to. Salvation comes in the form of Mr. Helton, a stranger who shows up at their gate one day asking for work. Mr. Helton is a Swede from South Dakota, and a relentlessly hard worker. As a farmhand he is truly the answer to the Thompson's prayers. Yet, as most good things are too good to be true, the Thompsons soon begin to suspect that this laconic stranger may have some dark secrets in his mysterious past.The final piece, \\"Pale Horse, Pale Rider,\\" also stars a young woman named Miranda, whom we can assume is the same girl from the first piece, though it's never explicitly stated. Now 24, alone and independent, she works as a theatre critic for a newspaper in a western \\"hick town,\\" which sounds a lot like Denver. Miranda falls in love with a soldier who will soon depart for the European battlefields of World War I. She despises the war and the jingoism that accompanies it, and dreads the day when her new love will depart for his inevitable doom. War is not the only manifestation of death that looms ominously on Miranda's horizon, however, as an influenza epidemic also rages through the city.My personal taste in literature usually leans toward more antiquated works of romantic, realist, and naturalist stylings, but as far as the literature between the World Wars is concerned, Porter is clearly the best of the American modernists. She utilizes the linguistic experimentation and psychological probity characteristic of modernism to her advantage, without indulging in the gratuitous verbal games to which so many of her contemporaries succumbed. Her writing straddles the line between the naturalism of Theodore Dreiser and the modernism of William Faulkner, combining the best characteristics of both while dispensing with their faults. \\"Noon Wine,\\" which is primarily a naturalistic piece, is the strongest work in the book, while the more abstract \\"Pale Horse, Pale Rider,\\" is the weakest. At times it seems the main purpose of the latter piece is for Porter to demonstrate her prowess at depicting surrealistic, influenza-induced hallucinations. Nevertheless, all three novels are very strong works of literature and will appeal to readers of all stripes who appreciate writing that's both proficient and profound."},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider: Three Short Novels","review":"Few authors can deliver the ethereal feeling of sleep, dream, malaise or other seemingly other worldly moments of consciousness. This author is a master. I would even place her with today's grandmaster of such writing - Haruki Murakami. My feelings are not alone - \\"Many of Katherine Anne Porter's stories are unsurpassed in modern fiction.\\" Robert Penn Warren.In this book of three short stories, the first is the weakest, and the last in the strongest. The first is written in the perspective of a young woman who revered an aunt but discovers the \\"good looking aunt'\\" may have been a less delicate or beautiful character. This story is more about the writing than the story - and though it may be the weakest, it well surpasses the average story in American literature.The second is a classic men's perspective of mid-western perspective with an overlay of classic Greek tragedy. The story delivers the innocent and good to the worst of all worlds: murder - or is it? The bad also are hurt, but the living and good people are more affected. The simplistic dialogue and salt of the earth personalities remind me of Faulkner.The last story, from which the novel gets it title, returns to the female narrator whose woozy self, created by illness, transfers in and out of consciousness, while struggling with her job, the world's war, and her relationship with a man about to go off to war. Like all of the stories, it too involves a tragic ending, but this book seems to have a little hope - there is some light at the end of its tunnel.I feel a Toni Morrison style in this writing - some discussion of the otherworldly touching the living, and closing other concepts with spiritual verses of songs or prayer.These stories hug you and give you goose bumps. You may weep and mourn but do so in sympathy.In this short review, I have likened this author to Murakami, Faulkner, and Morrison - and showed devout admiration by Warren - need I say more?"},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider: Three Short Novels","review":"With these three, very different stories Porter fully emerged onto the American literary scene in the 1930s, having scored a success previously with \\"The Flowering Judas Tree and other stories\\". Though the book has only the three sections, they are so separate as to warrant separate reviews. Only one character, Miranda, appears in two stories. She is probably Porter's alter ego, though I am not so familiar with the details. All the stories deal with Death in some manner, Love plays a strong role in the third, and to some extent, maybe tangentially, in the first.OLD MORTALITY explores how the influence of a dead family members can extend far beyond the dates of death; the sagas of their loves and lives touching the children of following generations. I found this tale of a proper Southern family harder to \`get into' than the others, but very persuasive once absorbed. While not much about race, it certainly deals with social class and decadence, in a certain Southern literary tradition.I liked the second story, NOON WINE, the best, a portrayal of a hard-working, tight-lipped Swedish-American workman from North Dakota who turns up on a hardscrabble Texas farm and stays working there for years. He slowly becomes a family member, bringing the farm to a semblance of prosperity, but never reveals his past. His only recreation is to play on a set of harmonicas; he knows but a single old Swedish song about people who drink before noon. A final twist of the tale brings death and loss of reputation.The last offering, PALE HORSE, PALE RIDER, is a love story set during World War I and the influenza epidemic that swept the world then. Porter herself nearly died in Denver (scene of this story) of the same disease, so even though all the stories are drawn from her experience, this one must be the closest. We might describe PH,PR as a race between Love and Death, as Miranda fades into illness, cared for by a handsome soldier with whom she's in love. He goes off, preparing to go to Europe, she's hospitalized. The end is not what you'd think. Or maybe, it's precisely what you'd think if you find death romantic.All three stories are excellent, with strong color and description, subtle changes in character and mood, interesting transformations; well-worth reading despite their age. Porter was no doubt one of the best writers working between 1935-1965 though she seems to have faded from the pantheon at the moment."},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider: Three Short Novels","review":"Have just finished Old MOrtality portion of this book. The way porter goes @ language, a bull w/ her head, hooking @ hoping to gore us something...It is admirable. Also a Texan &amp; have not heard of her. Even if you've never been to the state, she is that rich link to the region and to humanity in general that many of the southern writers are. When you read Eudora Welty, you get distinct pictures of humans and what it is they do and think and feel during their days. Porter does it, too. She doesn't go for hard contrasts like Flannery O'Connor, but has a simple workmens' ethic to her language. (John Gardner is recalled by this.) I can care less about the topic of the first story...it's just that porter makes you want to know because she nails down for us a real world inhabited by real people. Amen, folks."},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider: Three Short Novels","review":"previously read first part of this book and it was great..Second part also excellent. Mr Helton, the farmer's dilemna, the stranger were all rendered cleanly...thought ending dragged wee bit on 2nd part, but still a strong one..I wondered what would happen to the people while reading it without being jerked by the writer to feel by dishonest means this way or that. (You know, some writers want sadness so throw a dead puppy or a crippled child into the mix w/out creating a real character. just for the sake of wringing a feeling out of us by this foul means.) Porter never resorted to a trick in this story except that its overlong ending may have detracted just a bit. Just a bit.The 3rd story felt dishonest. I admit it's hard to portray illness dramatically...well, ok the russians did it with one day in the life of what's-his-name. But porter doesn't do it here. And while she did give us this and that metaphor to give our senses something to react to and make it all less abstract..the way she piled one top of another hurt the overall story. It made it seem dishonest. It smelled of 'how do i make this story longer?' desperation. A shorter illness of miranda would've helped. The fin de siecle feeling of a war..she evoked it, but then seemed unsure of where to go from there. As a short story it might've been better.POrter is a good writer..but you can skip the third part of the book and leave liking her better for it."},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider: Three Short Novels","review":"Katherine Anne Porter displays the human experience with turns of phrase that catch your breath. The awkward spinster cousin blooms &quot;like a dry little plant set out in a gentle rain&quot; when her critical mother leaves the room. A woman delirious with influenza falls into a sleep &quot;that was not sleep but clear evening light in a small green wood...&quot;I thought Flannery O'Connor had ruined all other southern short fiction writers for me, but Porter meets O'Connor's deft character portraits, with their keen knowledge of mannerisms and their psychological depth, as well as O'Connor's ability to surprise the reader with moments of recognition: Miranda's girlhood experience feels like my girlhood experience, across generations and geography. Even Mr. Thompson's story feels like it could have happened in one's own family, like the story grandparents and great aunts and uncles half-tell and subtly refer to while the turkey roasts in the oven and everyone steals nuts off the pecan pie.I agree with others who are astonished that this book is not part of the literary canon in the U.S. It is a stunning, gorgeous example of short fiction. With the impenetrable heaps of &quot;literary fiction&quot; from contemporary writers, marketed to ridiculous heights, I'm finding old gems like this one soothing to my constantly inundated reader's mind. Read it. And writers, take note."},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider: Three Short Novels","review":"I first read this book about thirty-five years ago, as a young teenager. At the time, I didn't really know what it was about, lacking the historical background to understand World War I, and having no knowledge whatsoever of the widespread influenza epidemic of 1918. Nevertheless, the memory of Porter's shimmering prose somehow stayed with me, leading me to read the story once again, this time as an adult, and to finally comprehend it better. In fact, I have reread it several times over the years, always profoundly moved by the experience. Recently, after the events of September 11, 2001, I found myself thinking again of the story, and hauled it out of the library for still another reading. It is more beautiful and meaningful than ever. It has the powerful force of deeply felt, true experience."},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider: Three Short Novels","review":"I think the author that Katherine Anne Porter is most often compared to is Thomas Mann. Both wrote their best known work in the novella form and both use a highly distilled prose which is rich in symbols. Death in Venice and Pale Horse Pale Rider(both dealing with plagues of some sort) are two of the best novellas you are likely to come across, both appear in most novella collections(even though Porter didn't much care for that word). Porter evokes another author though as well, Mary Shelley, in Pale Horse Pale Rider. Being a male reader who doesn't read a lot of female authors I am always struck by something in authors like Dickinson and Woolf and Porter and Plath which is that distanced perspective, the writing seeming to come from somewhere outside of life, real life being only a memory. This may be a personal point of view only but in Pale Horse the main character Miranda, even before the epidemic hits, seems the perfect example of this phenomenon as she seems not to very much want to participate in the life around her. She may be tempted into something resembling life by her lover Adam but still she seems to be sleepwalking. So it is not all that surprising that when death does enter her chamber so to speak it is received as not an altogether unwelcome guest. Miranda's dream or vision is so well written and the pace of it so well sustained throughout that you feel you have accompanied her through it. One of those sequences you never quite forget. The coming to life again segment(Shelley)is also quite astonishing and strangely, eerily beautiful. The other two tales are good too but this is the one you will remember. There are many great romantic and symbolist(especially) paintings that you will feel you understand or have a strange communion with after having read this."},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider: Three Short Novels","review":"Katherine Anne Porter writes like a lapidary; each sentence is like a polished jewel, every word is perfect. &quot;Pale Horse, Pale Rider&quot; is a compilation of three novellas: &quot;Old Mortality&quot;, seen through the eyes of Maria and Miranda Rhea, two children home for the weekend from their stultifying boarding school, is the tale of the family black sheep, a beautiful young cousin of easy virtue who continues to fascinate and frustrate her extended family long after her early death; &quot;Noon Wine&quot; shows us a Texas family torn apart by the guilt of the father who murdered a man in what may or may not have been self-defense, and &quot;Pale Horse, Pale Rider&quot; brings Miranda back again as a young woman disillusioned too many times, whose relationship with her lover Adam is threatened not only by his impending entry in to combat in World War One, but even more immediately by the specter of the great flu epidemic of 1918 that is sweeping through the population, leaving more death in its wake than any war ever fought. Porter writes sparingly, but she packs a world of emotion and feeling into every paragraph. This relatively short book is one of the giants of American fiction."},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider: Three Short Novels","review":"This book clearly deserves more than five stars.Pale Horse, Pale Rider is one of the finest American novels of all time. Long before nonfiction books about dying and coming back to life became popular, Katherine Anne Porter wrote this brilliant story about life and death during the influenza epidemic near the end of World War I. Unlike any other book I have read on this subject, she successfully captures the perspective of the beauty of death eclipsing the beauty of life. The book further develops this theme to explain how our perspective shifts back towards favoring life, as the memory of death retreats.Like all great novels, this one transcends its obvious theme into a broader one -- the meaning of the inevitable death that ends each of our lives . . . and what life means in this context. One of the fascinating plot complications that she uses in this book is showing how &quot;duty&quot; to life usually means increasing the likelihood of death. As a result, you see death more visibly in front of you through this book than you ever will in every day life.The story begins with a young woman reporter who is concerned over the chance of losing her job because she has refused to buy a Liberty Bond. She feels she cannot afford it, and she doesn't want to buy one any way. The reason she cannot afford one is due to have been demoted for refusing to write a story about a young woman that another paper ran. As she races from social event to social event, while scribbling her short columns in between, she longs for a personal life and a future. She is attracted to a young man in the Army who is awaiting shipment abroad. She knows this relationship is hopeless. He will be gone in a few days. Also, on the front, people with his job of clearing mines usually die quickly. Against this potential for romance is an influenza epidemic that is taking many lives. Our heroine finds herself feeling a little under the weather. What happens next is described in some of the greatest writing about illness since Marcel Proust's Remembrance of Things Past.This is quite a short novel, so you can read it quickly. I suggest doing it in one sitting, if possible. In that way, the cadence of the inner voices of this story's progression will have a much stronger effect on you. I do recommend reading this on a weekend, though, early in the day. You might not sleep too well if you wait until late at night.After you have finished reading this novel, I suggest that you consider how you view death. Consider the event from several perspectives: emotional, intellectual, as an ending, and as a beginning. Also, look at other peoples' deaths as well as your own. If you do this carefully, I think you will see new perspectives that will be helpful to you.I remember how surprised I was when I first met people who saw death as an opportunity to happily celebrate the life of one of their friends. When I thought about my own reaction to that, I realized that I needed to spend some time thinking more about death. The results were very worthwhile for me. I hope they will be for you, as well.See beauty in all the light around you!"},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider: Three Short Novels","review":"In PALE HORSE, PALE RIDER, Katherine Anne Porter creates a world of two universes; one contains the semi-autobiographical life of Porter's alter-ego, Miranda, who is seen first as a very young girl in the first novella, \\"Old Mortality,\\" then later as an adult woman in the third entrant, \\"Pale Horse, Pale Rider.\\" The third novella is \\"Noon Wine,\\" which is linked to the other two in its focus on a protagonist whose choice of life is severely restricted by the need to conform to society's restrictions. In these three long short stories, Porter elaborates on themes and character types that had previously appeared in her short stories. Porter most often examines the innermost recesses of the human mind that cause her protagonists to encounter spiritual and physical isolation even as they attempt to reach out to end their disconnection. These attempts at finding a soul mate are at first rebuffed, but in their continual probing for like-minded life mates, they achieve a near Faulknerian level of endurance even as they fail.In \\"Old Mortality,\\" Porter becomes young Miranda, who has heard of the almost mythical attributes and deeds of her aunt Amy. In Miranda's mind, her aunt is the apotheosis of all that she herself could be. Porter suggests that much of the accepted myth of the American south is similarly grounded on a no questions asked basis. Later as Miranda matures, her growth is seen as both physical and spiritual, but her sphere of newly-won perceptive vision comes at a heavy cost. She learns what happens when brute reality collides with delicate myth. In the second part, Miranda meets the husband-lover of Amy, whose appearance, actions, and words disrupt her connection to the past. This disconnect is deliberately shaded so that the reader is not quite sure whether Porter intends a discrediting of the past or merely a modifying of its accepted interpretation. In the third part, Miranda is further distanced from her idealized view of Amy when she talks to her cousin Eva, who has a definite grudge against Amy, the result of which leaves Miranda feeling that the immortality of myth is itself a myth. Stories and legends then must be measured against the mortality of those who lived them and those who told of them.In \\"Noon Wine,\\" Porter tells of a tragedy that begins in the past, assumes a myth that becomes self-sustaining, then encounters a reality that causes pain for all concerned. A Texas farmer named Thompson hires a roustabout Olaf Helton as a field hand. Helton works hard, well, and uncomplainingly. Thompson is more than pleased with Helton but is puzzled by Helton's harmonica, upon which he never plays more than one single tune. One day, a bounty hunter appears with a tale that disrupts Thompson's idyllic view of Helton. The bounty hunter, Homer Hatch, tells Thompson that Helton is an escapee from a lunatic asylum where he was committed for murder. Thompson ironically and unwittingly kills Hatch to protect Helton, an act for which he is tried and exonerated in court. The trial is so devastating to Thompson that he kills himself in depression. Both Thompson and Miranda are faced with disruptive reminders from the past, and the results cause pain to them and their families.In \\"Pale Horse, Pale Rider,\\" Porter brings back Miranda as an adult newspaperwoman during the First World War. She falls in love with Adam Barclay an army officer that brings to mind the ill-fated romance between Amy and Gabriel. Both lovers are stricken with the flu epidemic and Adam dies, leaving Miranda grief-ridden. The best Miranda can hope for is to reestablish her spiritual center in a world that is hostile to her very attempt. In all three novellas, Porter precisely captures the essence of those who face moments of crises when they begin to see that the ground underneath their feet is not as solid as once believed."},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider: Three Short Novels","review":"I was unfamiliar with Katherine Anne Porter before reading this book and am now glad I picked it up. Porter has an amazing way with words and with characterization. With only a few sentences you feel as if you know the people in her stories. This book contains 3 short novels of which I think Pale Horse, Pale Rider is the best. Miranda is a young woman working at a newspaper during the last year of the first world war and of the tragic flu epidemic which killed millions. She goes from show to show every evening writing reviews for the paper, never sure why she bothers. She is alive, but not living. She dines and dances with a soldier she loves but knows the relationship is pointless as he is being shipped overseas in a few days. Then she contracts the flu and the end is a harrowing description of the effects of the disease.Noon Wine is the second strongest in my opinion, detailing a small Texas family dealing with the aftermath of the father murdering a man. It may have been in self defense, but it might not have been, you are left with the question and the family is left with the guilt and shame.Old Mortality tells of the sad life of Gabriel through the eyes of his two young nieces. The woman he loves puts him off for a lengthy time while flirting with other men. Finally, though she doesn't love him, marries him and dies 6 weeks later. Gabriel never completely recovers.These novels are beautiful and sad, filled with complex characters trying to get through each day while figuring out why they are doing it."},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider: Three Short Novels","review":"By the time I came along, Katherine Anne Porter was known as the author of the blockbuster SHIP OF FOOLS, the inspiration for the blockbuster movie of the same name. She was pop, or so I presumed, never having read the book or seen the movie. After reading PALE HORSE, PALE RIDER, I realize I was missing out on a lot by dismissing her as such. This book is a perfect trio of novellas, each crafted from a tradition that emphasized the classic architecture of fiction--plot, character, voice, dialogue, setting, title, symbolism, theme and, especially, vision.All three stories were historic fiction when Porter published them in the 1930s. She is looking back on the visitable past, the remains of the 19th century as they pressed upon the earliest years of the 20th. The first story, \\"Old Mortality,\\" explores the weight of a family legend upon an extended family, especially one little girl. The next, \\"Noon Wine,\\" visits a poor Texas farmer who hires a mysterious, harmonica playing stranger, a Swede from the north, who quietly saves the farm, only to be outed years later by a bounty hunter as an escaped mental patient. The last, the title story of the collection, returns to the young girl of \\"Old Mortality,\\" now a young career woman who witnesses the homefront of World War I and the killer flu of 1918. Porter nails the era, the South, the nation and all of humanity in stories that build and explode in ways that postmodern fiction never does. Each is a stand alone story but they sing to one another and make the experience of reading one after the other that much more satisfying. Porter makes the attention to character, to detail, to the expression of creative vision seem effortless.To say more is to spoil the experience of reading this volume. Go for it."},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider: Three Short Novels","review":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider is the collection of Katherine Anne Porter's three short novels that was first published in 1939, offering three pieces of fiction that very much helped to make and secure Porter's reputation as one of this country's best short fiction writers. Calling these pieces \\"short novels\\" may be a bit of a stretch for most readers, however, and it may be more appropriate to look at them as \\"long short stories.\\" After all, the book is only 150 pages in length.Porter herself weighed in on the question and seems to have preferred the term \\"short novels\\" asking of readers and critics, \\"please do not call my short novels Novelettes, or even worse, Novellas. Novelette is classical usage for a trivial, dime-novel sort of thing; Novella is a slack, boneless, affected word that we do not need to describe anything. Please call my books by their right names...\\" However we choose to categorize these stories, it is easy to see why they are still being read today, almost seventy years after they were first published, and why they solidify Porter's reputation.The first and last stories in Pale Horse, Pale Rider share a main character, Miranda, who is portrayed in \\"Old Mortality,\\" the first story, as a child growing up in the shadows of her almost legendary Aunt Amy, a beauty who died young but still seems to be the family \\"star.\\" Miranda and her sister spend much of their childhood trying to unravel the legend of their aunt's life and to make some sense of all the family personalities involved in her history, including that of their own father. As is always the real strength of Porter's fiction, this story is filled with interesting characters and astute observations about the dynamics of family life.The book's last story, \\"Pale Horse, Pale Rider,\\" centers again on Miranda, now a young newspaper columnist struggling to make a living completely on her own during the trying times of World War I. Porter captures the home front atmosphere well, including the often overzealous characters who tried to shame their fellow citizens into buying war bonds they could not always afford and the friction between the young men still at home and the women who had been left behind by their own soldier husbands, sons and boy friends. But her story centers on the flu epidemic that so devastated the world during the war years. Her description of the surreal dreams and confusion Miranda experiences in her struggle to survive an attack of the flu is an intense, and sometimes tiring, experience for the reader.But it is the middle short novel, \\"Noon Wine,\\" that is my favorite. \\"Noon Wine\\" takes place on a tiny Texas farm between 1896 and 1905. As the story opens, the farm is going nowhere and its owner resents the fact that his sickly wife has insisted upon expanding into the dairy business. Even on such a small scale, this lazy man is not at all happy with the daily requirements of tending to his milk cows. His savior arrives in the person of a foreign drifter willing to work for low wages while practically running the farm for its owner. Several years later when a stranger comes to the farm asking questions about the drifter, events suddenly go out of control to the extent that lives are changed forever. Nothing that happens is black and white and Porter does a remarkable job in presenting all the gray tones involved in the situation.Pale Horse, Pale Rider is an impressive collection that should not be missed by Katherine Anne Porter fans. At the very least, pick up a copy of the book long enough to read \\"Noon Wine.\\" You will be happy that you did."},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider: Three Short Novels","review":"this beautiful book impressed me greatly. it alone securely establishes katherine anne porter as one of the very best american prose writers of our century, in the company of faulkner, hemingway, o'connor, fitzgerald, west, and pynchon. this is american LITERATURE"},{"Title":"Faith Difference, The","review":"I teach 7th grade PSR, and I have searched for some time for a resource like this.

For Trina it brings tears - but for the reader, laughter.Trina's Boxcar is a warm old-fashioned story reavealing the need for patient understanding in language communication.TRINA'S BOXCAR is written out of Patricia Miles Martin's own experience as a teacher in a Wyoming town.Mrs. Martin writes: \\"Living in Wyoming furnished the remembering that served as a springboard for TRINA'S BOXCAR. That was a wonderful year, when I learned to know the children who lived in the boxcars - and the children who lived in the town.\\""},{"Title":"The Madman: His Parables and Poems","review":"Just a couple of dozen extremely short stories, some brilliant, some a bit odd.

In addition to writing this profound and inspiring poetry, he composed 12 other books of verses. However, none of these are as renown as THE PROPHET. In fact, many Americans who love THE PROPHET don't realize the existence of his other work. This is too bad.THE MADMAN was first published in 1918. Although written nearly 100 years ago, it remains timely. In addition, it was Gibran's first published verse. It went out of print several years ago, but has recently been made available. This book of verse is a real treasure. Of all Gilbran's writing, THE MADMAN is my favorite. In fact, I like it more than THE PROPHET. I found it thoughtful, insightful and most importantly self reflecting."},{"Title":"The Madman: His Parables and Poems","review":"This is a collection of short parables ranging in length from a single paragraph to a few pages. They are individualist in nature and center around a single soul's dealings with the world around it. Notions of truth and being are communicated in that soul's interactions with God, friends, neighbors, strangers, animals and itself. It is quite possibly the most perfect writing I have ever read.Fans of prose should enjoy Gibran's style immensely. I prefer it to the general colloquial style of writing and it is more expressive than similar styles of essay and short story writing. Gibran also has several other books, in addition to &quot;The Prophet,&quot; that are worthy of reading. I own &quot;The Madman,&quot;The Voice of the Master,&quot; and &quot;Sand and Foam.&quot; This one is my favorite. It is an astoundingly eloquent, but still clear and expressive collection of writing on the most fundamentally important of all topics.There are very few human beings capable of rivaling scripture in the emotions that their writings invoke. Kahlil Gibran was one of them."},{"Title":"The Madman: His Parables and Poems","review":"Like all Gibran's writings, The Madman puts the mind in a peaceful and tranquil state.The Madman is a collection of 35 short moral stories and poetry that tell the tale of an individual who had all his self-imposed illusions and artificial faces stripped from him, leaving him just with the truth of his life, his observations and his surroundings. It shows the irony of sanity and it's status as a social construct.This book is very short (only around 71 pages, depending on your edition) and can be read very quickly.

Not only do we learn more about the nature of the Ringworld itself and how the interference of many protagonists has changed (and almost destroyed) it, but we learn how the natives have changed as well. For me, this is the essence of science fiction, and it's a pleasure to watch a master at his craft.Nivin's writing, too, has changed over the last 35 years, which is hardly surprising, and his readers' tastes have undoubtedly changed, too. Larry has other, newer things to say today, and they're worth reading. You need not have read the previous three books, but might be a good idea; the Ringworld books tell a complex story, and if it's been a while since you've read them, it certainly wouldn't hurt to do a bit of review.Larry updates his slant on technology, but he does it in a way that weaves it into the previous books.

Like I asked at the top of this review. Larry, where have you been? The book is a fairly accurate glimpse into the Larry we grew to know and love in the first two books.

I would rather have not read this mediocre mess."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"So, so disappointing. After being totally obsessed with the first two Ringworld books, I was unbelievably disappointed by the third, but I was heartened by the mostly favorable reviews of Ringworld's Children. However, it was almost just as bad. In the introduction, Larry Niven says that at first he really didn't know what to do with the story, and you can tell. The plot is completely aimless with nothing at stake. I skimmed the second half just to see what happened in the end, which turned out to be one of the most ridiculous things I've ever read. I gave it two stars instead of one purely because it involves Louis Wu, the Hindmost, and the ringworld, which were still riding on the positive associations I had with them from the first two books.Niven once expressed that with such incredible powers like the stepping disks and the autodoc, there isn't enough at stake for a good story. So take the autodoc and stepping disks away if that's what you have to do! You're the freakin' writer! RRR!!I feel like Niven has no idea what he has--the incredible narrative potential of Ringworld. Personally, after The Ringworld Engineers, I wanted to hear about the making of the ringworld, or to see it in its glory days--and to stop having to read about Louis Wu's incessant sexcapades. Surely that would be an incredible saga of its own, but, in this book, when we finally hear about it, the entire story is covered in two or three pages. Apparently the crafting of this superstructure with the mass of Jupiter by the strongest, (almost?) most intelligent, violent and territorial beings in the universe was totally uninteresting and went off without a hitch. Now, personally, I really, really dislike the Protectors, and I wish that either they were a bit more admirable or it had turned out that the Outsiders had built the ringworld, and that the pinnacle of ringworld civilization was a bit more glorious, but that obviously would be too much to ask.Maybe Niven redeems himself (or Edward M. Lerner redeems the series) in Fate of Worlds, but I am--naturally!--skeptical, and almost don't even want to bother to find out."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"Continues the story of Louis Wu and the Ringworld. The plot gets overly complicated and if you haven't read the other Ringworld stories you'll be utterly lost. If, however you like the careful way Niven's universes are constructed and his style of story telling it's a pleasant read."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"This story was only part of a larger tale and assumes far to much back ground info that you would only have if you had already read the three other Ring world books."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"Ringworld's Children is a very well conceived, detailed and exciting addition to the Ringworld series that Larry Niven has created. There's a constant thread that keeps developing as one reads and lots of action that always makes sense - no matter how unexpected it might be.I find Niven a very good writer - better generally by himself than with others - but then. I'm reading Fate of Worlds - Return from the Ringworld and that novel, written with a co-writer, is also well put together and exciting.I thought Ringworld's Children was an excellent novel, and was hard to put down until I finished."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"The characters really just guess for the length of the book. There is no real development, and plausibility totally went out the window - which was such a strength of the original."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"It's been years since I've read a Niven book, but it was still as great as I remember. The characters, events, and locations are very memorable so you drop back into known space very quickly and pick up where you left off. The science remains right, which is always a Niven trademark. I can't wait to get started on \\"FLeet of Worlds\\"!"},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"Being a used book i expected it to be a little beat up, but it is almost new. what a great deal."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"After Ringworld Throne I had low expectations for this new Ringworld novel.In preperation I re-read the first 3 books, and they were still fresh in my mind when I picked up Ringworld's Children.I personally did not like Ringworld Throne anywhere near as much. I found the Ringworld natives generic and boring and hard to keep track of. Often I found myself not really caring what happened to them. Near the end of the book things started to pick up, and it does answer some important questions (while posing new ones). So even if just to learn what happens next it's worth it to fight your way through Ringworld Throne.Ringworld's Children goes a long way to fixing those problems.This time around the focus is back on Louis Wu, where it should be. As a result the book is far less schitzophrenic and a lot easier to understand (is it just me or was anyone else completely confused by Bram's origin story in Ringworld Throne?).A big Known Space fan (I have read almost all the stories, with the exception of the new short story included in the Crashlander collection) I really appreciated all the nods to previous books.Carlos Wu, the antimatter solar system, Nuetron Star, Protector and other stories are all tied together in this.It really does feel like Niven is wrapping things up, and when you see what happens at the end you'll understand it's pretty hard to top in terms of sheer scale.The book was a fun read. I thought the pacing was good. *Some* of the concepts introduced seemed somewhat forced, or not explored in enough detail. Like the extra convolutions to Teela's story. But they never really affected my enjoyment of the story.However something that bother me is Niven's ongoing habit of adding new slang whenever he writes a new story in a series.He did it in Engineers and in Throne, but it wasn't quite as intrusive as \\"LE\\" is. This whole \\"Legal Entity\\" thing came out of nowhere. No one said it in the other stories, even in Ringworld Throne which takes place the same year as Ringworld's Children.Similarly the term the Fringe War has no basis. No one used that term in Ringworld Throne, yet even as he's stepping out of the autodoc, not having spoken to anyone since the end of Throne, Louis contemplates the \\"Fringe War\\".For obvious reasons he needed to give a name to the growing conflict in the Ringworld solar system, but there are more elegant ways he could have introduced us to the term. Like how about Tunesmith uses it the first time he speaks with Louis after emerging from the autodoc and Louis asks him what it means.But that small gripe is not enough to ruin the book for me. The only other problem I had is the length. The story is relatively short. I'm not sure how short because my copies of the other Ringworld stories are paperback, but it feels shorter than the others, and it's dissapointing because when it really gets moving you don't want it to end.I might actually give it 3.5 stars if I had the choice, I'm not sure though. Somewhere in that range, 3.5-4 out of 5.Some might want to wait for the paperback though. And you should re-read Ringworld Throne at the very least, but re-reading all 3 would be best."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"If you're looking for brand-spanking-new sci-fi concepts this book isn't for you. If you're looking for some unforseen revelation in Niven's Known Space, this book isn't for you.Now, if you're looking for an entertaining foray into one of the more interesting classic sci-fi universes, with strong characters, and several surprises (not eye opening revelations, just surprises), this book is for you. Niven introduces some interesting new characters, and doesn't waste time on old ones who's stories have been told. He uses his invented technologies as plot-advancing devices. The book has a pace and urgency that wasn't present in Throne, and a clearer exposition than previous sequels, especially during the fast paced moments. Given his tendencies, we won't know for a while whether Niven plans on adding to the Ringworld epic, but if not, this brings satisfying closure to the important characters and to the ringworld itself."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"Maybe I'm being slightly generous with five stars but it's a pretty good read - the magnitude of Larry Niven's ideas never fails to be stunning. And known space continues to expand with the very fine stories of the Man-Kzin Wars, some by other writers with Larry's permission. I'd recommend reading Ringworld and the Man-Kzin Wars before this if you haven't done so already. It's a fine universe to lose yourself in!I'll not give the plot away, but its fast, highly-visualised and imaginative action such as we've come to expect from the Master!"},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"I didn't see the disjointedness that some other reviewers are claiming, I felt the book had a healthy, mostly linear pathway from beginning to end. I wouldn't place it with my favorite Niven books, but I definitely enjoyed it and felt the ending made a great finale to the Ringworld story (assuming that's what it is)."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"This was a fun read. Fast paced and interesting. I would not recommend starting the series here though. It won't be quite the adventure and you will probably be disapointed.Pick up \\"Ring World\\" if you have not read it. An even better idea would be to pick up \\"World of Ptavvs\\". I think it's the first of the known space books. An oldie but a goodie.(What I really want to know is what happens when a Thrint meets aprotector. Yikes!)"},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"I liked the original Ring World series, and like any book I enjoy, I found myself reading each book in a day or so.I decided to read RingWorld's Children on the strength of the original series. However, after a couple of weeks, I am still only a 3rd of the way through. I picked it up again today - after reading the new Dune series book and other - well more interesting - books in between, I found it hard to keep reading.Why? Well I decided, sadly, that the story is just plain boring, It drones. It reads like a sad tired addition to the series that I get the distinct impression that Larry Niven probably did not want to write.I honestly do not think I can finish it - which is probably the worst thing I can say about a book. I'll keep it by the toilet in case one day I have a bad case of diarrhea and run out of toiletry boxes to read.It is really quite sad."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"Once there was a sci-fi writer called Larry Niven who wrote some of the most imaginative hard sci-fi of his day. Never mind that the stories were badly written, the characters two-dimensional, and the societies that he described were little more than a teen-aged boy's wet dream; the stories were so chock-full of big ideas that I avidly hunted down everything that he wrote. Then came the Larry Niven who collaborated with Jerry Pournelle. This Larry Niven was a much better writer, but his ideas became smaller and smaller until we saw sad little political tirades like \\"Fallen Angels\\". I, like so many others, have spent twenty years hoping that the old Larry Niven would return from the literary wasteland. With \\"Ringworld's Children\\" the old Niven has at least sent us a postcard.The first Ringworld book was one of the old Larry Niven's later stories and is perhaps his grandest vision. The story is set on an artificial world that was created by building a ring around a star. The ring has the diameter of Earth's orbit, the inside is habitable, and there is enough room for almost anything to happen. Over the years Niven wrote two sequels: each less imaginative than the previous one. When \\"Ringworld's Children\\" appeared at my local library I ignored it because I was so tired of reading the awful books that Larry Niven has written over the past two decades. However, the other day I sat down and read the book and found that I could not put it down. The book is not a true return to form for Mr Niven, but it isfar better than anything that he has written since the early 1970s, and it does have the feel of his early work, right down to the bad writing.If you like Larry Niven's early work then read this book. If you think that the Pournelle/Niven collaborations were the gospels of sci-fi then this book is probably not for you."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"Ringworld's Children is half a book. The first half was the previous \\"Ringworld Throne.\\" Unfortunately, Niven didn't combine them, toss out the filler in \\"Throne\\", and write the book that would have been the worthy successor to \\"Ringworld\\" and \\"Ringworld Engineers.\\" But he didn't, and the two half books don't make a whole one.What we have instead is (like \\"Throne\\") the outline of a great novel, a few sketches of characters (and not even that for some: Chmee's son whatsisname), and Louis Wu solving a few puzzles with clues we never see.Larry Niven once said that the Ringworld offered so many opportunities for sequels that it would make Edgar Rice Burroughs look like a case of \\"writer's block.\\" Sadly, having created such a mental playground, Niven is unable to capitalize on it.3 stars because it's Ringworld. But only just."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"This is the first Known Space novel to disappoint me. Not only did it do that, it killed my interest in reading Larry Niven. One of the blurbs quoted when you open the book says this book has \\"enough mind-boggling ideas to keep a dozen lesser writers working for years\\". What?What new ideas? The nanotech 'doc? I've read about nanotech medics many times before, first in a robot story from Asimov where a robot goes mini to kill a cancer spread and later in a military SF book where a major businessman is restored to life as a cyborg after experiencing a heart attack.Rishathra? No, I won't tell you what it is. I'll just tell you it's one of those things you see a lot of in science fiction.Hyperspace predators? Yep, there's a new one all right--and it's going right back into the pit of Tartarus from which it came. I mean seriously, if you actually read the book (which I hope you don't), you'll be laughing.The worst part about this, though, is that every probelm can be solved in a few chapters. You want to rescue the Long Shot from the alien Patriarchy? Hop aboard! You want to save the Ringworld from the gaping air drainage? Easy! We'll use a plug! In fact, the only thing that ever stands between our heroes and a perfect solution to everything is a few annoying side-characters, some sex, and the aforementioned hyperspace predators that do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to help the story. In fact, over 200 pages of this book could be trashed and the story would still be pretty much the same. The pacing is terrible. In fact, the entire story reminds me of Dragonball GT. Remember how they manage to take everyone off the Earth to another planet in a few days? There was NO politcal resistance, the millions of spaceships neccesary came outta nowhere, and somehow they got the message to everyone on Earth, no matter how isolated they might be, and the series just takes it for granted. This book is about that intelligent...but maybe less."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"Ringworld's Children is a pleasant revisit to our old friend Louis Wu and his motley crew, still bopping around the Ringworld. Like many others, I looked forward to the chance to see what new and interesting scrapes Larry Niven would get him into this time and seized the book at first opportunity.Overall it was a pleasant diversion and a nice read. The ring is really fascinating as a place and here Niven makes it the most realistic its ever been. I don't mean the \\"additions\\" to make it more scientifically accurate, but rather the way he treats the slow degradation over the aeons and the way that various people have evolved to fit their world.Alas... this book is too short and doesn't really contain new ideas. It does bring a lot of old Known Space ideas together in one place and the logical interplay of things like the anti-matter star system, super auto-doc, QII hyperdrive, and the ring itself is kind of fun. On the other hand, there are lots of elements (the Fringe War in particular) that are just there on the page, rather lifeless. The hyperspace monster thing (more-or-less a throwaway in any case) didn't amuse me (except: Beowulf Shaeffer was right and Carlos Wu was wrong in \\"Borderland of Sol\\", who'da thunk it?) for more than a second. In fact it rather annoyed me. I hope Niven has something interesting to do with the beasties in some future story.I still like Niven's clear, affectation-free prose. This book doesn't rise to the level of the original and I'd much rather have had something heftier with some more interesting new ideas, but...Sour grapes aside, Niven's \\"playspace\\" still has amazing flexibility. Rather than \\"down in flames\\", this book seems to open up various possible additional storylines in the future. I hope that Louis Wu does, in fact, live forever. (Secretly I'm pining for him to meet \\"dad\\" for a shared adventure.)Wait for this one in paperback, my friends, but you'll want to read it nonetheless."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"Larry Niven reported that engineering students have determined that the Ringworld mathematically is a suspension bridge with no end points. I don't have the math skills to confirm the claim, but I can confirm that enjoyable as the Ringworld series has been, sometimes when reading this fourth Ringworld book I felt like more than one kind of end point was being suspended.This is the story of how Louis Wu's hand-picked successor to the Ringworld \\"throne\\" preserves the Ringworld from the threat of annihilation by human cops, kzinti warcats and other folk we thought we had learned to like. The ARM agents here, for example, aren't upset when their antimatter tools blast a Manhattan-sized hole in the floor of the Ringworld, jeopardizing the lives of the Ringworld's 30 trillion inhabitants. The ARMs we meet note they can still learn a lot studying the deserted, desiccated shell if that happens. It doesn't, of course, but Larry, you've sure come a long ways in your attitude towards cops since the days of Gil the Arm.Like Robert Heinlein in his last half dozen books, Niven has also taken to recycling old ideas from earlier books, even ideas his characters rejected then, and using them in \\"Children\\":- Ship-eating monsters in hyperspace, rejected as a possibility in \\"Borderland of Sol,\\" may turn out to be real. (Beowulf Schaeffer was right and Carlos Wu was wrong? Who'd have thought it?) So Puppeteers are right to fear hyperspace.- Teela Brown's fabulous luck, discredited in \\"Ringworld Engineers,\\" may be a matter of lucky genes after all.- The anti-matter solar system in \\"Neutron Star\\" turns out to still be around.- The \\"Longshot,\\" the experimental advanced ship from \\"Neutron Star\\" and \\"Ringworld\\" turns out to still be around.- Schizophrenic cops, an idea from the one original story in \\"Crashlander,\\" appear again. (Larry, what is it about you and cops?)- Carlos Wu's fabulous autodoc, also from \\"Crashlander\\" or maybe from \\"Ringworld Engineers,\\" continues to play a starring role.There are half a dozen other references from earlier works that I saw, and likely a lot more that I missed.Niven's strong suit has always been ideas and the extrapolation of ideas, combined with good plotting. He's never been a strong character author, and he has the annoying habit of paying more attention to the scenery than to character development. That's an ongoing problem with this short novel, too. And an unusually large number of characters are abandoned by the author, having served there immediate function to the plot. (Larry, what was the purpose of having Louis Wu and his motely crew meet the Giraffe People? And that's Larry's pun, not mine.)And spare me any more rishathra jokes. Please.Niven continues to do one thing consistently well: Protectors, the folk who probably built the Ringworld, are mostly superintelligent, in addition to having some other skills. How can a writer of normal intelligence, writing to a reader of normal intelligence, portray believably a superintelligent being? It takes more than one technique. Niven uses several effectively, perhaps more effectively than he has done in the last two Ringworld books. It's the best and most effective aspect of this novel.The motivation of Protectors is less well, or at least less consistently, developed. You knew - come one, admit it - that the Ringworld would have a surviving original Pak Protector. But how is that Proserpina is still alive? And why did Bram - the former occupant of the Ringworld \\"throne,\\" killed at the end of that book, let the Ringworld deteriorate to its present sad condition?Still and all, this is an entertaining yarn. Niven ends it ambiguously, with the Ringworld safer, if not safe, and enough satisfying new ideas to give a reader something to chew on. There's enough trickiness, plots-within-plots and general scheming to keep a reader guessing. And only Louis Wu and Nessus have the means to return to the Ringworld.I'd expected this to be the story where Louis Wu meets Carlos Wu, who is almost certainly his father (see: \\"Crashlander\\") but that didn't happen. Stay tuned.Is this a classic Niven story? Nope. But it's something of a return to form after disappointments likes \\"The Burning City.\\" Strongly recommended for \\"Ringworld\\" fans. This is not the book for newcomers to Niven's universe; start with \\"Ringworld\\" the novel. If you're not a science fiction fan, you should probably skip this one."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"This is one truly appalling book. If I could have given it zero stars I would have. Larry Niven was once an exciting writer whose excitement in novelties carried you along with him. Now he seems to be drearily trying to tie together the loose ends of most of his previous work, to little or no effect - just going through the motions.Where can I start? Lack of characterisation. Slack plotting (which Niven now seems to believe is purely mechanical). Ho-hum action sequences. Personal obsessions (inter-species sex). Here-and-there action to no great purpose. And a resolution which is wholly deus ex machina.Sad to see an author who once had it all together (and remember the younger Niven justifiably won both Hugo and Nebula awards) lose it to this extent. I ended \\"Ringworlds's Chidren\\" thinking it would have read a lot better had it been edited by E. E. (\\"Doc\\") Smith - and that's saying something!"},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"If you made it through all three of the Ringworld books before this one, you owe it to yourself to keep going. I thought this one was better than Ringworld Throne, but not as good as the first two in the series.It's fast-paced, has interesting characters, and contains plenty of conflict. There's a war on over Ringworld, called the Fringe War, and it supplies a lot of the action and some of the characters. Louis Wu is great as always, and Acolyte (son of Chmee/Speaker to Animals) is a fine sidekick.A couple of interesting twists await towards the end of the book. I thought the denouement was just a wee bit maudlin, but it's obvious that Niven really likes Louis as a character, and... well, that's all I'll say.If you really, really love the Ringworld series (as I do), get the hardback for an immediate good read. If you are not quite as fanatic about it, hang on and get the paperback in a couple of months."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"This book is a fun read, with lots of \\"insider\\" jokes that folks who've read most of the author's previous Known Space fiction will get a chuckle out of (\\"You mean they're being eaten?!? But the Hindmost hadn't reacted to the news!).Unlike Ringworld Throne, the focus is once again on action, adventure and near-magical technology. The only reason I didn't rate it higher is because the tongue-in-cheek \\"sense of wonder\\" that I used to get from Niven's early work is missing. However, that's probably just a result of the changes that growing older brings in the way most of us look at the world (myself included).Bottom line, read the book, you'll enjoy it.And as to the title of my review... Ringworld's Children sure seems to pretty much close out the possibility of future Ringworld tales. In fact, many of the \\"closures\\" in Ringworld's Children feel very much like the kinds of things outlined in his previously published outline of the known-space-story-to-end-all-known-space-stories \\"Down in Flames\\"."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"In September 1993 I read Ringworld for the first time. I had turned twenty that June, just gotten my driver's license, and I was starting my third semester of college. By Christmas I had read all of Niven's Known Space work (except The Patchwork Girl, which took about a year to track down), and his two Smoke Ring novels. Call it binge reading, an odd little habit I'd developed at a young age of picking an author and reading as many of his works as I could in as short a time as possible. My first binge read, that I can recall, was of Arthur C. Clarke in 1984, and I did it several times later, with Isaac Asimov, with Orson Scott Card, with Philip K. Dick.Ringworld wasn't my first encounter with Niven's work or with Known Space. I'd found Niven, at a very young age, through Star Trek, and Known Space through the Man-Kzin Wars anthologies because of the Kzin and their connection to Star Trek. But Ringworld was the biggie, the Big Dumb Object, the capstone of the entire Known Space mythos, where all the threads of Niven's prior work came together. Reading Ringworld first, however, left me blind to how much the novel built on those earlier works, and knowing that I didn't know everything led me deeper into Known Space.Reading Ringworld's Children, Niven's new Known Space novel, last week brought back memories of that binge read. It is a book that needed to be written--the previous book, 1996's The Ringworld Throne ended on a cliffhanger as Louis Wu defeated the vampire Protector Bram and installed the ghoul Protector Tunesmith in his place as the Ringworld's Protector with Kzin and ARM spacefleets approaching the Ringworld to take possession of it. Ringworld's Children resolves that cliffhanger and explores who will control the Ringworld and why.Ringworld's Children is different than any of the other books in the Known Space series--the writing is leaner, more spare. There's a lot of exposition, as characters bounce theories past one another to be confirmed or denied--who built the Ringworld; who runs ARM, the United Nations tech police; what exactly is hyperspace; what is luck. The book ends with a sense of closure, but new and wholly different avenues to explore have been opened. As much as I'd like to see a Known Space novel set anywhere but the Ringworld just to expand the focus a bit, I have to admit I'm mightily curious to see what happens next.It's not the book for someone just discovering Known Space or the Ringworld--there's far too much assumed knowledge on the part of the reader to really be reader-friendly, though references to past books in the series are given some brief explanation. I wish Chmeee, the Kzin who journeyed to the Ringworld with Louis Wu in the first two books and established an empire on the Map of Earth, had more than just a cameo appearance at the novel's conclusion. And in some ways, the Ringworld seems like a much smaller place now--the sensawunder of the wide-open vistas and the Arch of Heaven towering overhead with the sun as its keystone is lost. A person could live forever and never see all of the ringworld, or even grasp his mind around a mere tenth of it.If you're a Niven fan, I recommend Ringworld's Children. I can only hope that a span of years, even a decade or more, won't pass until the next volume in the Ringworld series."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"What is it about aging Science Fiction writers that they become so obsessed with sex? It happened to Heinlein, and sadly, it's happening to Niven, two of my favorite authors from childhood.I've read most of Niven's work, loved all his known space series, even if he's made some serious physics blunders, and loved Ringworld and Ringworld Engineers. Ringworld Throne would have been a short story if you ripped out every page with his twisted interspecies sex fantasies, and I promosed myself that I would toss Rindworld's Children if I encountered a single scene of gratuitous rishathra that didn't propel the plot line.Surprisingly, I got through half the book, but that sucker is on the curb for recycling as I write this.Larry, get a ticket to Thailand, get yourself thoroughly laid, and then write your next story."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"Yet another book in this ever-engrosing and ever-growing tale of a truly scientifically-possible and viable \\"ring\\" upon which trillions of people, human and not-so-human, live on an artificial band millions of times larger in area size than Earth. Just as fascinating as the first \\"Ringworld\\" and the others that followed, this one, wherein war threatens the ring and its inhabitants, this book should also rank with \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\", \\"Childhood's End\\", \\"2010\\", \\"Puppet Masters\\", \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\", and even cyberpunk books like \\"Snow Crash\\", \\"Cryptonomicon\\", \\"Neuromancer\\", \\"Mona Lisa Overdrive\\", \\"Virtual Light\\", \\"Cyber Hunter\\" and more."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"Praise to Larry Niven!!!

It arrived quickly and it was at a very reasonable price.I am very satisfied with this purchase."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"If you like clean-cut, chaste prose and loose, not to say slutty ideas you love Larry Niven. In this fourth book in the Ringworld series he leaves more loose ends than he wraps up.Spoilers, or inside baseball.Does Tunesmith pick a fight with the h-monsters? Pak strategists don't seem to maintain a force in being long.Are the Ringworld pak manipulated by an artificial intelligence in the superconducting network?Why not just use a lightsail with a stasis field for meteor patches? Also for bank shots around the Ring.If the Ring is really out of Known Space, maybe Niven could put a Smoke Ring around a gas giant in the sequel to 'The Gripping Hand'. New Singapore? I don't think he should have used savages the first time."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"people who like the character Tunesmith in 'Ringworld's Children' might like the book 'Tunesmith' by Jimmy Webb."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"This book is an improvement on Ringworld Throne, which isn't saying much. There still aren't new striking ideas, but this time Niven brought in ideas from earlier in his career (tricks with hyperdrive, loony ARMS officers), and made it look like he had planned it that way. And the elaborate cover story that Louis comes up with sounds almost like the plan of an unwritten Ringworld novel. Finally some mysteries are finally tied up neatly:(SPOILERS!)Why did Teela die in spite of her \\"luck\\"? Because the Teela Brown gene was protecting ITSELF, not her -- Dawkins' selfish gene theory.Why don't the Ringworld Protectors show the xenophobia that they did in PROTECTOR? Because they did genetic engineering on themselves to eliminate the trait.Still, to paraphrase TS Eliot, the RINGWORLD ended not with a bang but with a whimper."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"I think this book stands up well in comparison to other books in the Ringworld series. The story moves quickly, especially in the first 150 pages, and Niven's ability to combine action and hard sf is in top form. The book will be especially rewarding for readers who, like me, have long wondered what the ringworld was like when it was originally built, governed by a coalition of Machiavellian and super-intelligent beings, rather than the wrecked civilization it became.The main difficulty for the reader is the amount of effort required to understand and enjoy the story. First, it is helpful if the reader is very familiar with the three previous ringworld books, and with the novel Protector. The novel is definitely not a stand-alone story. Second, over the years Niven's writing style has become increasingly telegraphic, so that important plot points are often covered in just one or two sentences. Thus, I recommend reading this book slowly. Trying to read it all in one sitting will give an unfocused and unsatisfying experience."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"Not quite the crapfest that was book 3 in the Ringworld series, but still a gigantic disappointment coming from Niven. Children is plagued by the same things that made the previous novel so unbearable: flat, uninteresting characters, ridiculous names, obsession over interspecies sex for no reason other than to include sex in the story, and overall a poorly written plot. To be fair, I didn't come out of this one as bewildered as after Ringworld Throne - don't even ask me to summarize THAT plot, I've yet to come across a decent one myself, mostly because trying to figure it out can cause lasting brain damage. But even so, this novel is nowhere near the original Ringworld novel, or even Engineers for that matter. Avoid if possible."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"I agree with those who think this book was too short. The Fringe War, barely touched on in \\"Ringworld Throne\\", could have provided a substantially-sized volume of material with which to work. Unfortunately the War itself seems to be nothing so much as a plot device for getting Louis Wu a bona fide human girlfriend, not long before Wu meets a final(?) destiny set for him since his first return to the Ringworld in \\"Ringworld Engineers\\".Having now re-read the entire Ringworld series in succession, I can't agree with those who have so violently disliked \\"Throne\\" and \\"Children\\". Both books read very much like standard Niven work, and standard Niven work is several cuts above the average SF novel, so why all the complaining? This book was a page-turner for me and I enjoyed very much getting one more glimpse at this fantastic \\"playground of the mind\\" and the denizens who inhabit it.Is this the end of the series? Niven seems to be angling that way. Though I think there are a lot of Ringworld stories that could still be told, even without Carlos Wu or Known Space being a part of the equation.*** SPOILER ALERT! ***My only real beef with this book is how Louis Wu's transformation into the Wu-monster turned out to be so anticlimactic. Such a life-altering experience should have profoundly affected the outlook and thoughts of Louis, but when he awakes after having consumed Tree-of-Life he seems only like a mildly-smarter version of himself. The accentuated hyper-intelligence of the Protector is not much in evidence, nor does Louis seem to experience any profound emotions regarding his unexpected transformation.Of course, the instant Wu awoke as a Protector, I knew he'd use the super-autodoc to reverse-engineer himself back down to normal \\"breeder\\" capacity. This too should have been further expounded upon, psychologically and emotionally, but throughout it all, turning Protector and then back to breeder, Louis still reads and feels like the same old Louis. And while some fans might have found that comforting, I found it to be not very consistent, given the fact that Niven has spent most of his professional career hyping the Protector and how transforming into a Protector drastically alters the mind (and body) of a normal human being."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"For the last 20 years readers and fans have bemoaned the lack of a worthy sequel to Lary Nivens 1970 Ringworld. 1980's Ringworld engineer was fair, and Ringworld Throne completely LAME. A lot of Niven recent work seem plain and uninteresting. I began to suspect that like his mentor and idol, Robert Hienlein that in his older years Niven was losing the ability to tell stories and had been reduced to essentially delivering long monolgue travel brochures.Not so with this book. Niven has come through with an interesting and delightful tale that brings full circle a number of story lines and characters. I enjoyed how he over came some of his previous &quot;Deus ex machina&quot; such as puppeteer hulls, stasis generators. Just as in the real world,a seemingly over powering technology soon becomes less dominant in the face of newer technological advances. Ie the usage of anti matter against scrith and Puppeteer hulls.I further enjoyed the more in depth examination of the motives of Louis Wu and Teela Brown from the first book. Without giving a spoiler simply let me say that this is the finest book Niven has delivered in a decade."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"It was a sad experience, like reading Harry Potter 7. This seemed pretty clearly the last ringworld book. Its been a grand 34 years for the story.Children was short, far too short, and in my opinion, over-edited. I liked that rishathra, contrived and distracting in previous books, was tamed. I didn't like that Niven has jumped on the nanotech elven-magic bandwagon. I loathe the concept of persistent nanotechnology, its become a literary krutch for science fiction, the ultimate Deus Ex Machina when far more interesting possibilites may have crossed the creative mind. This is not to suggest in the least that Niven is slacking, the sunfish ship and the details of Quantum II Hyperdrive are interesting enough by themselves.I liked the in-depth view of protector thinking, the satisfying plans-within-plans that has come to be expected of Niven's colorful and clever aliens. Louis Wu was at his analytical best. I was able to guess the fate of the ringworld (it was obvious), but not the extended truth of Teela Brown. The entire story is drawn carefully though somewhat breathlessly to a satisfying conclusion.I just wish it didn't have to end. Then again, Louis Wu *did* resolve to live forever..."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"I used to read a lot of science fiction, and I enjoyed Larry Niven's stories.

Unfortunately this book failed to meet them.I did not like the story, nor did I find the characters interesting. Had this not been a Larry Niven book I would not have finished it."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"Comepletes the story began in Ringworld Throne, these two stories are not Niven's best work but are worth a \\"read.\\" The stories move a little too slow for my tastes but there is multiple character development to enliven them."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"I just had the misfortune of reading this book. The only reason I was able to get through it is that I was on a very long flight and had nothing else to do because my laptop battery died.I remember a way back when reading the very first Ringworld book and being entranced. My goodness, how the mighty have fallen, just like the floating cities on the Ringworld.From the get-go, this book is unbelievably confusing. Niven spends way too much time with confusing conversation between the characters, and other than Louis Wu and the puppeteer, it's difficult to discern who the other characters are and how they fit into the story. The reader has to sit through pages and pages of confusing conversation, with events moving either too slowly or too quickly in between. The Ringworld is a fascinating place, yet we have perhaps three or four pages of description in the entire book.Niven ought to read the \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" series by Arthur C. Clarke, which is also a four book series. Now that is some masterful writing.Question -- is Larry Niven on drugs?Thank goodness I didn't pay for this book -- I got it from the library."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"I met Larry Niven (Lawrence Van Colt) back in 1983! Yes, it was over 21 years past at the Midland, Michigan Science Fiction conference. I kept asking Larry if he was ever going to write about Louis Wu and Known Space again. Larry kept telling me \\"no\\" (\\"rats\\", I thought). I was a poor college student and could not afford to buy both Larry and Dr. Pournelle dinner to continue the wonderful discussion of Larry's writing. Being a broke college student sucked when you meet your favorite author.For a good many years Larry kept his word about not writing about Ringworld and wrote about Smoke Rings, Alien invasions, and monsters-on-speed. Then he \\"licensed\\" out his Kzinti aliens for the various war novels. Finally in the late 1990s Larry wrote \\"Ringworld Throne\\". I didn't like the novel but gave it a fair review. Face it, Hillary Clinton could have ghost written \\"Throne\\" and I would have given it a fair review.Well, \\"Children\\" is just as good as Ringworld and Engineers. Louis Wu returns fit, tanned, and rested. He is a delight. Larry keeps the Puppetteer \\"Hindmost\\", Chmee's son, a new protector called Tunesmith, and introduces us to both new Pac Protectors and personnel from ARM.Larry did a great job of writing. The origins of the auto-doc that saved Louis Wu's life is expained. The technology for the uber-auto-doc didn't exist back in 1970 when Larry first wrote the Ringworld Novel. This auto-doc is copied to do many wonderous things.Larry also explains the Ringworld a lot better. The Pac are now fully extablished as the rightful guardians of the Ringworld. The ram-jets used for control of the Ringworld in the plain of orbit were to be replaced. Why they were not replaced is a great read. The protector Bram, killed in the previous novel, is found to have been a dreadful protector in charge of the maintenance of Ringworld.Larry really goes to examine the quasi-culture of the Pac protectors. In many of the novels involving Pac they are merely seen as ultra-bright killing machines. However, in this novel they work together to save the Ringworld.Yes, this time the Ringworld is threatned by ARM, the Kzin, and Outsiders. Years past I would have wanted ARM to win. However, Larry does a great job of filling in some of the blanks about the operations of ARM. The people who run ARM are not nice and a little ruthless. Imagine the UN as an all-powerful government agency with all of the caring of the IRS or Enron. A typical reader will end up wanting the allied forces of the Ringworld to win.Larry also ties in anti-matter to the Ringworld. Where is this anti-matter found and how does it tie into Known Space? You have to go ALL THE WAY BACK TO NEUTRON STAR!!! Yep, the anti-matter of a short story in Neutron Star is tied to Ringworld. That is over a 35 year gap in story telling.Larry keeps the natives of Ringworld out of the action to a lessor extent. Why? Well, breeders are sort of like pets. There is a full war going on in the Ringworld star system. When massive forces fight, the only thing that happens is lots of innocents are killed. Anti-matter is nasty and ARM has a big supply of it.I'm not going to give away much about this novel except these two facts: Larry pretty much takes any possibility for a Ringworld follow up out of the picture but Larry leaves open the possibility of lots of new Know Space adventures. Read the novel and find out why!!!Larry, if you ever read this review I want to tell you that \\"Children\\" is lots better than \\"Throne\\". Oh, I'm no longer a \\"broke\\" college student so I can finally buy you and Dr. Pournelle that good dinner.Amazon.com readers and Larry Niven fans, You will like \\"Children\\", trust me."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"Ringworld Throne was a sub par book at best, and certainly well beneath the rest of Niven's work in this universe. With Ringworld's Children, he returns to form and produces an excellent story based in his fantastic Ringworld universe.If you missed the great works of Niven, then you owe it to yourself to check this book out. The Ringworld series is one of the greats."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"I really enjoyed this series and Larry Niven is a great writer. He has created a very detailed world and wonderful characters. Could not put it down and would think about this world and the people as if they were real. I really got caught up in this world and didn't expect Larry Niven to have such a great sense of humor and laughed out loud at Louis Wu and company! Great books! Highly recommend them all."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"This is a quick read, and would be a reasonable end to the Ringworld stories. I downgrade it a bit for repetitiveness and for the \\"deus ex machina\\" quality of some of the devices employed.I think Niven is generally regarded as a \\"hard\\" sf writer, but after all, he employs, for example, psionics and various undefined ftl drives. This story features some fairly extreme examples of the liberty that using such fantasy elements allows for rather extreme events.But that's to some extent a side issue to my review. This book has much the same tone as the previous entry in the series, The Ringworld Throne, though I somehow liked that book better. In this book Niven continues to explore the ramifications of the struggle for control of the Ringworld and sheds a little more light on its history and fate, along with those of a number of characters."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"250-year-old Louis Wu awakens as a young-man after an extensive stay in a nanotechnology healing chamber to find that the situation on Ringworld is not good. Although the new protector, Tunesmith, is doing what he can to repair the damage Ringworld has suffered, too many societies have recognized Ringworld for the technological treasure-trove that it is. The worst part is, Ringworld doesn't actually need to survive to be looted of its treasure. And anti-matter weapons can quickly punch holes in the Ringworld that Tunesmith would be powerless to stop.Louis involves himself in Tunesmith's secret plan, testing a space drive, checking on the status of Tunesmith's comet-hole repair system, and falling in love with an Earth-human whose fighter craft has penetrated Ringworld through a hole in its surface. He gets the chance to see even more of the mysteries of Ringworld, but he can see no way out of the war that is coming.Author Larry Niven's Ringworld is a fascinating construction. A ribbon of super-strong material around a sun, Ringworld sports the surface area of a million earths--and is inhabited by a hugely diverging group of semi-humans along with a few aliens. Protectors, the final stage in 'human' development, work to benefit their decendents, but armed with limited information, have done too little to prevent war.Fans of the Ringworld series will want to read this story, see the further adventures of Louis Wu, and see how Niven has dealt with the criticisms of his great creation, adding devices and details that make it more technologically possible. The world-building that went into Ringworld is first-class and the original Ringworld novel is a true classic of SF. Ringworld's Children is a far smaller book than the original masterpiece. The characters are not really fleshed out or motivated, and I found myself uninvolved with the story.Fans of Ringworld will want to read this one for the latest on this fascinating more-than-world. If you aren't already a Ringworld fan, though, you'll definitely want to start with the original."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"I am suspicious of all of the negative reviews of this book. First of all, anyone who says they read this book in one day is lying. The concepts in this story are staggering. The visuals are awe-inspiring. You can read one sentence and then spend 20 minutes visualizing the scene just described. One of the problems with most scifi is that the action is 'toned down' to the level of a bad movie or a TV show. Niven does not do that. He imagines a truly future, amazingly complex reality; and then the characters move along in real time in that situation. The reader has to THINK just to keep up.I kept thinking as I read that \\" there will never be a movie made of this story... it is just TOO difficult \\". Niven is juggling a vast array of disparate elements here; and part of the fun is watching him keep those balls in the air and tell a story at the same time. Not for everyone; but satisfying for those who try.I wrote the above review after reading the book one time. Then I dug out 'Ringworld Throne' and tried to read it again. It took me awhile. The first half of the book is just boring. Then I discovered that the second half deals with the characters we all love, especially Louis. So I forced myself to read through the second half. This helps to appreciate ' Ringworld's Children '. So then I picked up 'Children' and started to read it a second time. Much better. I actually enjoyed most of it. I think I understand what's going on a little more, at least enough to offer some minor helpful criticism:Larry Niven no longer writes any descriptive sentences to help us to understand or visualize what he is talking about. He wastes no time. Almost as if he is a Protector telling a story. He touches on details and keeps moving, forcing us to figure out what is happening. This is a problem. Because sometimes the events are difficult to comprehend or understand. And without understanding them we lose the thread of the story.Another failing is the way the characters talk. We are supposed to believe that an alien living for thousands of years on the Ringworld would be interested in literature from Earth, or phrases or concepts from pre-space-age Earth. This is fun, and makes the story colorful and easier to comprehend; but the idea is still silly.It is never explained what exactly Protectors do with all the time they have lived. Apparently they sit around living for thousands of years and then act quickly in a flurry of excitement during the events in the story.And they teach themselves quantum physics on their own, but fail to grasp simple concepts that to us seem obvious ( super nerds ).And everyone uses the concept of a BallWorld ( like Earth ) but no one thinks to ever call it a sphere-world or cantaloupe-world.I realize now that the problem list goes on and on.Perhaps the concept of the Ringworld is just too big. Maybe a smaller Ringworld would be easier to write about and easier to visualize.I still like the characters, and I love when Hindmost and Louis and Acolyte are doing stuff together.And there are some great situations that Niven plays with . One of my favorite sections involves Louis Wu pretending to be a younger son named Luis and talking to a hot female ARM agent who he is lusting after but pretending not to. And he is trying to interrogate her and at the same time fool her and manipulate her. And she is trying to coerce him and interrogate him at the same time, while she wants to have sex with him and also kidnap him. The dialogue and thought balloons are maddening and great fun and to me 'pure Niven'.All in all I greatly enjoyed 'Children' the second time through.If I understood the physics I think I would like it even more the third time."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"Ringworld's Children (2004) is the fourth novel in the Ringworld series, followingThe Ringworld Throne. InRingworld, Louis Wu had encountered a very large patch of sunflowers, but except for a minor incident that left Speaker to Animals hairless and charred, his party managed to hide from their reflected sunbeams during the day. InThe Ringworld Engineers, Louis had boiled a sea, providing enough time for the locals to weed out the mirrored plants, but also left a legacy of clouds that remained in the region.In The Ringworld Throne, these clouds allowed the Shadow Nest vampires to greatly increase their hunting range and thus their food supply, resulting into a local population explosion of these predators. When Valavirgillin and the Farsight Trading company arrived in the region, they soon found themselves under attack by the vampires and the Machine People joined forces with various local hominids to attack the vampire lair. They gained access to the floating city and turned on the bottomside lighting system, thus driving the vampires out of their sheltered enclave and forcing them to scatter throughout the region.Elsewhere in previous volume, Louis, Acolyte and the Hindmost were captured by a vampire protector, whom Louis named Bram. He and his mate Anne have gained control of the Meteor Defense room and now Bram has started using the meteor defense system to destroy ships from the various known space species. Louis lured the Ghoul Tunesmith into the tree-of-life garden, where he underwent the change to protector. Then Louis and his associates cooperated with these vampire protectors while they fought other vampire protectors for control of the rimwall. Anne was killed by the rimwall protectors and Bram was injured. When Bran returned from the rimwall, Tunesmith ambushed him and, with a timely diversion by Acolyte, overcame him.In this novel, in 2893 AD, Louis Wu awakes under a coffin lid in the nanotech superdoc; he has been in the 'doc for 84 days and hasn't felt this good in two centuries. However, Tunesmith has been very busy while Louis was undergoing treatment. He has negotiated an agreement with the Spill Mountain protectors. He also has moved Hot Needle of Inquiry back under Olympus Mons, sliced it open, and removed various components. The superdoc is spread out on the cavern floor, as is the repaired hyperdrive (maybe Louis can go home afterall).However, the Fringe War has heated up again. Warships from the ARM, Kzinti, Trinocs and other, unknown aliens abound within the system; even the Puppeteers and Outsiders have sent observers. Tunesmith has made plans to hijack the Long Shot, which is being used as a courier for the Kzinti. He has also made Hanging People protectors and is using them to pilot probes against his opponents. He sends Probe One out to agitate the Patriarchy command ship Diplomat, which is trying to link with the Long Shot. The probe thwarts the rendezvous, but is destroyed by an anti-matter bullet.Tunesmith has made some changes to the hyperdrives and can use them in near space. First he fires Probe Two out of the linear accelerator launcher and then sends Hot Needle of Inquiry immediately after it. Probe Two acts both as a decoy and a test vehicle for the new hyperdrive. It jinks and curves and then disappears ... but returns a quarter million miles ahead. Then the ARM and Patriarchy notice the Needle and soon beams and missiles begin to converge on them. The Needle goes into hyperdrive and gains a quarter million miles on the targeting systems.The Needle avoids the warships as it travels out to the periphery of the system, where it takes a hyperspace jump back to the other side only ten light-minutes from the Long Shot. Approaching the rendezvous point, a pulse of the hyperdrive bypasses two guard ships and the Needle dives on the Long Shot as it attaches to the Diplomat. It touches sides with the Long Shot and a \\"glue\\" stuff causes the Needle to adhere to the other ship; the Needle then accelerates at ten gravities, tearing the Long Shot away from the Diplomat. Tunesmith, Acolyte and Louis storm aboard the Long Shot, but the fight is over before Louis can reach the other cabin.In this story, Tunesmith discovers something new about hyperspace: it is populated with living creatures, including ship-eating predators. Thus, hyperspace can be used within a gravity well as long as the ship returns to normalspace quickly. He now plans to learn even more about the quantized velocity of hyperspace using the Long Shot. Meanwhile, the Needle aerobrakes through the sun and returns to Ringworld, where it dives through an eye storm into the sea, out one meteor hole, and into another, and then hides beneath the sea.Two ARM craft follow the Needle in the eye storm, but lose it under the sea. They are attacked by two other ships and an ARM craft disappears within an anti-matter explosion. The blast blows a wide hole in the sea, sucking out the remains of the eye storm into space. Tunesmith deploys his experimental meteor patch to the new hole and sends Louis to observe.The other ARM craft lands on the ring and Louis joins them while pretending to be \\"Luis\\", a young Ringworld resident. The Hanging People protector who piloted Probe Two, Hanuman, pretends to be Luis' pet and also accompanies the ARM party. Later, Wembleth, a native of indeterminate species, travels with the group, as does Proserphina, one of the oldest protectors on Ringworld, who has been exiled to the Isolation Zone for millennia while her descendants have been running free on the Map of Earth.This story is too short and abrupt -- it is less than 300 pages long -- and there is plenty of space for clarification and follow throughs, but it still provides some interesting new concepts and scenery. All the protectors seem to have consented to follow Tunesmith as the Master Protector. Of course, Tunesmith doesn't give many clues as to his plans, but you can take for granted that they are BIG; everything on the Ringworld is oversized, after all, and only BIG plans have any chance of saving the ring from the careless hands of the anti-matter wielders.Recommended for Niven fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of strange sentients in an even stranger environment.-Arthur W.

All of the sentient species want to learn the technology that went into making Ringworld but the protectors want to keep such people out. The Protector used to shoot down any ship that got too close but the new protector Tunesmoth is holding fire so as not to irritate the participants of the Fringe War, which is getting too close to Ringworld.The ARM, the military leg of the United Nations, is using anti-matter engines near Ringworld, something that could destroy the planet if an accident occurs. When a ship falls and puts a hole in the top layer of Ringworld the Protector must fix it or the place will cease to exist. As ARMs soldiers try to ferret out the secrets of the Ringworld, are, a group of RINGWORLD'S CHILDREN work to repair the damage. One of the original engineering experts, together with Tunesmith try to figure out a way to move Ringworld away from sentient warmongers.People who have never read the Ringworld books will find the latest entry as a strong stand-alone book that gives enough information about other novels in the series so that new readers will want to buy and read them too. It is a fascinating place to visit, an engineering marvel so advanced that even in the year 2893, the technology is too sophisticated to duplicate.

Niven's usual detailed depiction of the alien or foreign is almost completely absent from this work, and the reader spends much of his or her time re-reading to try and figure out if they missed a page by accident.The treatment of the primary personas in the book is almost offhandedly shabby.Louis Wu, the longtime main hero of the series is swep along with the story rather than being the guide for the reader that he had been up until this book. He is constantly distracted by self doubt, lament over Teela Brown, and his desire to bone anyone he meets.Chmee: Pretty much absent. His one appearance late in the book is exempt of flavor.Hindmost: bleh. This one has been one-note since the first appearance. Typical Puppeteer \\"I'm scared! But I can be manipulated int doing scary stuff.\\"Chmee's son \\"Acolyte\\": starts out as an interesting persona in the first 1/3rd of the book, but becomes just a minor note lost in the confusion of the jumpled plotline.Tunesmith (the Ghoul Protector): Banal. While he shows some potential to live up the the Brennan monster, the original sentient Protector from the novel \\"Protector\\", he ends up being not much more than a step ladder.The new characters in this novel are:Roxanny: An ARM agent, crashed on the surface of the ring. Dick-fodder for Wu, and other male characters. The dynamic between her and Wu has moments but they are never adequately explored.Wembleth: A \\"native\\" of the ring. A plot-point involving this guy is one of the only interesting ones in the book, sadly it is explored and dropped in about two pages.An actual Pak Protector: Who is so uninteresting that even though I finished the book last night I already forgot her name.This book had so much potential, with the introduction of an original Pak I would have loved to learn more about them and the origins of the ring, but all of that is glossed over.Fortunately the hardover was very cheap an I'm a Amazon Prime member so shipping was free.Summary: Worth reading if you have read the previous three and can get it cheaply enough.

It was also good to return to the many familiar characters from the other books, although I wish Chmee would have had more than a passing cameo and his son did nothing to really advance the plot. I also wish the history of the Ringworld would have been fleshed out in more detail by more exposition from the Prosperina character. Good points include the ARM characters and a nice resolution of the whole Teela Brown situation in a way that I was initially sceptical about, but made sense when the lucky gene was factored in. I also liked the fact that we finally got to see the other Great Ocean, and there were so many Protectors in this book I was beginning to lose track of them. A must-read for Ringworld/Known Space fans with a few hours free.SPOILER - SPOILERA SPOILER AND A HOPE FOR A FUTURE BOOKGiven that the book ends with a planned visit to Home, I can only hope that Niven has a plan for a future book which will finally explain what happened after the events in Protector, my all-time favourite Known Space book. It looks like there'll probably be no more Ringworld novels, but I really wish Larry would fill in the biggest hole in the Known Space history - what happened to Protector population of Home and what they did to the Pak colonization fleets which never made it to Earth. The tantalizing idea that ARM may be run by a Protector, plus the Hindmost's comment that he wants to go to Home because it has an \\"interesting history\\" makes another book a hopeful possibility."},{"Title":"Ringworld's Children","review":"This was not a great read.

The worst part, however, is just trying to figure out what's going on from page to page.

I would have been SO much happier if Niven had filled his pages with more descriptions (much more description)... like, in every scene of the book!

From there on it's a fairly straightforward investigation by D'Cruz a thorny Chinese/Indian policeman, and their mutual Arab lawyer friend Jafar. What quickly comes to the fore is the extreme multi-ethnicity and multi-culturalism of Singapore's inhabitants, as various cultural traits and prejudices prove important to the murder mystery. In the end, the culprit isn't a shocker, but How Kum's reaction is, and the reader will come away with a nice sketch of Singapore."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Amateur Astronomy","review":"An excellent book that takes a unique approach to explaining the world of amateur astronomy.

The paper is cheap and really doesn't stand up well to the heavy page turning I have subjected it to - a minor gripe though. There is stuff in this book that is very hard to find elsewhere.

While this book is very similar in purpose to Dickinson/Dyers's Backyard Astronomer's Guide, it doesn't go into as great a detail on most topics. If you are just starting out in amateur astronomy you should consider buying this book. Two additions I would have liked to have seen in this book were 1.) A section with starmaps, and 2.)

While most of Earth's citizens adhere to the suffocating state-imposed moral code, the most heroic and memorable characters are the ones who buck the trend and safeguard their own freedom of choice in deciding between right vs. wrong. Their courage has important consequences late in the book and make the story ultimately readable.But the suspense can't match the stakes. The main character \\"has the capacity to literally change the world\\" and yet it never feels like it. Devoid from the acts of terror and sabatoge are the intense moments of fear, the inconceivable risk of failure, the thrill of the getaway, etc. Judging from the characters' emotions, you'd think they were committing acts of petty vandalism. This man is supposedly trying to change the world and yet you never really feel riveted.You know a book isn't so great when the world's civilization is a stake and you're indifferent to the result.I have other complaints but I don't want to spoil the story for others."},{"Title":"The Man Who Japed","review":"It's 2114, and Al Gore's vision has come to fruition: All art is sanitized for your protection; everything is bland and environmentally, ergonomically and politically correct. Yuppie-of-the-future Allen Purcell is set to take over as director of Telemedia, a giant edutainment conglomerate responsible for producing a steady diet of pap programming to keep the population from thinking too hard (sort of like Fox). Things are definitely looking up for Purcell and his heavily tranquilized wife, Janet. So why does he subconsciously commit subversive pranks against society, such as defacing (beheading, rather) a venerated statue of a military leader? I wonder if Terry Gilliam ever read Philip K. Dick. Parts of \\"The Man Who Japed\\" are reminiscent of \\"Brazil.\\" PKD pulls off the odd feat of being simultaneously ahead of his time and goofily dated. He remains in print and continues to be read and critically appreciated because his writing was more psychologically and philosophically complex than much of the science fiction by his contemporaries in the '50s and '60s. But Dick's novels remain firmly rooted in the martinis-n-cigarettes aesthetic of the Esquivel Space Age Lounge. Which is part of their charm to me. It's like \\"Mad Men\\" with rocketships and laserbeams."},{"Title":"The Man Who Japed","review":"As I say in my Amazon's Profile: \\"I am a science fiction fan and a history buff, I read omnivorously on these subjects.\\"PKD (1928-1982) is one of my favorite authors and at the present moment I intend to read and review his whole production (at least all his sci-fi novels).\\"The Man Who Japed\\" (1956) is his third published novel. As many of his earlier novels this one is constrained by ACE doubles format (6000 lines, no more, no less and roving action), PKD performs great once more.This book, as each of PKD's novels, is unique, captivating and full of action, moral and ethical issues. Characters are not heroes, just human beings doing their best to survive in a hostile environment. They may be selfish and even despicable but within them there is always a spark of altruism trying to emerge.The backdrop of the story is one dear to PKD: earth after WWIII. PKD has used this scenery in other novels and short stories, with common elements as androids, wasted land after atomic bombing and authoritarian government; nevertheless he never repeats himself.Around year 2114, different star systems are colonized; Earth is central administrative planet; an authoritarian bigoted government (Morec) rules society; Colonies are agricultural and dependant from Earth yet the colonists are free to do as they please.The main character is Allen Purcell, owner of a small innovative publicity agency and a convinced Morecist. He, somehow unexpectedly, receives a proposition for promising governmental career. Alas! the night before receiving the proposal, and unknown to his conscious self he has made a Big Joke (Japed) to the state founder's statue.Purcell's two pronged quest is about his unconscious motivation and struggle for power with the older companies bypassed by his talent.IMHO existentialism's influence is shown in this book and at least in other two of the same period: \\"The World that Jones Made\\" (1955) and \\"Solar Lottery\\" (1956).This book is real good. Not only sci-fi fans may appreciate it, general inquisitive public too!Enjoy!Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"The Man Who Japed","review":"Originally posted at FanLit.In 2114, Allen and Janet Purcell live in Newer York, a post-apocalyptic city that strictly regulates morality so that all citizens understand exactly how to fit in. Robotic spies film suspect behavior and turn it in to the committee members who are in charge of renting out apartments to law-abiding citizens. Citizens who get drunk, curse, or engage in sexual or other misconduct are brought to trial by the peers who live in their apartment complexes. A guilty verdict usually means losing your lease and having to move to one of the faraway planets that supplies Earth with food.Allen Purcell has just been offered the top position in the government's ad agency which produces propaganda meant to maintain public ethics. The job is very prestigious, but there's only one problem: The night before, in his sleep, he japed (made a joke of) the statue of General Streiter, the man who started the current governmental regime. Allen wasn't conscious of his activity, and he doesn't think there's any evidence that he's the culprit, but he needs to find out why he did it before he takes a job that puts him in charge of promoting the government's agenda. But when he decides to visit a psychoanalyst, things just go from bad to worse.The Man Who Japed (1956) is Philip K. Dick's third published novel, and it contains many of the same themes and types of characters seen in most of his works -- a bewildered male protagonist with a neurotic wife, a society obsessed with the morality of its neighbors, bad psychoanalysis, fascism, paranoia, fear of nuclear war, media propaganda, McCarthy-like witch hunts, synthetic food, and drug trips. Unusually, women are in positions of power in The Man Who Japed, and the Purcells actually seem to love each other (bad marriages are the norm for this author).Perhaps I've read too much PKD, or perhaps it's because I had just finished another of his novels, but I was not truly entertained by The Man Who Japed until the last 20% of the story. The final jape and its aftermath was hilarious and completely satisfactory, but much of the story up until that point lacked the constant humor and bizarreness that I love about Philip K. Dick. There were certainly some funny moments (such as the joke with the statue and Allen's visit to a black market dealer in banned 20th century novels), but most of the novel is obvious hit-\`em-over-the-head social commentary, and none of it is anything I haven't previously seen many times from Dick.Compared to his other works, The Man Who Japed is short, linearly-plotted, and not at all confusing (if you're a fan, you know what I mean). I listened to Brilliance Audio's recent production which is 5 hours long. Luke Daniels, who I've come to love, reads the story and does a great job highlighting Dick's weird sense of humor. The Man Who Japed isn't one of Philip K. Dick's best novels, but it's one of his first, so just for that reason, it's worth reading."},{"Title":"The Man Who Japed","review":"In PKD's \\"The Man Who Japed\\", published in 1956, is his view of a totalitarian society caused by a 1985 revolutionary named General Streiter.

Read this in the early twenty-first century and it's difficult not to be reminded of other novels and films of that era. An oppressive government, an overly morally-conscious society, and a community where trust is not an easily found commodity: these are story elements that will be familiar to 1950s science-fiction readers in general and fans of Philip K. Dick in particular.This story does quite a lot of world-building to get its message across. Dick presents us with a future Earth ruled by a puritanical, totalitarian state. Deviation from correct behavior (from society's \\"morec\\") subjects the deviant to anything from a public verbal berating of his local community's moral leader to excommunication from his apartment building.The protagonist, Allen Purcell, is a man in charge of a production team, one of many who create short television-like dramas called \\"packets\\". Each packet presents some moral lesson conforming to the standards and ideals of the state. Purcell's role in THE MAN WHO JAPED is presented through his dilemma. He is shown to be an excellent propagandist, so talented are he and his agency that he is offered the job of overseeing all packets broadcast throughout the world.Yet, as skilled as he is, he has conscious and subconscious doubts about the society in which he lives and his own role in maintaining this rigid and hypocritical structure. So overwhelming is his moral dilemma that he has even found himself apparently walking in his sleep and performing acts of vandalism and sabotage while retaining no memory of his actions or his motivations.The plot is relatively straightforward with precious little in the way of subplots or distractions. Almost certainly this is because the story's length. The book is rather short (my copy runs a scant 140 pages) and it's a pity because Purcell's story and his inner dilemmas are perhaps deserving of more exploration. The book's conclusion feels slightly rushed and predictable.However, the story's strength is in the picture it paints of this post-apocalyptic society. Most of the book's word count goes towards describing the moral views of the society, the intimidating way in which it deals with divergent behavior, the future history which resulted in this world, the relationship between the Earth home world and her scattered colony planets, etc. There simply isn't enough room for much else. The world-building and the technology and attitudes of the future are perhaps the best reason for reading. For the most part it's fascinating stuff, although there are a few places where the story's interest in the more mundane descriptions of futuristic labor-saving devices feels like something out of The Jetsons.I liked THE MAN WHO JAPED and I enjoyed the topics it touches on. However, I couldn't help but feel that it never reached its full potential. Of course, this story is very early in Dick's career and many of the themes that are only briefly explored here would get a much fuller airing in later works."},{"Title":"The Man Who Japed","review":"This was an early attempt by Dick to infuse humor into his science-fiction novels. A minor novel by the standards of his mature work, its flashes of originality and light touches of satire more than compensate for the contrived and improbable plot elements. The novel is set in a society based on the ideology of Morec (Moral Reclamation). Morec regulates individual morality through compulsory block meetings, in which one's friends and neighbors have the opportunity to take one to task for sexual peccadilloes or other lapses from puritanical conformity. Dick based his critique of the state as moral policemen on the structure of Chinese communism. It is not difficult, however, to see the roots of satire in American society, which has a long history of repression, from the Puritans to the Moral Majority. The protagonist is a man working for the media that promotes Morec, but he finds himself unconsciously japing, making fun of, the symbols of the regime. The most interesting part of the novel is when, after he is subjected to reprogramming, he suffers a breakdown in which his entire reality disappears. This episode prefigures themes that will become central in later Dick novels such as Ubik and Valis."},{"Title":"The Man Who Japed","review":"Funny little story about a society completely obsessed with morality. Every bit as relevant today as when Philip K. Dick wrote it in 1956."},{"Title":"The Man Who Japed","review":"This is an early PKD, and probably isn't really worth 5 stars, but I rate it thus anyway, just because hints of work to come show up in this book. This is a story of a very repressive society (read cold war, McCarthy-era USA)and a man who breaks out of the pattern. As with all PKD books, read carefully or you will lose track of where you are."},{"Title":"The Man Who Japed","review":"This book is very short, and it is quite straightforward for PKD. As this is one of his earlier works, I was expecting an extremely outdated view of the future, but surprisingly, PKD kept the details of the mechanisms vague enough that there were no glaring 'futurisms', such as those that jammed the first chapter of \\"The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch\\". Simply stating that they took a ship between planets rather than inventing the Amazing Steam-Powered Punch-Card Engine helped the book a lot.Despite the fact that this book came before PKD really started to 'write outside the box', I was expecting the traditional PKD chestnuts- the nature of reality, psychotherapy, bleak futures, evil robots, etc.- to be mostly overlooked. Happily, he managed to investigate most of his favorite topics without tripping over himself or screwing up the plot, as he did in \\"The Simulacra\\". The plot flowed straight and true, and although one part seemed a little forced, it didn't detract from the book- it was simply a wee bit off.If you are new to PKD, you should give this book a try, but don't expect any cosmic insights, just a good book. You might also try \\"Time Out Of Joint\\". If you are familiar with PKD, you should read this as his inventive take on the good old distopian novel. It is also proof that though the man wrote a lot of mind-bending novels, he could also get a point about individuals in a distopian system across perfectly clearly."},{"Title":"The Man Who Japed","review":"In this delightful early (1956) effort, Philip K. Dick reaches all the way back to Jonathan Swift's \\"A Modest Proposal\\" and all the way forward to Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.To jape is to cut up, to spoof outrageously a la Monty Python. Dick's hero, Allen Purcell, is about to assume the most powerful media position on the planet; at the same time, he is in fear of being imminently arrested for a jape involving the mutilation of a monument to Morec's beloved founder, the infamous Major Streiter.Morec is short for Moral Reclamation, a kind of Moral Majority Heaven on Earth in which any offenses -- most particularly of the sexual variety -- trigger vicious Maoist self-criticism meetings culminating in the loss of one's apartment lease. And without a lease, there's nowhere to go but the outer planets.Philip K. Dick weaves in a number of themes masterfully, from the devastation following a nuclear holocaust to the \\"Health Resort,\\" a scheme for processing those who crack under the strain of Morec. There are juveniles everywhere (not what you think), not to mention the Cohorts, Active Assimilation, the Domino Method, \\"nooses,\\" and the usual panoply of brilliant Dick inventions, such as all food dishes being enclosed in quotes, as in \\"His 'eggs' were cooling on the plate.\\"There are arresting throwaway lines such as when the character of Sue Frost is introduced: \\"Her eyes, he noticed, were an almost colorless straw. A strong kind of substance, and highly polished.\\"Although he has been compared to Borges and Kafka, Dick is very much an American original. THE MAN WHO JAPED's unusual combination of paranoia and a wicked sense of humor is unique, as if Orwell's Winston Smith in 1984 were played by John Cleese."},{"Title":"The Man Who Japed","review":"\\"At seven A.M., Allen Purcell, the forward-looking young president of the newest and most creative of the Research Agencies, lost a bedroom,\\" and so begins the Man Who Japed.This novel, published in 1956, a product of the very early period of Philip K. Dick's career, is an immense step forward from his inferior, disjointed, and amateurish novel, The World Jones Made. The uncanny feeling, which one associates with PKD when reading his later and more famous works, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Martian Time-Slip (Among others), is apparent from the very first line. For example, Purcell's apartment randomly changes shape - his oven is a table that is a sink that is a food cupboard - his intelligent, caring, and somewhat bewildered wife constantly sedates herself with a vast array of drugs - and mankind emigrates to other planets and moons. The most surprising element is Allen Purcell himself, a remarkably well-rounded character (albeit as a previous reviewer noted, the secondary characters are flat as ironed cardboard).Also, the society of The Man Who Japed is remarkably vivid. The reader must remember that this book was written in the late 50s so concepts and societies that we might consider clich&eacute; were fresh off the oven (the totalitarian masterpiece 1984 had only been around for 7 years). The Man Who Japed takes place in 2114 after a nuclear war in a society founded upon Puritanical ideals (no extra marital sex or classic books). Allen Purcell simultaneously creates propaganda 'brochures' and debases symbols of the regime without understanding his own motivations. He eventually must decide if he is to change society.All in all, this is a very good effort. Perhaps in comparison to his later works this might deserve 4 stars but considering how early this was written and what came before 5 stars is definitely the correct rating. It is well written and contains the embryonic manifestations of PKD's later compelling and poignant themes."},{"Title":"The Man Who Japed","review":"At the beginning of this novel, the hero gets in trouble with his client for failing to make the moral content of his product clear enough. That's not a problem with the novel itself - the moral of \\"The Man Who Japed\\" is very plain. Don't run away, though - for a novel concerning the values and limitations of public morals, it's mercifully low on preaching.Allen Purcell lives in a world governed by Morec, which stands for Moral Reclamation, a governmental system developed by one Major Streiter hundreds of years before the story begins, and designed to protect civilization against waste and vice after a nuclear holocaust. Purcell contributes his bit by running an agency that produces scripts for television shows and sells them to the government-run media outlet. Each of these scripts has to have a moral, of course, for the edification of the public. Like everyone else, Purcell also has to lead a morally upright life or face the possibility of eviction from the one-room apartment he shares with his wife Janet, not to mention public disgrace and economic ruin. Mechanical spies crawl all over everything to make sure that he and everyone else tows the line, and he and his neighbors gather in local meeting halls every few weeks to pass judgment on each other.None of this bothers him much, of course - he's used to it and believes in the values he was born into. Then one dark night, someone vandalizes the government's big statue of Major Streiter in a way that turns it into a big joke, and evidence suggests that Purcell did it, although he has little or no memory of the incident.Now, this was one of Philip K. Dick's earliest novels, and you will not be surprised to learn that the moral of the story is a pretty simple affair. Without giving too much away, Allen Purcell begins the story believing that morality consists of following certain rules; he ends it considering the possibility that morality and obedience are two different things. Put in this way, it sounds sort of boring. The best part of \\"The Man Who Japed\\" is that it's actually very funny.A \\"jape\\" is a joke, usually of the practical variety. This is, of course, exactly the kind of joke that Allen Purcell indulges in, at the expense of his culture's Messianic founder. It would be a big mistake to write a story about such an activity in any serious manner, and PKD is too smart for that. On the other hand, as others have pointed out before now, humor is no laughing matter. It's powerful. No tyrant can put up with it for long, from Hitler to Mao to the Devil himself. This is what makes it such a useful weapon against dictatorship, and such a dangerous one to those who wield it. It takes a brave soul to make fun of a tyrant, but wait until you see Purcell's final jape. No kidding, even with the morality police banging on his door, he comes up with something that will make you laugh out loud.\\"The Man Who Japed\\" has some of PKD's early flaws, to be sure. Allen Purcell isn't as much of an Eagle Scout as the protagonists of \\"Vulcan's Hammer\\" or \\"Solar Lottery\\", say - a few self-doubts do creep in to give the character depth - but his inner life is still pretty sparse. We don't see him giving any consideration to what he'll do or why; one minute he obeys the rules he knows, the next minute he rebels. Since we can't see the process leading to this about-face, it seems forced.His wife, on the other hand, makes a remarkable showing. She begins as a bit of a wimp, ready to jump out of her skin at the slightest noise - by the time the novel is over, she's strong, supportive, and courageous. Today's readers may find her too subservient to her husband's way of doing things, but then again he's fighting the good fight and there's nothing particularly wrong with joining that. And besides, this book was published in 1956.Speaking of wives, this is the first PKD novel I've read in a while where the husband and wife not only get along, but actually seem to love each other. There are a few other such couples in this author's body of work, but not many. That in itself is inspiring enough for me, and when you add in the protagonist's struggle against mental illness, his success in fighting off the bad guys by their own rules, and his ongoing insistence on having a good time, \\"The Man Who Japed\\" becomes a genuine pleasure.Incidentally, in one of his last interviews, PKD said that he got the idea for Morec from the Chinese Cultural Revolution, maybe the most blatant attempt in history to force good behavior down people's throats. PKD didn't like that at all. He was a humanist, a devout enemy of oppression wherever it fell - in communism, fascism, or anywhere else. In other words, he was just the sort of writer we need once again, fifty years after \\"The Man Who Japed\\" came out; today, as in 1956, there are those who think morality should be governmentally policed. There's only one thing to do with such people, as PKD shows us. Laugh at them.Benshlomo says, Mock the wicked - it will drive them crazy."},{"Title":"The Man Who Japed","review":"\\"The Man Who Japed\\" is a fairly early Philip K. Dick novel, and as such is somewhat dated, and a little more straight-forward stylistically. In many ways it reads like early Bradbury; those looking for true science fiction will probably be put off by the simplistic technology. However, as with Bradbury, the powerful message transcends the context and drives the novel forward.Like many of Dick's novels, \\"The Man Who Japed\\" is set in a post-apocalyptic future, in this instance, some two hundred years after a nuclear war in the 1970's. Society is now governed by a strict moral code that emphasizes utility over comfort and social enforcement of societal mores. Enter Allen Purcell, an otherwise successful creator of \\"packets\\" (morality propaganda purchased by the state) who has inexplicably \\"japed\\" the statue of Major Streiter, founder of the Morec (moral reclamation) society. As his world begins a slow motion unraveling he comes to question everything about the society that has supported his family for generations.This perspective on morality as the driving force in politics is oddly prescient with today's debates about abortion, gay marriage and the like. Dick, has taken this evolution to its logical, but insane conclusion, in which every person is held to account by their neighbors in what is theoretically a people's court, but which is in fact an on-going witch hunt in which anonymity allows vicious personal vendettas to be aired with impunity.Admittedly, the actual story meanders and is not particularly engaging. While Purcell evolves into a rather intriguing character, by and large the supporting cast is rather two dimensional. To a degree this is understandable, as Dick is after all trying to create a world of cardboard cutouts. Nonetheless, this can make for a rather dry read at times.A short novel with a powerful message, \\"The Man Who Japed\\" offers a glimpse into Dick early in his career. While the wit and thoughtfulness is on ready display, his story-telling abilities are not yet at the level of \\"The Man in the High Castle\\" or \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" As such, this probably isn't the best novel for those new to the author to start, but it will definitely be appreciated by fans of his other work.Jake Mohlman"},{"Title":"The Man Who Japed","review":"This is the earliest of Dick's books that I've read, so far. I can see where his writing got just a little bit smoother later. But this is the same guy, easily recognizable. He evokes a future-scape extremely well, pulling you right into it. There's a density of ideas and level of ambition well beyond his peers. And an engaging sense of humor, which is on display in this book particularly. This one is arguably \\"farce\\" as much as \\"science fiction\\".It pulled me in deeply and entertained me well, while stimulating thought. Great book."},{"Title":"The Man Who Japed","review":"Written by Phillip K Dick in 1956, the story follows Allan Purcell (alias John Coates), a man who writes moral advertising copy (Morec) for his repressive post-modern 22nd century society. For an unknown reason, Purcell goes out and japes (defaces in a funny way) a statue of historical and moralistic significance. He doesn't know why, so he goes to his society's version of a psychologist. Meanwhile, he gets promoted to the head of the entire Morec operation. He gets to decide what is moral.The book takes a surreal look at a future dystopia, where the food dishes are \\"foods\\", everyone is monitored all the time by small robotic cameras, and if you lose your apartment lease, they boot you off the planet into a space colony. My edition is 155 pages. With the state of current techology, I found much of it absurd. Still, having a sense of humor is the entire point!An OK book, perhaps a Morality Satire, itself. Just couldn't get into the characters. They weren't interesting. While a commentary on the society, it didn't move me as a reader. Bored me after I'd gotten used to the gimmicks. Not a book I'd ever want to re-read, though I could see the story behind the story."},{"Title":"The Man Who Japed","review":"Cult sci-fi author Philip K. Dick's third novel, \\"The Man Who Japed,\\" was originally published in one of those cute little \\"Ace doubles\\" (D-193, for all you collectors out there), back to back with E.C. Tubb's \\"The Space-Born,\\" in 1956, and with a cover price of a whopping 35 cents. (Ed Emshwiller's cover for \\"The Man Who Japed\\" was his first of many for these beloved double deckers.) As in Dick's previous novel, \\"The World Jones Made\\" (1955), the story takes place on an Earth following a nuclear Armageddon that has considerably changed mankind's lot. In \\"Japed,\\" by the year 2114, around 130 years after the war's end, society is run in accordance with the principles of Morec (Moral Reclamation). It is a highly puritanical society, in which 18\\" long, buglike robots spy on the populace, weekly neighborhood block meetings chastise the residents' slightest peccadilloes, cursing and neon signs are banned, and premarital sex is taboo. In this world that is still staggering back to self-sufficiency, the citizens live in tiny apartments, drive steam-powered cars at top speeds of 35 mph, and depend on Earth's off-world colonies for its NONsynthetic foodstuffs. Against this backdrop, Dick introduces us to Allen Purcell and his wife, Janet. Purcell is the founder of a small agency, similar to our current-day ad agencies, except that Purcell's bureau makes up \\"packets\\" of propagandistic fodder for Telemedia, the government's communications arm. When Purcell is offered the opportunity to become the head of Telemedia, he is sorely conflicted, as he has recently begun--for reasons unknown, even to himself--to somnambulistically desecrate the statue of Morec's founder in the local park. Why Purcell has been acting so mysteriously, and what he ultimately does as regards Morec, are at the heart of Dick's underrated yet very entertaining short dystopian novel.And yet, short as it is, this is a book that's just chock-full of imaginative touches. Those weekly block meetings, during which neighbor passes judgment on neighbor, are extremely well depicted, and come off as analogies of sorts to the then-recent McCarthy hearings. (\\"More harm is done in one of these sessions than in all the copulation between man and woman since the creation of the world,\\" Allen satisfyingly tells the witch hunters.) Although Dick's pet theme of the elusiveness of objective reality is not explored in this early work, there is still one quite \\"trippy\\" segment--in which Allen awakes in what seems to be another world--that should surely please all the hard-core Dick fans out there. Another bit of strangeness: the \\"Yoda talk\\" that the world's citizens are apt to utilize at any given moment (such as in \\"This an order is\\" and \\"This serious is\\"). Also unusual: the fact that the leader of Morec's government, as well as Telemedia's head, AND all the block wardens, are women; blue-haired bluenoses doing their darnedest to protect society from anything blue! As usual, Dick exhibits a great deal of empathy for his \\"little characters\\" caught up in bizarre situations, and the reader will most likely grow to like the Purcells for the sweet couple they are, despite Janet's incessant pill popping and Allen's dubious mental state. The book is also laced with a fair amount of humor; for example, a few \\"high-speed\\" car chases, a look at verboten reading material (such as \\"The Saturday Evening Post\\" and James Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\") in the radioactive wastes of Hokkaido, and, of course, Purcell's final \\"jape\\" on Morec. The book is consistently, compulsively readable, and an early triumph for Phil, then a young novelist but soon to be recognized as one of the most distinctive and fascinating talents that the sci-fi field has yet produced."},{"Title":"The Man Who Japed","review":"P.K. Dick brings another relatively short novel encapsulating some very good ideas wrapped in a brief but enjoyable story. You can read the synopsis elsewhere, but the overall story is well done, rockets along with plenty of sardonic humour and succinct observations on the characters and society.There are some odd ideosyncracies in the book, most noticably a bizarre grammatical structure that pops up again and again when the characters describe something - \\"This ridiculous is\\" and \\"This dangerous is\\". It makes them often sound like Yoda, with no real explanation. It's most likely an unusually amateur attempt by Dick to further define his future reality, which itself is full of so many gimmicks and gadgets that it's hard to imagine the future being any other way.Insightful, funny and well worth the few pence it is to pick it up now. It was also recently reprinted - 2002, I think - so you don't have to put up with the awful cover displayed here that, incidentally, has nothing at all with the story of the novel!6/10"},{"Title":"The Man Who Japed","review":"Philip K. Dick novels are an acquired taste, and I'm not sure if I've reached the point of fully appreciating the man's talents. While never boring, it seems that he only lets 80% of the material to be logical and leaves the rest to the reader's interpretation/imagination. This is sometimes fun, but often frustrating.'The Man Who Japed' is no different. Philip K. Dick paints a rather ugly picture of the USA some 100+ years in the future (after some nuclear holocaust). The moral majority has run amuck, the Earth is pretty much trashed, and life is miserable for our leading character (an ad executive). Sprinkle in some space travel and some mind-altering nonsense, typical of Philip K. Dick novels, and you have a rather fun if somewhat bewildering story. The author's blasting of the moral majority alone is well worth the price of the book; it must have been a shock when it was first published (mid-1950s).Bottom line: a worthy read, especially for fans of the author."},{"Title":"Judson and Rice talk to Baptists.(Adoniram Judson, Luther Rice): An article from: Baptist History and Heritage","review":"My download of this was a little hard to get.

These annuals are great for deciding bets among fellow enthusiasts and for filling in gaps in memory from seasons past. No motorsport library is complete without a complete set of these annuals.

The race guides are an indespensible piece of information for the serious fan, although they do occasionally miss outstanding performances from the middle or rear of the field, due to the majority of the focus being on the battle at the front, however most details are covered and in very good detail. The summary of the other racing series (F3000, F3, CART, NASCAR, etc) is a very worthwhile addition as it gives a good reference point without having to purchase other literature.

It is filled with concrete examples of archeological findings and artifacts and attemps (succesfully) to describe them from a psychological point of view. The style is clear, easy to read, although some of artifact descriptions have somewhat far fetched interpretations. However, this book not only gives the reader a great historical overview of ancient civilizations and insight into their cultures, but shows quite conclusively the unifying (and underlying) link of the myth of the Great Goddess with all &quot;future&quot; mythologies.

From the beginning of consciousness in the caves through the decline of the Goddess with the emergence of patriarchal warrior cultures where the hero is the focus. Occasionally they lapse into some psychology babble (I don't know what Depth Psychology is) and I believe that they may be over interpreting some of the data. I mean, how can you make an entire story out of some lines scratched on a rock?But in spite of some minor flaws, they are pure of heart, they are attempting to be balanced, they are presenting a natural history. They are trying to be scientists of the spirit. It's as though this is how it all had to happen. They are trying to get us to look at things through a different lens, one that gives an organic sacred prehistoric spin. What were these people really thinking about 20,000 years ago? Structurally we are essentially identical to those people. Why are we like this now? As Ogden Nash said: Progress might have been all right once, but it has gone on too long.They do a wonderful job of discussing the phases of the moon as the goddess. After all, for thousands of years we were outside connecting with the sky. Part of our mass psychoses is the loss of this natural connection.

The two authors spent over ten years researching and writing this book and it shows. The book traces the evolution of the Divine Feminine from Inanna, to Ishtar, to Isis, to Gaia, to Athena, to Aphrodite, to Cybele, to Sophia and more. Excellent resource for both experts and amateurs.As for the blissfully ignorant reviewer who states that matriarchical cultures are feminist pseudo-history, I challenge them to find one reputable scholar/archaeologist who believes otherwise. (By 'reputable scholar/archaeologist' I mean someone who isn't going to try to convince me that God made the world in six literal days...)"},{"Title":"The Myth of the Goddess: Evolution of an Image","review":"I found this book enjoyable and inciteful. It is lengthy but for the most part worth reading through. The book is very concise at showing how wide spread and spiritually diverse the ancient worship of the goddess once was.The major problem with this book is that it is rather biased on its views of ancient cultures and readers should not take most of its information as their primary source of information on this subject. The authors often gloss over the cannibalism and blood sacrifices practiced by the ancient goddess cults, usually in honor of their war goddesses, but they stress the warlike aspects of the Semites and Indo-Europeans, while forgetting that the Indo-Europeans often adopted many of the beliefs of the older cultures.The book, despite being about historical goddess worship, spends a painfully long time talking only about Judeo-Christian views on the divine feminine. It also doesn't mention Islamic views or the beliefs of any culture outside of Europe and the Near East."},{"Title":"The Myth of the Goddess: Evolution of an Image","review":"An excellent book, based on solid scholarship.

The biggest problem is that the author does not build her case on anything more than supposition. there are almost no footnotes or references or anything to indicate that what she is saying is more than opinion of idea. There is no proof for anything she says and then she builds her case on the point that she didn't justify in the first place!

Their book is very comprehensive, well-written, and full of ancient images--a goldmine of information. The authors trace the goddesses of the ancient Near-eastern and Mediterranean world to single goddess named Nammu. In my book NOAH IN ANCIENT GREEK ART,Noah in Ancient Greek ArtI connect their Nammu to the last person listed in the line of Kain (Cain) in Genesis 4:22, the woman Naamah, sister of Tubal-kain. In the ancient languages of the Near-east, it's not the vowels that matter, but the consonants. Nammu is Naamah.In NOAH IN ANCIENT GREEK ART, I show that Nammu/Naamah came through the Flood as Ham's wife. After the Flood, the ancient world turned from Noah and his God and worshiped this woman as Inanna, Ishtar, Astarte, Isis, Asherah, Artemis, Athena, and others, giving her credit for bringing back the way of Kain. All of these goddesses, some in different aspects, evoke the memory of the adored woman, Naamah.Ancient gods and goddesses, with rare exception, are deifications of real people. I present abundant evidence for this in THE PARTHENON CODEThe Parthenon Code: Mankind's History in Marble. In Plato's Dialogue EUTHYDEMUS, Sokrates himself refers to Zeus, Apollo, and Athena as his \\"lords and ancestors.\\" Baring and Cashford miss this key point.

They talk about goddesses of the paeleolithic era, a period of which there is nothing known about religious practices or beliefs, how could there be? The carved images of women found may be goddesses, or they may not. We don't know. That doesn't stop these nutty women laying down the law on the subject though. All the authors of these batty feminist sprituality books should be made to write out the following a hundred times &quot;WORSHIPPING GODDESSES DOES NOT MEAN A SOCIETY IS MATRIARCHAL&quot; .History is full of partiarcahl goddess-worhsippers, Egyptian, Greek and Roman society were full of goddesses, and they were totally male-domonated societies.

Alos they are banging on about moon goddesses as per usual, sun goddesses not getting a mention, though there were plenty. And these women are meant to be psychologists or something, aren't they? They both seem to me to be in urgent need of psychoanalysis themselves."},{"Title":"The Myth of the Goddess: Evolution of an Image","review":"This book took me about a week to finish, and I count it a week well spent. This is, bar none, the best book I've seen yet about the goddess religions of the ancient world. It has its limitations--it mainly covers Europe and the Middle East--but it is amazingly thorough on the stuff it does cover.Many goddess books have the weakness of bad scholarship--they believe that the world used to be a certain way just because someone else told them so, or because they wish it was so. This is not one of them. To give you an example, an issue often in contention between goddess-folks and other researchers is, were the \\"Venus figurines\\" really meant to represent goddesses? Usually, authors either dismiss those statues as pornography, or else laugh off the suggestion that they are pornography with equal disdain. Baring and Cashford tackle the issue head-on, eventually deciding the figures are not simply pornographic based on their abstractness. Writing about prehistory always requires some speculation, but this book is a breath of fresh air in that it provides arguments and evidence every time the authors must make a leap of faith.Baring and Cashford begin there, with the statues of matronly women found in European caves, and trace the transmission of the archetype of the goddess from prehistory to the twentieth century. Each culture was influenced by those before it and near it, and the stories and images they honored can be used as a map of changes in human consciousness. The goddess in ancient times was seen as the spirit of the natural world; as humans began to distance themselves from the natural world, the goddess became seen as a symbol of \\"mere\\" physicality and the god as the \\"higher\\" symbol of spirit. Finally we get the image of Eve, the first sinner, who carries all the ancient goddess symbols for political reasons--the leaders of the time were trying to distance Judaism from the polytheistic traditions of their neighbors. But this image was blown out of proportion--taken as literal history, the story of Eve was used to denigrate the goddess, human women, sex, and nature all at once.Beautifully written, scholarly, and insightful, this is a very good book about the goddess archetype--and doesn't even fall into the common pitfall of assuming that all human women can be defined by this archetype. This is the kind of book that is good for the goddess movement, rather than embarrassing."},{"Title":"The Myth of the Goddess: Evolution of an Image","review":"Quite scholarly and well-educated, Baring and Cashford offer a widely-scoped yet controlled and well-written survey of the Goddesses in ancient religions. At times the interpretations of the artwork may become a little breathy, but as a fellow lover of art I will forgive that. At other times, the authors will stretch to make connections between Goddess traditions(particularly in the chapter on Mary - e.g., as Goddess of War?) that do not quite reach. This book is, however, an excellent overview of the Divine Feminine and moves to revitalize a long-neglected aspect of spirituality. Among their most powerful arguments is the idea that the psyche and the drive for spirituality and religion is a \\"structure,\\" not a \\"process\\": humans possessed a fully matured spirituality by the time they could be called \\"human beings.\\" This helps to open the way for the reader to discover that ancient religions are no more primitive than modern religions, nor modern religions any more sophisticated than ancient ones - they are simply different.

The millions upon millions of men and women who make up the world each carry with them collective unconscious, traditions, religions, values and individuality. Above all, the world today is best described as a complicated imbalance of opposing thoughts- feeling versus thinking. The dualism of mind seperate from matter began with the splitting of God's female principle from his masculine principle. Every devoutly fundamentalist Christian (as well as Jew or Muslim who read the sacred \\"texts\\" as absolute truth) will tell you that God is a man. In the Christian Bible, the Torah and the Koran, God is given masculine attributes- he is a warrior, a conqueror, a father figure, a king, etc. Rarely, does it exalt his feminine qualities- compassion, healing, motherhood, love and kindness. Sparingly, he is described as a mother bird taking loved ones under his protective wings ( I will speak about this further).Anne Baring is a British psychoanalyst specializing in Jungian philosophy, while Jules Cashford is an expert on mythology and folklore. Together, this complimentary duo team of writers have compiled an extensive Bible-size plethora of information on the Goddess. When we speak of \\"the Goddess\\" we refer mainly to the Divine Female Principle. God (power, energy, divinity) is both male and female, and not limited to merely one function- he is neither simply a man nor simply a woman. HOWEVER...as the accurate sources of archaeological, historic evidence proves (the wall paintings of various caves like Lescaux in France and stone figures of pregnant women and various goddess idols of the Middle East) there was a time when the powerful God principle was merely female. The Mother is always the first, direct experience for all of us after we are born ( she provides the child with milk, raises him/her and nourishes him/her child). Because humankind's first life consciousness was the mother, God was thought to be a Mother. The Mother Goddess was worshipped in many forms- a bird flying over the world or the oceans (later this bird image would become the dove of the Holy Spirit). In the Egyptian culture, she was Isis, in Mesopotamia/Canaan she was Asherah, Astarte, and in Greece, Athena and Aphrodite. Female/goddess worship extended in many forms, each of the women were fulfilling various roles and functions- she was a warrior, she was a mother, she was a hunter, she was a cook, she provided all of life. It's very sensible - since women give birth and therefore produce life on earth. The whole earth was a woman. She was even the sun.Later on, Indo-European warriors and expert conquerors demolished the concept of the Goddess, establishing patriarchy. No longer was the one Divinity a Mother, but a Father. Lineage and inheritence was once traced from the mother. The status of power that women once held was seized from them by men. The ancient Jews of Israel conceived the concept of Yahweh or Jehovah as the all-powerful male God who created the world and forbade women worship and women's freedom. The Female Principle was no longer equal to the Male Principle, but subjugated to it. This book is clearly an encyclopedia of how this came about. Extoled is the great female principles in Kabbalah (where she is Sophia or Chokma Holy Wisdom or Holy Spirit). The book also explains the sexist, misogynist points of view from the male writers of the Bible- the figures of Eve as the cause of human suffering, death and sin, the Kabbalah figures of the demonized Lilith, and further examples include the venerated Catholic icon of the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene. This book is a must for feminists , be you a male feminist or female feminist, or anyone man or woman who wishes to balance and integrate his male/female principles in harmony. If everyone did that, the world would be a better place."},{"Title":"The Myth of the Goddess: Evolution of an Image","review":"A &quot;must read&quot; for anyone trying to make sense out of whereour culture is going. The two authors have really done their homework and have tied many important ideas together. This book is what every Christian should read in order to understand the mythic basis for Jesus and Mary. The information doesn't weaken one's christian faith, but rather takes it to a broader perspective of what ego-death and resurrection really mean. The book creates the standpoint of Metamorphosis rather than Apocolypse. Another good book in this realm is &quot;The Great Mother&quot;, Eric Neumann, however, &quot;The Myth of the Goddess&quot; is more readable and fills in more of the story-details.

He doesn't believe in UFOs and she does. She's an assistant to Dr. Garnet Jones, the President of the Society of UFO Watchers (SUFOW) and he's a reporter for The Streeter. But they find they do have something in common.Cody Walker had disappeared for six weeks without a trace, and then reappeared with amnesia. In the year since his return, he hasn't been able to sleep more than a couple hours at a time, has been nauseated, and has had a decidedly lack of interest in women. No amount of probing from doctors can tell him what happened to him for those six weeks.Roberta Vandenburg wants to help Cody find that missing time. She believes he's been abducted by aliens, but doesn't want to tell him, as she's afraid he'll think she's crazy.This is a story of intrigue, how opposites attract and work together to find out the truth, if Cody was really abducted by aliens or just kidnapped. She feels he was once a womanizer, so cannot be trusted, and wants to investigate his friend, Eric, like the psychic Madame Carabini told her to after their visit.Ms. Perkin pulls the reader in from the first page and knows how to keep them enthralled. The interaction of all the characters is very believable. It's heartwarming to see how the heroine wants to help the hero figure out what is really going on about his disappearance, his friends' baby and the way they act towards him. How she learns to believe in herself and him. This is one for the keeper shelf. And what happens when they get their answers?

The rationale for his choices outlined in the Introduction is very compelling and far superior to Berliner's &quot;System&quot; (with its axes to grind) and Shereshevsky's 'Conveyor' repertoire (which was designed for Soviet-era kids with a chance of becoming greats as opposed to plateauing club players like me). Kaufman quotes over 200 recent games or game fragments by 2400+ players using succinct but clear annotations. He favors Silman-esque evaluations in terms of the significant positional features over plus/equals signs, so this is incidentally a good middlegame strategy manual. (The role of the 2 bishops is particularly stressed.) My only regret is that I can't keep the repertoire to myself, as everyone will start playing these lines. -- Oh, and those are: for White, Spanish Exchange, Sicilian Bb5, French Tarrasch, C-K Advance, etc.; and as Black, Spanish Berlin, QGD Semi-Slav (Moscow, not Botvinnik, and a positional Bd6 defense to the Meran). A final and interesting point: the recommendations are validated with but not dominated by computer-checked analysis. As an expert in computer chess, Kaufman is uniquely well qualified to provide this kind of human-machine symbiotic analysis. Even if you don't like the sound of some of these lines, give it a chance: The book is a labor of love, not a &quot;Win as White/Black with...&quot; potboiler."},{"Title":"The Chess Advantage in Black and White: Opening Moves of the Grandmasters","review":"Here is a new book by Kaufman, who is (was) known for excellent writing about computer chess ... approximately 10-15 years ago. (This is my short review; I may post a longer one on my web site.)The basic goal of this book is very singular and specific - to write a &quot;repertoire&quot; book for players who are interested in such things. (A book like this is to provide a student with a program to learn certain openings, in order to be prepared for any possible chess opening that a player might use against them.) The &quot;R.H.&quot; chess meter on the back cover places this book for players who fall between the &quot;intermediate&quot; and &quot;advanced&quot; category. (HINT: Beginners would find this book of little or no use.)I spent a lot of time in this book the past week, I went over most of the lines, and I analyzed some in great detail. My initial impression was very favorable. I can tell you that this is NOT one of those books that were bashed out in a great hurry.The author is very frank and honest with you. He had some very specific goals when he wrote this book. (497 pages!) He did not want to always play the &quot;best and most fashionable lines,&quot; as this can be a very difficult proposition. (After 1.e4, c5; 2.Nf3, d6; the &lt;best&gt; move according to theory, is 3.d4. But this leads to the Open Sicilian, which could take up hundreds of books to really address properly. Instead Kaufman opts for the move, 3.Bb5+. It is simple, effective, and has a high surprise value. Additionally, there is no easy way to get to a draw, and White can still obtain a viable edge out of the opening.) The author avoided lines where castling on opposite sides occurred and everything hangs by one tempo, similarly he avoided other razor-sharp lines ... where the theory is likely to change on an almost daily basis. (He states in the introduction that he wanted to produce a book of lasting value, that might still be viable 10-20 years from now.) The author also used a &quot;committee&quot; of computer programs to help him find the best moves.The author, IM Larry Kaufman, proposes that you play 1.e4, as White. (The core of your repertoire will be the Spanish Exchange. 1.e4, e5; 2.Nf3, Nc6; 3.Bb5, a6; 4.Bxc6, etc.) He provides you with a sensible line for every possible opening that any opponent might try to use against you. There are dozens of very good suggestions in here. (And probably many &quot;TN's&quot; as well.) Kaufman also proposes that you meet 1.e4 with 1...e5; using primarily The Berlin Defense. (An excellent recommendation, a GM co-authored this chapter.) He also advises using the Semi-Slav against an opponent who opens with the Queen Pawn. (1.d4) His list of five criteria on page # 377 shows that much thought went into the choice of openings.There are MANY positives to this book.# 1.) Virtually any opening that a prospective opponent could pick is provided for. Many times, the line that you will use is solid, and very good. Not only do you stand an excellent chance of gaining a very concrete advantage, there is the distinct possibility that your opponent might not have studied these lines.# 2.) ALL the analysis has been meticulously checked with more than one computer program. (I found NO large or major mistakes.) Compare this ... to many other books that I have dealt with lately, where the author claims a computer was used, but the volume is still replete with many errors and mistakes.# 3.) Since many of these continuations are not main line theory, there is little chance that theory will change before you get a chance to use them.# 4.) The author explains the basic ideas and strategies of an opening at the beginning of each section or chapter.I did find a few drawbacks to this book:# 1.) Many of the lines are VERY long, 15-25 moves, (or more). The emphasis here is on being able to memorize a lot of material for your next tournament. (If you forget a line, you might be a dead duck.)# 2.) Many possible - and even likely moves - are not provided for by this author.# 3.) Some of the continuations examined here are distinctly inferior. {For one side.} Many improvements will probably be found before the next edition. (Despite what the author says, I doubt that a book like this would be of much use to a really strong Master, say rated 2400 or better.)# 4.) Some of the games are gross mis-matches. (Page 235 is one such example. White is rated nearly 2600, while Black holds an unimpressive 2215 rating.) I prefer to base my theoretical decisions on games between really strong players with less than a 150 point differential in their respective ratings.But all these questions are secondary to the overall aim and quality of the book. (On a scale of 1-10, I would give the author at least a 7.5 here.) This is an in-depth and high-quality book that deserves very serious consideration. Players rated 1000-2300 ... that have been searching for a REAL repertoire ... will find this book enormously helpful. Postal players will probably find that this book is a MUST!!In closing, I truly liked this book; and give it a high recommendation."},{"Title":"The Chess Advantage in Black and White: Opening Moves of the Grandmasters","review":"Should you pick chess openings that suit your style? Of course you should. But there are considerations that may restrict your choices. Some openings concede your opponent a choice of moves that offer such a big advantage that studying them is a waste of time. And others, such as the Marshall Gambit against the Ruy Lopez, are so good that most of your opponents will avoid them.This book has some suggestions that you may want to try, just to see if they suit you. My point is simple. If you do indeed like some lines in this book, you can be sure that they make sense, they score well at any level of chess, and you can get to play them. In addition, the openings are solid enough so that studying them is worthwhile. And the author checked his analyses using three strong software packages (\\"Fritz 8,\\" \\"Junior 8,\\" and \\"Hiarcs 8 and 9\\").With White, Kaufman suggests an Exchange Ruy. No Flohr-Zaitsev-Karpov Variations. No Breyers. No Chigorins. No Marshalls. No Moellers. No Archangelsks. And no Open Variations! Instead, those who want to avoid your Exchange Variation after 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5 will have to try the Steinitz (3...Nf6 4 0-0 d6), the Bird (3...Nd4), the Cozio (3...g6), the Schliemann (3...f5 4 d3), the Classical Berlin (3...Bc5 4 0-0 Bc5 5 Ne5), or the Berlin proper (3...Nf6 4 0-0 Ne4 5 Re1 Nd6 6 Ne5 Be7 7 Bf1). And those who want to avoid all this on move two will need to choose among the Russian (2...Nf6), the Philidor (2...d6), the Latvian (2...f5 3 Ne5), and the Elephant (2...d5 3 ed). This book tells you how to do well against all these choices. As for the Exchange Ruy itself, let's just say that I'd much rather have White than Black in it!With White against the Sicilian, the author advises 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 d6 3 Bb5+. And 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5. Um, okay. That avoids the dangerous Najdorf variation. And the Kalashnikov. And the Dragon. While White has fine chances in these Open Sicilians, the games become very tactical. But that does leave us without a very scary line against 1 e4 c5 Nf3 e6 (with Black aiming to play a Scheveningen or a Taimanov). Since we're refusing to play 3 d4, that means 3 b3 (or 3 d3). Still, these are not bad choices, and I can understand why Kaufman recommends them.Against 1 d4 (and in many cases, 1 c4 or 1 Nf3 since White often starts with any of these moves to get into a Queen's Gambit), Kaufman recommends the Semi-Slav, and the variation 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 Nc3 c6 4 Nf3 Nf6 5 e3 Nbd7 6 Bd3 dc 7 Bc4 b5 8 Bd3 Bd6 in particular.Still, I think the best part of this book is the defense to 1 e4. Let's have some applause for the Berlin Defence to the Ruy Lopez, please! Very few books devote so much space to playing it with Black (19 carefully analyzed games!). The main line leads to an endgame where Black often has the Bishop pair (or a Bishop against a Knight). Sometimes, the Black King winds up safely on the Queenside, on b7 or c6, supporting the Black pawn majority there (with these pawns on the opposite colored squares from White's missing Bishop). I'd rather have Black than White in such positions. And the whole idea is better than, say, the Marshall Gambit, because that just turns into an Anti-Marshall or an Exchange Variation much of the time. The Berlin line is 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5 (3 Bc4 Bc5) Nf6 4 0-0 (4 Qe2 Bc5) Ne4 5 d4 (5 Re1 Nd6 6 Ne5 Ne5 7 Re5+ Be7 8 Nc3 0-0) Nd6 6 Bc6 (6 de Nb5 7 a4 Nbd4) dc 7 de Nf5 8 Qd8+ Kd8 9 Nc3. Here Kaufman recommends 9...Ke8, but he also analyzes both 9...Ne7 and 9...Bd7 which, if you can get away with one of them, can lead to the excellent endgame I was just talking about.This is a carefully written book and I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Chess Advantage in Black and White: Opening Moves of the Grandmasters","review":"The Chess Advantage in Black and White by IM Larry Kaufman is something new. There have been many opening repertoire books have appeared before but either they aim merely to get the student out of the opening at all costs or demand large chunks of time to memorize lines for an opening advantage at the 2500 level. A good example of the second type of repertoire book is the excellent series on 1.Nf3 by GM Alexander Khalifman.Kaufman's proposed repertoire, 1.e4 as White with the Exchange Ruy and Bb5 versus the Sicilian and the Semi-Slav and Berlin Ruy Lopez as Black, won't blow opponents off the board, but has sufficient venom to fight for an opening advantage. The advantage of this kind of repertoire is that theoretical study becomes much more manageable when you escape the highway of trendy theory.Most of the book is IM Kaufman and some of his silicon friends. Computer analysis can often be useful but definitely benefits from tweaking by a knowledgeable user. Kaufman is certainly a knowledgeable user that has been at the cutting edge of computer chess development for many years.The repertoire itself is quite reasonable. It seems like the Rossolimo Sicilian (3.Bb5) appears more often as 3.d4 these days. Certainly the Semi-Slav (Meran and Moscow variation) is no stranger to GM chess. I also like the idea of advocating the subtle Berlin defense.Few openings strike terror into the heart of a chess fan like the Berlin Defense. Using it like a virtuoso, Vladimir Kramnik not only won the (a?) world chess championship from Garry Kasparov, but also, simultaneously, succeeded in putting thousands of chess lovers into a coma-like state. Okay, let's grant that the Berlin isn't the Botvinnik Variation of the Semi-Slav or the English Attack in the Najdorf. What it is, however, is mysterious and annoying to many players - and that's a fact that we as chess players, as opposed to chess fans, can certainly use! If we play and understand the Berlin and our opponents play natural, normal moves, we will have excellent winning chances! Best of all, while the games will be long, some themes are pretty straightforward. The power of the two bishops, a little patience, and ...the Berlin Defense - it will be worth your while.The Chess Advantage in Black and White provides a solid repertoire but begs the question exactly who is it aimed for. Players below 1500 FIDE will see 500 pages of analysis and throw their hands up. Super GMs will want more than the clear pluses for White that the repertoire leads to. My guess is that this book best serves players in the FIDE 2200-2500 range who are ambitious about their chess and who want save precious time on study.Deeply Recommended"},{"Title":"The Chess Advantage in Black and White: Opening Moves of the Grandmasters","review":"This is a great repertoire book.

As you might expect from a mathematician, his primary criterion for selecting a repertoire is numerically-calculated past performance by rating. This trust-the-numbers approach produces a repertoire that could put anyone to sleep. It is all early endgames and quiet variations. Hey, I like to play endgames, but this repertoire goes way overboard in that direction. You might call it the Stillwater Repertoire. It is for people who despise tactics, hate sharp positions, and cannot stand attacking the opponent's king. It is the Quaker Repertoire. It is the Pacifist's Last Stand. It is the Repertoire for Nodding Off In Math Class.Kaufman maintains that his soporific suggestions are perfect for battling higher-rated opponents. When things are very quiet, you might hang on for a draw, and maybe even occasionally win. That is an old ploy: against better players, steer the game into quiet waters. Like most old ploys, it fails miserably. Strong players always jump at the chance to grind you down in a long endgame. That is what they do best. Against lower-rated opposition, they are much more concerned about sharp positions, where one blunder might lose the game for them. Well, they will never face a sharp position against any sucker who plays the Pacifist Repertoire.With White, Kaufman suggests 1. e4. Against 1. ... e5 Kaufmann recommends the ultra-quiet Exchange Variation of the Ruy Lopez. It could be called the Endgame Variation. Against 1. ... c5 you can play the silent Rossolimo and Moscow variations with Bb5, except after the move-order 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6, when Kaufman varies with the Super-Ultra-Quiet 3. b3. Yes, your main weapons as White will be sustained efforts to bore your opponents to sleep. You can probably guess what will happen against the French: that's right, the Tarrasch, the Quietest One. Ditto for the Pirc (h3 variations), the Caro-Kann (the Advance variation), and Alekhine's Defense (early Be2 and O-O). You could play these lines for a year without attempting one kingside attack.As you may have guessed, with the Black pieces Kaufmann recommends the quietest first moves for Black: 1. e4 e5, and 1. d4 d5. Your main weapon against 1. e4 will be--you guessed it--the Berlin variation of the Ruy Lopez. Yes, the favorite of Kramnik, a GM noted for continuously drawing, especially with black. Catch Kramnik's new book, \\"My 60,000 Memorable Draws,\\" where half the games are Berlins. I tried the Berlin Ruy for quite awhile online. It is excruciatingly uncomfortable. Your king can barely move. Your bishops can barely move. Your rooks cannot get out. Oh, and your bishop pair might be worth something by move 144, but probably not, as one of your holy men gets traded long before then. Against the King's Gambit, the Scotch, the Vienna, etc., Kaufmann found lines that rush the queens off the board (perhaps he dislikes queens) and steer directly into Quietville Junction. Keep the rules of chess handy if you take up this repertoire, because periodically you will forget how the queen moves and what she looks like.Against 1. d4 Kaufman recommends the quietest possible variation of the Semi-Slav, with ... Bd6 against almost everything, which GM Arthur Bisguier has used for decades as a drawing weapon. Most of the Meran variations reviewed by Kaufmann lead to rapid exchanges and early endgames. Kaufmann gives reassurances that you will grind out victories against lower-rated opponents. Not that you will enjoy fighting for the full six hours against an opponent rated 300 points below you, struggling to prove that your bishop is slightly better than his knight, when you know that he would have folded by move 28 had you played a normal opening. If you play this repertoire, you may motivate the tournament organizers to make a special endurance prize, just for you, for being the very last to finish his game in every single round of the tournament.Unlike everyone else, Kaufmann takes seriously the weird mathematical conclusions that he published in an infamous Chess Life article. He analyzed a big database and came up with some pretty strange theories. He maintained, for example, that the bishop pair is worth half a pawn. That remark provoked sardonic cracks in innumerable chess books and articles. Kaufman's trust-the-numbers dogmatism is the opposite of what you learn from Silman or Soltis, who teach you how to fight for an advantage on either side of the bishop pair. Another eccentric conclusion was that a rook pawn is worth more when it gets doubled on the knight file after capturing toward the center. So Kaufmann hilariously keeps commenting on how, in this or that opening variation, your position is improved after your opponent \\"promotes\\" your rook pawn to a doubled knight-pawn. All these bizarre numbers-are-gods comments cannot be read with a straight face.Instead of taking Kaufman's suggestions, fire up your database and start scanning through games, quickly and easily, until you notice openings that lead into the kinds of positions that you find appealing, positions that you enjoy playing, and can therefore play well. That is how tournament players select an opening repertoire. It is a personal matter. The opening repertoire suitable for one player is unlikely to be suitable for another. People are different, and prefer different kinds of positions. This is the major argument against any opening repertoire book. Kaufmann's repertoire may be suitable for Kaufmann himself, but people are different, so it is unlikely to be the preference of anyone else. Save your money and buy some other book that is more likely to be useful."},{"Title":"The Chess Advantage in Black and White: Opening Moves of the Grandmasters","review":"I was amazed to discover that the book has no index, no key for opening moves etc. You either have to know his name for the openings and variations, perhaps generally known but not by me, hunt page by page for the proper line.

Also the lack of an index was curious.Particularly troublesome for me was the skimpy chapter on the Center Counter, a very popular club level response to e4.The author suggests the following move order if the black queen retakes the pawn.1. e4 d52. exd5 Qxd53. Nf3?The third move is dubious. The average club player will respond as black with the natural Qe4+, which the author NEVER MENTIONS! This is a sinful oversight.How to respond to the check? You will never know by reading this book.Fritz 8 responds as white with Be2, and yes, white can develop naturally and have a decent game, but he is NEVER going to achieve positional superiority unless black goofs. And if white makes a mistep with the enemy queen on the front porch he is DOOMED. This is too dangerous.As black, you can confound anyone using this \\"second best system\\" in 3 moves!Also there are annoying errors, like when the author says to see Game 2 for how to handle the queen's recapture of the pawn, but he really means Game 3.Simply put, this book, by choosing less critical lines, lets black off the hook far too easily.As white, the choice of the \\"exchange variation\\" of the Ruy Lopez is also suspect in my opinion. It allows a club level player to equalize almost immediately.I would suggest getting two books -- as white, a book on the \\"King's Indian Attack\\" system, and a \\"complete defense for e4 and d4\\" book. Then go from there. You will be sure to find something more suitable to your individual style.In closing, I think this would make a nice \\"gift\\" book for someone getting serious about chess.

I am not sure where this analysis comes from but it does not hold up.Let's take one example page 297, has a variation of the Italian game. It is game 7. The note for move 12 says that white can not stand to play a3 because of ... Ba6. Well, the delorie computer webpage basically disproves that quite simply. The basic point is that black has a bishop that is hanging. He has no time to play either ...c5 or ...Ba6. After ...Bxd2 13. Qxd2 Ba6 black does not seem to have a way to get at the \\"stuck\\" king. Since white simply plays Qc2 and Ng5 is aways a threat. This whole line seems to be predicated on some wild dream.

He explains how to recognize dangers and danger areas, and how to avoid them as well. This book helps clear a lot of naivety and demonstrates how YOU can become ONE LESS VICTIM without relying on paranoia and sensationalism, just on hard-earned truths and stunning true life examples.This is a highly recommended book for all walks of life to read. The difference between a victim and a survivor is how to read the signs of impending dangers and learning how to avoid these potentially life threatening problems.

The book also contains references and sources for the claims being made, which I also find refreshing. Theories and \\"research\\" pulled out of an authors behind get old fast, so I'm glad that this book was well researched.Since most people tend to at least somewhat fall into the category of victim or abuser in at least some situations in their life, this is a good book to read to recognize this within ourselves, so that we have something to work on. Why do our coworkers and bosses treat us the way they do, why do certain people belittle us, why do relationships not work out... This book helps us to see the patterns which we have brought with us over time, and keep repeating. It also gives steps to overcome these patterns, first with recognizing them within oneself.Good point which actually work are given for avoiding being conned or attacked by someone.

Doug Setter speaks to awareness, attitude, the way you carry yourself, and preparation. Most valuable is his discussion of the types of people who commit crimes. He profiles the criminal mind to help us from becoming victims. Sometimes a simple change such as crossing the street will foil a criminal. Trust your gut, he tells us. If you sense trouble, it's there. People not used to crime, sometimes walk right into it because they are too unaware, too trusting. Just as animals can sense a weaker animal, so do criminals watch us. They want easy marks and fast rewards.Criminals rarely blame themselves. Successful crime feeds their egos. For some people, violence is a normal part of life. It's how they grew up and learned to behave. Burglars often use a three-person model: the finger who finds the mark, the burglar, and the fence. Batterers can be psychopathic, over controllers, and their behavior tends to be cyclical. Again, they like weaker people and do what they can to isolate victims.He notes that the hero who helps can become the victim when the others involved blame him. A recent US example occurred when a mall security person broke up a fight. One of the fighters shot and killed the guard. The fighters ran off together and remain uncaught. He tells us that every student can expect some form of theft. Every parent has the right to speak to the school principal about a child's safety and demand protection. Don't let school leaders hide the truth. You have every right to ask questions and learn school policies and practices. He speaks of the church hiding pedophiles.He says to check out everything and everyone before purchasing anything or using any service. Avoid bad areas by checking them out, also. He gives us the signs of trouble based on his experience and research. This sobering book provides a much needed attitude adjustment for all of us.

This book does nothing to prevent rape! I was walking home the other night from the library with this book in hand when three larger men appeared out of nowhere and grabbed me and thrusted me against a brick wall. My first instinct was to read passages out of this book to warn them about the horrible dangers and implications of rape. That did not work. Then I tried to use this 128 page contraption of paper as a deadly weapon. That, however, also did not work. I was then raped by the said men and was left on a sewer drain covered in sweat, blood, and tears. Not once did this book step up and prevent me from getting raped. It failed its only purpose. This book needs to come with some sort of disclaimer saying that it in no way shape or form will prevent you from getting raped. In my opinion, this author is just spreading lies, providing some source of false security that will always fail to protect you whenever the time comes. Do not buy this book."},{"Title":"No Good Deed (Berkley True Crime)","review":"A very good book and easy read, this was a very interesting case, more interesting than the description actually. Two ordinary people who hardly fit the profile of murderers with some insight of \\"why\\".. but then we really never know why exactly. I wish this author would write more books about local cases, as a former detective he has all the experience and understanding of the law enforcement processes."},{"Title":"No Good Deed (Berkley True Crime)","review":"I read this book after reading a documentary on the case. I was hoping to obtain a more in depth treatment of the case and its principal characters. What you will get is a mostly one-sided law enforcement, fairly shallow take on the participants, which does a disservice to the integrity of the story. The actual crime and trial, were pretty straight forward, and it would be hard to make it too gripping, since the solution fell into the lap of the police when Ny Nourn, the female participant, who agreed to lure the victim to his death, came forward.There was no attempt to bring the perpetrators to life, other than as criminal actors, and in fact, Mr. Basinski appeared to take great joy in making fun of Ron Barker (e.g., how he looked like a \\"grouper\\"), who tried to defend himself in court.A good portion of the first third of the book was largely devoted to the police chasing the wrong trail, which becomes dull since the trail truly leads nowhere. The book picks up when Ny Nourn comes forward, but suffers from the author's tendency to editorialize and make assumptions about the varius partcipants' behavior.The most glaring example of Mr. Basinski's bias towards the police is his total defense of their investigation, including their failure to follow up in detail with Ny Nourn who had called David Stevens, the victim, at home the day before and was vague about why she did (see page 55). They spent alot of time talking to dancers and checking their prints against finger prints at the victim's home, but did not take the time to obtain prints from someone who had contact with the victim, and did not question why someone from work would not just call work for a schedule (Ms. Nourn claimed she called for this reason). Mr. Basinski's response was, \\"What should [Detective] Young have done, drag Ny Nourn in and angrily demand that she 'give it up'?\\" No, but when I read this, as someone with my own experience in the criminal justice system as a prosecutor and defense attorney, I could not help but feel that the police had missed a BIG clue and may have unnecessarily lengthened the case.I do not recommend this book, except that it will give some detail on how the trial and some of the appeals proceeded and I personally do not know of another book out there on this case. Note: The book was written before Ny Nourn's re-trial and does not include information on all the appeals."},{"Title":"No Good Deed (Berkley True Crime)","review":"David Stevens was a normal, average nice guy, leading a relatively innocuous life in his new home in California. The 38-year-old single man called himself a \\"California virgin,\\" since he hadn't been with anyone since his move from Nebraska. And yet, a couple of days before Christmas, his body was found in his burning convertible along a road near La Jolla, outside San Diego. He'd been shot twice in the head.The police had virtually nothing to go on -- who in hell, or on earth, would want this poor man dead? The only hint came in two sets of handprints on the mirror above the victim's bed. One set belonged to David; the other set was a tiny pair of hands. Some time before he died, police theorized, he lost his \\"California virgin\\" status, but the female prints were not on file. Whatever happened that night, it seemed, the unfortunate man paid for it with his life.The San Diego PD was stumped. Days turned to weeks, to months, to years... then they finally got the break that justice demanded, which led them to an infernal pair of killers. The story of the investigation of the Stevens case has been featured on A & E's Cold Case Files and is the subject of No Good Deed by author Tom Basinski, himself an experienced homicide detective. I read this book, and it impressed me on two levels: one, the prose and structure of the story kept me flipping pages at a clip; two, the dogged, dreary, and often thankless investigative work by the homicide squad led to a resolution in a case that, by all accounts, should have remained cold. I'd recommend the book for anyone who enjoys true crime, especially the police procedurals."},{"Title":"No Good Deed (Berkley True Crime)","review":"If you like a mystery, true crime, or both, NO GOOD DEED is the book for you. Former homicide detective Tom Basinski recounts, in a sometimes chilling manner, the long, tedious, frustrating investigation into the murder of 38-year old David Stevens, a guy who \\"didn't have an enemy in the world.\\" (Until he was found burned up in his car with two bullet holes in his head.)The case took three years for San Diego cops to solve, with many twists and turns along the way. Every time a glimmer of hope appeared toward solving the case, it disappeared just as rapidly. Once the arrests were made things really got interesting.Right after the preliminary hearing, one of the homicide defendants attempted to contract for the murder of the co-defendant's defense attorney.The book is a good police and court procedural work too. Basinski educates the reader on the vagaries of the criminal justice system and the realities of prosecuting a senseless murder. While it sometimes appears the cops are spinning their wheels, working on leads that go nowhere, that is exactly how some murder investigations go. The problems will be as frustrating to the reader as they were to the homicide cops. Basinski's wry cop sense of humor might even provoke a smile or two.The presence of a private investigator/investigative reporter with an overactive ego add extra drama to this gripping story.Christmas is coming. Do a good deed, and buy NO GOOD DEED."},{"Title":"No Good Deed (Berkley True Crime)","review":"The story in itself is interesting, but not landmark. But what really hurts this book, is the writer. It reads as if written on some teenage boy's blog. Along with unneccessary commentary, Basinski includes constant comparisons to the O.J. Simpson trial. This opinion is not supported by actual research, by like so much of the book-mere commentary of the author. From page 191,\\"Maybe, in a burst of optimism, the defense attorneys might hope for a second-degree murder verdict based on Ron Barker's uncontrolled rage. Stranger things have happened. Remember a guy named O.J. Simpson?\\"Granted, many people joke about O.J. Simpson's innocence. However such jokes seem grossly out of place and read as unprofessional in such a book.It is if the whole book was written by free-association after doing the research. The author will switch from narrative writing to what one can only assume are his thoughts on what the person he is observing is thinking. Considering he supposedly interviewed many of these people, such liscense should not be allowed.There are also annoying little quips interjected throughout the text. After a defense lawyer's questioning where he asks for a dismissal for his client due to the fact that she was not involved with the cause of death, Basinski writes, \\"Yes, Mr. Stevens. I'm sorry to inform you your son's death was caused by two bullet wounds to the head and a gallon of gasoline.\\" It's more a statement than the intended witty quip.There are many better books out there to spend your money on. I would recommend almost any other one."},{"Title":"No Good Deed (Berkley True Crime)","review":"Ex-Cop Tom Basinki's writing in No Good Deed is the non-fiction equal to Michael Connelly's fictional cop procedure books. Basinski and Connelly are the best pros around. If you want to know how real cops work No Good Deed tells it like it is. If you want phony story or cute fictional devices go someplace else. If you are a budding mystery writer No Good Deed is a great primer."},{"Title":"No Good Deed (Berkley True Crime)","review":"That has got to be one of the worst books I have read in a long time. It actually took me forever to read because it was so boring. I almost put it down and gave up many times, but hate the fact that I wasted money on this.

The murder of David Stevens was puzzling to the police and devastating to the Stevens family, as he had no dark side, no enemies, nothing that would cause him to be murdered so brutally. The only evidence was a set of palm prints on a mirror. The detectives had theories about what happened to David, and ran down every lead, but the only progress they made was ruling out suspects. The Stevens family felt the murder wasn't a priority, it wasn't solved in a timely manner, and they weren't being kept informed. They soon got caught up in a private detective's fantasy-world hypotheses and went public in their criticism of the police. After three years and nothing new happening, a call came in from a woman who claimed to have information on the murder. The story picks up, and we find out the strange and sad tale of David's last hours. If Ny Nourn had not come forward (for whatever her reasons were), the case may never have been solved, although I believe her involvement was more than what she testified to."},{"Title":"No Good Deed (Berkley True Crime)","review":"This book is quite well-written.

The thing that I enjoyed most was the attention to details in all of the publications. As with every roleplaying game I have ever played, there were a few things in the game mechanics that just didn't work well, or could be done better. Because I didn't want to abandon the incredible world of Warhammer, many house rules came about to solve my troubles with the existing system. I am happy to say that most (if not all) of my issues with the old system were addressed in the new edition. In that respect, the new edition is fantastic, possibly perfect. (in my humble opinion) That all being said, I am woefully disappointed at the lack of attention to detail regarding the FAR TO NUMEROUS typos throughout the book. We're talking about HUNDREDS, folks. There are spelling errors, repeated words, incomplete sentences...whoever proof-read this thing should be fired. I would not care if there were a just few, but there are so many that I sometimes struggled to understand what they were trying to say with the text!In a nutshell, kudos to the game design team, my prayers were answered.

This is a concise core book that is great for players and DMs alike. Being used to a D&D type of world, it's hard to get used to the idea that magic is ultra rare and frowned upon due to Chaos.

The core book is a must of course. ;)"},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"Long-time gamers searching for a change of pace should definitely take a look at Warhammer Fantasy RPG's unique setting and d10/d100 system. I enjoy it much more than your typical d20 system, and the Old World \\"low fantasy\\" setting feels more gritty and realistic than your typical D&D game. You don't have to worry about picking the right class and skills, either; your starting profession, skill set, and gear is a package mostly determined by the dice and you take it from there. Since everything is based on D10 and percentage rolls, it's easy to determine your character's limitations and strengths. This makes a campaign easy to get started, even for new players that don't know all the rules since game play is very intuitive and moves along smoothly. Experienced GM's- give this one a try. Fun alternative to your d20 games, and it's also a great way to introduce new players to RPG's. The book itself is very high-quality and gorgeous. There's enough information here to put together a variety of campaigns and there's so many careers and paths to take your characters that you'll never be at a loss for something new."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"I've started running WFRP now, and have purchased a lot of the books.

My only real problem with this book (and Sigmar's Heir - the book about the empire) is that I'd REALLY like to see more maps.As a GM, WFRP seems pretty deadly for basic career characters. Definitely run your group through a few mock combats before creating your module's encounters so you can get a feel for how fast they'll die.

This is not an updated version of the old Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, but is instead a whole new version with new updated and streamlined rules and background. However those already familiar with the old Warhammer Roleplay will find the new rules very familiar and easy to adapt to.Other than the rules themselves (which are very good by the way, especially the new magic system) the most notable feature is the background and world setting for this game. When this new version of Warhammer was started, the designers decided to make the background of the Roleplaying game match that of the Tabletop Wargame by Games Workshop (Warhammer Fantasy Battles). Thus the RPG is set in the wake of the recent Storm of Chaos that swept the Old World, and thus Fantasy Battle fans will find that a lot of material is already familiar to them in this new edition.This book deserved 5 out of 5 stars for its rating because of how well it is put together. The book itself is very visually appealing (with great interior art), the game mechanics are well balanced and work very well, and the background and story of the world is unique, making this an excellent RPG product to buy. If you are looking for a new gaming system, one that involves a much darker and dangerous world than your typical gaming systems, a world of grim adventure, indepth roleplay, and many other great features, then Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay might be just what you are looking for."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"WFRP is one of best ever made fantasy RPG.

Combat is bloody, the world is gritty and the player characters are doomed antiheroes. A sampling of PC occupations: bonepicker (a thief that steals valuables from corpses), camp follower (prostitute), ratcatcher and servant. Spell casters get access to many spells and are not limited to the number of times they can cast them. The catch is they could go insane or accidentally summon a demon that could bite their head off. PCs are vulnerable to insanity and disease (in the case of one nasty plague, the \\"bloody flux\\", the cure is almost worse than the disease). And should your character live to the ripe old age of 35, it's likely he'll be missing a limb or an eye. And magic items? Never heard of them!Great game for those who want a change from the high fantasy to something more realistic. The game book contains everything the players and GM need to play: PC creation, adventure creation, world background, monsters, and brief introductory scenario. Since Warhammer scenarios have a distinctive feel, I'd also recommend \\"plundered vaults\\" and the \\"character pack\\". At the cover price, this book is a bargain compared to D&D;, as all the info is contained in one volume.My only gripe is the introductory scenario has some design flaws and isn't all that thrilling.

It deserved better, but was more expensive to buy due to being imported, and never built up the fan base needed to keep it going. Games Workshop has alternated, over the years, between supporting it directly, licensing it out (as now, to Green Ronin) and ignoring it--but it won't go away, because it _does_ have lots of European fans, as well as an American fanbase.This long-overdue revision of the game fixes some game-mechanic problems, and continues to be reasonably compatible with the Warhammer Fantasy Battle background (a big part of the trouble WFRP had, I am told, was that Games Workshop kept changing the WFB background, and insisted that WFRP continue to be consistent with WFP) but although this revision is good, on the whole, there are some things I'd change.The book is printed on slick paper, with type against a pseudo-\\"parchment\\" background. This makes it more difficult to read, and pushes the price of the book itself up somewhat, as does the hard cover. While the hard cover can be defended, I'd personally much prefer black type on _white_ paper; I don't need to pretend that my game rulebook is some ancient tome, no matter how cool it looks."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"I'm 37 years old and grew up playing AD&D.

The original WFRPG was an awesome feat of character development in a rich and ... to my taste... grimmer world than much of what D&D; had to offer at the time (and still does imo). As the other noted, there are problems with spelling errors and such, so I do not have to go into that. Here are some suggestions though for the future of Warhammer FRPG and I do hope that you designers take note of what I am about to suggest as these are important (at least for me):1) create a system to bring the old characters I might have into the new rule system as there are many rule updates that need to be fixed with the old characters that I have. There is a need for linking the past to the present.2) link the rules to the Warhammer Fantasy Battle system. I want to be able to take my characters on and off the battle fields of the Warhammer world, it would be nice to have rules linking one to the other.3) go like you are going in terms of creating adventurers. What is so nice about Warhammer games is that you can go from one campaign in a city to the horrors of the wilderness in no time flat. No going from room a to b to c like D&D; is at times.4) have a companion with statistics for many of the characters both good and bad that we love from the Warhammer novels, I'd enjoy seeing my chars move along behind the trails of those like Konrad.5) stay focused dont decide to put out a suppliment for every single thought that comes to mind. One of the problems I have with 3.5 D&D; is that there are too many books coming out that seem to flow over unto one another and are unneeded. Focus on one suppliment at a time.I would suggest Warhammer to any true player and game master. The world is rich in gothic horror and high adventure, while the character development is simple so that you wont have to look up in the rule book every other minute to see if you can do or not do a certain action. Easy. Complete. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"One wonders why there was a need to re-do what was a very good product in the first place. It is now a much trimmer book, without some of the scenarios that were in the earlier edition, and with a combat system relying upon the same die roll, which makes armor even more useless than it was before. These are just two of the criticisms I have of the game, though for the most part it still evokes the Warhammer universe well. If you have the original, I would stick with it, and just get the latest scenario books. There just does not seem to be enough in this new edition to justify the revision."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"A Fantasy role playing game from those whacky guys that made Warhammer 40K. As a consequence, this is much grimmer, nastier and dirtier than some of the fantasy roleplaying games out there, so if that is not your thing, and you want a more lighthearted high fantasy type of approach, then do not get this game, you likely will not enjoy it at all."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"This book is a must-have for the serious gamer. I have even found it easily adaptable to d20 rules and use it in the D&D campaign I run. Great low fantasy setting without all the weird races, classes, etc. that are in new D&D books coming out nowadays. Just classic fantasy with surprising depth."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"I've seen a lot of fantasy games, and a whole heck of a lot of RPGs in general. Probably over a hundred. And this is the best fantasy game I've ever seen (and easily the best I've ever played).It supports political intrigue, mystery, horror, adventure, even black comedy, all with a strictly defined setting. It does not do \\"epic\\" fantasy, a la Lord of the Rings, but all it's tropes still apply. People used to more epic fantasy should definately not try to take metagame logic from that system to WFRP (if, say, a band of goblins that outnumbers the party approaches, it's alright to outright attack them in most fantasy games. Better to negotiate or hide in WFRP, as combat is quite debilitating).The combat system is detailed enough to give the tactics one wishes for, but also light enough that one doesn't fall asleep waiting for his/her turn. Even better, the incentive to dodge combat all together, as it tends to be quite deadly. WFRP doesn't have the reputation of \\"Call of Cthulu: The Dark Ages\\" for nothing, though this title is a bit misleading.In Warhammer, it's good to keep in mind that even the weakest peasant with a rusty dagger can still kill the mightiest hero in the land in one stab (it's possible, just highly improbable)The magic system is corruptive and elegant. There is a price to pay for the powers one wields in the game. The magic system is not of the \\"Fire and Forget\\" variety (see D&D;).All the standard fantasy monsters are present, from Orcs to Dragons, some with very similar intentions, some with a twist. I highly recommend getting the Old World Bestiary with this product, should you buy it, as the bestiary in the core is serviceable but not very wide in scope (Mostly orcs, mutants, and undead)There are a few flaws with the game, mostly due to this reviewer's pickiness. I have an all-or-nothing policy when it comes to randomness in character creation. This game has the vast majority of character creation as random roll (stats, careers, etc), but still allows the player to pick a very important aspect: Race.Looking at the races, it is obvious that there is a succession of power, where Halflings/Humans are at the low end, and Elves/Dwarves are at the high end. For this reason, the first game of WFRP I ever played involved only Elves as characters. It wasn't even fully intentional, I'm sure, but everyone's powergaming roots were showing. So I decided to make Race random roll, placing the odds heavily in favor of everyone playing Human (around 60% chance), and my next, more mixed party made more sense.That's another quick perception one must make, while balance (game balance that is) really doesn't have a place in Warhammer (where one character can be a Noble and another a Peasant), nor does powergaming.After this, and utilizing all the random roll options in the book, WFRP chargen (character generation) was fun to my players. Chargen usually isn't fun, most veteren RPGers can tell you, but WFRP is. I still catch myself rolling up a character now and again in my spare time, just to see what I'll get.It also seems much easier to GM/write up NPCs than other fantasy RPGs. I find ideas flow to me pretty quickly once I \\"got\\" the setting.Overall, if you're unhappy with other fantasy games and want to try something grittier, or just want to try something new, I'd recommend WFRP. Until I played WFRP, I was completely burned out on fantasy roleplaying.If you don't like WFRP after playing it, you are more likely an epic fantasy lover, at which time I'd recommend either DnD, Everquest, or World of Warcraft (either the RPGs or the MMOGs). If you find you like the character's roles to be \\"larger than life\\" heroes, I wouldn't recommend WFRP. In WFRP, a character starts as Joe Average with a tattered cloak (perhaps even Joe Belowaverage). He or she builds the role of \\"Hero\\" from scratch. It's a hard journey, one that most character's won't finish. If this concept doesn't appeal to you, I wouldn't recommend getting WFRP."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"I played the original version of this game briefly in the 90's, and I actually got the oppurtunity to playtest this version about 4 to 6 months before the release, and they have made some very nice changes since the first version. A LOT of stuff that was tested that never made it to the original, but that's irrelevant in this review. I think one of the most important changes from the original was the magic system, it's a whole lot easier to use now, and generally more fun than it was in the first version.One thing that I was extremely happy about was the fact that they kept the percentile system (D10's) instead of moving to a D20 system like most games have recently. It's a really good change to the normal everyday D&D; type gaming. Personally I like the Warhammer lore and world much better than D&D;, but that's just me. They also implemented this with the current rule set of the miniatures, so it's completely compaitable with all of Games Workshop's current miniatures rules.For those of you that have never played Warhammer, it's a bit different than your normal leveling system. It uses careers to advance instead of levels, so for an example let's say you get 200 Experience at the end of your adventure, you can use 100 of that to advance skills (Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, Strength, Willpower, etc...) and the other 100 to change careers, or use all 200 to advance skills, or advance two careers. As you advance careers, new options for other more advanced careers open. Definitely a great concept. A refreshing change from your typical D20 systems."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"This second edition of the WFRP ruleset is a simple, yet fun, role playing game (RPG) system. The rules footprint is a tiny fraction of d20, yet it covers all the basics of fantasy adventure in a clean system that consistently reminds the players they are in a dark and perilous world.The only dice used are d100 and d10. Combat can be very dangerous, and even the most experienced character is at risk every combat. Should a player die or loose a limb, there are fate points which can save the character. However, fate points are very, very hard to get.Magic is hard to control and dangerous, yet powerful and useful enough that the players will want to use it. They may pay the price in loss of sanity, attracting the attention of deamons, or getting their deity annoyed with their constant petitioning.The Warhammer world is deep and twisted, with plenty of lore coming from the table top miniatures game of the same name. The default setting is The Empire, a fantasy take on the Holy Roman Empire. The dark forests are full of beast-men. The underground is teeming with rat-men. An army of chaos demons has ravaged the north. Chaos cultists lurk in every city, in every social class. The technology level is pre-baroque. There are black powder weapons and printed books, but swords and illiteracy are much more common. The world is corrupt, and powerful threats to The Empire exist within, as well as without, it's borders.Game balance and fairness are given short shrift in favor of mood, atmosphere, and dark humor. One player might start out as a rich noble, the other a rat catcher. Yet if the party finds themselves searching for clues in sewers and tunnels under Middenheim, it might pay to be the rat catcher.If you have played d20 for years and want something different and grittier, or if you've never tried a RPG, and want to start with one whose rules are easy to grasp, I would recommend this game."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"Warhammer Fantasy is an angry game. The setting is bleak and forlorn and the system is very lethal making the lives of characters nasty brutish and quite short. Characters are as likely to die of disease or mishap as they are of a sword in the chest and dying of old age (anything over 30) is practically unheard of. Instead of strong kings and a centralized government the Empire, such as it is, is a patchwork of independent kingdoms with a weak emperor chosen by each of the electors. Religion, unlike many other fantasy roleplaying games that skirt the issue, is a very powerful force in the kingdom that is at the same time one of the most unifying and dividing forces in the Empire.Gods and demons, or at least demons, are as real to the backwards, superstitious denizens of Warhammer Fantasy as they were to the backwards, superstitious people of the 14th century. Magic, while legal under license from the Empire, is hunted down and exterminated as heresy and chaos corruption.Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay has one of the best system-setting matches. Everything is based off of a percentage or D10 roll, armor provides damage reduction instead of making you harder to hit. Landing a good solid blow can lop off an arm, leg or outright kill. Magic is very powerful and consequently very dangerous - spells are only slightly more likely to work than they are to backfire with disastrous consequences.The book itself is mostly mechanics - there is only a chapter or two of setting information provided. While this might seem to short shrift the setting the concentration of rules here makes later books more able to focus on the setting rather than simply serving to add only more rules to the game.WFRP is historically inspired fantasy at its finest - hard-bitten, dark, depressing and violent. Hero is a relative descriptor even in the face of villains that are absolutes. WFRP is a much needed injection of bile in a hobby choked near to death with stale heroics."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"The mood of the world in the new edition may still be dark, danky and disheartening but the game system revision is far from being grim, on the contrary it is quite resplandecent.For the newcomer to The Old World:If you have never played it (or any other RPG) this game is a very good start.Rules are nice, easy and maleable, the setting is very enticing and detailed plus the whole world information is contained in one book. Action resolutions are figured out with 10-sided dice only, and in most cases, via percentage rolls. Magic is powerful and for that reason it is dangerous to use, and the system is entertaining and complex but not complicated.All characters come from the same stock races as most games (Elves, Humans, Halflings and Dwarves).Antagonists are the usual Orcs, Trolls, Dragons and other fantasy favorites plus a few other WHRP-specific creatures.The greatest difference and what makes Warhammer truly unique is the use of careers to mark the progress and development of a character. You must select one of these to learn skills and acquire trappings and then, when you are done with that one, move on to a related occupation to keep up your life's progression.It is set in a world resembling ours circa the 14 or 15 hundreds (somewhere between the late dark ages and the renaissance).For the Warhammer veteran:It is in essence the same game you played before with the radical exception of the magic use. This new approach seems to have made many a player very happy. I never disliked the old system but it appears that most people did. Well, the new one is actually truly good. It is vaguely reminiscent of the Ars Magica system where you must roll a difficulty number with a certain number of d10 dice (avoiding rolls of the same number) in order to cast a successful spell. And if not done correctly there will be dire consequences. Ingredients are optional to enhance the magic use and there are no more Magic Points. Magical schools make their appearance and if you have read novels you will see that they are those mentioned in some of the books, such as the Bright Wizards. Quite a bit of the world story and background has been modified to fit into the setting that the novels have created.The occupational groups (Rangers, Warriors, Academics, etc.) have disappeared, as some of the details of creating a character such as age and hight. Free Skills are now given to only 2 races, and Fate Points are generated differently.Weapon damage and armor absorption now goes up to 10. There has been a slight rearrangement of the profile, where Initiative and Cool have been deleted, and Insanity and Fate points included in it. Skills have been divided into Skills and Talents.In comparison to the old edition:HIGHS: The magic system is very entertaining to use and very detailed. Skills and Talents are very easy to memorize since they all work under the same principles so they quickly become intuitive. Skills allow you to perform actions and Talents support and enhance the use of some of those skills. Critical charts are now generic so missile and melee weapons use the same ones and the results can be read in both kinds of damage. And for the superficial of us, the presentation of all the books made by Green Ronin is superbly done.LOWS: The Bestiary is quite stingy. Only a very diminished number of creatures appear in the one included in the rules book. If you would want to populate your world with mean critters you would probably need the Bestiary sourcebook (or a bit of time to convert the ones from the first version). In general this case is a constant low, many features that where included in the first edition now are modular, and only appear in the detail that they did in the original tome in several different companion books.A note for all: Typos and errata are rampant in the edition I have (the first), so all you have read about it until now is totally true."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"The new Warhammer roleplay book is an excellent return to the good old days of Warhammer roleplaying. Gone is the cumbersome magic system and the mediore careers and the somewhat clunky dice system. In the new system everything is done by D10s and that helps things greatly. I have high hopes for this new system and the company that puts it out especially when (at the end of the book) the publisher said that there would be new Warhammer material released more often than when Hogshead published it. If you ever played Warhammer roleplay I highly recommend this book as It improves the overall game while adding new flavor. 5 stars all the way!!!"},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"The much awaited second addition of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay. Green Ronin provided a much needed update to an amazing old system, while keeping the feel, flavor and speed of the old system intact. Vetrans of the system will find much to love with this one. Most of the old system remains; from Elves Dwarves, Halflings and Humans as playable races, to Advanced Carreers like Assasin that everyone seemed to want. What has been removed are alot of the limits of the old system. No more must elves be Good or Lawful, no longer must you pick a Warrior, Ranger, Rogue or Academic). The system remains relatively unchanged, with percentile rolls making up the majority of game mechanics. The D6 damage system has been replaced by a D10 system (eliminating the needs for multiple types of dice) with more wounds per charcter keeping this balanced. Combat has moved from open ended miniature style to grid based - with conversion rules for fans of the old system. All tests are now done based on a skill instead of a characteristic (with a %50 penalty if you don't have the skill), balanced with the addition of purchasing certain skills more then once to add +10% each level. Without getting into too much more detail this is an amazing, well needed update, that brings Warhammer back to the forefront of dark fantasy gaming. A great addition to a veterans collection and a great way for new players to learn that +5 swords and Dragon's hoards are they only game out there. One last note- Warhammer in the past was barely supported, with new material being released sporadically over periods of years. Green Ronin aims to change that and they have. With a new book promised pretty much every 3 months this is a great time for the Warhammer world."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"This is a great game and a good break from D&D. The flavor is gritty and dark. The fact that characters advance through careers is more logical than D&D. All and all a good buy and fun to play."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"The world is exactly as described: grim and perilous. You roll up your \\"dooming\\" at character creation, and spend the game trudging through the peril toward insanity. Of course it depends on your GM, but within the first six games of our first Warhammer campaign, three characters were dead, two were amputees, and one had lost an eye. This might not sound like much fun if you're used to playing essentially indestructible heroes in other games, but trust me, everyone loves it!The percentile-based system is far easier to deal with than the mechanics of other games we've played; rather than an arbitrary target number assigned by the GM, you need to roll under the number on your sheet (with possible modifiers in degrees of plus or minus ten), so you immediately know whether you succeed or fail. The optional rules for drunkenness, insanity, and disease are often a combination of hilarious and disgusting. Not exactly adults-only, but definitely in the PG-13 range. This is the best pen-and-paper RPG I've played."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: A Grim World of Perilous Adventure","review":"I was worried when they announced a second edition of the Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay rules. Part of the appeal of the WFRP rules is that they are so simple, and I feared fiddling could only make things more complicated. But now, having played several sessions with the new rules, I can honestly say that the changes were a great improvement. They managed to keep the simplicity that encourages role-play over power-gaming while cleaning up some of the more clumsy elements (the magic system is a notable improvement). The same career system is in place, but the careers choices have been balanced well enough that there's a good reason to choose any of them, unlike the old rules where some few careers were hardly worth considering.Someone who has never played before and doesn't know the rules could have an entire character rolled up and ready to play in as little as 30 minutes. The entire process is die rolls, so you don't have to make decisions that require knowing the rulebook, like when you have to choose skills or spells in other games.The history of the world is quote a bit lighter than in the previous rulebook, and in my opinion easier to read. Where previously even though it was interesting it was pretty dense and dry, but the history has been rewritten now to be a bit more interesting and relevant for the players.They've removed a few things that used to be included, for instance in the back of the book there used to be maps and images of common buildings but that has been moved to a supplementary book (the Game Master's screen, I believe). That's unfortunate but I can live with it.If you're used to playing with more complicated rules, like d20, Rifts, GURPS or similar, I highly recommend trying out the Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay system. See what it's like not having to worry whether your mace does more damage than your longsword. In WFRP the story and the lives of the players are the focus, instead of the rules. Less \\"roll-play\\" and more \\"role-play\\"."},{"Title":"Kennedy: The New Frontier Revisited","review":"This is a very good book which tries to give an objective and balanced assessment of the Kennedy Presidency free from 'Camelot' or 'sleaze' biases.It succeeds.I thoroughly recommend it."},{"Title":"Fun with Maths and Physics: Brain Teasers, Tricks, Illusions","review":"I LOVED this book - it was lent to me by a neighbor and I did the unthinkable - never returned it! In its place, I did buy the lady a whole lot of other books...This book is ABSOLUTELY essential for everyone - whether you like maths/science or hate maths/science or are indifferent to maths/science. Or to the wonders of the world. For everyone who thinks a scientist understands a rainbow too well to fall in love with it.The book teaches you in the oldest, best way possible - through stories & anecdotes ans puzzles - to open your mind to everything around you. When you wonder next why a flame goes up, or how to do the magician's tablecloth trick, or how to fool your 8-year old cousin, or how to ALWAYS win in a game of odds'n'evens, how chess was invented, or how long to wait for a bus. It's not just laboratory science, but also party tricks and philosophical questions which lead to the first principles of scientific thought - to question Everything around you, and then to figure out the answers."},{"Title":"Fun with Maths and Physics: Brain Teasers, Tricks, Illusions","review":"This is one of those old fashioned books written in a pre-electronic age. Though the book was written for audience of a century ago, the book is very readable to this day. The translation of the book from the original Russian version is flawless and captures the early twentieth-century sense of excitement about physics. The book contains many anecdotes taken from history, for instance the author narrates the story of Chelyuskin disaster to illustrate the principle of Bernoulli's principle. This book makes for an interesting reading and can be read at leisure without a break in flow over the weekend afternoons."},{"Title":"The Svalbard Passage","review":"This book to my thinking does something revolutionary: it synthesizes the best of British, American and European fiction. Perhaps this is because it has two authors, one European and the other American. Before I get into the book, let me give you an idea what I mean. British spy novels are often very well written and most amusing. But they are so British and so quirky that if you haven't spend a great deal of time in England, you will be reading a lot of things that seem a bit meaningless. European fiction is always well written, but it tends to be so deep and demanding of the reader that when you are tired and in need of entertainment, you often feel as if you are being asked to take part in a mental iron-man competition. Then there's American thriller fiction. It's certainly entertaining in the sense that you keep turning the pages. But the bestselling authors I've read are appallingly bad writers, the stories are contrived and banal, the characters are cardboard vehicles for the action, the plots follow a predictable formula and you finish the book wishing you had done the iron-man thing after all. Here's where the Svalbard Passage is different. You keep on turning the pages, you're never bored or forced to think too hard when you wish to relax. Yet when you finish you realize you've been taken on an incredible journey - and I mean, in every sense. This novel is like Thirteen Days in that it gives you a glimpse into the way politics really is. It's fiction, of course. There are Norwegian and American officials that avoid the stereotypes, there is an American professor and an obstinate but beautiful German journalist, there are two Russian characters whose descriptions are on a par with those done by the best British authors and there's the spectacular scenery of Svalbard. I, as a Norwegian, know this part of the world well, as do the authors. But most incredible is the story. It has the entertainment quality of an American thriller, the fine writing and unforgettable if quirky descriptiveness of an English story and the real-life depth (no predictable formulas here) of a work of European literature. You can't do a whole lot better than this. I commend the authors and urge you to read the novel. It's an experience you won't soon forget."},{"Title":"The Svalbard Passage","review":"As someone who has daily contact with theWashington bureaucracy, I have to say, this is a very realistic and scary novel. I don't know Norway at all, but I feel after reading this book that I've spent years there. In fact, I intend to go now. You will too, I imagine, after you immerse yourself in these incredibly vivid and scenic descriptions of a place so beautiful I can only hope it's for real. The book is about how we almost went to war, due not to any fierce desire on anyone's part but as a result of misunderstandings. The action reminded me of a couple of trains going opposite directions on the same track. The problem was, both drivers had died and no one could control the trains. There was a wreck coming, and you didn't know like you usually do in a thriller type book if it would happen or not. The love story was pretty terrific. It was an American guy and German girl. I think I'm going to try my luck with European women! The Russians were absolute incredible. I'll never forget a guy named Obruchev and you won't either if you read this book. I hope you will. It's a thriller that comes back to haunt you day after day. It makes you realize a lot can happen out there you probably consider impossible. You have a great time while you're reading but you don't walk away when you've finished wishing you had done something else! Wow, is all I can think to say."},{"Title":"The Svalbard Passage","review":"I'll admit it. I'm a true Kirkwood fan. This is another of his well-crafted taut thrillers. You're right there, smelling the sharp pine scent of the forest and feeling the cold wind buffeting you.

It's tightly written, keeps the reader engaged, and makes me want more from Tom Kirkwood."},{"Title":"The Svalbard Passage","review":"This is quite a good adventure/espionage novel. Nothing stunning here though. We have Cold War adversaries, an interesting setting, a love story in the middle of the confrontation, and small, but exceptional, people making a different in geopolitical matters.Not sure how popular this book was in the day, but I see copies from time to time. Interest in Svalbard got me to read the book. It's a quick read, good for the train or airplane."},{"Title":"The Svalbard Passage","review":"This was a very silly, unbelievable book. The great American hero outwits and outfights the dastardly Russian, while charming the pants off the cool Norwegian beauty. Oh dear....."},{"Title":"The Svalbard Passage","review":"Cold war thrillers are one of my guilty pleasures and I was expecting a little-known gem after reading the other reviews. But this book was somewhat of a disappointment.The dialogue seems forced and even stilted. For example, several Americans are asked to join a trip. After one accepts, another says, \\"I, also, of course.\\" Now, have you ever heard an American say \\"I, also\\" instead of \\"me, too\\"?The lead female character is also a problem. Almost none of her actions or dialogue rang true for me. She seemed liked nothing more than a clumsy device to move the plot along. If the plot required a tantrum, she threw a tantrum. What's worse, for a thriller, this book wasn't very, well, thrilling. The first half of the book seemed to drag, although it did pick up in the second half.SEMI-SPOILER ALERT: I also disliked the ending, or should I say, the non-ending. When you stick with an author (or in this case, authors) for 307 pages, you deserve some sort of payoff."},{"Title":"The world and Thomas Kelly","review":"What a potboiler! Basically a retelling of \\"The Prodical Son\\", but with nice descriptions of Harvard and Newport, Rhode Island, as they were at the turn of the century. Not nearly as good (well, not actually good at all) as his later book, \\"His Children's Children\\". Why do I suspect Train of being something of a prig? Here it seems he lashed together all the moral adages ever told to young men about going straight, loving home and hearth and Mother, to make a semblance of a story, a thinly disguised parable of the hero who went wrong, but found true love in the end. Such claptrap! Unfortunately, I had inadvertently glanced at the last page, so I knew how it would all turn out, though it was pretty predictable anyway. The description of the houses and society of Newport was fascinating, at least."},{"Title":"Corkers Freedom","review":"Written thirty years ago and published in the U.S. for the first time in 1994, Berger's novel describes one day in the life of a man, 64 years old, who decides to claim his freedom.As the story opens William Corker has left his invalid sister and decided to move into rooms over his employment office. A bachelor, he sacrificed marriage and all his other potentials to care for, first, his mother, then his sister, crippled with rheumatism.The narrative moves between Corker's plans and reminiscences and his young assistant's observation of the change in his boss and the momentous change in his own life - he has just lost his virginity. Interspersed are paragraphs from the various people who come in seeking employment - a vigorous, middle aged housekeeper Corker fantasizes employing for himself; a young, snooty woman who demonstrates Corker's naivety and optimism while casing the joint for her boyfriend; and an elderly impoverished housekeeper terrified of being put in a home to die.Corker is ebullient, proud of himself and feeling daring. Alec, his assistant, is by turns suspicious and excited. Unable to quite overturn the habits of a lifetime, Corker sacrifices his visions of the blowsy housekeeper and tentatively decides on the elderly one - who's asking less than half normal wages. But he vacillates while Alec fumes with the impatience of youth, helping Corker shove furniture around upstairs and dreaming of his girl while he listens to the old man go on about art and travel.The tone is wistful and ironic with a hint of acid. The story builds to a climax which seems certain to end in disaster, what with an ongoing robbery, the entrance of the querulous sister and the addition of some unaccustomed alcohol. A trifle wordy but a poignant and humorous look at the contrast between sacrificed hopes and youthful incomprehension."},{"Title":"Corkers Freedom","review":"William Corker, ever-so-proper, and presumably celibate, has spent his life caring for his mother and his domineering sister, and now, at age 64, he has made the break, found his own apartment, and is living, joyfully, on his own, above the employment office where he works. The inner thoughts, memories, and poignant regrets of Corker as he approaches old age, contrast delightfully with the decidedly uncelibate, hormone-induced thoughts of his employee, 17-year-old Alec. Berger illuminates every possible intergenerational contrast and conflict here, evoking great humor and equally great sympathy for Corker and Alec, both of whom the reader recognizes as nave.Within this delightful and amusing story, however, Berger deals with serious universal themes related to one's life goals and responsibilities, how one wants to be remembered, and how personal freedom is defined. After caring for others for sixty-four years, Berger's only desire is \\"I do not want to die as I am, when I die I want to be different, I want to be less ignorant of the consequences of not being good.\\"Corker takes an irreversible step into his independent life during a tipsy travelogue of Vienna. It is here that Berger uses language most brilliantly to reveal the many ironies of Corker's life. What Corker actually says, what he knows, and what he would like to say to and about the other characters in the audience, all of whom have affected his life, are combined in this one stunning scene. We can observe him taking chances for the first time and experiencing \\"the general triumph of having spoken out and been listened to.\\"Simultaneously, however, the reader is privy to ironic events that are taking place outside the lecture hall, events over which Corker has no control and which will force him to continue living his new, \\"free\\" life, whether or not he wants to. The epilogue which shows us Corker two years later, reveals Berger's consummate irony: Corker is still speaking out and still living free, though not in the way that either he or we would have predicted. A fine study of a man at the end of his life, the novel showcases Berger's masterful use of irony and brilliant manipulation of language, making this a novel that language lovers will not want to miss. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Corkers Freedom","review":"This is not one of Berger's best: in fact it's not far short of the worst thing he's ever written. Almost entirely without humour, this is a dull dog of a book. Only the seriously committed need bother: others perhaps should look to his '60s masterpiece 'A Fortunate Man' or the later 'Into Their Labours' trilogy. But please steer clear of this one."},{"Title":"The Civil War Memories of Elizabeth Bacon Custer: Reconstructed from Her Diaries and Notes","review":"This is a book I had a hard time putting down. It is an eyewitness account of civilian Civil War times, and is a &quot;must&quot; for Civil War period buffs. It tends to deromanticize the era, as Libbie Custer tells the day-by-day details of marching with the Union Army, living in then near-desolate Washington D.C., and taking over rooms in Confederate farmhouses to set up camp. But those details are nevertheless fascinating, because they are so different from life today. Her memoirs unfortunately give too little information about Custer's personality and her relationship with him, which I was eager to learn. This is probably due to the writing style of the era, however, as Victorians tended to be &quot;closed&quot; about their personal feelings."},{"Title":"Islands of Light","review":"This book is so good that i think everyone should read it! It is not for kids younger than 9 but everyone above that will love it! It takes you into an adventure about two kids and some mysterious situations and amazing excapes. I couldn't put it down and this is definetly one of my favorite books! I garentee you will love it so read it today!! It is definetly worth the money."},{"Title":"Yesterday in the hills,","review":"These stories are the kinds of stories we should all be passing down in our families and communities. Through such stories young people find out who they are. The people in long ago Ballground, Georgia were poor, but in many ways they were richer than most of us now. Their daily lives had texture and provided a closer walk with the natural world. Just to survive required hard work, cooperation, and wisdom. Humor was a nice extra too and these stories have that extra in abundance. My mother's family lived right on the outskirts of Ballground, and many of her stories could fit right in this book. This is a great read!"},{"Title":"Yesterday in the hills,","review":"This is a well written book, that is filled with Southern charm and wit. I highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Yesterday in the hills,","review":"\\"Yesterday in the Hills\\" provides in-depth details about the daily lives of individual poor North Georgia farmers and their families in the early twentieth century. The details are given in the form of stories about indiviual lives and events. Humor, courting, medical practices, farming, family life, poverty, loafing, hunting, gardening, childhood games, etc., are all described in detail. The book reads easily and the stories leave a lasting impression. A very good read."},{"Title":"Yesterday in the hills,","review":"&quot;Yesterday In The Hills&quot; is the story of the Ballground/Canton/North Georgia hill country settlements. It tells a story of people too poor to live and too proud to give up. I'm descended from these people, and I'm very proud of my roots. I'm white, yes. But these stories, anecdotes, and tall tales need to be preserved.This is before the depression. This is making a living before the &quot;new deal.&quot; This is life before the urbanization of America. This is the story of when people lived on and off their land. This is the story of men and women who settled the land and found it good. This is the story of Georgia, and all the lands where work, industry, faithfulness, and hope were the by-words.Buy this book. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll remember when Momma's fried chicken, and pastor's sermon would keep you awake for days. But most of all, you'll remember a time passed, when things seemed simpler and the world was larger. . .but most of all when community meant just that. . .read THIS BOOK"},{"Title":"Master Teaching Techniques","review":"Back in 1984, when it first came out, and when NLP books in general were pretty thin on the ground, this may have been hot stuff. But then came books like Michael Grinder's \\"Righting the Educational Conveyor Belt\\" and Eric Jensen's \\"Superteaching\\", etc., and this book became a definite also-ran.By and large the author gives a fairly accurate \\"introduction to the basics of NLP\\" - and SOME idea of how it can be applied in the classroom. But compared with later books the writing style reads more like a technical report, the layout and choice of fonts don't help, and if the book were presented in the same way as the other two books I mentioned, it would probably work out nearer 150 pages than the 233 pages that it is at the moment.In short, if you want to teach NLP to a robot, just feed it this book. If you want something with a little more \\"body\\" and some real enthusiasm for the subject then I'd definitely recommend one of Michael Grinder or Eric Jensen's books - INSTEAD OF this."},{"Title":"Private Dowding","review":"Private Dowding is an engaging story of a soldier who dies in battle and who communicates his life-after-death experience to the author Wellesley Tudor Pole. First let me say that it is a good book containing many wonderful gems, but unfortunately the book isn't an authentic life and death story. You must understand Wellesley Tudor Pole's background; he was a spiritualist, or druid, along the lines of a Benjamin Cr&egrave;me type figure. He incorporates the Baha'i Faith into his story, a Messenger in the afterlife tells him about the founder of the Baha'i Faith and that it is a revelation of God. I have no problem with this, because I'm a Baha'i myself. The only problem is that Wellesley Tudor Pole was also a Baha'i in 1915 during the time he wrote the book; therefore he wrote the story under false pretenses. Years later the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith, Shoghi Effendi told Wellesley that his spiritualist-druid-like beliefs are incompatible with the Baha'i Faith, and shortly there after he left the Faith.If you're looking for an authentic life-after-death account don't read this book, if on the other hand, you want to read an interesting book with many wonderful pearl's of wisdom in it, then I recommend you read it."},{"Title":"Ransom of Love (Mail Order Bride Series #5)","review":"This is the fifth in the Lacy's Mail Order Bride series. The first two were great, and the third one good, but the following books have not met that standard.Ransom of Love is a good title for the story line of this book. They do a wonderful job of showing two different illustrations of how Christ has paid our ransom. The information on slavery was interesting and the hate and bigotry toward the slaves is unfortunately true. However, I found the book itself redundantly wordy and at times too simply written.I only recommend this book if you have read the others in the series. For those who haven't - read the others first so you can see the quality of work the Lacy's are better know for."},{"Title":"Ransom of Love (Mail Order Bride Series #5)","review":"I have enjoyed the entire series of mail order brides by these authors and found more substance and &quot;meat&quot; in this one. Reading about the various lives that are woven together, the differences in life choices by Christians and non-Christians, I found several stories that occur simultaneously to bring all the actors together. God's plan in our lives was never so clearly shown through words. A very good read as are ALL in this series. You will learn about slavery to the revival era of the late 1800's. Informative, entertaining, and thought provoking I recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a good read."},{"Title":"Schools of Linguistics","review":"From the title, you would think that this book was an overview of different schools of current linguistic thought, and that would be partially true. However, there's also some treatment of the history of linguistics, starting with the historical linguists of the 19th century.This is an incredibly readable book--lively and well-written, so much so that for a week I skipped my lunchtime novel and read this, instead.I found two more or less separate threads in the book. One is an insightful treatment of pre-Chomskyan linguistics, with a chapter each on 19th-century historical linguistics, Saussure, the American descriptivists, and (primarily) European functionalists. The second thread has to do with Chomskyan and other approaches to linguistics as of the late 70's/early 80's. Some parts of this second thread are as screamingly funny as the elements of the first thread are insightful; I don't think that &quot;funny&quot; is normally a word that you would associate with a critique of classical generative grammar, but indeed I was rolling as I read it. To be clear--I mean &quot;funny&quot; not in the sense of being laughable, but rather humorous--it's really quite entertaining. His analysis of the sins of rationalism as applied to questions in language acquisition is absolutely devastating. Hopefully Sampson's description of the Chomskyan community is no longer accurate; I can't recall ever meeting a linguist as stupid as he paints (at least the early) TGists as being, and sometimes wasn't sure that his description of their theoretical excesses was not meant to be hyperbole or a caricature. In any case, it's tremendously enjoyable to read. And, Sampson certainly does point out both the things that TG is good for, and the weak points of the theories that he *does* approve of.All in all, a great book--I'd love to see an updated version."},{"Title":"Schools of Linguistics","review":"If the book weren't so dated, it would be a better survey of the field. Sampson does a good job outlining the historical development of linguistics as a discipline and the main schools of thought currently existing; it's a must-read for those who enjoy the field. But there are a couple of needlessly eurocentric comments, and while I agree with the author's attacks on generative grammar, they are probably a bit harsher than deserved (though at the time of publication, as Sampson is keen to point out-- and exaggerate-- the generative school had an enormous unfair advantage in terms of media publicity and the ability to dominate professional linguistics journals)."},{"Title":"Full Circle: A South American Journey","review":"Full circle details the past and the ceratin present of sepulveda's life, his torture and exile from his country because of his belief and his travels through South America as he cannot return. The story begins and ends with his aim to try and get to the village of his grandfather's birth in Spain and to see if he has any surviving relatives. A book that touched me in a way no other book has ever done and none probably will, and belive me, for once that is no understatement."},{"Title":"Full Circle: A South American Journey","review":"a very honest and coolly written book. While the narrative appears disjointed at first, one realizes that if the author were to write all the details in chrono sequence, given that he has been travelling for years, it would have been several fat volumes. This is not srictly a travelogue in the sense of day 1 we did tis, day 2 that happened.. rather, its a collection of incidents and events that took place in the couirse of the author's travels, that illuminate life in the various places he has been.I feel like hitting the road again, with no fixed destination in mind, no final goal, timeless..."},{"Title":"Full Circle: A South American Journey","review":"This book was disjointed. It was really hard to follow what was going on and where the author was going and why. The book seemed to be a compilation of miscellaneous stories about his life. Some of the stories made sense, while others were out of place and unintelligible. This made for a difficult read."},{"Title":"Full Circle: A South American Journey","review":"Full Circle is a book that cannot be read only once. The stories become like old freinds and are joys to visit with again and again."},{"Title":"Travels of Marco Re","review":"On a sidenote before I give a synopsis of the book: I wanted to mention something interesting about this book. The book tells that due North of where Marco lives is the tallest building in the world. Since in 1956 when this book was written this building in fact was the Empire State Building and it was so much higher than other buildings existing at that time, it must have seemed unnecessary for the author to state the name of the building. Today there are nine other buildings taller than this one and that is not including the twin towers of the World Trade Center that came down. There also have been 20 or so buildings built since that come near to the size of the Empire State building. Nowhere in the book is it stated to take place in New York City but if you know your history you would know that it is. Also if you were reading it when it was released it would have been obvious as well. Interesting to me!Now for the synopsis: Marco is a pigeon who lives with twenty-four other pigeons in a rooftop coop, pleasantly situated in a grove of television aerials. He is well-fed on buckwheat and let out of his coop each day for excercise. Each day he travels and meets friends throughout the city and enjoys trying samples of wht they eat and hearing different phrases that make them culturally unique. In the end he follows other pigeons to \\"a big central park' where he meets all of his friends and marvels that while they all eat bagels, rice, hot peas, melons, spaghetti etc outside of the park, inside the park they all eat peanuts.The illustrations are line drawings in black and red with 44 pages of text. With a little commentary as you go along, this is a very nice book about the many different people you meet along the way. You could use this book in a Five in a Row style with your preschooler and add commentary mentioning such things as how the name Marco came from Marco Polo who also had many travels. You could talk about the United Nations being in New York city and how it represents the many countries and people of the world. The people are only identified with culural elements such as food, phrases and clothing styles shown in the illustrations. The country or cultural names are never mentioned. You could perhaps have the children guess their country of cultural origin. You could include other picturebooks of pigeons or read the Newberry book, Gay the Longneck Pigeon, after this picturebook. Many different kinds of food are shown in the book with cultural ties and you could eat some of them with your child. How about going out to feed the pigeons. They are really fun to watch as they bob their heads and peck at the grain and nuts.ENJOY!"},{"Title":"Irish Whiskey","review":"Hasn't it been a brilliant ride through the &quot;Irish&quot; series? Won't it be better for you to begin with &quot;Irish Gold&quot; then follow it with &quot;Irish Lace&quot; before arriving here at &quot;Irish Whiskey&quot;? In Gold you will become enamored with Dermot and Nuala Anne. In Lace you will hope for their relationship to develop and succeed. In Whiskey . . . well, wouldn't that be telling now? I eagerly await &quot;Irish Mists&quot; arriving in stores next year. Write quickly Father Greeley."},{"Title":"Irish Whiskey","review":"Having been a huge fan of Father Greeley for many years now, I was pleased to see how well he can still spin a yarn. &quot;Irish Whiskey&quot;, third in a series surrounding a firery Irish lass named Nuala McGrail, continued to be entertaining as well as insightful. Greeley creates characters that are so alive and real that I find myself hearing them speak in Irish in my head! &quot;Go long wid you now!&quot; Having been raised in the Catholic Church, I find Greeley truly refreshing and insightful with his thoughts about how all of us truly feel regarding the matters of love and sex, and yet we have been programmed to feel guilty about those thoughts! While many think it is shocking that a Catholic priest should write such racy material, I find it refreshing that Father Greeley writes about the things that are beautiful and wholesome, such as the love between a man and a woman. The love story that is the basis of these series of novels, reveals a much more imp! ortant message. It attempts to explains how relationships and marriage can become deeper and more meaningful all within the eyes of God. Greeley and his Nuala McGrail series is a well thought out homily of how he sees men and womem fulfilling their committments to God through their committment to loving one another. Whether you are Catholic or not, you'll love the mystery and if you read carefully enough you will find the wonderful hidden message of how love can conquer all."},{"Title":"Irish Whiskey","review":"I now have read all three of this lovely trilogy and hope and pray to Nuola for the stories to go on and on and on and on."},{"Title":"Irish Whiskey","review":"Andrew Greely has really out done himself this time. He keeps the reader interested in multiple different scenarios in Dermot Michael Coyne's life. While preparing to get married, investigating the life and death of a famous Mobster and threats of criminal charges make this very complex novel come to life. The Irish intonations in the speakers' voices causes the reader to read out loud and laugh at the anitics of the characters. Fun and very witty writing; every situation is described in great detail. Definitly a book that cannot be put down!"},{"Title":"Irish Whiskey","review":"I have probably 2/3rds of the Greeley novels, including Irish Lace and Gold. After the first few pages I thought this was going to be a quickly slapped together journal of the events leading up to the nuptials of our heroes, Dermot and Nuala. In fact, I put it down, and only picked it up again after some unexpected down time.For those of you who presevere, you will find the usual complicated mystery threads, that always tie together quite nicely by the end.I love Greeley's lack of pretension. I live on the &quot;fringes&quot; of the Chicago Irish community. By that I mean I belong, by heritage, and I am enjoying the recent resurgance of anything Gaelic and Irish, but some take it too far. Many in the community tend to wrap their nationality, newfound respectability and religion about themselves, and use it as a cover to excuse immoral or otherwise bad behavior. Greeley always manages to blow these people away!What I have always enjoyed about Greeley is his social stance. The protagonists are flawed, yet quietly pious and moral. That would describe Nuala and Dermot. Her brother Lawrence represents the other side of the coin, hiding behind his heritage as he imposes his hatred on everyone else. To me, how the lovers handled his intrusion was the far more interesting mystery of the book."},{"Title":"Irish Whiskey","review":"Andrew Greeley is a favorite author of mine and Nuala is one of my most favorite of his characters, so any book from this series is a win for me."},{"Title":"Irish Whiskey","review":"Please catch the rest of my reviews on this series. Don't want to repeat myself except that if you love good mysteries and character development, these books are for you. Again, read in sequence."},{"Title":"Irish Whiskey","review":"This was the worst book I have read in recent memory. I enjoy a lighthearted detective novel on occasion. This was not lighthearted and the author used the premise that the girlfriend was \\"fey\\" to explain how the whodunit was dun. It was as if the author learned some Irish phrasing and wanted to use it in a story...and failed."},{"Title":"Irish Whiskey","review":"Irish Whiskey, the third of Andrew Greeley's Nuala Anne McGrail mysteries is not as successful as its predecessors. The mystery deals with the mysterious death of an Irish bootlegger, Jimmy \\"Sweet Rolls\\" Sullivan and once again Nuala has the feeling something is not quite right with the story. But the mystery plays second fiddle to two sub-plots; the upcoming wedding of Nuala and her stalwart Watson, Dermot, and a case against Dermot concerning how he achieved the financial independence he has. The former is a problem due to the machinations of Nuala's oldest brother; the latter is caused by a vindictive figure from Dermot's past. Both these storylines take away from the original mystery, which plays second fiddle to these soap opera plot lines. While Greeley continues to make Nuala and Dermot enjoyable and believable characters this was a disappointing sequel."},{"Title":"Irish Whiskey","review":"Being the first book I've read by Greeley, it has definitely got me hooked. I read it in 2 days and went out to find more of his works. I was amazed at the time Greeley spent to interact with his readers. Since my Irish roots run deep, I was pleased and enlightened by the book. Thank you for such a wonderful experience, Mr. Greeley."},{"Title":"Irish Whiskey","review":"Andrew Greeley managed once again to write a book that made me want to know these peopleas if they were real. The vivid passion and love that are written with the humor thrown in, makes Irish Whiskey a keeper on my shelf, along with the others. So, what is next? Gotta keep these characters going Father!"},{"Title":"Irish Whiskey","review":"Father Greeley's bad habit is like that of His Master at Cana--&quot;You have saved the best for last&quot; While I am encouraged that this is NOT the last in the series of the Irish-speaker from Galway and her Watson boyfriend-husband, this is fast paced, quick witted, and an even faster page-turner than USUAL.Expect to cheer, laugh and stay up all night to finish it. If you need your sleep--do not start this at bedtime!"},{"Title":"Fowlers of Sweet Valley (Sweet Valley High)","review":"I was really attracted to the Fowlers of Sweet Valley because I was always curious about Lila Fowler, such as where was her mother and why did she leave her and this book really helped me get an intimate look at Lila's identity. I could see Lila's personality in the characters-for example,her selfishness in Emily De Bocage, her strong willed independence in Rose de Bocage, her stubborn pride in Charles Doret, her inner strength in Lili de Beautemps, and her gentle spirit in Celeste Chardin.I found each story suspensful and heartwrenching. I really liked Celeste's story because she was kind and gentle and really loved Marc and everything worked out well for her in the end. I didn't really like the story about Rose and Pierre. It was kind of boring and dragged a little with no suspenseful plot, really, just a girl playing a game of hard to get until she finally lost. I do think Rose was kind of a fool to deny Pierre her love when she knew how she felt for him and it's her loss in the end. But the story about the Charles-Isabelle-Jacque/Jack love triangle was the most heartwrenching. But what are the odds of failing to track someone down in France, moving to America, and winding up in the very same town with that person? My very favorite is the Grace Doret/George Fowler love story because I always wanted to know how the met and how it ended and why Grace left her daughter. The book ties in very well with the SVH series, especially Don't Go Home With John, which tells more about Lila being reunited with her mother after being assaulted. Did anyone notice in Isabelle's story the name Evelyn Pearce? She is described as a red-haired gossip. And in Grace's story they mention a girl named Lydia with the same last name, whose one of Grace's friends. Perhaps they are the ancestors of SVH gossip Carolyn Pearce? Lila has such a small part in the saga, but you really see her vulnerable side as a little girl saying goodbye to her mom it's so sad. I was also hoping to get a glimpse of the Wakefield twins in the book, or one of their ancestors, since the series revolves around them and Lila is more of a secondary character but they are not mentioned. This is a really great read and definitely one of the best books in the series. They should come out with more SVH sagas about other characters such as Todd Wilkins, Enid Rollins and even Winston Eggbert would be interesting!"},{"Title":"Fowlers of Sweet Valley (Sweet Valley High)","review":"I love this book. My friend recommended it and i was hesitant at first because i'm not a huge fan of sweet valley high but i love historical fiction book. After reading this book I'd have to say it is my favourite book, all the stories of each generation are remarkable!!"},{"Title":"Fowlers of Sweet Valley (Sweet Valley High)","review":"I checked this book out from my local library not really thinking that I would have the time to read it. But as soon as I finished reading the first chapter I was hooked. I mean who would have known that Lila Fowler's ancestors' stories could be SO touching. Everything was so descriptive that I could imagine myself being the characters in the wonderful story about friendship, romance, tragedies and just plain fun. If you are interested in ANY of the Sweet Valley series you will definately enjoy this book.When I was reading this book I was really hooked on the Sweet Valley Twins Series. This book made me broaden my horizon's and got my interested in Sweet Valley Jr. High books, Sweet Valley High books and many other great Sweet Valley miniseries.Recently, I read the book, The Wakefields of Sweet Valley. This book was even better than The Fowler's of Sweet Valley if that is humanly possible.The only thing that I didn't like about this book and The Wakefield's of Sweet Valley is that they are SO sad. I have never cried so much in a series. The only time I could put the book down was to get a tissue.These books in the Sweet Valley Saga series teach you a lot. I hope that you will condsider reading them.(Tip is you read any of the Sweet Valley Saga books: Get lots of tissues.)I hated how in this book Lili never got together with her true love. It was SO sad."},{"Title":"Fowlers of Sweet Valley (Sweet Valley High)","review":"This book was excellent. It told us all about Lila Fowler's ancestors.

I remember reading it when I was a few years younger and I remember not really understanding a lot of the language. Now, after two years of studying French, I know that the author must have had previous study of the language. There are phrases that simply the average joe would not understand. Also, I must commend the author on her wonderful and accurate historical descriptions. The details about the French Revolution and then WW1 were great. It's nice to see a historical fiction actually be historical. Anyway, this book inspired me to write my own and you can tell I stole a few things. Anyway, a great book. I also enjoyed the Wakefield one but really only the story of Elisabeth and Jessamyn."},{"Title":"Fowlers of Sweet Valley (Sweet Valley High)","review":"If you don't like history, you might be a bit put of by this book, which goes bak in time to the people who come before Lila Fowler.

Get it now!"},{"Title":"Fowlers of Sweet Valley (Sweet Valley High)","review":"This was the best sage i read. It kept me intrested and enjoyed.

I liked the Wakefield ones the best; the Patman one was pretty good, too. I think the problem with this one for me was that this time they actually knew that they were meant to be. Usually it's 2 generations before the two families meet again...this one they knew about it because the generations where the families meet are separated. As well, in the other books there was certain something special on each side of the family that signified their love. There were only roses for this one...and only on one side of the family. Overall, it was ok, but I didn't enjoy the romances as much as the other sagas...they didn't seem to have the same feeling."},{"Title":"Fowlers of Sweet Valley (Sweet Valley High)","review":"This book was definetly one of the best SVH ever written!

It is a book that can show you how circumcision became popular in America as an anti-\\"self abuse\\" operation. Or where the perfect Christian model of sexual fear and frustration began. If you want to know how NOT to raise your child, and more perfectly understand the faulty model that many Americans were brought up on, this is the book to read. Freud had a happy business no doubt partly because of this book."},{"Title":"Shamanism (Quest Book)","review":"I'm not quite sure how to categorize this book. Its really a nice little collection of brief essays concerning Shamanism in some way shape or form. I believe no few of which appeared in Shaman's Drum (a wonderful magazine in and of itself). There are alot of names you'd expect to see in such a book: Mihaly Hoppal, Joan Halifax, Mircea Eliade, Michael Harner, Serge King, etc. Overall thats a pretty broad scope there, from New Age neo-shamanism to social scientists, so you get a variety of perspectives.Each article contributes something else to the overall books. There are articles about shamanism and madness, the ecstatic state, ESP and other paranormal phenomena as relating to shamanism, dreams, the question of whether shamanism is archaeic or modern, Native American prayer pipes, shamanism and Theosophy, the role of shaman as adventurer (filled with info on traditional African and Hawai'ian culture) and so forth. Other articles focus in on specific traditions, so that we get articles on the Tamang Shaman of Nepal, Australian aboriginal medicine men, and perhaps most unusual of all an article by Rabbi Yonassan Gersham on Jewish Shamanism, interperting Prophets from Ezekiel to the Baal Shem Tov (founder of the Hasidic movement) as shaman. There are also a couple articles on famous healers such as Rolling Thunder and Wallace Black Elk (who is actually more New Age pseudo-Shaman than anything else).Overall, this is a very nice book to read, especially if you are interested in history, religion, archaeology, anthropology or so forth. The articles are all relatively short and easy reads, and many of them present some very unique perspectives. Overall worth getting."},{"Title":"The Plan of Salvation","review":"I found this book to be very intriguing and though provoking. I have never been much of a reader but have found LDS Doctrines to be very interesting. This book touches on the beliefs of the LDS Church concerning where we came from, where we are, and where we will go after this life.This book references many sources from early leaders of the LDS church and gives great insight to what the purose of life really is. If you are LDS and don't have a firm knowledge of what the plan of salvation encompasses then this is a must read."},{"Title":"The Plan of Salvation","review":"Who am I? Where did I come from? and, Where am I going? Matthew Brown brilliantly lays out the plan of salvation. He begins in the pre-existence (where we were before we were born) and carefully takes us through the Garden of Eden experience, the events of the parents of the human race and through each doctrine. He carefully backs up every thought and premise with the writings of the scriptures, prophets and apostles. Every person on the face of the earth must read this book and treasure it as a valuable addition to their religious library. So many questions about life and so many answers within the pages of The Plan of Salvation by Matthew Brown. Well done, Mr. Brown, and thank you. Questions I have had for years were answered within these pages, so again I thank you."},{"Title":"The Plan of Salvation","review":"Very reliable quotes, sources and simply explained mysteries from quotes of prophets, revelations etc. It travels you from pre-mortal sphere to exaltation through the view of eternity. Broadens your understanding, opens your view and revelations for further knowledge."},{"Title":"Triplicity","review":"When something dominates the landscape long enough, it falls into the intricate patterns that ultimately lead to its downfall. Complacency, the feeling of superiority and supreme authority, overpopulation and spreading the herd paper thin; these are all symptoms of that coming demise. It can be seen in every creature colonizing on any continent, from the largest of animals to the smallest insects. And nothing reflects that teetering on the brink of perpetual extinction more than mankind.In The Genocides, this point is painstakingly brought to the surface, showcasing exactly how mankind would react to sweeping changes and how easily the proverbial \\"fall from grace\\" could be fashioned. First come the seeds of destruction in the shape of mysterious plants, growing at levels that astound even the most studious minds while being followed by the atypical reactions hinged on dismissal that one would expect from \\"civilized thinkers.\\" As the plants start claiming ground and choking out the human blight, the reaction remain as we would expect them to be, unwavering in their arrogance, and the people see themselves as dominate. They don't see this as an invasion because plants couldn't be invaders, after all, and they opt instead to fight it with poisons that seem to keep the problem in check and methods that keep it out of sight. Slowly, however, people come to realize that this is all a mirage and that extinction is looming just beyond that next horizon. And there, in a town painted to the backdrop of crumbling cities and mammoth greenery, Thomas Disch begins painting a vivid portrait of what humanity truly entails.There were many elements of the story that sprang from those pages and that were captivating as I eagerly devoured page after page. I personally liked the way the characters sprang to life, their ideas and ideals mingling with their backgrounds, and I liked the way all sorts of normally-mundane items started marching back into lives that had forgotten them. Food, grueling efforts to keep portions of land, needs for medicine, the elements; these were all there and they were all there in kind. Little tastes that we'd become numb to began taking effect, with people dropping like so many flies as the going grew tougher and tougher, and Disch painted it well. And, out of that, he painted something that I liked even better.One of the best things about Disch's work was that he wasn't trying to become a mouthpiece for the redeeming factors housed in mankind. He didn't gloss over the fact that brutality is a key component to survival when structure becomes disheveled, and he doesn't try to bore his readers with passion plays that encompass only a portion of that \\"light vs. dark\\" spectrum. Instead, he explores the way the individuals feel and how they manage to survive on both a mental and a physical plateau when the world falls apart. And sometimes this means doing little things to keep the past alive or finding someone to latch onto that you really don't care about. And sometimes it means doings deeds that are even worse, eternally answering not only the question of what people are willing to do to stay alive but also the question of where sausage will come from when pigs are gone but still savored in the deep spiciness of memory.This is WELL worth working into your hectic reading lives."},{"Title":"Triplicity","review":"In 'The Genocides', the remains of humanity struggle against the onward growth of an alien monoculture known simply as 'the Plants', which has destroyed civilisation and left only pockets of survivors.The novel starts well, in an almost Faulknerian community of farmers, lead by the dominating and deluded fundamentalist patriarch, Anderson, who are trying to maintain their cornfields and animals against this relentless growth, along with alien attempts at 'pest control' (essentially the slaughter of all living beings remaining on Earth). The plot concentrates on what happens to the dynamics of this community when it is decimated by one of these genocidal attacks, and then forced to welcome a charismatic and educated urban survivor, Jeremiah Orville. His revenge on Anderson for killing his partner, is slow and cunning and pits the old patriarch's children against each other and against him, as the devastated group is forced to seek shelter underground in the roots of the Plants themselves.'The Gencocides' was Disch's first novel and suffers from a common fault of first novels, and of 1960s sf, in having a great concept but being really rather aimless for long stretches (see also Brian Aldiss' 'Hothouse' as another example of this). The characters switch between being a more realistic band of survivors than, for example, those in Stewart's 'Earth Abides' - with some intriguing and challenging interpersonal conflict - to melodramatic and over-cooked. The long passages underground are claustrophobic and tense to begin with, full of dark and squelchy atmosphere, but soon become dull as Disch, rather like the characters themselves, loses the plot.The novel is redeemed somewhat by a fine, cinematic and depressingly gloomy ending, but, like 'Hothouse', you can't help but think it would have been better as a novella. Sf in general improved as early 1960s superficiality gave way to anger and disappointment with Disch's own extremely grim and disturbing 'Camp Concentration', and the work of Spinrad ('Bug Jack Barron'), Moorcock ('The Cornelius Quartlet'), Ballard ('The Atrocity Exhibition', 'Hi-rise' etc.) and Brunner ('Stand on Zanzibar', 'The Sheep Look Up' etc.). 'The Genocides' is still worth reading as a book that stands on the cusp of this revolution, as the older more complacent sf was faced with this tide of energetic bitterness and loathing."},{"Title":"Triplicity","review":"With all the aplocalyptic books out there to enjoy, this is the freshest approach yet, and probably one of the older books.One day the world is covered in little green plants sprouting up everywhere.

Those who are left survive only by sheer determination and hard work, having not only to deal with the immense plants blocking out the sunlight, but with strange spheres that patrol amongst them and disintegrate anything that moves. Disch takes us into this little society, and we follow this group of well formed characters onward through further declines, delving into an underground world of strange fruits and un-ending roots systems; where human nature takes over and even the smallest of societies finally breaks down under the weight of desperation. The ending will may not shock you, but it will leave you thinking &quot;what if?&quot;Very well written, outstanding characterization, this is one of Disch's better adventures."},{"Title":"Triplicity","review":"At first I thought the book was going to be a tale of mankind's fall - a Plant has come to Earth that sucks up the water, grows fast (becoming the size of a maple in a month) and destroys the land. Nothing can live near it and few things can live on it.But small pockets of men live and fight back. They protect the land, grow food, keep animals and do what they can to survive. I figured we were no longer King of the Hill but mankind would still fight on.Then the story seems to change. There are machines that hunt down anything that may hurt the Plants. Mankind is nothing but a type of aphid hunted by robotic ladybugs - with flamethrowers.The aliens are never seen - only their machines. Maybe there are ONLY machines carrying out the operations in the first place - how many farmers are needed to run a farm in the 21th Century?And that is what the Plants are - seeds placed on Earth to be grown and harvested. It seems any planet would have been OK as one as it had water and lots of sunlight.The ending is sad but realistic - maybe this is how an alien invasion would happen. We would be so below their notice that not even their machines would tell us apart from the deer or cattle they also hunt down and kill."},{"Title":"Triplicity","review":"Bleak is the first word that comes to mind-which is not a bad thing. Disch's debut novel was part of a movement in sci-fi at the time that rejected the prevailing paradigm of human ingenuity and/or nobility being able to save the Earth from alien attack (no matter how technological advanced those aliens were). In this slim novel he tells the story of a small band of Minnesotan farmers near Duluth who are struggling to survive the blanketing of Earth by a mysterious and apparently indestructible species of trees. In the seven years since the spores first appeared, the trees have spread across the globe, sucking all nutrition from earth, drying up rivers and lakes, and generally destroying the planet's ecological balance.At the same time, some kind of automated drones have been leveling cities with fire and gradually seeking out remaining mammals to toast. The implication is clear: Earth has been designated as a planetary cropfield, and all pests need to be eliminated so the crop can thrive. That premise is neat, but the main theme is how the surviving humans interact with one another and newcomers. It's clear that Disch was determined to show how the uglier side of human nature would prevail in such a high-stress situation. Throughout the story, jealousies, rivalries, and petty disputes between characters threaten the safety of the group. Indeed, at times, the various conflicts concerning the women get a little too melodramatic for the situation, but on the whole, the atmosphere is great, especially when the survivors are forced underground into the trees' root system.A great take on the alien invasion story, it could benefit from a little trimming in the second half. Still, if you like your sci-fi grim and unsparing, this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Triplicity","review":"The Genocides must have caused quite a shock when it was first published in the mid-Sixties. This novel is not for the faint of heart, as a drastically reduced population of humans try to hold their own against alien plants and mechanical invaders. I found the second half of the story to move too fast toward its inevitable ending, but Disch will always remain one of the most underrated (by some) science-fiction writers of the twentieth century. A potent story which shows us how animalistic we all can be if the situation is right."},{"Title":"Triplicity","review":"Environmental degradation, global famine and mass extinction are some of the concerns held by those who think about the long-term future of our planet - a slow, lingering death for Mother Nature. In Thomas Disch's novel &quot;The Genocides&quot;, a race of unseen, uncaring aliens have done the work for us.In the space of seven years Earth has been overwhelmed by towering alien Plants, whose dominance has all but destroyed the ecological balance upon which all species survival depends. Billions have died, cities have been razed to the ground, and the Incinerators efficiently mop up any survivors.&quot;The Genocides&quot; concentrates on one isolated group that is still holding out. With grim determination, they skulk and scavenge among the Plants, trying to stave off the inevitable. Unlike the big-budget science fiction blockbuster films of recent years, this is not a story of heroism and valour. In fact, there are those who enjoy what is happening to them. Jeremiah Orville takes a perverse delight in the whole situation, while he plots revenge on the leader of the group who captured him.This is certainly a grim story, and possibly one of the best interpretations of the alien invader theme. Comfortless, hard-hitting and bleak. Goodbye Earth."},{"Title":"Triplicity","review":"I enjoyed this bookl Disch's characterizations are excellent. It is a short book-an easy read, but holds your attention the entire way. A new take on an old premise of world takeover."},{"Title":"Triplicity","review":"The collection 'Triplicity' brings together three of Thomas Disch's better short novels: Echo Round His Bones, The Genocides, and The Puppies Of Terra. This is a great way to start your Disch collection, who happens to be one of one my favorite authors. After 'Triplicity', I highly recommend 'The M.D.', my favorite Disch of all.Echo Round His Bones:Captain Nathan Hansard is an ordinary man and an ordinary officer of Camp Jackson, his only outstanding trait being his steadfastness. In the future (forgive the dates, this story was written in 1967 and considers 1990 to be \\"the distant future\\") the US has developed a matter-transmitter that changed global war relations forever. Hansard, though a lifer in the military, has never \\"jumped\\" before; until Colonel Ives orders him to Mars.Hansard soon discovers that there is a well-kept secret to the \\"manmitter\\", as it is jokingly called. An Echo. A literal creation of a duplicate person. Together, with other \\"Echos\\", Hansard must think of a way to stop the world from blowing itself up.The Genocides:With all the apocalyptic books out there to enjoy, this is the freshest approach yet, and probably one of the older books. One day the world is covered in little green plants sprouting up everywhere. One month later the little plants are already over 100 feet tall. Things fall apart too fast to stop them, and as they encroach on society, society collapses. Those who are left survive only by sheer determination and hard work, having not only to deal with the immense plants blocking out the sunlight, but with strange spheres that patrol amongst them and disintegrate anything that moves.Disch takes us into this little society, and we follow this group of well formed characters onward through further declines, delving into an underground world of strange fruits and un-ending roots systems; where human nature takes over and even the smallest of societies finally breaks down under the weight of desperation. The ending will may not shock you, but it will leave you thinking \\"what if?\\"Very well written, outstanding characterization, this is one of Disch's better adventures.The Puppies Of Terra:Ever wonder what would happen if humans, without losing intellect, became pets to a higher race? Disch answers this question with a playful romp through the imagination. The Masters, an ethereal race of supreme, God-like Beings, enter the minds of men and take them as pets. Humans, ever seeking complete comfort of being, feel that under The Masters protection they have touched the Hand Of God. They are comforted, and willingly allow themselves to become pets.The Masters create beautiful places for their human pets, called \\"Kennels\\", some on Earth and some on other planets. Only Earth contains humans who have refused The Masters, a renegade group determined to bring freedom back. The only problem is, the pets do not want to leave their Masters. They are well treated, well fed, and given complete freedom to move about the kennels and be creative.'The Puppies Of Terra' is told by one named White Fang, a pet of impeccable breeding, and follows him from childhood to becoming an adult, and how he was taken away from not just his family, but his Master as well.These three stories are excellent Disch's to serve up to yourself as a main course or a late night snack. Although Disch was one of the earlier Sci-Fi writers from the 60's and 70's, his works are timeless, and as good in today's market as when they were written. If he didn't actually use real dates in some of his stories, you would never know they were not written in today's SF styling. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Triplicity","review":"Aliens have covered the Earth with the seeds of giant plants that come to dominate the planet, at the expense of nearly all native plants and animals (including humans). The story focuses mainly on the inhabitants of a small town and their struggle to survive. And it's fair to say they'll do just about anything to survive. It's a dark, intense, chilling and even claustrophobic story. So, set aside a few hours on a rainy weekend afternoon for this one. Highly recommendend!"},{"Title":"Triplicity","review":"Engrossing, odd, frightening, and ultimately depressing story about humanity being wiped off the earth. The story picks up several years after mysterious plants have sprouted around the globe. They grow by the billions and are hundreds of feet high within months. The plants are everywhere - deserts, cities, sidewalks. Bodies of water are drained and the earth's eco system is soon thrown out of balance. Animals begin dyingoff. Governments grind to a halt. Cities turn to anarchy and people retreat to the country where they form little villages.Soon, flying mechanized drones appear and begin torching all remnants of humanity. Yep, things are definitely looking bad at this point. It becomes awfully clear that the plants are a crop being grown by some alien race and earth has been designated a good place to throw seed. It's a fascinating idea, certainly, but one that is as much horror as it is sci fi. Also, because we never know who the aliens are or anything about them, and because humanity is so pathetically outmatched from page 1, the whole thing ends with a slightly hollow ring. It ends up being rather depressing.Disch has an elegant writing style. It's fluid. He is able to shift gears from horror to humor without missing a beat - and without it seeming forced. He never seems to be talking about something he doesn't understand, and he doesn't overreach with his ideas. I think I would have liked this better if he had delved into the characters more. His character descriptions are lovely (like Maryann and her basket weaving) and seemed to give the village real flesh and blood, but then he abandons them too soon to rush off into more bloodshed.Anyway, I enjoyed this because Disch is an superb writer. I just found it a bit too bleak in the end."},{"Title":"Triplicity","review":"This first novel by Disch is really impressive, almost gothic in its grim, extreme vision of the extinction of mankind. The plot is very fast paced but there are still many layers of psychological and thematic interest. Disch's characters are not conventionally &quot;identifiable&quot; but are completely human. There's a purposeful, Bibical subtext to much of the story but it's subverted to Disch's own purpose."},{"Title":"Triplicity","review":"I've read Camp Concentration and 334 (both of which were great) but I have to say this is my favorite out of those.The story just sucks you in and then when it's over it leaves an imprint on your soul that makes you think about what it says.I still haven't stopped thinking about the implications of the thoughts behind this book.A must read for fans of intelligent, sci-fi literature."},{"Title":"Triplicity","review":"The Genocides, one of Thomas Disch's earlier ignored works, is actually the first Disch book I read. It tells the story of a small group of human survivors, led by Anderson, wandering the earth in search of a home after an alien civilization decides to cultivate the entire planet. The story begins seven years after spores are dropped; the earth is nearly consumed with plants 600 feet tall that are stripping the earth of its resources: soil and water. Anderson and his small group struggle to survive even in the face of the aliens who originally brought the plants. Highly suggested for any fan of science fiction without the threat of popularity. This book deserves more credit."},{"Title":"Triplicity","review":"The author created a realm that gave me a great sense of adventure and discovery.

The presentation is great but content is poor on two levels: unacceptable sweeping generalisations (eg. brown eyed people are intellectual)and a negative approach to the subject matter: systematically critical and judgemental about people and not seeing their strengths. What a contrast with books like The Power of face Reading by Rose Rosetree, or Face Reading: an Illustrated Encyclopedia by Mac Fulfer, whose respect and compassion for the human race calls out from every page. Also, the interpretations given in this book differ often from those given by other respected experts. Conclusion: not a book I shall be able to use, nor would I give it to anyone."},{"Title":"Face Language 2000 E-Z 10 Second Personality Speed Reading System : Advanced Social Technology for Today's World","review":"I've been interested in face-reading and palmistry for several decades and during the past 15 years I've tried to seek continual verification. In conclusion, I have very high regard for this field of knowledge, whether it is applied to health or to understanding personalities, one's past and potential future. It is quite amazing to find that we can verify whether people have tumours, gall stones or note the minute changes before and after an operation by looking at their faces. It is even more so to see how the lines in the palms change over the years corresponding to their emotional and personality changes. Face reading is certainly worth serious study. It is a joy to find this book's ingenious method of using rainbow colored divisions to demarcate different parts of the face for easier learning and application. All the colored drawings are very helpful in picking out the characteristic features. The summaries and personality analysis at the end help one to apply the &quot;E-Z 10 second personality speed reading system&quot;. This is a well-produced book. I hope it will be used as a preliminary step to understanding one another instead of categorizing people. We must also be aware that usually we use very general language that's hard to negate. If you point to someone's eyes or mouth and say that she &quot;desires love&quot;, how often will you get a &quot;no&quot; for answer? The need is to adopt a really scientific attitude and not to cheapen this field of physiognomy. There are many nuances. You can apply palmistry across the races. But with face-reading, I think we must be much more sensitive to some racial differences. Different combinations of features will also give new meanings. There are also deeper levels that face-reading must also consider, such as the muscles, the bones, the spirit reflected in the eyes and the more ephemeral colors related to energy rather than skin. These cautions only affirm the value of face-reading as windows to peeping into each person's uniqueness. This book serves as a very attractive and easy introduction, though at the price of being too simplistic."},{"Title":"Face Language 2000 E-Z 10 Second Personality Speed Reading System : Advanced Social Technology for Today's World","review":"I have have read all of the face reading books out there and never have I seen anything like this before.

I searched day and night in coffee shops, shopping malls, grocery stores, night clubs, etc. Until one day I saw her standing in line at a gas station AM.PM. and I quickly went up to her, and introduced myself. After reading her face and talking to her she had all the qualities I was looking for, and we hit it off. Fortunatetly to make a long story short wer'e getting married next spring. For those of you who are skeptical about face reading it really works, but you have to have the right book. Face Language 2000 it is the right book and it allowed me to make an unbelievable thing happen in my life. Many thanks to authors for making my dreams come true!"},{"Title":"Satellites, Rockets and Outer Space","review":"When I was a youth, I worshiped the American space program. It was a time of great thrills, as humans were going into space for the first time. Sputnik changed the American mindset forever, as before, the communist threat was primarily the overwhelming hordes but after that it was the potential for Soviet technical superiority. The \\"space race\\" was a constant reminder that the Cold War extended beyond the boundaries of the Earth's atmosphere.I first read this book in the early 1960's when I was reading everything about space that I could get my hands on. Ley did an excellent job in explaining in layman's terms what rockets are and the potential benefits. There is a short history of rocketry and he also covers some of the technical problems of putting a human into space. When the book was published, no person had yet flown into space, so some of the physiological reactions he describes are only speculative.Fortunately, the passage of time and the consequent increase in technical prowess have not exposed any flaws in Ley's technical reasoning. All differences between what he states and what has happened are minor in nature. Ley also includes a chapter on the then \\"flying saucer craze\\", debunking the likelihood that they are spacecraft from another world.Many technical treatises grow old rather quickly, but this is not one of them. Reading this book is a look back to a time when it was all so new, exciting and largely unknown. I enjoyed reading this book just as much this time as I did over forty years ago."},{"Title":"Warplanes of the Luftwaffe","review":"For those looking for an indepth reference oriented book relating to the Luftwaffe of WWII, this is the book for you. The author provides a very thorough look into a wide array of aircraft (a/c), giving both a developmental history as well as a fairly indepth look at what specifically changed from variant to variant. The information provided is very detailed and well laid out. You will find various color drawings interlaced with actual photos. As well, many types include a detailed &quot;transparent&quot; which details the components of the a/c. The author has also included a very handy quick reference feature in the form of a chart which provides a snapshot of important characteristics of specific types. As an example, the chart for the Fw 190 includes a snapshot of some 50+ variants from the Fw 190 V1 to the Ta 153. In describing a given a/c, the author does a very good job of giving a well rounded view of the plane; what was good about it, and what wasn't. You won't find, however, pilot accounts or actual combat recollections. The book is very much reference oriented. Overall, an excellent addition to ones collection. Trevor Myler"},{"Title":"Warplanes of the Luftwaffe","review":"I'm no expert but I am familiar with most of the Luftwaffe planes and I can't seem to think of one that's not represented here. Represented is rather a weak term for what this book provides. 250 pages, most of them with at least two or three illustrations of the various types. Photographs, a few of them in color, color drawings including quite a few 'three views' (front-on, top down and profile) of the more important types. There are also about two dozen 'cut-away' diagrams showing the structural and internal components of the planes.That's just the visual treats the book provides. The written descriptions give the required information - powerplant, dimensions, performance, armament, etc. Where there were prototypes, modifications and variants, details are also given. Of interest to me, and highlighted by the book, is the fact that much of the history of the Luftwaffe is also a story about designs and designers. Experimental designs were almost a rule rather than the exception. The great designers like Willy Messerschmitt, Ernest Heinkel and Claudius Dornier live on through their wonderful planes, even the great 'what might have beens' (Me 262, He 162, Arado 'Blitz' and my personal favorite, the revolutionary Do 335). All are beautifully depicted for us here."},{"Title":"Warplanes of the Luftwaffe","review":"Pros: Very complete, includes all the front-line types plus some of the most interestingexperimental planes.

It is precise in it's descriptions, although not in-depth for all presented models. The aircraft described in the book all have reached the flying status, so experimentals built but not flown didn't make it in. You might miss some aircraft, I'm not an expert (yet), but it looks very complete. On the down side: The extensive use of pictures (some wartime color pictures too!) sometimes forces the accompanying descriptive texts to be placed in a chaotic manner. I Just can't get past those first pages, so much do I enjoy them. Yes, truly a work right from the heart..."},{"Title":"Warplanes of the Luftwaffe","review":"I found this book to be the best refference I've come across regarding Luftwaffe aircraft. Very well researched with good photographs,provided appropriate detail and attention to each aircraft. One might be surprised that the Luftwaffe even possessed helicopters, along with some highly advanced rocket and jet aircraft. For example, there was even a prototype for a jet-powered flying wing, very similar to our B-2 stealth bomber! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Desert Fires","review":"While not quite as perfect as Desert Fires this book is easily one of the best novels I own, and I own many.It continues the saga and continues it as their children grow up and politics never ceases to cause trouble. This time with a sweeping bandit army and an evil, beautiful woman seeking to ensorcel the Pharoah for her own.There is, again, ancient egyptian magic in this book but it is not waving your arms and fireballs exploding. It is a subtle thing of curses and invoking the favor of the gods that goes well with the historical feel of the book.As far as I can tell, this book also is not set in any particular dynasty but instead made up. It feels right though, without pushing the authenticity. It simply reflects the times.One of my favorite books. Read Desert Fires first, then this right after. They are a seamless match."},{"Title":"Hawk","review":"George Green was born in Dublin in 1956 and brought up in Tipperary, where he lived in a house built on an ancient burial mound. After university he embarked on a career in sport and leisure Ten years later he realized his mistake, took an MA in Creative Writing, began teaching and now works for the Department of English and Creative Writing at Lancaster University.This is a book about all of the things that I look for in a novel. It is about Rome in AD34, a period and a place that I enjoy reading about very much. It is a time when the Emperor Tiberius preferred to be down the coast, in sunny Capri, away from the stench and mobs of the city, leaving all of this in the hands of his regent Sejanus, a man who has come down through history as reckless and cruel man.Serpicus, one-time charioteer and now hunter of wild animals, also yearns for the quiet life like Tiberius, but of course not everyone can have the privileges of an Emperor. Money talks in the world of Serpicus and he has had an offer he can't refuse, from of all people the uncle of Sejanus..The above synopsis provided by Amazon is more than adequate to give the reader a taste of the contents of the book and for those who do not like too much information before they read a book, my own gives just a taster of the start of an exciting and interesting story. As I said at the beginning, everything was in place in the book for me to know that I would enjoy it, I hope that you do too."},{"Title":"Soul Food and Living Water","review":"Although prepared specifically for the African-American palate, Christian families of any culture will find sustenance in Soul Food and Living Water. The poignant accounts of the Powells' journey through submission and respect in marriage, raising teens with understanding and maintaining bonds and wisdom from grandparents and ancestors will help all Christian households navigate the rigors of raising a world-changing family against a pulsing, flashing landscape of sin. Single parents also will find practical ways to keep their families dining at God's table--even if all the seats aren't occupied.At almost three hundred pages, Soul Food and Living Water offers enough to keep readers consumed for a long time. Each part of the book-individual spiritual relationships, marital intimacy, parenting and cultural heritage through extended family-could have easily comprised a book of its own. In an attempt to encompass all aspects of family, some subjects are probed more deeply than others, most notably marriage, understanding the influences of hip hop culture on teenagers, creating a home of peace and order and specific suggestions on dealing with family problems. The book is worth buying for these passages alone.The editing team at Moody can be commended for maintaining the voices of the authors as well as many references to African American culture, such as the principles of Kwanzaa and the spiritual significance of cultural gatherings like Friday night fish frys and other get togethers. Focus on the legacy of endurance found in African-American culture will leave the targeted reader uplifted and satisfied. The cover shot and images throughout are positive and appealing as well.--Marilynn Griffith"},{"Title":"Soul Food and Living Water","review":"This is a biblically based, self-help guide for families. The book is a must-have for families following the teachings of Christ in today's fast-paced world. The Powells offer a fresh outlook, which is rich in heritage and truly anointed in the word of God. Their biblically sound examples and practical applications make it easy to transform your personal relationship with God while expressing love and sharing the word with your family.The authors begin the book focusing on a personal relationship with God. Using biblical principles, the book emphasizes how every aspect of your life is tied to the Bible, even soul food Sunday dinners. The discussion on intimacy in marriages describes personal stories of commitment and provides suggestions on how to keep marriage as a threefold cord. The words are carefully crafted into stories, which present a clear relationship between Christ, husband and wife. Examples on how to enrich your marriage through romantic interludes, husbands leading the family while modeling the principles of Christ, wives modeling submission but still being independent, disciples expressing and sharing God's love to our families.Is it possible for today's African-American family to raise children to be Christ-like? The Powells say YES! They present examples, affirmations, and suggestions on changing from \\"world view\\" to \\"biblical view\\" without compromising commitments to self, family, church or work. They chip away at America's problem, the breakdown of the family, in a way that will transform the world.Soul Food & Living Water is not just a guidebook for reinventing the African-American family; it provides real-life answers to some of today's most complicated questions. As a Sunday school teacher and avid reader of Christian books on family and marriage, I strongly recommend this book to families, book clubs, Sunday school classes, and church leaders, as it will promote discussion while providing a biblical foundation. The word selection and presentation of ideas are skillfully sewn together to be culturally sensitive and relevant to other cultures. If family is important to you, this book should be part of your library.Reviewed by Monique Bruner for Loose Leaves Book Review"},{"Title":"Magica Ruta 40/magic Road 40 (Coleccion Turismo) (Spanish Edition)","review":"If you're looking at this book then you probably already know that this legendary road along the western edge of Argentina runs from nearly the frontier with Bolivia to almost the Straits of Magellan. This book provides some excellent color photos of not only the road itself but some of the scenic locations not far from La 40, including the Patagonian glacier parks. Ruta 40 has already taken on the sort of mystique that many North Americans associated with US route 66. At times it is a nicely paved highway and in places days can go by without seeing a single vehicle. The captions are in both Spanish and English, and Mr Kirbus has been kind enough to answer a question I had about a specific situation in the northwestern part of the country - his email address was shown on the back cover. If you think you might want to take a trip to the places where Ruta 40 runs through the Argentine outback then this is the first book you should get ahold of."},{"Title":"Magica Ruta 40/magic Road 40 (Coleccion Turismo) (Spanish Edition)","review":"I was very satisfied with the quick delivery of the book by \\"Latin Libros\\"It only took at about 2 weeks whereas at Amazon, two month were predicted.The book arrived in a perfect condition."},{"Title":"For the Birds: Paper-Pieced Birdhouses and Birdfeeders","review":"Just try choosing which project to do FIRST - they're all so pretty!!If I'm counting correctly, there are 10 birdhouse designs, 7 bird feeders, and 5 filler blocks. All blocks are shown with FULL color photographs, and the birdhouse/feeder blocks are shown as completed projects, with borders/sashing/binding, so you get great finishing ideas, and great color suggestions.The patterns each include a color photograph, a chart with the fabric key, sewing order, and suggestions for block embellishments. The pattern itself is full size, but does not include the seam allowances, nor are the multi-piece patterns already separated for you. The author has used dashed lines to delineate the different pieces in the multi-piece patterns (in comparison to other books just showing BOLD lines, which are hard to differentiate from the other pattern lines - at least - for ME). The individual sections of each pattern are clearly labelled with the section number and the fabric key. If you have NOT done paper piecing before, there is a large information section at the front with LOTS of instructions and drawings - even people experienced with paper piecing will find these instructions helpful!In addition to the 20+ block designs, you will find 6 &quot;Individual Block Wall Hangings&quot; - with full color pictures, clear and detailed instructions with drawings - even a Christmas design!!My hat is off to Jaynette Huff - what a fabulous book :).

Along the way, the reader will appreciate the historical context.S.L. Kalush, M.D."},{"Title":"Illegal Tender: Gold, Greed, and the Mystery of the Lost 1933 Double Eagle","review":"I'm not a coin collector. There are one or two coins I'd love to own. And I do own a few lovely ones. I say this so you'll know I'm not a member of the society of coin collectors --- that closed society of people who have their own vocabulary and ways of doing business.But I wanted to read this book because I became interested in why Roosevelt the second opted to steal gold from the American public, making it illegal. I also was enchanted with this coin that Roosevelt the First wanted so badly. He wanted it to not contain the motto, \\"In God We Trust\\" because he believed in separation of church and state. So the story begins in 1907.Well, I got much more from this book than I bargained for. To begin with, it's written wonderfully well. If you remember the old Dragnet radio and television shows, you'll recall how Joe Friday always said, \\"It was Tuesday, March 1 in Los Angeles. It was raining. ETC.\\" It drew you in. You could picture it, get a feel for it. Well, Tripp does that in this book. He accurately tells the reader when the action takes place --- sometimes including the exact time. He often tells what the weather was like that day.The book is exceedingly well documented. It is a true historical drama and mystery that, even today, is not really solved. All but one of these lovely coins are illegal. Yet we have reason to believe others exist --- somewhere.You'll enter the rather mysterious world of the true coin collector and dealer. You'll be thrilled at what you find. You'll meet people of greed. Just to hold this illegal coin, this beautiful, magnificent piece of history, must be the thrill of a lifetime. Yet few people have done so or ever will.You'll follow the coin from the mint to the final auction that makes this one coin legal (the others, if there are others, are illegal.)This is a fascinating book and I recommend it highly.-Susanna K. Hutcheson"},{"Title":"Illegal Tender: Gold, Greed, and the Mystery of the Lost 1933 Double Eagle","review":"This book is about a 7.5 million dollar gold coin. Obviously, this cannot be a normal coin. The book explain how the 1933 gold double eagle came to be. It begins with Saint Guadens designing the design because Teddy Rosevelt wanted new and inspiring designs. From there heads into the depression and the recall of all gold. The book invesitigates the murky beginning of all the 1933 double eagles. From there, it gets interesting. The secret service has a major headache on their hands. The plot thickens as more people come into play with these rare coins. However, you will have to read the book to see how everything plays out!I would reccomend this book to any numismatic interested in the history of these coins. However, some parts of the book can be slow. Do not stop reading it; keep going because the action picks up. Just remember, 10 more 1933 double eagles were just (2005) recently found which would add a new chapter to the book. That development makes the story even more interesting."},{"Title":"Illegal Tender: Gold, Greed, and the Mystery of the Lost 1933 Double Eagle","review":"This is magnificent! I couldn't put it down! It is beautifully written a la McCullough and Kearns Goodwin, whose prose I prefer to Ambrose, Morris and Chernow; those works are thorough, but a bit pedantic to my mind! Mr. Tripp unweaves a tortured web in a most enlightening way. His background in Art and Architecture embellish visits to our historic buildings, with accurate descriptions.The tedious years of investigation by the FBI and the lack of laws and oversight by the government make this very timely, indeed!

The author drones on and on needlessly about unimportant, irrelevant details.For example \\"The mercury flirted with ninety, while anvils in the sky built, waiting to crack and wash away the fetid air.\\" Ummm... how about these 5 words instead: \\"it was a hot day.\\" I know some of you are thinking that this is supposed to paint a picture, but trust me it isn't even necessary to mention the weather as it did nothing to advance the story/plot.Call me unimaginative but parts of the book read more like they belong in a 19th Century poem rather than a modern book.

It is clear that he accustomed to writing shorter essays and getting paid by the word. He spared no words or overstatements. This book is about a federal investigation of a coin wanted by collectors. I am a federal investigator and a coin collector. The first eighty pages of the book are a good read and a nice discussion of U.S. coins and the double eagle. The book then drones on and on discussing an unlikely series of circular interviews described with pointless details. The author attempts to tell the story in a colorful fashion by including passages that are reminiscent of detective novels but falling far short - to the point of being trite. Face it, this investigation lagged for 60 years. Obviously, evidence discovery was slow.If you are getting on an airplane and want a pleasant read that will put you to sleep, go ahead and buy it.

That was a mistake.

But this is not fiction. Rather it is a true story spanning more than 70 years and starring of all things a $20 gold coin!!!You see when Franklin Roosevelt took the country off the gold standard immediately after his inauguration in 1933, he ordered that all gold coins in circulation be returned to the government. It was a monumental task of course but most patriotic Americans voluntarily complied. Likewise, any gold coins that had been minted and not yet circulated were also ordered to be destroyed. In early 1933, more than 445,000 double eagle coins had been struck by the U.S. Mint. Somehow, a tiny quantity of these coins managed to see the light of day. And this is what \\"Illegal Tender\\" is all about. You'll learn how these coins managed to escape the clutches of the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia and all about the individual who was responsible. It is equally fascinating to read about those collectors who were able to obtain a rare 1933 \\"double eagle\\". For most of these folks the \\"double eagle\\" turned out to be an albatross. Be careful what you wish for!!! And as it became known that a quantity of these \\"illegal\\" coins had somehow fallen into the hands of collectors, David Tripp chronicles the Herculean efforts of the Secret Service to retreive them. Pretty compelling stuff!!!! Along the way you'll also be introduced to a number of coin dealers, lawyers and other assorted charactors who also play a role in this intriguing tale. Just what was it about these coins that was causing such a commotion?\\"Illegal Tender\\" gets off to a fast start and I found myself hooked right away. However, I thought the story lost a bit of momentum over the final few chapters. Nevertheless this is a well written book that certainly deserves your attention. Recommended."},{"Title":"Illegal Tender: Gold, Greed, and the Mystery of the Lost 1933 Double Eagle","review":"Although hard core coin collectors will enjoy this book, those of us who enjoy reading non-fiction crime stories will be a little disappointed. The author does a good job in describing the history of the coin at stake but loses something in the translation. The sad fact is that this coin's history is checkered and unknown. Therefore, the reader is always left guessing and speculating about how it ended up at auction. There is very little that is \\"known\\" when it comes to how this coin escaped the melt-down. Perhaps this is not the author's fault as he is limited by his subject. The book is readable and grabs the reader at times with the description of the auction as well as the FBI investigation in the 1930's as they tried to track down where the coins came from and who had them. All in all, the author did a competent job but the subject, which could have been fascinating, is somewhat dull."},{"Title":"Illegal Tender: Gold, Greed, and the Mystery of the Lost 1933 Double Eagle","review":"Rare coins, government fowlups, kings and presidents, big money, criminals, artists and a beautiful girl (on the coin)...all elements in this fascinating book.

All the elements of a great \\"whodunit\\" are here. The elusive treasure, the thieving insider, the hard nosed by the book detectives and tying it all together is the outstanding writing of David Tripp.In addition to weaving a fascinating tale of the fate of these precious 1933 Double Eagle coins, Tripp masterfully expands the panorama of the story to bring the reader back to the early 1930s and FDRs decision to essentially ban private ownership of gold. Indeed, while reading the first few chapters, I couldn't help but think the story of FDR's first 30 (forget 100) days in office would itself fill a book.The story of the hunt for the purloined gold coins is wonderfully told with rich texture given to the main characters, an insider's look on how an FBI sting operates, the sometimes shady world of numismatism, and everything in between. The kernels of information laced throughout this book will literally leave you saying this CAN'T be true. But it is. There's a great coda to the story, I won't spoil here, but Tripp leaves one last twist until the very end.This book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Illegal Tender: Gold, Greed, and the Mystery of the Lost 1933 Double Eagle","review":"Who would have thought that a book about an old gold coin would be interesting? Tripp does a fine job in explaining the financial problems this country was facing at the start of FDR's first term and how gold coins played a major part in saving the US banking system. The story of the '33 Double Eagle is fascinating--full of intrigue with a cast of characters worthy of Dickens.One does not need to be a numismatic to appreciate this story. A great example of narrative non-fiction. Bravo, Mr. Tripp."},{"Title":"Illegal Tender: Gold, Greed, and the Mystery of the Lost 1933 Double Eagle","review":"As with any thriller, the book opens with the background and history of the our protagonist, in this case, the Saint-Gaudens $20 Double Eagle. Tripp repeats the well known history of how President Theodore Roosevelt wanted to extend the gilded age and update the design of US coinage. Roosevelt thought the design of the Mint's Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber's were bland and not fitting of a great nation. Tripp reproduces reports of conversations and letters from Roosevelt to Barber and other US Mint officials demanding they follow the instructions of sculptor, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, as to how the coin would be minted. If you have not heard the details of this history, the first chapter is a must read.From the history of the rise of the Saint-Gaudens $20 Double Eagle, Tripp then talks about its demise. With the country in the throes of the Great Depression and the country revolting against President Herbert Hoover at the polls, Tripp discusses the tension between Hoover and the transition team of Franklin D. Roosevelt. While the country was experience a near total economic collapse, Tripp writes how FDR did not want to do anything that would give Hoover credit for doing anything before the March, 1933 inauguration.Hours after FDR's inauguration, the Senate approved the appointment of William H. Woodin as the Secretary of the Treasury. Woodin worked tirelessly with the Hoover administration to try to stop the damage. Tripp paints a great word picture as to how Woodin and FDR created a policy that helped the country pull out of the depression.One of the problem was the amount of gold leaving the United States and being used for overseas trade. More gold was leaving the Treasury than they were taking in. At Woodin's urging, FDR signed an executive order recalling all privately held gold. As this executive order goes through many updates, Tripp brings us inside the Philadelphia Mint facilities as they continue to mint 1933 $20 Double Eagles. Tripp puts us right in the Mint and traces the path of these gold beauties.With the order to melt these coins in 1934, the mystery begins. Tripp weaves the story in true mystery novel style following the trail of several of these coins as they leave the Mint. This includes the one coin with a legal export receipt that was shipped to King Farouk of Egypt. Tripp' coverage of the \\"Palace Collections of Egypt\\" or King Farouk's by the Egyptian government (website in English) is a classic twist of capitalism and greed meeting politics.The book bogs down a bit starting in the late 1950s as the trail for all of the Double Eagles gets cold and the various law suits are settled. The story picks up again with the discovery of the Farouk coin. Tripp follows the trail from its consignment in England through the seizure in the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City by the United States Secret Service. From there, the book reads like an episode of Law and Order leading up to the settlement and auction of this one-of-a-kind coin.The only thing that makes this only a four-star book is that Tripp's prosaic tome makes this composition a somewhat arduous read. One may require a dictionary close at hand to fully understand the lexicon he uses. If nothing else, the book did help improve my vocabulary. Otherwise, Illegal Tender is a wonderful book to read and better than most mystery novels because it is true!Illegal Tender won the 2005 Book of the Year award from the Numismatic Literary Guild."},{"Title":"Illegal Tender: Gold, Greed, and the Mystery of the Lost 1933 Double Eagle","review":"I expected Illegal Tender to be heavy on historical facts and otherwise a dry, boring read.

Until a few years ago I would now and then visit a coin show and, of course, hear the occasional rumor of what had happened to those few 1933 St. Gaudens gold double eagles that had missed being melted down. This well researched and well written book gives the complete story. This book is not for everyone.

That being said, I will say he was pretty close, closer thatn many of the other Burroughs wantabes. In Planet of Peril the author has our hero, Robert Grandon (Carson is already there), transported to the planet Venus into anothers body. Of course Grandon is transmitted right into the middle of an action packed story full of the perils of any semi-barbaric world filled with mean beasties, great big reptiles and wonderful maidens in distress that must be saved from a \\"fate worse than death.\\" This is a fun read. I have bee reading and collecting Kline's work for a number of years and do enjoy his work."},{"Title":"The Planet of Peril","review":"Otis Adelbert Kline (1891- 1946) was one of the American \\"scientific romance\\" writers of the early twentieth century. Some of the other writers in this school were Edgar Rice Burroughs, A. Merritt, Ray Cummings, George Allan England, H. Bedford-Jones, and Charles B. Stilson. These authors looked to colorful \\"new frontiers\\" for settings of rather garish adventures. Some of these settings included lost valleys, underground caverns, distant planets, the jungles of Africa, the interior of a hollow Earth or Moon, or the electron of an atom.There are still accounts floating about of a literary feud between Burroughs and Kline. The origin for these stories was an article by Donald A. Wolheim. Since that time, this thesis has been debunked in a study done by Richard A. Lupoff. Lupoff found no written or oral evidence of such a feud. Wolheim later admitted that he made the whole thing up. I think that it is fair to say that there was no rivalry or sense of hard feelings between the two authors. A similar case is that of stories circulated about a nonexistant feud between Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi that were generated by Hollywood publicists.That being said, it must be acknowledged that most of Kline's novels were blatant imitations (one might say \\"rip-offs\\") of Burroughs. Kline did not have the original imagination of Burroughs, the sense of color and rough poetry of Merritt, the scientific knowledge of Cummings, or the basic craftsmanship of Bedford-Jones. Moreover, his writing was frequently tinged with racial and sexual stereotypes. Even by the standards of his own day, he could not be said to be a major scientific romancer.But Kline did have one virtue as a writer, which might be characterized as that of briskness. Kline would get right down to business and start his action as soon as possible. He would then keep things moving until the close of the novel. Let us take _The Planet of Peril_ (1929), for example. At the opening of chapter one, Robert Grandon, our hero, is listening to a performance of _Don Giovanni_. By the opening of chapter three, he is waking up in some slave barracks on Venus. And bear in mind that the chapters in this novel are short.There follow a series of capture and escape episodes involving prison guards, hyeenalike predators, noble rebels, a reptilian monster, a beautiful queen, insectlike sabots and their human slaves, the underground palace of a lost race, and more. Much more. There are cliffhanging moments aplenty, but there is not a lot of structure to them. Sometimes they occur at the end of a chapter, other times at the begining or middle of a chapter.On some occasions scenes shift, with some degree of confusion. For example, at the end of chapter four, Grandon finds himself surrounded by an armed band of men. The begining of the next chapter opens in the palace of the queen. But instead of letting this scene play out for a full chapter, Kline abruptly switches scenes in mid-chapter to reveal that Grandin is among the rebels and that he is demonstrating his fencing skills to them.On another occasion, Grandon and the queen are captured separately by the sabots and are enslaved. Though a slave, Grandon is able to make it back to the site of their original camp and deduce that Vernia probably has been captured as well. But he is not able to escape, and he has to return to the insect plantation.Ah, well. No matter. No matter. Kline keeps things moving, even if it doesn't always make a lot of sense. And Kline buffs (there are still a few today) seem to like that briskness, that action-oriented quality of his.Perhaps it might be appropriate to close with a few bibliographical notes. _The Planet of Peril_ (1929) was the first of three adventure novels set on Venus. They were imitations of the Burroughs Barsoom planetary romances with a slightly different setting. Burroughs had not yet written any Venus adventures of his own. The other two novels are: _The Prince of Peril_ (1930) and _The Port of Peril_ (1949). The third novel was originally a six-part serial in _Weird Tales_ in 1932 under the title _Buccaneers of Venus_. Kline also wrote two Martian novels, _The Swordsman of Mars_ and _The Outlaw of Mars_. Both were serialized in _Argosy_ in 1933. There were also several series that were imitations of the Tarzan novels."},{"Title":"The Planet of Peril","review":"Just a fun read. Swords, beautiful women in distress, giant bugs and beast. If you like Bouroughs you will like Kline with a similar style in writing, plot and adventures."},{"Title":"The Planet of Peril","review":"This apperrs to be an abridged edition of the original Kline story. As a boy I read a version printed circa 1929 or the 1930s which contained far more development of the action. For example in the earlier version there is an episode of an encounter with a ptang which is killed and eaten by the rebels in Uxpo. That episode describes what a ptang is. in the modern version there is no mention of the hunt and the word ptang appears once with no description. The current version omits passages which carry the story smoothly through passage of time. The current version jumps from one adventure to another with no connection of the time or action between events. Is it possible to find an uncut version of Planet of peril?"},{"Title":"The Planet of Peril","review":"In 1929, Edgar Rice Burroughs approached his editor with the idea of starting a series of Barsoom-like novels set on Venus. His editor quickly informed him another author had already secured the publication of a Venus novel. This delayed Burroughs' writing of his own Venus series by a couple of years. The author whose story appeared in the magazine was Otis Adelbert Kline. The story was this book, Planet of Peril, written (or at least begun) by Kline years earlier in 1922. The novel begins with the abduction by the mysterious Dr Morgan of a man named Robert Grandon. Grandon soon learns Morgan has established a telepathic link with a scientist on Venus (known as Zarovia to its inhabitants) who has found men willing to do astral body transfers with Grandon and a man named Harry Thorne, who really was a Martian named Borgen Takkor who had already engaged in a transference. Once on Venus, Grandon finds himself a slave under the imperious Queen Vernia, whom he soon desires to possess. From there, it's all adventure as Grandon and Vernia alternately battle and assist each other across Venus. Kline lets his imagination go wild with hyena-like animals capable of cutting down trees, giant termites capable of enslaving men, treachery in Vernia's court, and all kinds of other exotic delights as Grandon seeks his destiny on Venus. Unfortunately despite its vivid description of Venus and sense of wonder, the flaws of this novel as Kline's first full-length work are obvious. Pacing at times is poor. Plotting assumes slapdash laziness at times. Characters engage in sudden shifts from good to evil and back again as the plot dictates with no underlying indication of legitimate motivations. Grandon himself alternates between grating cliched pulp stupidity and omnicompetence. Nonetheless, this book, despite its many flaws, is a worthwhile read sure to delight fans of its genre. On final note though: The edition pulished by Pulpville Press is the definitive one. Any edition published before the Pulpville edition features a cut and bowdlerized version originally published by Tom Bouregy and Associates and later by Avon. That is an inferior text to be avoided in favor of the Pulpville print, which is taken directly from the original magazine publication."},{"Title":"The Tao of Leadership/Audio Cassette","review":"I have listened to a good translation of the Tao Te Ching along with some commentary about it, which was very interesting, but some ideas from China before Christ do not translate do today's world directly. This audio book makes the Tao more useful in today's world, especially for leading groups, including therapy groups such as I do. Especially helpful are the anecdotes by a leading expert in leadership which follow each passage. I would recommend this to anyone who has read or listened to the Tao and wants to understand it better. It is especially easy to listen to in the car."},{"Title":"The Tao of Leadership/Audio Cassette","review":"This book changed my whole outlook on life, work and parenting. I came to realize that &quot;leadership&quot; is simply the art of observing, reflecting, understanding, and helping others to understand. Snippets of wisdom like &quot;The wise leader is invisible&quot; and &quot;only push where there is no resistance&quot; will have you contemplating the true meaning of leadership. I've read this book many times over (it's a short book and brisk read, the time is spent absorbing and reflecting) and it refreshes me each time. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"The Tao of Leadership/Audio Cassette","review":"I have read this book countless times since purchasing it in the late 1980's. Its pages are worn but its content remains fresh, profound and useful. I have worked with Global 500 Leaders throughout the world for nearly 20 years and find this book reaches them at a core level and has created an impetus for real change in many. This is on my required reading list for every leadership retreat and has been a treasured gift to many clients.No preaching, just ageless wisdom applied to leadership, and life. I would dare any reader not to get something out of this book. The lessons are only a page long so you can easily pick it up to read one at a time or devour the entire book in short order, as so many do."},{"Title":"The Tao of Leadership/Audio Cassette","review":"This book is a classic. I enjoyed the simple yet powerful advice on leadership and personal development. I especially like the fact that the wisdom found in this text transcends cultures and generations and can be applied to leadership as well as life in general. I found the format to be very useful, each lesson is contained within one page so that you could read it as a daily dose of wisdom or read the entire book straight."},{"Title":"The Tao of Leadership/Audio Cassette","review":"To think that this little gem of a book was required reading by one of my professors in college amazes me. The messages inside are simply profound! - as I just found out by rereading this book almost 15 years later. In college, I got it to some degree but not nearly to the degree that it clicked with me now. For some reason I held onto this book and while I was browsing my bookshelf it kind of jumped off at me.It also amazes me that the wisdom in the book the Tao Te Ching written by Chinese sage Lao Tzu around the year 600 BC - the one in which John Heider's adaptation was derived - transcends time and is as relevant today as it was then.I say this is a must read for all since we are all leaders of our own lives.

It has the vernacular, the attitude, the mystique, and the community values of residents of 1930 Harlem down pat. I found the narrative very inviting. This book has detectives, criminals, lawmen, africans, and mystics. Once you read the first chapter, you will not be able to put the book down. It is a shame that the author did not live long enough to produce much more in this detective series."},{"Title":"Conjure-Man Dies; A Mystery Tale of Dark Harlem","review":"This is the first African American mystery novel, originally published in 1932, and much celebrated by Walter Mosley, the most successful African American writer of mystery novels. (This book preceded Chester Himes's Coffin Ed and Grave Digger novels by more than a third of a century.)W. E. B. DuBois castigated the group of younger writers of which Fisher was a part for sensationalizing low life rather than celebrating the &quot;talented tenth&quot; of which they were presumably a part. I don't know if Fisher was stung by this, but the protagonists include a physician (like Fisher himself), a policeman who is the only black who has risen to the rank of detective, and an African prince with a princely sense of noblesse oblige. Also an critically important part is played by a mortician, a kind of professional.The main lower-status participants, who liven things up with a running game of the dozens, are not debauched, and the \\"conjure man\\" turns out not to be the wacko many thought him to be.The middle of the novel sags. Unfortunately, Fisher did not live to hone his craft, leaving only this and _The Walls of Jericho_ and a few stories."},{"Title":"Conjure-Man Dies; A Mystery Tale of Dark Harlem","review":"I discovered this book through my Amazon recommendations. In this case, their mysterious calculations delivered a treasure!Rudolph Fisher, a major figure in the Harlem Renaissance, died at age thirty-seven, having written only two novels and some short stories. His detective novel, The Conjure-Man Dies, is a complete delight.According to most sources, this is the first detective novel by an African American. There are no white characters. The crime victim is Frimbo, an African king in his own land, and in Harlem a Harvard graduate who makes his living by the exercise of his tribal psychic powers. He is invisibly and bizarrely murdered in the dark recesses of his office in the very midst of predicting the future.Suspects include the various people consulting with Frimbo that evening, not to mention his cock-eyed servant.There are three investigators, not merely one! Detective Dart, a rare Black detective, is out to prove his worth. Doctor Archer, called to the scene of the crime, lends his logical and forensic insights to help Dart. Then there's Bubber Brown, ex-street cleaner turned private eye, hoping to clear his friend from suspicion of the murder.The plot has such amazing twists that I won't say anything more about it.Published in 1932, The Conjure-Man Dies treats us to lots of vintage black humor, including witty insults between loveable ne'er-do-wells and Detective Dart's struggles with Dr. Archer's professorial jargon.I suspect that Fisher, who was a successful doctor as well as an important writer, might have influenced the attractive character of Doctor Archer.The Conjure-Man Dies offers a lively picture of Harlem in the twenties. I strongly recommend it as an exotic reading experience, as well as a highly original mystery."},{"Title":"Conjure-Man Dies; A Mystery Tale of Dark Harlem","review":"I stumbled across this book one day in the library and took it home based solely on its status as the first known African-American detective story. It took me a few weeks to finally pick up, but when I did finally dip into it, I found it hard to put down. So often, when one reads an older genre book (this one was originally published in 1932), the language is badly dated, the structure creaky, and the overall effect quite stilted. Here, the language and setting brim with so much vitality that the rather formally structured book feels quite fresh.Set in 1930s Harlem, the story kicks off when Dr. John Archer is summoned to attend to his neighbor Frimbo, a well-known conjure-man (aka psychic, sorcerer, fortune-teller, etc.). The doctor finds Frimbo dead, with a waiting room full of clients. Soon, Detective Dart of the Harlem precinct (literally the talented tenth of the precinct's ten black police officers) shows up to take charge, and allows Dr. Archer to join in the investigation. Unfortunately the corpse disappears, only to make a remarkable reappearance which confounds the police. Like many novels of the \\"classic\\" detective era, the story is intent on misdirection and confounding the reader as, over the course of the book, it's unclear just who the victim actually is, if a crime has actually been committed, and if so, how and why.Dr. Archer and Det. Dart must wade through a variety of clues, red herrings, and possible motives to get at the heart of the matter. The doctor even jokes that he should write a book in which the least likely person isn't the the murderer for once -- a very clear wink to the reader that pays off in the classic final revelation in which all the suspects and witnesses are gathered in one room. Joining in on the fun is Bubber Brown, a colorful local entrepreneur trying to clear the name of his friend Jinx Jenkins, who has been locked away as the suspect with the most opportunity to kill Frimbo. Bubber and Jinx are the book's highlights, as their conversations are less dialogue, than an ongoing game of the dozens. (They duo are carryovers from Fisher's earlier Harlem novel, The Walls of Jericho).Fisher was an intellectual giant, and the story is packed with scientific details from his own background as a pioneering doctor. There's also plenty of discussion of determinism, metaphysics, and at one point, an bitter comment on racism. Various lit-crit scholars have written articles over the years seeking to dissect the book for greater meaning, but the simple fact of the matter is that it's an entertaining read, both for fans of mysteries and those interested in the Harlem Renaissance setting. Soon after its publication, it was staged as a play by the Federal Theater Project, and the story has periodically been optioned for the film industry. It's probably a little too old-fashioned to work as a feature film, but might work well as the lead episode for a Masterpiece Theater-type period mystery series on PBS."},{"Title":"Conjure-Man Dies; A Mystery Tale of Dark Harlem","review":"This book is a must have for anyone interested in the Harlem Renaissance, Mystery Literature, and simply good story telling. I eventually bought this book in a first edition copy for several hundred dollars a few years ago. The book adequately and provocatively illustrates the attraction of a good mystery novel. The book is simply brilliant. A great American story about the social interaction of race, justice, and survival in 1920's Harlem with all the pomp, ceremony, and show of a traveling circus. In the end, Fischer was brilliant and far ahead of his time. Langston Hughes often praised him as a savant worthy of the title of artistic genius who died far to early...."},{"Title":"Conjure-Man Dies; A Mystery Tale of Dark Harlem","review":"This who done it story is very unpredictable.

Listening to the CD as soon as I got the book, I thought \\"Great, this is going to be way over my head,\\" but within about an hour, I was playing the piece I had just listened to. By the way, why did it take me so long to start using my DVD player for instructional CDs? I can use the remote from my playing chair, and I can easily see which track I'm on from across the room .This book might not be challenging enough for guitarists who consider themselves experienced fingerpickers, but for hacks like me who are trying to throw some variety into their playing, it's a great choice for the money. I own a lot of guitar instructional books and quite a few of them have CDs with them, but I've never found them terribly useful. After hearing Mark Hanson's materials recommended at three different acoustic guitar workshops, I decided to give this one a try. I've since ordered his Travis Picking and Solo Fingerstyle books and have been impressed with them as well.If you're not already fingerpicking, this package will get you into it in a relatively painless manner, and you'll probably find yourself experimenting with songs you already know using new techniques. Cheers!"},{"Title":"Beyond Basics Fingerstyle Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"This is a good book for just starting out, but anyone who has played for a while (more than a year or so) may find this book limited. I was able to go thru all the lessons in a day and a half. At least the songs in here are different than most of the other lesson books."},{"Title":"Beyond Basics Fingerstyle Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"This book is good for people who have some chordal knowledge, but don't know the fundamentals of finger-picking. This is definitely not an advanced book, but a very helpful tool for a moderate beginner who can already strum a few songs.If you already have a handle on finger-picking, this book will bore you.For those who can strum chords and need further learning, this book will guide you through the finger-picking rudiments at a nice pace that will keep you interested, but will not overwhelm you."},{"Title":"Beyond Basics Fingerstyle Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"I picked up guitar a few years ago and have been struggling finding a good book that would allow me to teach myself at my own pace and at the same time leave me feeling like I was accomplishing something.

I recommend it for any beginner-intermediate guitarist who is looking for a book to help them FEEL and HEAR the guitar in a new light!!!"},{"Title":"Beyond Basics Fingerstyle Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"With absolutely zero fingerstyle abilities after 15 years of playing guitar I was fed up! I purchased Mark Hanson's Fingerstyle Guitar (Beyond the Basics)after reading the reviews. While expectations were low, I was pleasantly surprised to see my abilities improving at an astronomical rate. Don't get me wrong, it's not a miracle book. I had to put many long hours into it, but my musical background was so lacking (I played songs that were very simple for years)that I was also working on other problem areas such as timing and learning to read music and TAB (although none of Mr Hanson's books require the ability to read music, and TABS are explained fairly well in the books).The lessons are very well thought out and I like how at the beginning of each section you hear a musical piece that sounds rather complicated, but you are playing the entire piece by the end of the section. Mr. Hanson wrote most of the pieces as well, with each technique he teaches incorporated into the songs. Very clever and effective. Each song is broken down into a series of manageable exercises. As long as you work each lesson and proceed after doing them effortlessly you should find the songs quite doable, although later lessons require more thinking on the reader's part, but by that point the hand-holding of the instructor is less, as it should be. I see myself coming back to this book every few months and playing the songs in their entirety in one sitting because it will force me to remember the lessons. This book helped me gain a lot of confidence, and I'm always getting compliments on my playing, even by people in my band that originally took me on as a harmonica player. This is a very exciting period for me.The only complaint I have is that Mark says \\"Very good!\\" after many of the exercises for encouragement. I'll tell ya', there were some times where I sounded like I little kid playing a Walmart guitar and to hear \\"Very good!\\" after producing such rancid notes and melodies reduced his credibility as a musician! :)"},{"Title":"Beyond Basics Fingerstyle Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"Targeted to a range from beginner - intermediate players.

I think I've finally found my go-to book! Often finger picking is included as an afterthought in a small section of a method book, or it is part of a song book that is pretty advanced. The p-i-m-r introduction in this book is wonderful. Also, as you turn the pages the songs certainly become more interesting and difficult. It is not JUST a book of exercises. For 11 dollars, you can't beat it.

In the last few months, I have developed a desire to play fingerstyle guitar as well as improve my chord-playing. Many songs demand that you have these skills. This book has taken me much farther than I had expected.First of all, I really like the songs. They are a combination of folk, blues, and \\"soundscape\\"-style music, similar to what you would hear in a scene of a movie. I loved this CD, which is not something I can say for all of the other book/CD sets I own. I got very excited at the thought of playing some of the more advanced songs in the book - and, guess what? I am on my way.The book has greatly increased the dexterity in my right hand fingerpicking, and has also aided in my ability to play chords. This has directly aided my playing of some Jazz songs I know, and will also help with playing folk songs and Delta Blues.Finally, I really enjoyed the instructor's approach and kind manner. He broke the songs down into sections, which you learn individually, and gives thorough guidance on how to play each one. Once you have the sections down, you then combine them and play the entire song.

I read the reviews here and took it that the peices would be harder than they are. If you have basic finger separation and the ability to play two and three note thumb patterns you may easily be able to play, and remember, everything in this book in a bit over an hour. It is straight-forward.I disagree with the people here that say the peices will make you sound better than you are. What you get with this book is peices that bring out the beauty of the *sound* of the guitar. Most people, including us guitarists, are just suckers for the open ringing you get so easily with a (decent) guitar and that is what these peices exploit. If you play these peices you will not sound like a pro (at least not to a musician, maybe to your grandma). You will, on the other hand, sound....lovely.So, I recommend this book one hundred percent to a beginner who can play a few chords competently and wants to get into fingerstyle. But if you can play with you fingers a little already, look around for a slightly more advanced book."},{"Title":"Beyond Basics Fingerstyle Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"This is the fourth book I have purchased by Mark Hanson.

The book has many difficult appearing chord names--BUT--most of the chords are two fingered and can be moved up an down the neck to make for some really great accompaniment. You will be playing all over the guitar--and sounding like a pro real fast. The book gets into more complicated material towards the end--but this book is not as complicated as the earlier mentioned books--so I would recommend this one first."},{"Title":"Beyond Basics Fingerstyle Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"This book is superb. Hmm. Wait: it's flawless. I had heard that Hanson was a great teacher. Now I see why.I've been playing about four years, I have a certain amount of ability, and I was able to start picking things up from this book right away. I was playing the first song in an hour or so. It uses all kinds of complex-sounding chords (Amin6, Dmin6, etc.), but Hanson ingeniuously uses very simple-to-play chords. As in, most of them require only one or two fingers!I recently recorded myself playing one of the book's first songs and posted it to a message board of guitarists. Several people commented that it sounded \\"really complicated.\\" Little do they know how easy it is to play! (They wanted me to post tabs--I gave them a link to come here and buy the book.)The book's songs start at the fairly easy level, but by the end of the book, the material is extremely challenging. (Some high-speed ragtime.) If you're brand-new to the guitar, you'll struggle even with the first songs--but they would be learnable even by a novice. It will be a mighty struggle for me to learn the later songs in the book.If you have any level of fingerpicking experience at all, you will jump into this book like a fish into a river. You will find excellent material to build your chops.The book contains very little in the way of theory, but those two-finger chords I was telling you about are a great way for an advancing guitarist like me to sit and think about chords and the notes that go into them, and how to build them all over the neck. So you don't really get any theory about this book, but with a little dedication on your part, you can use it as a sort of launching platform. That's what I'm doing.... It has vaulted straight into the \\"top 5 most valuable books\\" category for me--and I've bought a lot of guitar books...."},{"Title":"Beyond Basics Fingerstyle Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"This book is excellent. I found it by chance and decided to give it a shot. Whether your just learning fingerpicking, or youve been playing for a while, there are lessons to challenge any player in this book. Ive played guitar for 12 years, fingerpicking, but not TRAVIS picking. I first heard Travis picking in Dust in the Wind by Kansas. This book will teach you how to play like Lyndsey Buckingham in no time. the lessons in the beggining are easy and prepare you for the beautiful songs that you can learn in the end. People hear me play the songs from this book and think Im amazing. (secretly, it took me 2 weeks to master this book, practicing for 30-60 minutes a night)If you want to learn to play classical guitar, then get this book, steal it, buy it, borrow it from a friend, just get it!"},{"Title":"Beyond Basics Fingerstyle Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"Wow! After playing various guitar styles for years and years, I decided to learn a little fingerstyle guitar and boy am I glad I picked up this book. While only 56 pages, the book includes a CD and some GREAT practice pieces to learn. Hanson lays out the material in a format that is simple enough for a beginner but also challenging enough for the intermediate to advanced player. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Beyond Basics Fingerstyle Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"I decided to start playing acoustic guitar about 2 months ago after a 25 year hiatus. I didn't know exactly what I style I wanted to take on, so I purchased several books on different styles and flavors of music from power chords to classical. (As a side note my musical tastes range from Andres Segovia through Michael Hedges on to Tool, so go figure).As a beginner I found this book to be very approachable with little formal guitar experience or training. Mark Hanson does a wonderful job arranging these pieces to make your guitar sound beautiful. The pieces start out easy and end up pretty difficult. Again I've only been playing again for a couple of months. I'm still trying to wrap my fingers around Taylor's Ferry and Brahm's Lullaby.Last Sunday morning over coffee with my wife I played through the first three arrangements in the book; Canyon Cannon, Windows and Wheels, she remarked that they sounded wonderfully relaxing. Happy me!I highly suggest using the CD with the book. I put the CD in my car and listened to it for days driving back and forth to work. It helped me feel the ebb and flow and swelling of the sound. After learning the fingering I was then able to incorporate what I heard on the CD to get rid of the rote stiffness and bring it to life.An excellent book for a beginner like me and convinced me this is one style of guitar playing I want in my tool box."},{"Title":"Beyond Basics Fingerstyle Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"This book,like other Mark Hanson books, is not only well written and presented, but comes with a CD that's almost like having a teacher at your side. I'd certainly disagree with the review by A. Mutimer who says \\"If you have basic finger separation and the ability to play two and three note thumb patterns you may easily be able to play, and remember, everything in this book in a bit over an hour.\\" While an advanced player would be able to get through this material quickly, how many of those who are just learning fingerstyle guitar are at that level? Played at tempo, a piece like \\"Key to the Kingdom\\" obviously requires expert finger control and speed, which is one reason, I'm sure, why Hanson says he plays this piece in most of his concerts. It's impressive, and anybody who can play it like he does is definitely an advanced guitarist. But what makes this book so appealing is that even a beginner can tackle this piece at a much slower tempo and enjoy trying to develop their skills. Other pieces in the book, like \\"Canyon Canon\\" are easier, but still challenging enough for beginners and intermediate players who haven't mastered fingerstyle technique, and provide plenty of opportunity for improvisation to take them to a higher level. I give this book a 5 star rating even though it has some errors. I contacted the author's website to mention the errors I found in the chords/notation/tabs for \\"Key to the Kingdom\\". It's played correctly on the CD, but the printing errors could confuse somebody who realizes that some of the printed notes don't correspond to the way it's played. I was told that Warner books, the publisher, failed to give the author a chance to proofread the book before publication. I'd be happy to share these errata with anybody who can't figure them out."},{"Title":"Beyond Basics Fingerstyle Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"I am a self-taught guitarist and I considered myself a beginner. Being self-taught, I'm pretty directionless and whimsical when it comes to practicing and learning. I randomly pick songs off YouTube to mimic, download random tablature and more recently I decided to start investing in guitar instructional manuals to try rein in my lack of discipline. Beyond Basics Fingerstyle Guitar is one of the books I purchased a few weeks ago.For someone who is attempting to self-teach and lacks direction, this book is great. The book is broken down into several sections, each of which build up to a simple but beautiful song. The author takes different measures out of the song and explains both in the book and on the CD and the breakdown is very clear and logical. The author is also very encouraging, especially on the CD; he has a very patient and calm voice - feels like having a nice teacher in the room with you. He plays the tracks slowly at first and then speeds up to tempo and adds encouraging words along the way.Given the title \\"Beyond Basics\\" I assumed that the author was assuming at least some foundation in fingerstyle but he starts from the very beginning and the book, I feel, doesn't take you very far beyond that. This is not a bad thing. I feel that he tries to make sure you've developed basic fingerstyle skills without frustrating you, so while progress might seem incremental, they are building solid foundational skills in a slow but non-frustrating way. Other instructional books I've acquired seemed to jump around with skill level and techniques and this book is like a nice comfort blankie to come back to because it assures you that you are progressing while other books may suddenly drop a roadblock on you.One thing that was a little different about this book was that the author immediately takes you up and down the fretboard (albeit on the same two strings). Other beginning instructional books usually never stray past the first 5 or even 3 frets so that was a nice change.Overall, I recommend for the absolute beginner. If you already have some guitar skills and are looking to develop some fingerstyle skills, this book may not be for you. If you already have some fingerstyle skills (you've developed some right hand finger independence), this book may be OK especially to review but it will not take you very far. I felt it was a little easy for me but I really enjoyed his teaching style and will definitely move on to his other fingerpicking books."},{"Title":"Beyond Basics Fingerstyle Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"I've been playing for 14 months. During this time I have purchased many books and videos on learning to play guitar. But, when it came to learning fingerstyle, I got lucky in picking (no pun intended) Mr. Hanson's book on Travis Style guitar and have since \\"progressed\\" to his other books, including this one.In the end, we're all self-taught, and Mr. Hanson's books helped me teach myself easier, faster, and better. You begin by learning simple patterns then applying the patterns in practice routines that combine left and right hand exercises (position changes). At your own pace, you move on in the book to more difficult and challenging patterns. Musical pieces are introduced and they evolve into more challenging pieces and melodies. As you practice and listen to the CD, you feel like someone is right there teaching and keeping you moving along.If you're like me, when you first hear the CD you might not believe you can play the pieces. But, if you practice you'll be able to play them well and in a relatively short period of time. How much time it takes depends on your own abilities and willingness to practice correctly and of course practice frequency. It takes me a long time to master new material as my fingers don't cooperate as well as I'd like them to. But, I've found Hanson's book and CD combinations to be thoughtfully layed out, well written and worth the price.His web site is very supportive. The author and staff respond to emails and provide excellent support via newsletters and quick responses."},{"Title":"Beyond Basics Fingerstyle Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"Excellent book. Ihad been playing for about 2 years when i purchased this book and I love it. You'll quickly learn several different patterns of fingerpicking while learning to play in different styles of music.

You won't be playing at that level obviously, but it is a start.I have recently purchased the contempary art of travis picking by Mark Hanson and I plan on working through that book as well"},{"Title":"Beyond Basics Fingerstyle Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"This book of excercises and songs is the best ever for getting right down to fingering your own wonderful sounds which Mark Hanson has put together in a way that shows his interest in helping new guitarist in the fingerstyle method.

My first exposure to fingerstyle was in lessons from a classically trained guitarist. He introduced me to the p-i-m-a designations of the fingers of the right hand. Because of this early exposure, books that teach fingerstyle technique using any other nomenclature are confusing. This one uses t-i-m-r [thumb, index, middle, ring]. This might make sense to you and be suited to your purpose. That wasn't so for me. Yes, it would be possible to go through the book changing all the finger references over to the system I'm familiar with. But it would be BETTER if Amazon's 'Look Inside' feature actually showed some useful content so that I might avoid the error in the first place. I returned the book to Amazon, so rated it 3-stars, not wishing to slam it, nor give it high praise since I don't have enough experience to form an opinion on the content."},{"Title":"Beyond Basics Fingerstyle Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"I found this book to be very useful in teaching fingerstyle guitar to my students,Once you know the basics of the guitar I highly recommend moving on to this book."},{"Title":"Beyond Basics Fingerstyle Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"The songs start pretty easy and are broken into sensible exercises and segments to help the beginner master the entire pieces. They start out very easy and progress to a few pieces that are more challenging and showy. All the songs are fun to play. GREAT BEGINNING fingerstyle book."},{"Title":"Beyond Basics Fingerstyle Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"Would the gentleman who wrote about the errors in the book and offered to share please post an email address. I would love to have your errata. I am frustrated at the discrepancy between what is written and what is played. Other than that I am finding the book both challenging and satisfying. Have played for 4 years - practicing 1-2 hours a day and this book provides some pieces that give a real polish to my sound. Planning to purchase other Hanson books. Having the CD to go along with is very helpful. I do wish that the entire piece Key to the Kingdom had both the song played at half speed in its entirety and the full speed rendition that is provided. For someone like me struggling with the speed of this monster, it would have been helpful to play along at my speed for the entire piece."},{"Title":"Beyond Basics Fingerstyle Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"I like Hanson's books - he's a good teacher with good material, as are most other authors of tutorial books with CDs. However, I could've saved a lot of money on books had I first come across the DVD \\"How to Play Fingerstyle Guitar\\" by Eltjo Haselhoff (available through customerservice@peghead.nl), which I'd come upon at YouTube. The video production is top notch, from lighting to scripting, to camera angles, etc. and Mr. Haselhoff's goal is to get you to a point of fingerpicking mastery that you needn't have to have tab to play a tune that you've heard. His instructions are very clear, and, like his playing, precise. And he has a pleasing personality as well.Check it out."},{"Title":"Beyond Basics Fingerstyle Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"Im not a good guitarist but after going thru this book found that im able to follow the style and the CD was a great help. Mark H. did a good arrangement and this book serves for an intermediate guitarist."},{"Title":"Beyond Basics Fingerstyle Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"It is a good book on fingerstyle guitar. When I bought it some months ago I was able to play arpeggios and some picking patterns. The first lessons are easy to follow but the last ones are hard. You will need time to get some patterns.I agree with some reviewers. All the studies sound very nice but not all studies sound as the \\"professional\\" ones.However, my main complain is the lessons are written twice. I mean, the book has the complete partiture in a sheet but the previous sheets are the same partiture divided into bars. The author try to explain how to play every bar but sometimes it is just an unnecessary introduction. I'd prefer another kind of previous exercises (some lessons require them) and/or references to the main partiture. I did read before, it seems as if the author or publisher need to use more pages in the books."},{"Title":"Beyond Basics Fingerstyle Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"This book is the perfect path forward if you are a beginner/intermediate guitarist, who is stuck in a rut, and you're interested in fingerstyle guitar. Mark Hanson is a superb teacher, and this book covers a wide swath of material without spreading itself too thin.I deduct one star because in several cases the marked left-hand fingerings are incorrect. For example, in measure 5 of Key to the Kingdom, the 7th fret note is marked as being ring finger, but on the audio CD, he clearly says little finger. Several other spots in Key to the Kingdom are fingered inconsistently with how Mark actually plays them (using his videos on Youtube as a guide). His DVD of this material might also help (I have not viewed it). As an aspiring guitarist, it's important for me to learn not only the right notes, but also the right fingerings. This is a somewhat minor nitpick, but something to be aware of."},{"Title":"Beyond Basics Fingerstyle Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"It had been some years since I had regularly played a guitar. Much of my previous experience with the guitar had been boring. This book has fed new life into my playing. I get done with an evening session and feel deeply content, even inspired. All of my previous experience with the guitar pales by comparison in terms of how it left me feeling. Though I suppose that has less to do with this book and more to do with the lifeless way in which I approached the guitar. Still. I love this book."},{"Title":"Beyond Basics Fingerstyle Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"This book will be a little above an absolute beginner as it takes time to master the technique playing some of these chords ,that said it's worth getting if you can read TAB & PIMA to stretch it to the next level ."},{"Title":"Beyond Basics Fingerstyle Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"This is my second Mark Hanson book and I recommend it.

In &quot;the colonial harem,&quot; Malek Alloula reverses the camera and literally enables the readers to observe the observer and his &quot;colonial gaze.&quot; As a final note, Barbara Harlow's introduction itself is worth reading alone for a better grasp of the complex issues that underlie the representation of the other. - Definitely worth buying!"},{"Title":"The Colonial Harem (Theory and History of Literature)","review":"This is an excellent book. i use it in my postcolonial classes in college as a way of introducing colonialist discourse and the way women are used in colonialist representations. if you want to understand why the East is suspicious of the West, especially when it comes to women and gender as a whole, this book is a good starting point."},{"Title":"The Colonial Harem (Theory and History of Literature)","review":"I know that this is an old book, and it was advertised as good, but it was really wasn't in \\"good\\" condition, the binding was intact, but the pages were written all over and there was minor damages in the page structure."},{"Title":"The Colonial Harem (Theory and History of Literature)","review":"From start to finish a diatribe against the evil French who pandered photographs proporting to be of Algerian women to the decadent west in an unsuccessful attempt to subjugate the Algerian people by doing so.The author was equally distainfull of what he aparently considered the non-human things pretending to be Algerian women who appeared in these old photographs.He used a few of the worst quality of these postcards to prove his points, which were driven home with questionable references to psychology.Of course these photographs were the pornography of the day but they can often be beautiful works of art in their own right.What the author does not anywhere mention in this venemous discourse is who the models actually were, if not Algerian women. In fact, that is exactly what they were, no matter how they dressed.The earlier ones were often of slaves. Most of the others were of young girls without the protection of family driven into prostitution. It is not the French who were responcible for this. It was the Algerians themselves. Though the author does not show it, there were often series of photographs taken of the same girls. It is obvious when viewing these series that many of these girls were having the times of their often short, tragic lives being photographed. Others show the dispair of social evil.The author shows none of this.This book isn't worth the paper its written on.

Forget the Mommy Wars, the stereotypes and the cultural dissonance which disempowers our vision. The Hot Mom's Handbook uplifts our maternal spirits, raises us above burned dinners and household chores to our higher selves, the people we've always been but have forgotten amidst the dirty laundry and mile-long list of commitments.The book is divided into eight chapters with reflective questions, commitments and pages for journal-like entries at the end of each. It is reminiscent of Sarah Ban Breathnach's \\"Gratitude\\" journals, but the \\"Hot Mom's Handbook\\" has a tighter focus. It's all about moms and how we can live more powerful lives.My favorite line was from Chapter Six, \\"Every Mom has an Inner Siren\\": \\"Think you don't have an \`inner siren'? Every woman has one. She may be buried behind those clothes you just sniffed and pulled from the hamper, but I promise, she's in there, and it's time to let her loose!\\"This book shares testimonials from astounding women whose insight into contemporary motherhood will leave you with a warm feeling. At times I laughed out loud. What a relief! I'm allowed time away from the kids - guilt-free. It sounds simple, and it is. But you wouldn't believe how much we mothers need to hear it to truly believe it. This book assures us moms that we are on the right path to reclaiming our rights as individuals. After all, moms are the most creative people around. We create life. Thankfully, we have Hot Moms to remind us we create ourselves, and our attitudes, too.Christine Louise Hohlbaum, American author of \\"Diary of a Mother\\" and \\"SAHM I Am: Tales of a Stay-at-Home Mom in Europe\\", lives with her family near Munich, Germany.

No kidding Ms. Denay, I should make time for my husband AND my kids? Gee, I never thought of that one. How profound. I would also hope every mom out there doesn't need to be told to \\"dance\\" with their kid once in while and I don't mean just to music.

A Hot Mom is about being the best YOU, about being a woman who radiates confidence from the inside out.\\"In a time of countless books on the madness of motherhood, this is an uplifting and refreshing change.

I could really live without being told how much weight I would gain, how many stretch marks I would have, how having a minivan is \\"so much easier,\\" and how short I'd chop my hair when I became MOM and completely gave up my identity as Melissa. I mean, being a mom is something I'd always wanted to do! I found the right man, I was married and stable, and I was excited to be a mommy, but did that mean I could no longer go out on a romantic dinner with my husband? Dance wildly in the living room when the mood struck? Wear a dress and heels to go shopping just because? How did giving birth completely change who *I* am, and was that a good thing?My husband brought this book home to me when he found it at a local thrift store, and I have been hugging and kissing him ever since. FINALLY, some words of enlightenment and encouragement from women who understand that you are still YOU, and being YOU is the most important gift you can gift to your children, not morphing into a human taxi and chef and bowing down to the every whim of a child. I have often felt that I really go against the grain of modern society in viewing children as CHILDREN, not equals. A mother should love, cherish, respect, and guide her children.. all while continuing to grow, mature, and respect herself as well. Yes, you are undeniably changed when you become a parent.. but your own contributions to your life *still matter*. It was so indescribably refreshing to read the words of other women who pursued goals, held public offices, ran at-home businesses or blogs, and still love and cherish their children. One of the comments that has stuck out the most to me is that being a confident woman is the most important gift you can givce to your children. Amen, sister!As someone mentioned in a previous review, the book IS a little \\"fluffy\\".. There isn't much real direction or instruction and more thoughts and quotes from \\"famous\\" moms.

Dreadful reading, not scientific in any way. Maybe somewhat appropriate for a health professional who deals with people who suffer from agoraphobia? This was required reading for a linguistic anthropology class(yes this a discipline), which essentially encompasses anything and everything. This book is no exception and is all over the place. It starts out with a case study of someone with the illness and then starts analyzing the language the patient uses to describe her condition. After a while it starts to sound like the author is trying to blame the victim or something, as if the patient was making herself sick by using certain language. In any case, The author is completely missing the point, and if I was seriously interested in learning more about agoraphobia, I would choose a more scientific, psychologically oriented book. I understand where the author was trying to go with this, and of course it is important what kind of language we use, but it really ended up in blaming the patient, rather than understanding the patient. We do not question a patient who has diabetes, no matter what kind of language a diabetic patient uses to describe his condition. Physical illnesses are accepted without question, whereas people with mental illness are still questioned, or told to suck it up, or in this case to simply change their language."},{"Title":"Equine Reproductive Physiology, Breeding and Stud Management","review":"The book has good visual aids and is well written.

Hinduism2. Zoroastrianism3. Jainism4. Buddhism5. Christianity6. Islam7. SikhismOriginally entitled Four Great Religions in 1897, three were added in 1901 - all from lectures delivered in India. Her bibliography cites over seventy sources from which she generously offers quotations and context, from the Al Qurn to the Zendavesta.The historical coverage is valuable, but alone is not the purpose of her book. Rather, she provides unmistakable linkage among the great religions, their laws, and purpose. Specifically she seeks to support religious study and comparisons of:* The Founder - whose life and character are impressed on the religion* The exoteric religion - thought to appeal to the masses of the people* The philosophy - thought to appeal to the learned and the cultured* The mysticism - defined as expressing the universal yearning of the human Spirit for union with its sourceEnjoy this book because it suggests a celebration of religion seen as a process that supports the advancement of all humanity, given its current condition, constraints, and culture at the time it was founded."},{"Title":"Later Life: Realities of Ageing","review":"Author Harold Cox must surely be in violation of his contract with the publisher. This textbook has been through multiple editions, the most recent of which is copyright 2006. But there are key topics for which he has in recent years made apparently *no* attempt to provide updated empirical data for.Median household income, for instance, is a phenomenon that changes over time. (Inflation, etc.) Yet, the income data he reports are, in many cases, from the mid-1990s. That's just one example.The most egregious example of his completely dropping the ball is opinion data on age synchronization. As culture changes, people's attitudes about age synchronization (what age a person should be when they tackle critical life tasks such as marriage, child-bearing, first job, etc.) change. I could see using survey data from maybe as out of date as 10 years ago on this matter because, yes, culture changes slowly--but to use survey responses respondents provided in the 1950s and '60s is ***outrageous***.Back in the '60s, yes, people's perception of the \\"normal\\" age for someone to get married might have been 18 or 19. But wake up, Harold Cox. Times have changed since then. People in our times have a vision of people getting married not much earlier than their mid-20s. In a text that purports to be a sociology text, and therefore one that explores such key concepts as norms, Cox's inclusion of such out of date data about perceptions on norms is worse than not covering that phenomenon at all. By not updating that data, Cox has rendered this book almost unusable as a textbook and my students are profoundly displeased with him, to say the least.The only strong suit of this text is its treatments of major sociological theories on aging and the question of what is a theory and what role does theory play in the scientific method. Well handled, there.But otherwise, I give the book about a D."},{"Title":"Later Life: Realities of Ageing","review":"Thank you!! Book was everything seller said it was. Also speedy delivery.

After he is diagnosed with cancer and loses his right leg below the knee, Terry plays wheelchair basketball and takes up distance running, a real challenge with an artificial leg. The bulk of the book describes Terry's determination to run across Canada and his well-known attempt to do so in his famous Marathon of Hope. Readers learn about the challenges he faced, the support re received from both celebrities and ordinary people, and how inspiring he was to others. The book ends with Terry's death before reaching his goal.Like other books in the ValueTales series, this book uses a real-life person to exemplify an important value. It is suitable for reading by children in the later elementary school grades. A \\"Historical Facts\\" section at the book's end summarizes Terry's life in a single-page bio form suitable for adults.Closing quote: \\"If you accept the challenge to give your best not matter what the odds against you, then you too can make a difference--just like our good friend, Terry Fox.\\" (p. 62)"},{"Title":"The Value of Facing a Challenge : The Story of Terry Fox (ValueTales Ser.)","review":"I was 10 when Terry Fox ran his Marathon of Hope. I enjoy reading this book to my kids, and they can relate to this story even though they live far away from Canada and long after Terry Fox died. The story presents Terry's illness in a non-threatening but honest way. The story rightly focuses on his life, and his accomplishments and not on his death. The message about facing a challenge is relayed throughout the book from incidents from Terry's childhood right through to his last hospital stay. Incidentally, the book is good for teaching Canadian geography."},{"Title":"Seaports of the South: A Journey","review":"I love this book. It looks at ports in each of our southern states. Each chapter looks at one of our ports through text and lovely photographs. The Port of New Orleans for examples takes us into the cloud of the rich aroma coffee, as it is unloaded at the port. The port is explored through several other angles also, from tugs, to excursion vessels, Coast Guard officials and the like. We tag along with the author and the photographer on a journey that few of us could ever make. Reading this beautiful book makes us wish we could have been part of the writing team. And then they have to also talk about the places that they ate. My mouth even watered, an unforseen side effect."},{"Title":"When the Machine Stopped","review":"After years of working with his father, who worked for Burgmaster for 29 years, Max Holland wrote an thouroughly researched book on the American industrial enterprise.

The first part of the book includes a basic introduction into Microsoft Office, to get the reader familiar with basic Microsoft procedures, (i.e., the menu bar, the Start button, starting Office applications, etc.).The second part gets into the actual Access 97 program itself. The reader simply downloads the software off of the Internet, then follows along in the book, using those files to complete the necessary steps for each learning event.The material, as a whole, gives the reader a comprehensive introduction to Access 97, although it does not go deep into the many applications of which this program is capable. However, if the reader wants a good jumping-off point into Access (which is, in this reviewer's opinion, one of the more complicated Microsoft programs), this is the book to acquire."},{"Title":"Mastering & Using Microsoft Access 97","review":"Don't buy this unless you're a complete idiot, and are not sure how to navigate in Windows.

Much more than a devotional commentary, &quot;The Synopsis&quot; gives an overview of the Bible from the dispensational, premillenial prespective. A valuable addition to any theological library.

Lewis, John Knox,etc.), John Nelson Darby. All too often over-looked, his insight into the Holy Bible has influenced myriad Christian scholars, both past and present, as well as members of the church seeking direction and truth. This volume brings to life Darby's teachings, deatailing his thoughts from Genesis to The Revelation of Saint John the Divine. A pleasure and a must have! I cannot recommend this zealously enough."},{"Title":"Synopsis of the books of the Bible","review":"Synopsis of the Books of The Bible is an outstanding and perhaps unique commentary on the Bible by a protestant author John Nelson Darby (1800-1882) Others have come to the same conclusion: \\"They opened up the Scriptures in their comprehensiveness in a way that nothing else has ever touched\\" H. A. Ironside. \\"His \`synopsis' remains the one book par excellence for the Bible reader and student who desires to get a full, clear summary of the contents and scope of the Word of God\\" S.

This edition was originally published by Loizeaux Brothers in the 1940s but the Synopsis has been in print for over a century in five or six languages and numerous publishers still list it as currently in print on their catalgues. The special feature of the edition being offered for the student of scripture is that the commentary is carefully divided into chapter headings and subdivided into headed paragraphs for quick and easy reference. I believe that no library will be complete without a set of this thoroughly worthwhile work."},{"Title":"Synopsis of the books of the Bible","review":"John Nelson Darby (1800-1882) was truly a significant and all-too-overlooked figure in the history of biblical interpretation. And for those who truly want to understand both his place in that history, along with the philosophical foundation he provided for what came to be known as Dispensationalism, Darby's &quot;Synopsis of the Books of the Bible&quot; has true value. It probably also has value to those who want to keep their own interpretations of the Bible in line with Darby's. But since this work claims to be a concise commentary, and since I believe that the primary goal of such a commentary should be to give the clearest and most accurate exposition of Scripture possible, I cannot recommend Darby's &quot;Synopsis&quot; to the average reader. His interpretations are far too idiosyncratic and too narrowly focused on maintaining his peculiar scheme of interpretation to be of much use to most people who are simply trying to understand the Bible and apply it to their lives. While it's true that there are some points where Darby truly shines, these do not make up for the times that his train so completely jumps off the tracks that there's no getting it back on. On top of all this, there's one stubborn fact about all of Darby's writings that will not go away: he composed some of the clumsiest prose that's ever been committed to paper. Even without this issue, today's readers will find themselves having to adjust to his mid-19th century style, but even for the mid-19th century, Darby comes across as highly stilted to the point where he sometimes veers into unintelligibility. This is especially true in (of all things!) his own Bible translation (which is still printed by his devoted followers). Here in the &quot;Synopsis&quot; it's not as bad of a problem as it is in his translation, but it's still worth noting. As for the Dispensationalist school of interpretation he founded, it is now foundering as scores of people have abandoned it for its chief rival, Covenant theology (which was already at least a couple of centuries old by the time Darby came around), or have modified it so substantially that it bears little resemblance to Darby's formulations (as in the case of Progressive Dispensationalism). In short, the chief value of Darby's &quot;Synopsis&quot; is what it can contribute to the historical study of one particular school of biblical interpretation, rather than to the study of the Bible itself. And, if one is so inclined to pursue Darby's unique contribution, one would be better served by purchasing his complete works."},{"Title":"Sacred Feathers: The Reverend Peter Jones (Kahkewaquonaby) and the Mississauga Indians (Kahkewaquonaby & the Mississauga Indians)","review":"This is the story of the Reverend Peter Jones,(1802-1856) (Kahkewaquonaby), a Methodist missionary and a Chief of the Mississauga.Doanld B Smith, a History Professor at the University of Calgary, writes an important story of the conflict between the First Peoples and the Europeans in the first years of settlement of south-Central Ontario. We see this interesting man in the context of the British settlement in Canada at a time when the new nation to the south (the USA)were forcibly moving the Cherokees and other eastern tribes to west of the Mississippi. That this did not happen in Upper Canada is to an important extent due to the leadership of this one man who could interpret the Europeans and Native Peoples to each other."},{"Title":"I am a composer","review":"Honegger was a very well known Swiss musician who lived mainly in France (1892-1955). He wrote ambitious things, but also a lot of good movie music. You can find Pacific 231 on Youtube, a piece where he builds momentum while the tempo slows down. Enjoy also parts of my favorite opus \\"King David.\\"The book is made of interviews and comments of Honegger on music. I like it very much because it is very honest, very \\"protestant\\"and fresh. These qualities make of it a rare book. The reverse of the medal is that it shows a protestant misogyny as well.There is happily, a lot of thoughts about music itself. Honegger discusses for instance atonal music and the possibility to do new things without necessrily looking for new sounds.A very interesting read, but it is all very French, the context is French, the composers and writers quoted are French, so if you are not too familar with Europe in the first half of the 20th century, you might get very lost."},{"Title":"Monarchs (Gulliver Green Books (PB))","review":"This beautifully photographed book traces a monarch butterfly's journey from North Haven, Maine to Mexico.

I hate not finishing a book once I start it, especially one such as 'THEFT' that I was so looking forward to reading, so believe me I tried. I suffered through page after page of this book for over two weeks only to get a little more than halfway through. You heard right, it took me two weeks to just get to the halfway mark, that is because every time I read a page or two I found myself falling asleep, as this had to be one of the most boring books that I have ever read! 'THEFT' has a promising concept, a former world renowned painter finds himself, after being bankrupt on the verge of making a comeback only to get involved with a mysterious woman who threatens to bring down all that he has worked for. It sounds as though the book has a lot of suspense and intrigue. There is a promise of adventure as the clues unravel about the art theft & murder but at least for the first half of this story those things come in the smallest of doses. I couldn't even give a proper synopsis of the book because as far as I could tell, not much happened other than two brothers complaining an awful lot about each other. Every time you would see a hint of the story taking shape the focus of the story would change and it ended up being dragged out.Again, I give this book two stars instead of one because since I did not finish it, something, somewhere down the line could happen to make this a more interesting book. However, I personally couldn't suffer through another 100 pages before that happened."},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"This is both a clever novel, and a great read. Clever because of the way Carey uses language and alternates points of view to deliver a semi-reliable view of the action. A great read because the reader is in the position of trying to anticipate what the next development might be, and whether it is relevant.Which characters can you trust, and why? Does it actually matter? The Boone (Bones) brothers were so much 'the' story for me that the art theft and Marlene just seemed peripheral.Full of life, vivid imagery and never too serious: a clever read from a great author. Of course, I could read it again tomorrow and come to a completely different conclusion.Recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"A swirling canvas of art scams, art history, and Australian attitude is just backdrop. This book is really about two brothers, Slow Bones and Butcher Bones aka Hugh and Michael Boone. One is mentally impaired (he thinks in capital letters and likes to sit on metal folding chairs and watch the traffic go by.) The other is an artist. Each, by his nature, must be different from the rest of the world. Slow Bones can't save himself in social situations or manage city thoroughfares. And Butcher, though more adept, is just as likely to tick everyone off by his insatiable needs to gratify His Art.Theft deals with the balance between these two brothers as they ride the seesaw of great art thefts, beautiful women and the international art market. I found it charming and amusing. It was the first book I picked out for my book group ahead of time, showing up for the meeting with six copies tucked under my arm. I have to confess, though, that it wasn't so totally beloved by all. Ah, well."},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"Love or hate his novels, Peter Carey remains a writer like no other. Theft: A love story offers the reader a fascinating, nuanced, and often darkly humorous view of the relationships of three thoroughly damaged individuals, an Australian formerly successful artist, his \\"idiot savant\\" brother, and the beautiful and mysterious art expert who stumbles into their lives. Telling the tale from the two brothers' shifting perspective, Carey shows offers the reader an intimate view, while also providing an insightful commentary on the concepts of observation, blindness, attachment, and art.This being a Peter Carey novel, the author's characters hold strong opinions and the author's thorough research of his subject shines through the pages. Yet Carey also stands as a subtle author, interested in topics of relationship, loyalty, family, and time. What makes this work particularly interesting is that while Carey's topic involves the seemingly high stakes world of multi-million dollar art, he makes clear that the real stakes are for the character's hearts and in the end their souls.Those looking for a page turner may leave disappointed, but careful readers will surely relish Mr. Carey's singular style and wonderfully drawn characters, all complex and all deeply flawed. Whatever wrong they may commit, each in turn takes a hold of the reader's heart, making this a most satisfying read indeed."},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"The writing is viseral and eviscerating. The thoughts, feelings and the making of art shriek of reality. Believable, passionate, unusually strange characters. Believable, passionate unusual and rare story. While I cared about the art [...], the scams, the lies, the murder, I cared more about the characters, the love, the writing, and the never ending question about what makes art worth looking at.

And all of this plays in the art world and it is amazing the research that has gone in writing this book.One problem, I had with the book and that is the liberal use of Australian slangs. While it makes the book authentic and we are all global today, I had to google most of the time to get the meaning. As a fan of his books, I had no problem but this could be a problem for first-time readers of his books. Would it be asking for too much, if the writer included a glossary with the meaning for those words?"},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"Carey's humor is transcendent in this book. It's the story of Michael, an alcoholic nearing middle age painter who leaves the detritus of his failed marriage and some legal tussles in Australia and immigrates to New York city with his new (and ever scheming) love and his mentally challenged brother Hugh (though you find yourself continually wondering who has the largest handicap, Michael or Hugh). Most of the happenings are tragic but you find yourself laughing anyway especially reading Hugh's take on the scrapes Michael and his lover mange to get themselves into.

To his brother, on the other hand, artists are kings. But after all, what do artists are? It will be not this brilliant novel that will supply an answer - if there is such thing. But the writer provides an acid look on the little world of arts and the money related to it.It is a bittersweet look that caresses and, at the same time, laughs at a m&eacute;tier with complicated rules and thousands of dollars and euros. In this world, the protagonist, better known as Butcher (after his father's profession, that Michael repudiates), will have to lie and deceive - as most characters in Carey's novels do - to fulfill his desires and aims .He has just left prison for stealing paintings that belonged to his wife.His brother is such a complex character that he deserves a book for himself. He is as smart as furious, and his strange comments reminds the reader of Benji, the problematic brother from Faulkner's \\"The sound and the fury\\" - but with more sense of humor. And the art world he notices: as Hugh comments: \\"a doggie dog world\\".Using the specific jargon, that adds color to the narrative, Carey digs deep in the art underworld - doing the same A. S. Byatt did with \\"Possession\\" for the literary world. It is a thriller, but with wit and sagacity. The descriptions of the paintings, all fictitious, are so detailed that one doubts if they don't really exist.Living in New York for over two decades, Carey has a distinct view of his homeland, Australia. The writer and his protagonist have been born in the same year, 1943, and in the same place, Bacchus Marsh. With this novel, the author seems to return home - even if it is only in the fiction. In his first non-historical novel, Carey reminds us of Patrick White's work - the only writer Australian to receive a Nobel. Both are willing to show their reader the sordid and dirty side of the human soul.\\"The problem with art is the people who buy it\\". Art has been turned into business, appoints Carey. It has received more attention for the money it movements rather than the meaning it carries. On the other hand, \\"Theft\\" is a novel filled with meaning and art."},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"Having just finished Peter Carey's latest novel, Theft, I have mixed feelings.I liked the book, and simultaneously, found it... difficult.First off, in the \\"liking it\\" department, well... it is Peter Carey!You don't win the Booker Prize twice by writing poop even once! He is an incredibly good writer.I loved his Oscar & Lucinda, and My Life As A Fake.But this one, Theft. I did not love it, per se. I liked it.I needed help. Parts of it got away from me, like a lifejacket floating out of reach, and I often had to rely upon my Reading Partner to haul me into the boat, as it were.Theft is sub-titled \\"A Love Story\\" and it is!The story of Michael Boone, an ex-\\"really famous\\" painter, born 1943, in Bacchus Marsh, Australia. [? As was Carey himself, in both time and place. Let the reader interpret!]Newly divorced and down on his luck, Michael retreats to the unoccupied house of his patron, Jean-Paul, in an effort to here, perhaps re-invent himself.With him is his near-autistic brother Hugh. Michael takes care of Hugh in lieu of the only other option, which would be abandoning him to an institution.And so Michael sets out out to work on a series of new paintings.But into this peaceful backwoods setting, a beautiful woman appears one rainy night, her car stuck in the mud.28-year old Marlene Cook is not only vivacious, but also an art expert.Michael soon discovers she's married to the son of the now-deceased 20th-century artist, Jacques Leibovitz, and is involved in the authentication of Leibovitz's works.Michael has been a fan of Leibovitz since his high school years.Needless to say, his interest in Marlene knows no bounds!Soon he will wish there were bounds to his interest, as she involves him in a web of thievery and chicanery that threatens all he has ever stood for, in the production of authentic, genuine ART!Not to mention, he loves her. And she, him, apparently.Scamming, double-crossing, faking, severe cheatitry.In many ways, this novel is rip-roaring good. Roller-coastery good!Funny, too.In style, Carey is as subversive and non-generic as ever. The narration alternates, chapter by chapter, between Michael and Hugh. Hence, we are given dual perspectives of simultaneous events, and this keeps the reader [if the reader is me] fully engaged and on the edge of their seat. Or the edge of the boat, as it were.But a few times I fell into the lake.I got a bit lost in the intricacies of exactly what is done in the art world as presented, regarding counterfeit painting and related forgery activities. I think that Carey is counting on a real savvy reader here.It's not the kind of book you read while driving a tractor along a straight furrow. Or while stirring a pot of soup with one hand and changing a diaper with the other.You're just not going to get it unless you are paying attention.Throughout the book this one sentence is, themewise, center-stage:How do you know how much to pay if you don't know what it's worth?Hmmm.... a good question. As for me, I like to pay nothing!My own walls are filled with laminated posters I stole from Starbucks, so what do I really know about the higher realms of art?Because I needed a friend with this book, I suggest it as a Reading Group selection. In the multitude of voices, this book has gemstone potential."},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"Two-time Booker Prize winner Peter Carey has a command of the language that is beautiful in its simplicity. Just as three primary colors can make up the universe's sumptuous palette, so too does Carey's uncluttered prose create a world so detailed and rich that you might re-read some passages just to wonder how the man did it. The words are there, naked and innocent, but Carey's talent is locked somewhere behind them.In \\"Theft,\\" Carey tells the story of two brothers. Michael Boone is an artist who has just been released from jail, where he was held for trying to steal his own art from his ex-wife. Hugh Boone is mentally-disabled, a looming child of a man who enjoys a good chair, a good chicken sandwich, and a children's book called \\"The Magic Pudding.\\" Michael, fresh from his incarceration, has discovered that he is no longer \\"in,\\" his fame has fled, and he is now reduced to playing caretaker for his not-so-simple sibling.\\"Theft\\" claims to be a love story, and it is on several levels, but it's hard to say which level actually works. Certainly Michael is a man in love with himself as much as with his art (and at a loss to distinguish between the two). And there's a good chance he loves his brother, although there's not much evidence of that, other than his dogged (often resentful) dedication to the lumbering man-boy. Perhaps he loves Marlene.Marlene is an authenticator of paintings, specifically those by the late Jacques Liebovitz, one of Michael's profoundest influences. She strides into Michael's life, wet, harried and wearing three-inch Manolo Blahnik heels, and she trails with her not just rainwater and mud, but also a mystery involving a missing painting, a murder, and the possibly fradulent work of Jacques Liebovitz. She's a beautiful woman, a complex and fragile work of art herself, so it's no wonder why Michael falls moronically in love with her.Less clear is why she would fall for Michael. Maybe that's the point. In spite of the book's lucidity (and its even, measured tone) much remains muddied, like a priceless canvas that is in want of careful cleaning. The story is told from both brother's perspectives, although the narrative leaps don't happen with any kind of discernable regularity. Hugh's voice makes it easy to see why he is at odds with a world that pretends to be sane. Still, in spite of the gaps and flaws in the poor man's mind, he's eloquent enough to seem at least as coherent as Michael, if not quite as grounded. These are mostly worthless descriptions, anyway. Carey seems to be suggesting that artists, at heart, aren't that different from self-absorbed mental defectives.That sounds harsher than the novel is. Carey mingles technical details and slick cityscapes with loving precision, and although no character in the book could be called likeable per se, they all certainly seem real enough. It's this unswerving reality that makes it hardest to like the novel, which ends with a poignance that is deserved but somehow dull. Carey's artwork is beautiful, but it feels unfinished, unframed, and lacking the last, finishing touches. His technique is flawless, but the overall effect lacks clarity. Come for all the fantastic colors, but try not to stare too long at the big picture. It's not nearly as wonderful as the brushstrokes it's made of."},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"I loved this completely. May be the best Peter Carey has done, and that's saying something. I just finished My Life as a Fake, which I liked well enough, but really didn't measure up to his best work. This explores some of the same themes of artists and art, but far surpasses his previous books. Most highly recommended."},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"This is a smart, funny exploration of one of the lesser-known elements of the high-stakes art world -- the right of an artist's estate to declare a work \\"authentic\\" or not. The questions of authenticity that drive the plot are also reflected in the book's narrative structure, in which the story is told through two competing voices -- one a defeated, cynical, world-weary artist and the other his slow-witted, demanding and cantakerous brother Neither is a particularly reliable narrator, but the truth that emerges from their combined account is surprisingly sweet."},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"Michael Boone, a thirty-something painter who has gone out of fashion, is desperate to have his newest work noticed and to reestablish himself as a success. Michael is also the reluctant caregiver to his mildly autistic brother Hugh, who has a disabled yet perceptive view of his frustrated brother. In THEFT: A LOVE STORY, these Boone brothers narrate a story of thwarted talent, desperate ambition, fraternal responsibility, and loutish dependence, which becomes a mystery of theft and love when they meet Marlene Leibovitz, a beautiful art authenticator who may know something about a valuable stolen painting. The question that this fascinating novel poses is: How far will Michael Boone, who is angry at the art establishment, go to achieve artistic and emotional success? Where does he draw the line?Similar to TRUE HISTORY OF THE KELLY GANG, MY LIFE AS A FAKE, and other Peter Carey novels, THEFT: A LOVE STORY is totally engrossing with wonderful poetic writing that absolutely flies along. This book is highly recommended for everyone. But lovers and inhabitants of Manhattan will get an insider's thrill as the Boone brothers lurch through New York and its art scene. Bravo Peter!"},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"Take a little bit of the movie Dominick & Eugene, plus a pinch of Of Mice and Men, throw in a dash of Les Miserables add a magnificent high-stakes art theft, murder and an international crime investigation and you get just a tip of the magnificent iceberg called THEFT: A LOVE STORY. This is the story of individual identity that explores the relationship between Michael \\"Butcher\\" Boone, a has-been Australian artist just released from the slammer and his mentally impaired two hundred twenty pound brother, Hugh.The story unfolds in alternating chapters related by the two brothers, each offering their point of view - one wildly ranting and pretentious and the other achingly literal. Similar in theme to another book I read recently called THE ART FORGER it examines the very nature of art, its validity and valuation. With descriptive writing oozing from its pages, THEFT is filled with language that is grousing, earthy and crude as it amusingly addresses items as mundane as farting and bad breath, plus an assortment of other \\"stinky\\" items while in reality painting its story on a much large canvas. What appears at the outset to be just another run of the mill story of zealous but washed-up artist falling for a femme-fatale art appraiser/valuator is in reality a good hard look at the \\"fashion\\" of art, of what's in, what's out, and what's saleable in the art world, while addressing the question of why the theft of a piece of art can suddenly increase its value. Ultimately, it seems that the value of any piece of art is whatever the consumer is willing to pay for it and that self-invention is the order of the day.This is my first venture into Peter Carey country and I was pleasantly surprised. With THEFT, however, there are just too many layers for a reviewer to do it justice in a few meager paragraphs. I do believe that he is one of those authors that that offers no middle ground. One either loves his work or hates it. Guess you will just have to check it out for yourself to determine if you fall into the Love it or Hate it category."},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"This is the story of an aging, out-of-style artist, his idiot savant brother, and a femme fatale they both fall for. Part love story, part family saga, part crime thriller, this book has something for everyone. The alternating narrative voices (the artist and his brother) are pitch perfect, not gimmicky. Certain plot twists are a bit unbelievable, but the ending is truly masterful: an elegant and uncontrived resolution of several complicated plot lines and character traits. If you're interested in the art scene and not afraid of a few four-letter words, you'll love this one."},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"Theft is great fun. Told in alternating voices of \\"ex-really famous\\" painter Michael Boone (\\"Bucher Bones\\") and his mentally-challenged brother, Hugh (\\"Slow Bones\\"), the story takes on a lyrical quality skipping from Australia to Japan and to New York. A bitter divorce, a complex art scam, a love story of sorts, a brutal murder and the delicate relationship between two brothers combine for a humorous, magical roller coaster ride. Carey's command of language is, in a word, brilliant."},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"Perhaps an Australian reader might appreciate this novel more than I did. It is filled with references to life in Sydney and the Austrailian bush which I did not fully understand. I believe that some of the language includes Australian colloquialisms lost on me. Any book that sends me to the dictionary as often as this one did should be fabulous. It isn't. Theft is the story of an australian artist now fallen out of favor who is saddled with the care of his retarded brother, Hugh. After his acrimonious divorce he falls in love with the beautiful sociopathic young wife of the son of a now deceased famous artist. The story follows him as he follows her to Japan and NYC while he hopes that his future is secured by finding a rich patron. The art theft and forgery around which the story turns churns the plot forward albeit slowly. The book is obviously humorous as well as an example of black humor which I usually like. However, I found it tedious. It is technically well written, but I only finished it because I read it for book club. This author won the Booker prize. However, unlike most of the prize's winners, his language includes particularly foul words. Nevertheless, they are not gratuitious, and that is not the reason I didn't find it engrossing.The narrative switches from Butcher Bones in the first person to his brother, Hugh. However, the diction and vocabulary emited from the supposedly mentally disabled, Hugh, was unconvincing. The sentence structure and vocabulary were simpler but not sufficiently so. In fact had the author used such simple diction for the narration from Butcher I might have liked it better. However, other than walking around with a folding chair and his rigidity of routine, Carey does not portray Hugh realistically enough. I cannot say this was bad fiction, because it is not. Someone should inform this author that when writing is reduced to simple sentences and vocabulary, the story is enriched. I felt he was trying to impress. Still the plot might make a good movie.I recommend reading something else."},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"Peter Carey's novels have always traversed the line between truth and fiction, trading action for intent, and forcing the reader to re-examine what we understand as truth. He's done this fairly overtly in his last two novels, My Life as a Fake and True History of the Kelly Gang. Both titles call attention to the truth theme and by following a thread where fiction and truth overlap and twist in so many ways that fact is no longer the underlying key to truth, the novels shake up the reader in a pleasurable but unexpected way. Although the title isn't quite so overt in Theft, there is a similar theme on reality versus truth in Carey's latest book. Although the truth theme continues to be compelling, it never takes precedence to the original and natural integrity of the story, which is overwhelmingly entertaining, first and foremost. On pure plot and characterisation alone, Carey is a master. That Theft like all of Carey's books, is also linguistically beautiful and full of the kind of transcendency that makes literary fiction so much more than light entertainment, is icing on what is already an excellent cake.The story follows a heady period in the life of artist Butcher Bones, an Australian painter who has fallen out of favour after a nasty divorce and term of incarceration for trying to \\"retrieve\\" his best work \\"which had been declared \\"Marital Assets\\". Set in 1980, the novel opens on Bones' release as his lawyers and a wealthy collector \`exile' him to a country property in Bellingen with his challenging brother Hugh where he attempts to begin painting again. One wet evening he meets Marlene Leibovitz, daughter-in-law of one of the greatest painters of the 20th century, and Bones and Marlene begin a love affair which takes them deeper into the political machinations of the art world as they travel to Tokyo and New York in a complicate thread of sexy intrigue, real and fake art, murder and a certain amount of chaos. The story is well plotted, and as is always the case in Carey's novels, is fast paced enough to push the reading forward, while the writing and characterisation are so rich and powerful that it's an almost necessary effort to continue slowing the pace to savour and re-read the gorgeous prose.Right from the start of the book, Carey sets up the paradox between real and fake as he begins sipping a non-alcoholic beer with his patron Jean-Paul, which is \\"Like the real thing.\\" (6) The house is almost like the real thing too, although impossible to paint in until Bones destroys it, and his neighbour Dozy Boylan owns a real Leibowitz painting. Marlene, a would be American, whose real Manolo shoes Bones ends up washing mud off, is a classy art savant, whose delicate beauty and sophistication contrasts with Hugh's brutish childishness. Between The Magic Pudding and Benalla High School we learn that the truth isn't always as obvious as formal certification (or \\"droit moral\\").The narrative is told in alternating chapters of first person singular between Butcher and Hugh. Carey links the separate paragraphs with shared memories and a rough vernacular which bisects, but it is Hugh's chapters which are almost startling in their vivid intensity and the raw truth they emit.The difference between the two narratives is a gulf between perspectives and is often funny as the narratives describe the same situations in absolutely different ways. The relationship between brothers is almost as much of a love story as that between Butcher and Marlene. It isn't a perfect love affair by any means. The filial tension is almost unbearable at times as both Hugh and Butcher see themselves as subservient to the other and jealousy, love, need and resentment all collide.Butcher's own description of the power of colour and quality is immediately accessible to the reader, taking words beyond their usual medium.The ride is hysterical at times, and the reader will often grimace, or laugh outloud following Hugh's exploits with his metal chair, or the feverishly nave attempts of Butcher to try and control the events which take him over and still maintain a sense of bravado and artistic integrity. The line between self-creation, deception, crime, and reality start to blur with a rapidity that can be dizzying. It's the best kind of dizzy. However crazy the story gets, and however tricky the relationship between true and false in the end, it is as clear as the title makes it that there is simply one truth that underpins the story - love.Like Carey's other masterpiece, Oscar and Lucinda the fantastic, easy to read plot almost masks the fact that the work is an ode to the non-discursive nature of love. There are many thefts in Theft including the theft of a child, of a life, of a painting, and of a heart, but the final theft is one where the ultimate thief is unclear, and there is only one truth. The painting is beside the point. This is a stunning novel and one which certainly lives up to Carey's claim as a modern master.Magdalena Ball is the author of Sleep Before Evening."},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"Carey is technically a good and clever writer. The story is told from two view points Michael and his mentally handicapped brother Hugh.Carey does a very good job of conveying how someone who has mental deficiencies thinks and tells the story. The inherant problem with this is I don't want to read a book written by someone who has the mental capacity of a child.When we are reading from Michael's perspective the book becomes readable & decent. But as approximately half the book is written by his half-wit brother Hugh it makes the book tedious. A chapter or two written from Hugh's perspective would have highlighted Carey's clever tools without detracting too much from the story and this would have been a better option.Ultimately, though a good-writer needs to tell a good yarn and this is more important than all the literary tricks the author has. Unfortunately, this is where Carey falls flat on his face as this story is slow and not nearly as compelling as it should be.Peter Carey has won numerous awards including the Booker Prize (twice) so he has established his reputation among the literary elite. It would be interesting if he could write a book which the general book buying public would embrace just as enthusiastically.This is the first Carey book I've read. On the strength of this book I have my doubts whether he could write an international bestseller however, I will give Oscar & Lucinda a go before giving up on him."},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"Another terrific book from Mr. Carey told from two perspectives, the main character and his not so bright brother. He particularly writes beautifully about how an artist feels about his work, the materials, the process and you can see the paintings in your mind. How deeply he feels about phallo green. Another rich achievement. Plus there's that business about who stole the painting."},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"Excellent, moving, exciting, makes books in general seem like better works of art with characters so alive you wonder where they are now. I'm lucky to have been stolen but willingly went. 4 1/2 stars"},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"It's no denying Peter Carey is a brilliant writer. His flair for pin-pointing the nuances of the good old Aussie vernacular is spot-on, and his characters are always society's off-cuts, but ultimately likeable souls. Theft: A Love Story was a highly enjoyable and recommended read. But unlike his brilliant True History of the Kelly Gang, it seems that Carey wasn't sure how to end this wonderful tale, and lets it fizzle out rather than leave you with the same enthusiasm you had for it in the beginning."},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"Carey is a terrific writer. Theft, however, is a stupendously dull novel, chock-full of vapid characters and insipid storylines. To the extent that the emptiness of this novel was intended to mirror or riff on the emptiness of the contemporary 'art world', I guess it succeeds, but who's interested in an endless story about boors behaving boorishly? To the extent that this novel is intended as a black comic sendup of the same -- as some reviewers have suggested -- it fails. It is a slog from start to finish."},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"I have read \\"Theft,\\" have read most of Peter Carey's previous novels, and have read the generally favorable reviews, and now I ask, \\"what's all the fuss about?\\" \\"Theft\\" is the least enjoyable Carey book I've read. I do enjoy reading about the world of art and art collectors, but this book is way too technical for all but those who are collectors themselves or work in the field. I think the hero is an unappealing and hyperactive character with whom I could not empathize in the least. And what in the world did his women find attractive about him? The only real person in the story is Hugh, for whom I award the book three stars."},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"Talented Australian painter Butcher Boone is known for his work as much as for his hedonistic overindulgences especially alcohol and fighting. Unable to put up with his destructive behavior, his wife divorced him and left him broke, homeless, and without visiting rights to see their son. The darling of Sydney high society Butcher has been relegated to work as a caretaker at the New South Wales estate of a major collector of his paintings and raising his damaged sibling Hugh since their parents died.During a particularly stormy night, classy Marlene Leibovitz arrives at Butcher's abode totally lost. She informs him that she is the daughter in law to Jacques Leibovitz, a twentieth-century master. Unable to toss her out in the torrential storm, Butcher and Hugh soon become part of an international grand art crime scheme involving forgeries and murder because the Australian artist can not resist the sexual siren of the woman who came soaked to his door.THEFT is a fantastic character driven suspense thriller that grips the audience from the moment Marlene arrives at the New South Wales house as she is obviously high society Sydney not backwater isolation. Unable to resist the lure of this femme fatale, Butcher begins a further spiral downward. Mindful of the 1930s McMurray-Streisand films like Double Indemnity, fans will appreciate this \\"love story\\" masterpiece.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"I like to read fiction which is written in the first person (e.g. Richard Ford), because I think it's a huge challenge to get the story told and stay within the confines of one persons views/limitations. Part of the challenge of course is to avoid making the narrative completely dull. Therefore I picked up Peter Carey's new book and liked the first few pages. This is the first time I read any of Carey's work.This is not a dull book, however I do think it's a relatively straightforward story of conspiracy to defraud in the art market, made more complex than necessary by telling the story from not one, but two points of view. One of the points of view belongs to a faded artist, Butcher Bones and the other of his \`damaged, 220-pound, brother' Hugh. Through the book, the two points of view alternate. This leads to an amount of repetition, though I should say that each does manage to shed light on the foibles of the other. Nonetheless I think this is a clunky device which slows the narrative.By the end of the novel I found Hugh the more credible, and at times, the more insightful of the two. Indeed overall I found Butcher Bones to be a shallow, rather tenuous character, not entirely credible and definitely not delineated with the depth or clarity you might expect from a talent like Carey.In summary I found this book slow moving, unnecessarily complex."},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"I have read many books - some I couldn't put down and some that weren't so interesting; however, this has to rank within the top 10 of the most boring books I have ever read.

The characters were not interesting, with the exception of Hugh. Actually, he was the only one with any redeeming qualities. There was no plot to speak of.

The satirical insights are very apt and often laugh-out-loud hilarious, and Carey has a wonderful way of displaying his characters' pretensions and foibles without belittling them.

Weird characters and a brilliant command of the language have always been a part of his style,Some of his stuff almost crossed the line (My Life as a Fake) to the inintelligible but Theft makes it all the way. I found the characters somewhat boring, and the language, idioms, references to times and places impossible to understand in many cases. Perhaps if you are a Sydneysider or live somwhere else in that great and beautiful country the book will make some sense.

Michael (Butcher) Boone, a once successful Australian painter, is recently divorced and down and out when he meets the magical and beautiful Marlene Lieboviz, who is married to the son of he famous painter Jacques Liebovitz. What follows is a page-turner that is at once the account of a passionate obsession-- Michael and Marlene's-- familial loyalty-- Michael and his \\"damaged\\" brother Hugh's-- as well as a tale of intrigue that spans Australia, Japan, the United States and Germany.Mr. Carey tells his story from the alternating viewpoints of Butcher and his brother Hugh in language that is dense, accurate and often beautiful beyond description. Anyone who has ever ridden in a New York cab will recognize this truth: \\"The taxis in New York are a total nightmare. I don't know how anybody tolerates them, and I am not complaining about the eviscerated seats, the s----- shock absorbers, the suicidal lefthand turns, but rather the common faith of all those Malaysian Sikhs, Bengali Hindus, Harlem Muslims, Lebanese Christians, Coney Island Russians, Brooklyn Jews, Buddhists, Zarathustrians-- who knows what?--all of them with rock-solid conviction that if you honk your bloody horn the sea will part before you.\\" (p. 194.)Australian petty law enforcement types are described as \\"midgets of officialdom\\" who swarm \\"like a white-ant hatch.\\" Finally Mr. Carey through the voice of Michael, piles paragraph upon paragraph, much as the artist applies layers of paint on his canvases, of beautiful descriptions of Marlene, often in terms of color as you would expect from a painter: \\"Her eyes. They were what is called baby blue, that is the precise colour of a baby's eyes before the melanin arrives and here was a pleasure even greater than her taut young skin, a clear view of her naked soul-- a deep kind of transparency without a single speck or flaw or smut.\\"Mr. Carey is one of a handful of writers whose next novel I eagerly await. To read him is to experience the sheer joy of language. After the horrific events of 9/11, Mr. Carey, who now lives in New York City, wrote an eloquent essay about both that city and the U. S. Can't we just claim him as one of our own?"},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"Two-time Booker Prize winner Peter Carey writes his most dazzling novel yet, a send-up of the art world, filled with satire about dealers, auction houses, compulsive collectors, forgers, conservators and technicians, art researchers, catalogue writers, and even the artists themselves. At the same time, he also creates two splendid characters through whose limited vision this world is viewed--Michael \\"Butcher\\" Boone, a formerly successful Australian avant-garde artist, now experiencing hard times, and his \\"slow\\" brother Hugh, a 220-pound giant with little control over his emotions and a penchant for breaking the little fingers of annoying people.Butcher, recently released from prison after trying to steal back his own paintings, which were declared \\"marital assets\\" during a nasty divorce, is now living in northern New South Wales, as caretaker for the property of his biggest collector. He is also the full-time caretaker of his brother, \\"Hugh the Poet and Hugh the Murderer, Hugh the Idiot Savant.\\"When Butcher rescues Marlene Leibovitz from her partially submerged car during a flood, the \\"chance\\" meeting has long-range consequences. Marlene is the wife of Olivier Leibovitz, son of Jacques Leibovitz, a world-class artist whose paintings are nearly priceless. She has the power to authenticate Leibovitz paintings (the \\"droit moral\\") and effectively controls the Liebovitz market as undocumented paintings surface. She has arrived to document the \\"Leibovitz\\" belonging to Butcher's next door neighbor, a painting which promptly disappears.The involvement of Butcher in a complex scheme to defraud is told in alternating chapters by Butcher and Hugh, whose limited \\"take\\" on the characters and action leads to hilarious commentary, which is often more astute and realistic than that of his brother. Butcher, devoted to his artwork, and eventually to Marlene, is a brawling innocent, totally over his head in the international art circles in which he moves in Tokyo and New York, following a sellout show of his work arranged by Marlene. Butcher's narrative reveals his obvious ignorance of the details of the Leibovitz art fraud, increasing the irony and humor and developing suspense about Marlene's intentions.When the increased financial stakes lead to murder, the complexity of the art fraud is revealed to the reader--and to Butcher. The final chapter, almost an Afterword, gives new meaning to the word \\"irony.\\" Theft is brilliantly constructed, and in Butcher and Hugh, Carey creates two characters the reader cares about. The art world and its rarified atmosphere are subjected to Carey's rapier wit, and the humor and satire are non-stop. Well known for his word play and sense of the absurd, Carey has outdone himself with this novel, a continuation of the themes he began in My Life as a Fake--and a new comic masterpiece. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"The story is told in alternating chapters by two brothers - renown artist Michael Boone (aka 'Butcher Bones') and his idiot-savante brother, Hugh ('Slow Bones').Recently released from prison where he was sent for trying to steal his own paintings from his ex-wife (and here is where the alimony whore comes in) he is installed in a country house by his 'sponsor' and begins to make some of the best art of his life. Across huge canvasses he splashes fire and brimstone texts remembered from his violent and abusive childhood, the full scale of which only gradually becomes apparent.And then one stormy night there walks into his life (in her Manolo Blahniks - important detail) a beautiful young woman who claims to have lost her way. Marlene is the wife of Oliver Leibovitz, son of one of the greatest artists of the century. She's also an accomplised art thief and con-woman. Both brothers fall in love with her ... which fits into her plans just nicely. And thus begins a rollicking tale of art theft and deception which moves from Australia to New York via Tokyo.Love-story, thriller, comedy ... the novel is all of these. But the greatest strength of the novel is the depiction of the complicated love-hate relationship between the brothers. The interplay of voices is excellent, and the way the two accounts give sometimes contradictory views of events, the \\"truth\\" of things falling somewhere between them. Hugh may not be the full shilling, but he is certainly astute and in many ways sees the world more clearly than his brother. I love the way his talk is peppered with phrases picked up from everyone else and is full of malapropisms.The research for the book seems authoratitive - I knew little beforehand about how the art world works, or how artists feel about their work becoming an item of commerce, or how painting might be forged ... and certainly now I feel interested to learn more.I love the energy and drive of the writing. One reviewer described the prose as \\"muscular\\" and I like that. But the language has a rugged poetry too, particularly during when describing the artist working. We can see the finished canvases and know why they are so brilliant, through the words.Theft reminds me of a couple of other novels I've enjoyed: Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men (the episode of the dead puppy, Hugh's capacity for sudden violence and the murder at the end - I'm certain this is a reference Carey means us to pick up!), and Headlong by Michael Frayn (also about shady dealings in the art world and very funny). And then of course Carey's there are echoes earlier novels, particularly My Life as a Fake which also tackled the theme of forgery, and True History of the Kelly Gang in the way that Carey recreates the voice of Ned Kelly so brilliantly. And there's Carey's siding all the way with the rascal, the fraudster, the thief, and making us love him too."},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"Peter Carey is a truly original writer with a wonderful capacity to bring a new and unique perspective to his story telling (Ned Kelly, Oscar and Lucinda etc). He seems to use his subject matter to explore his Australian background and the place of the country in the world, but in a manner that should not alienate readers from other parts of the world. It has been noted that Theft includes a thinly veiled reference to his marital woes. It was refreshing to hear the idiomatic speech of the characters.I personally preferred The Kelly Gang, but this is an excellent book that is well researched and written. My only quibble is that they are more likely to play rugby (First XIII (League) or XV (Union)) than Australian Rules Football (First XVIII) in Bellingen."},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"Peter Carey is a writer I respect a lot. I think he has class and a real talent to put together great stories. Because he is so high in the ranks for me, I may be harsher with this review than with others - because \\"Theft\\" is a very good novel, showing true mastery of words, but it is not flawless.The storyline itself is very simple; banal even, but although predictable, it is engrossing, in a sense: what kept me interested was not the anticipation of an unexpected turn of events, but rather curiosity, how the author would detangle the plot towards the end. The whole point of the plot is revealed in the title, and the details at the very beginning, so there is no waiting for the climax. Therefore, no sleepless nights for this one... The prose is very dense and not easy, characteristic for Carey, but I recommend patience because, all in all, this novel is worth reading.An intriguing woman, Marlene Leibovitz, appears once at the doorstep of the mansion, where an impoverished, forgotten painter, Michael Boone, is allowed to live with his not the smartest brother Hugh (who not without reason earned himself the nickname \\"Slow Bones\\") in exchange for being a caretaker. Both brothers fall in love with Marlene as she involves them in her giant theft scheme. Marlene needs Michael, because the object of the grand theft is a painting by her late father-in-law, an enormously famous painter... The action moves in a brisk pace from Australia through Japan to New York City (the latter being the only place, where Hugh does not get lost because of the grid and he loves it).Reading \\"Theft\\" I could not avoid comparisons with \\"Oscar and Lucinda\\", the first of Carey's novels I read, which is amazing, in my opinion. The two fundamental differences are: the style of narration - here two alternating, first-person narrators (both brothers) present their stories from the inside of the plot; in \\"Oscar and Lucinda\\" there is an omniscient, third person narrator; and the anticlimactic plot - both the love story and the theft story have easy to imagine outcomes; \\"Oscar and Lucinda\\" was phenomenally surprising (and the ending was worth the wait). There are also similarities: very original main characters (although Oscar and Lucinda are the unbeatable pair, Michael and Hugh are very good too, painfully real and at the same time as far from typical as only possible, living their own lives with strong personal philosophies), and the obsessive passion for - there it was gambling, here art. I feel that Carey likes the obsession motif, always very promising, and he gives it an interesting angle. The multi-level schemes, which also appear in both novels, cheating and cheating the cheaters, are fun too.I found the ending (despite not expecting much of it) a bit of a disappointment, I felt that the idea somehow got diluted. I hated Marlene, her character was extremely irritating and obnoxious (maybe this was intended; or maybe male readers would find her as charming as Michael Boone did). I loved the narration, I like when the novel is shown from different points of view complement each other.\\"Theft\\" gets four stars from me, because I know that Carey can do better and I expect him to. But it is a good, original novel."},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"In robust, antic prose which embodies the characters of his two narrators, Australian author Carey (winner of the Booker Prize for \\"Oscar and Lucinda\\" and \\"True History of the Kelly Gang\\") recounts a tale of two brothers, a girl and a valuable painting.The brothers are Michael \\"Butcher\\" Boone (nicknamed for his father's family business), a once famous and fashionable painter now down on his luck, and his big, brain-damaged brother Hugh, a man subject to passions even less comprehensible than Butcher's. Since the death of their parents, Butcher is Hugh's caretaker.\\"Sometimes he was so bloody smart, so coherent, at other times a wailing gibbering fool. Sometimes he adored me, loudly, passionately, like a whiskery bad-breathed child. But the next day or the next minute I would be the Leader of the Opposition and he would lay in wait amongst the wild lantana, pounce, wrestle me violently into the mud, or the river, or across the engorged, wet-season zucchini.\\"Butcher and Hugh are in exile at a country estate lent by the painter's biggest collector. Butcher has just been released from prison after a bad divorce (he tried to rescue his paintings from the state of \\"marital assets\\") and reversal of fortune. This is his chance to regain his strength and paint, unencumbered by the distractions of the world - other than Hugh. And paint he does in manic scenes reminiscent of Irish writer Joyce Cary's Gulley Jimson at work on his masterpiece at another rich man's unwitting expense.But the world's distractions come to him in the person of Marlene, a slender young woman stranded in her Manolo Blahniks by a torrential storm. She quickly charms Hugh: \\"And there she was - a type - one of those rare, often unlucky people who \`get on with Hugh.'\\" Butcher is equally charmed, or at least intrigued, especially when it turns out Marlene is the daughter-in-law of Jacques Leibovitz, the painter who inspired Butcher's own career. Turns out Butcher's neighbor owns a particularly valuable Leibovitz and Marlene has come to authenticate it. Or something.Three weeks later the \\"art police\\" show up at Butcher's studio, accusing him of having stolen the famous painting from his neighbor. Outraged when the police confiscate his new work to x-ray it in their search for the missing painting, he abandons his new studio and country retreat, returning to civilization to pursue his paintings, his career and eventually Marlene, with reckless abandon.The novel accelerates from Australia to Japan to New York as Carey breathes new life into the old saw \\"blind ambition.\\" Butcher tricks Hugh into a home so he can have a show in Japan and ride his wave of success on to New York. But he can't quite abandon his brother and Hugh finds himself in New York where he impulsively rescues himself from Butcher's increasingly chaotic life, taking up with Marlene's now former husband, Olivier, the gentle son of Jacques Leibovitz.Hugh, however, has his own brand of guileless shrewdness. Olivier is tormented by love for the treacherous Marlene, who uses him shamelessly.\\"When he began to cry at breakfast I knew I had chosen the losing side, forgive me, bless me, I wish I was a nicer man. I tried to return to Butcher but he would not answer the bell.\\"The reader's sympathies will lie more with Hugh than his tormented, mostly well-meaning, but fairly venal brother. Hugh is the foil, the innocent voice of reason who often gets things wrong. He's also extremely difficult and one can hardly blame his brother for wriggling out from under from time to time.Hilarity and darkness coexist on every volatile page as Carey beautifully delineates their complex story of brotherly love while producing a wild caper and a slick send-up of the high-end art world. A terrific novel - one of his best.--Portsmouth Herald"},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, although in the beginning I found the voice of \\"Slow Bones\\" to be a bit hard to slog through. But once I became accustomed to the rhythm of his sections of the book, they became both lovely and illuminating. This is the story of a \\"once-famous\\" artist whose life is now pretty much in the toilet. It is narrated alternatively by Butcher Bones, the artist, and his \\"challenged\\" brother, Slow Bones. The book is called a \\"love story\\", and indeed there is a reasonably standard love affair - I don't want to give away the non-standard aspects as they are delightful surprises in the book. But there is also a very tender second love story: that of Buther and Slow (Michael and Hugh). It is Michael's love for his brother that is the basis for so much of what occurs or doesn't occur in the story, as the case may be. The characters are superbly well drawn, and the writing is both hilarious and luminous - sometimes in the same passage. And for anyone who has ever lived in or vistied NYC - Carey's description of taxi drivers will have you LOL."},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"The more I read of Peter Carey, the better I like him. I found \\"Oscar and Lucinda\\" tough sledding. \\"My life as a Fake\\" explored some interesting ideas, but wasn't altogether successful, in my opinion. In \\"Theft\\", Carey revisits some of the themes which clearly continue to interest him - Australian art and literature, and how they are perceived both within and outside Australia. \\"My Life as a Fake\\" dealt with literature and made obvious reference to the infamous \\"Ern Malley\\" literary hoax of the 1940's. In \\"Theft\\", Carey considers the issue of fakery in the art world, in a story that shifts between Australia, Tokyo, and the art world of Manhattan in the 1980's.\\"My Life as a Fake\\" didn't soar as one might have wished - in part because Carey sometimes bogged down in the complexities of an overly laden plot, and in part because it was hard for the reader (at least this reader) to share his fascination with the repercussions of the Ern Malley episode on Australian literature. In \\"Theft\\", he is far more sure-footed, and though the plot is also quite convoluted, he develops the story in a compulsively readable fashion. The reader is swept along by the story, the brilliantly drawn, idiosyncratic characters, and by Carey's wonderful language right up to the jarring (and absolutely brilliant) conclusion.The book reminded me of the recent film bombon (I mean that as a compliment), the wonderful \\"Duplicity\\", with Julia Roberts and Clive Owen, which also kept the viewer guessing throughout, but which the director and actors pulled off with tremendous style and humor. It was hugely entertaining, without ever condescending to the viewer.\\"Theft\\" has that same lighthearted verve, and Carey's terrific writing and obvious love of language made it a joy to read. On the cover blurb of my copy, Ali Smith calls it \\"a funny, gorgeous steal of a book\\", and I agree completely.Five stars."},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"I have no doubt that there is a group of people out there who love \\"Theft\\". (In fact, the friend who loaned it to me raved about it.) These are probably the same people who can readily appreciate the genius and vision in Jackson Pollack's paintings. I am not one of these people, however, and I found \\"Theft\\" to be plodding, artless, mostly uninteresting (save perhaps the last 50 pages), and just plain pointless.My chief complaint with the book is that there's very little plot. What plot there is (beginning with Marlene's second appearance and the trips to Japan and New York) would have been better served in the form of a short story. The first 125 or so pages are almost unreadably tedious. I nearly gave up on multiple occasions, and would have had I not felt some obligation to the friend who loaned it to me.I also found the characters to be thoroughly unlikable. The only character I had a modicum of fondness for was Oliver (oddly!), and maybe a touch for Hugh as well by the end. But Carey seemed to go out of his way to make them a remarkably off-putting, crude, and offensive bunch. Why on earth would Carey expect me to care at all about these people? I have no idea.In summary, \\"Theft\\" is not worth the effort. It's not rewarding or interesting, and it doesn't make any notable or unique contribution to literature."},{"Title":"Theft: A Love Story","review":"Peter Carey, one of only two people to have won the Booker Prize twice can clearly write. \\"Theft,\\" even with some of its glaring faults demonstrates Carey's ability to create interesting voices and narratives that instantly entertain and provide unique perspectives on whatever world he chooses to have them inhabit. In this instance, we are given Michael \\"Butcher\\" Bones and his half-retarded brother Hugh. Butcher is a painter who was once the darling of the Australian art world, only to have himself fall from grace and be forced to live as a caretaker to the home of his most adoring patron. What ensues, as the title alludes to, is a story surorunding the theft of a masterpiece by his painting idol, which is initially pinned upon him. The story follows Butcher's attempt to reclaim his place amongst the artistic elite and deal with the theft.What makes the story so great is what also makes the story clunky. Carey alternates between Butcher's and Hugh's voices, one full of bitterness, the other a mixture of poor, but comprehensible sentence structure with striking moments of clarity. The way the two viewpoints are weaved together provided two viewpoints of different events and gives us a more whole view of the Bones family. The way Carey plays with language in Hugh's voice is wonderful, but at times the two voices start to sound similar. Whether he notices it or not, other than the capitalized words and phrases in Hugh's dialogue, there are often times when the voices are almost indistinguishable. One could argue this is a result of Butcher's emotional rollercoaster ride, especially in regards to his love interest Marlene, who is also thought to be involved with the theft, but I would argue that Carey simply did not notice as both characters are meant to have a certain biting nature to their personalities that interferes with their individuality.Carey's description of the art world and the counterfeitting market is great and is done almost seemlessly with the narrative. But something simply seems to be missing. I can't put my finger on it, but even while reading the text, I kept saying to myself the prose is beautiful, the story is tight, but something isn't right. When you read some of Carey's previous work (esp. The True History of the Kelly Gang), some of the recent McEwan, and even Zadie Smith, you can't help but keep saying \\"Wow\\" as you see how successful a writer can be even when trying to provide copious amounts of information necessary to understand the way a particular world functions, even without noticing it happen. MAybe that's the problem - Carey seems to digress at times when providing backstory to the point where you just want to skip through it.Overall, this is a solid read, but again, his previous work is much stronger."},{"Title":"Russian and Soviet Economic Performance and Structure (7th Edition)","review":"To start off, the editors of this book must have been asleep when it crossed their desks: the numerous erros in spelling and grammar interrupt a generally lucid writing style, with numerous, critical errors even in charts and graphs. The worst editorial aspect of the book is that in several places, entire passages are repeated, sometimes immediately, other times in a different chapter. Being in the field, I know economists are not the most skilled writers, but I place all the blame at the doorstep of the publishing house.That said, the book is fairly good at getting its point across. While the authors' stance on capitalism-vs-communism is clear, they generally present the facts in a clear manner, and they are evenhanded in their treatment of the opposing theories.A servicable, if cursory, introduction to Soviet and transitional Russian policy. That said, though, I strongly suggest that you buy it used if at all possible. It's really not worth the $$$$ Amazon wants for it."},{"Title":"Swamp Monsters Don't Chase Wild Turkeys (The Adventures of the Bailey School Kids)","review":"Once again the Baily School Kids Melody, Eddie, Howie, and Liza have found that they have a pretty wierd adult in Baily City, and it just turns out to be their ecology project coordinator.

The stylish new photographs are supplemented by historic drawings, some from the archives of the museum.

She actually had access to Mount Vernon during off hours so she could grasp a \\" feel\\" for General Washington's home and the surrounding grounds.The reader gains many insights into what George Washington was trying to shape Mount Vernon into during the many years that he had control over it. He differed from many of his time in that he was not a planter but rather a farmer. He was also one of the pioneers in sustainable farming. This was information that I did not know of until reading this book.I never grew weary of reading it as it not only contains much information on what was planted during General Washington's oversight of the farm, his crops, trees, vines, and other plants, but also the history.There is much to be learned about how the farmstead operated even when General Washington was away fighting a revolution or when he was President for eight years.The issue of slavery is also discussed in various parts of the book.In addition to the text there are fantastic photos and illustrations throughout.After reading the book I told my wife that she had to read it as she is an avid gardener.This is certainly a reference book that I will keep at my side in looking for various plants that comprise Mount Vernon.At the end of the book are categories of the various trees, fruit trees, flowers, etc. along with their Latin names.As someone who gardens in the same climate zone as Mount Vernon I can shape some of my own garden in the fashion of that grand First Presidents estate.Thanks Mac Griswold for writing such a fantastic book !"},{"Title":"The Brides Of Christmas: The Wise Virgin/ The Vagabond Knight/ The Unexpected Guest","review":"I bought this book for Jo Beverley's &quot;The Wise Virgin&quot;, and I was not disappointed. The characters were awesome, the story well-developed, and the resolution plausible.When I buy an anthology just because there's one author I know I want to read, I always hope that there will be good surprises in the other stories. I'm frequently disappointed, but not this time.None of the stories in this book were a total waste of time. Deborah Simmon's story was wonderfully well-written. And it's clear that it's part of a series of stories about a family of men, which is great news. New books to read, a new author to explore.The middle story I found less compelling. An enjoyable read, but not a keeper. Still, since the entire book was worth reading, I'll give it five stars to reflect the quality of the two stronger stories."},{"Title":"The Brides Of Christmas: The Wise Virgin/ The Vagabond Knight/ The Unexpected Guest","review":"I bought this book because I absolutely LOVE Jo Beverley and I was not disappointed with &quot;The Wise Virgin&quot;. The case of mistaken identity but finding true love amidst such problems of long time bitter feuds. I really shed a few tears on this one, as to the poignant way Ms. Beverley fleshed out her characters. She makes me laugh and she makes me cry. So sensual in such a short story, it was a pure Beverley delight.I was very much impressed with &quot;The Vagabond Knight&quot; by Margaret Moore, as well. Here you had two wounded souls both past the fresh dew of youth, older and hopefully wiser, but both carrying baggage. I cried for these two as well as laughed as some of the dialog, and shed tears of joy at the end. I felt she dealt well with giving both a history and tieing it up quite nicely in the end.The &quot;Unexpected Guest&quot;, by Deborah Simmons, again was a wonderful short story. Being able to flesh out so many characters this well in so short a story time is the mark of a very accomplished author. I was so impressed with this story, that I plan to look into other novels by this author to pick up more works on the de Burgh family.As a rule, I dont like anthology novels and much prefer the meatier stories, but this was excellent. A keeper to reread around the holidays!"},{"Title":"The Brides Of Christmas: The Wise Virgin/ The Vagabond Knight/ The Unexpected Guest","review":"out of the three stories in this book, i was impressed with only one. but, i shall review them all.THE WISE VIRGINit is wise to say that this is the only good story of the book, and it's a good thing that it's first or i wouldn't have read the whole book. when joan first realizes that she has been captured by the golden lion, she is annoyed to think that someone like him would go and get her cousin pregnant without being married. after a 'close encounter' with him, joan is stunned to find out that it's the golden lion's brother who was in love with her cousin. after a night of passion in a dark cave, joan is taken back to her uncle's land, where the golden lion is attacked. seeing him under seize, joan realizes that she loves him and goes against her own family to protect him. when she finially gets the golden lion to agree to a settlement with her uncle, she is as surprised as the towns people at her fate.this whole story had me on the edge of my seat. the author kept me interested the whole time, without any real pornographic details.THE VAGABOND KNIGHTthis story didn't hold that much of my attention. it's about a knight who comes to stay at a widow's manor. when the knight's horse gets sick, he is surprised that the widow is willing to help him. they both are extremely shock, and even in denial when a priest tell them that have feelings for each other.there's not much to say about this story, except: boring.THE UNEXPECTED GUESTwhile a little more interesting that the second story, it is still not an attention keeper. the earl turns down all offers of sex with a widow until she gives up and leave his manor, than he realizes his true feelings for her. the widow looks at the earl only as a one night stand, until the earl keeps refusing her. she is just as shocked as the earl to find her own feelings of love for him."},{"Title":"The Brides Of Christmas: The Wise Virgin/ The Vagabond Knight/ The Unexpected Guest","review":"I don't generally buy anthologies but I realized that Deborah Simmon's story related to the DeBurgh series, which I love! I thought Jo Beverley's story was a novel plot idea and I enjoyed both characters -- he, the famous knight who just wants someone to like him for who he is and treat him like a normal person and she, the strong, intelligent woman who doesn't fully perceive her own value. I also like Deborah Simmon's story precisely because it didn't have the typical young knight but an older, experienced (certainly mature in his own mind which is part of the plot). Can't wait to read Reynold's story and what is going to make Stephen grow up (and dry out)!"},{"Title":"The Brides Of Christmas: The Wise Virgin/ The Vagabond Knight/ The Unexpected Guest","review":"Jo Beverley's story leads this anthology and it was the only story I liked. Joan and her &quot;too perfect&quot; hero are wonderfully written and very likable. Joan has this problem, you see, she can't keep her opinions to herself as a proper maiden should and Edmund has had too many people toading up to him----how could they not connect? Ms. Beverley is a fine author and this small gem is another example of her fine skill. I only wish the other two stories in some way matched, but I can not say I liked either one. Ms Moore's story suffered from being too predictable in format, but unbelievable in content. I don't think the hero/heroine would ever have met or fallen in love. Ms Simmons has delighted me in the past, however not in this story. I did not like her hero. I felt he was too old for the heroine and the addition of his family of grown sons made it worse for my sensibilities. If you are not opposed to the plot points, yuo may enjoy this story more than I did. It is well written just not to my taste."},{"Title":"The Brides Of Christmas: The Wise Virgin/ The Vagabond Knight/ The Unexpected Guest","review":"This book of three different Christmas stories is the perfect item to cozy up to the fire with this Holiday season.

Too much subjective dialog to give the story the strength it needed.The second story, \\"The Vagabond Knight\\", written by Margaret Moore to my surprise was boring. I've read quite a few books by her and found them to be enjoyable, but in this one, the main character just didn't come through. It was obvious what she had intended, it just didn't work, leaving him appearing weak and confused.The third story, \\"The Uninvited Guest\\" written by Deborah Simmons, the best writer of the three, who for some reason wrote the worst story of three, was a real let down. I've read her prior 6 books on those wonderful deBurgh males and if anyone deserved a good story it was Campion! It paled in comparison to her other works. Another good book from her is \\"The Devil's Lady\\", a highly likeable heroine, an interesting story, and of course, a great Knight."},{"Title":"The Brides Of Christmas: The Wise Virgin/ The Vagabond Knight/ The Unexpected Guest","review":"Normally, short works are dull for me because they aren't long enough to develop the characters... but Beverley was awesome in her The Wise Virgin, which appears in this book!

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Brides Of Christmas: The Wise Virgin/ The Vagabond Knight/ The Unexpected Guest","review":"I would have to disagree with the other reviewer. This book was very good and I enjoyed all three stories. Anyone who enjoys Deborah Simmons' medieval De Burgh series will love her story because they will be well familiar with Campion, who makes a great hero. There is an age difference but frankly it is never clear how old either character is, so I don't know how someone can determine he is too old for her. In any event, history shows many marriages with age differences. The other story by Margaret Moore is also cute and light hearted. I like Jo Beverly's story very much as well."},{"Title":"The Brides Of Christmas: The Wise Virgin/ The Vagabond Knight/ The Unexpected Guest","review":"I got one of the books from an old stack when we were cleaning out my grandmothers house and have been searching for the rest of the books online. I have not been dissapointed! Everyone is as good as the last. These are books I read over and over again and still feel the anticipation and tension between the characters every time.The sad part is that without a current publisher Simmons will never be able to publish Reynold & Nicolas' stories.I hold out hope that someday the right person will want these published and will have the power to do something about it."},{"Title":"The Brides Of Christmas: The Wise Virgin/ The Vagabond Knight/ The Unexpected Guest","review":"This was my favorite of the three stories. Very believable, but then I have a soft heart for romance expecially when it is slightly May-December love story. It made sense that he was wary of another marriage with the possibility of losing a beloved again. The romance and ultimate marriage. of Fawke de Burgh, Earl of Campion, and Joy was great that it inspired me to seek out the sons' stories as well and I was not disappointed. Within four years, 5 of the de Burghs were wed and their stories were lively. Enjoyable. Now I'm waiting for Reynald's story. I hope to learn how many children the Earl and Joy eventually have together. Can't wait."},{"Title":"Tales of Mystery and Madness","review":"Okay, first I'd just like to say that I'm not sure if this is really for ages 9-12 like it says....Now that that's out of the way, let me just say that this is one of the best books I've ever read. The stories are good, Poe always is, but the pictures are what makes this a winner. Not only do they make the stories a lot more understandable (this can sometimes be a problem with Poe) they are purely amazing works of art. Gris Grimly is a genius ( go to madcreator.com) and needs to win a Nobel Prize or something. His drawings capture terror, romance, comedy and grotesqueness all equally well. Buy this book, it will change your life. I'm serious.The Black Cat: This story is a classic Poe, but the mood is captured so much better with Grimly's art. It will creep you out.The Masque of the Red Death: I don't know about you, but I never quite \\"got\\" this story till I read it here. This makes it terrifying and blackly amusing at the same time, and will get you thinking.Hop-Frog: This story is awesome! Even if you don't get this particular book, read Poe's original story. It's great.The Fall of the House of Usher: Rather odd. This was made into a movie I think.... The story is weird, but the pictures will have you riveted.And if all else fails, buy the book simply for the raven picture in the front page. Wow."},{"Title":"Nightmare House","review":"This was a good book but I was very annoyed that after every couple of chapters, about 6-10 pages would be missing. So I'm hoping I didn't miss too much."},{"Title":"Nightmare House","review":"A good story, but could be slow at times. Maybe since this is the first novel of the series, it required more back story than future installments might. I did enjoy it, but I am not in a rush to move on to the second novel."},{"Title":"Nightmare House","review":"Scary and gripping from the fist. A little predictable near the end! Overall a good read! I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Nightmare House","review":"Douglas Clegg has done it again!Nightmare House is perhaps Clegg's finest--and scariest--read. Though only two hundred odd pages long, the rapid-quick prose left me breathless and aching for more. This novel is the ultimate foundation for reading all the Harrow House books. So if you're a Harrow fan, read this book NOW.For fans of splatter horror, this book may not quench your appetite. Nonetheless, the atmospheric mood and in-depth characterization (and detailed history of the 1920's) breathes life into the words. I promise you that you'll start seeing shadows move and hear things go bump if you spend just ONE night reading Nightmare House.If only more books were like this one...Bravo! Mr. Clegg!"},{"Title":"Nightmare House","review":"The hero's wife in \\"Nightmare House\\" (2002) calls him a \`Caspar Milquetoast,' i.e. a \`childish, timid, unassertive man' before she runs away with her lover. She's right on target. Even when he's confronting the worst \`Nightmare House' has to offer, Ethan Gravesend goes limp and/or gets taken over by evil spirits. Because of his hero's lack of gumption, and also because of a bit too much foreshadowing, the author allowed me to guess the ending of \\"Nightmare House\\" although it came much sooner than I expected (this novel runs 218 pages, followed by a novelette called \\"Purity\\" at 122 pages.)\\"Nightmare House\\" reminds me very much of Jonathan Aycliffe'sA Garden Lost in Time (A & B Crime)(2004) in that both involve a child who requires exorcism, dies or is murdered, and returns from the dead. Both authors are wonderful writers, but Clegg sets his story in New England instead of Aycliffe's Olde England, and he clutters up a chilling ghost story with ancient Egyptian artifacts, Lovecraftian villagers, and a local constable right out of Gilbert and Sullivan.\\"Nightmare House\\" is still a good ghost story, just a bit too muddled to earn five stars.\\"Purity,\\" the novelette that pads out this edition of \\"Nightmare House\\" is a psychological thriller about two guys who love the same young woman. One of them is a sociopath who worships Dagon, the ancient Philistine fish-god. The three main characters are developed with loving care, but \\"Purity\\" has nothing to do with \\"Nightmare House\\" although both are set in New England."},{"Title":"Nightmare House","review":"So far, I'm on page 107 of a 218 page story and nothing even remotely scary has happened.

I'm having a hard time staying awake in order to turn the next page!"},{"Title":"Nightmare House","review":"This book began slowly, developed slowly, and ended blandly. Nothing was well explained or well developed. Some portions began to develop the story and characters, led the reader to think a good story was being grown, only to end with nothing developed or explained."},{"Title":"Nightmare House","review":"i read all the reviews even the poor ones but decided to read it myself and it was worth the time. its a different type of story but enjoyable still. it was a fast pased read and a note to remember credicts, its fiction..."},{"Title":"Nightmare House","review":"I listened to the audiobook as opposed to reading and was very disappointed. I enjoyed the story and agreed with many other reviewers regarding Clegg's storytelling chops. I am an avid audiobook listener and have been listening to books during my commute for well over 15 years. Admittedly, I have my favorite narrators and others that are simply tolerable. But Michael Taylor's rendition was so distracting I found myself having to repeat portions, which just added to the annoyance. I especially found the voice of the elder Ethan to be extremely grating, and the attempts at an Irish accent were horrible. I have read other critiques of those who praised the narration, but as for me I was relieved when the book was finally over! (But I guess that shows the strength of the story that I held out to the end!!) Anyway, I recommend reading the book rather than listening to it."},{"Title":"Nightmare House","review":"Will try some of his other books, but this one did not impress. In fact will not bother with the remainder of the Harrow series. No horror, nothing really even spooky. Don't understand why it got such high reviews.

It just ends! The story behind it was unreadable! Very stupid! I could not finnish it!Don't waste your time on this book!"},{"Title":"Nightmare House","review":"The novel Nightmare House succeeded for me (and I hope for you too) on many levels. I would like to share with you two of them.First, Setting: The reader is immediately and constantly aware of time and place. Ethan's travels to Harrow through the villages and along the road. The grand tour of Harrow, through its many levels, seen and unseen. The reminders that this was a more simple time - gas lights, unpaved roads, a constable that arrived on bike.Second, Realism: Now, that may sound funny when reviewing a horror novel, but I'll have to say that when I read this novel, I did not once say to myself, \\"No way - that makes no sense at all.\\" The story flowed well and made sense. I felt as though I could put myself in Ethan's place and experience it this in the \\"real\\" world and not be surprised. Life is full of mysteries and the answers to what happens in the infinite have been faith-based and if you believe in good, you must also believe in evil. The afterlife has never been defined, only interpreted. Ethan's experiences in the Nightmare House kept me glued to the story and my fingers turning the pages."},{"Title":"Nightmare House","review":"This is one of those novels that I just didn't want to put down and wished would never end. Douglas Clegg is truly a master of horror fiction. He knows how to strike the chords of terror within the human mind without the crutches of butchery and gore. His eloquent writing style captivates the senses in such a way you can almost feel, see, hear and taste his every word. Whether this makes any sense at all, I can best describe this novel as terrifyingly beautiful and that I was beautifully terrified."},{"Title":"Nightmare House","review":"The year is 1926, and Ethan Gravesend has just inherited Harrow House -- the Watch Point, New York, home of his grandfather Justin Gravesend (who tells the story of his own early years in The Necromancer). Called Nightmare House by the local newspapers because of the events that have taken place under its roof, it is also said that every stone, every piece of glass, of this English-style manor castle was chosen specifically by Justin with full knowledge of its history and possible black-magical effects.\\"Harrow, you belong to me,\\" Ethan proclaims upon his arrival. \\"But I was to learn,\\" the elder Ethan notes in the telling of this story from the present day, \\"that this house belonged to no man.\\" However, Ethan feels as if he has come home at last. He used to visit Harrow in his youth, but his parents kept him away except for those rare visits, though he would dream of it at night.Newly single, Ethan is prepared to settle in to his newly acquired wealth and status -- until the dead woman is discovered in the secret walled-off room. Accompanied by chief of police Pocket and local boy Alf, other frightening events are to come (during what the elder Ethan calls a \\"night of mystery\\") that will cause him to wonder what exactly his grandfather has let loose in Harrow. But these events will pale in comparison to the new information he discovers about his family.Author Douglas Clegg has said that Nightmare House is his version of the \\"quiet ghost story\\" -- in fact, each Harrow novel reflects a favored literary style of his. Clegg leaps around from first-person to third-person, past to present, with confidence, and he never misses a step. Reader Michael Taylor (from Books in Motion, the audio publisher who produced this edition) follows along gamely. Taylor's friendly baritone eases the listener into the strange happenings like a kindly uncle telling a spooky story before the fire. He also shows a surprising facility with voices that I would have thought out of his range. I especially enjoyed Taylor's characterization of Pocket; Clegg gives Pocket a lot of space to maneuver as a supporting character, even allowing him to tell his own side of the story, and Taylor gives him a dose of extra personality.My first Harrow novel was through 2005's The Abandoned, which I did not enjoy for various reasons, but one of those may have been my lack of knowledge regarding the house and its background. (Clegg says you can read the series in any order, but that one may be the exception.) Nightmare House filled me in wonderfully, and I may have to give the other another try. This first novel of Harrow House and its surrounding history and happenings was wholly satisfying, and it has made me look forward to reading the other entries in the series. In fact, as soon as I finished listening to it, I picked up The Necromancer and read it in two sittings. These have reaffirmed my confidence both in Clegg and in Harrow, and now I am eager to acquire a copies of the other Harrow stories. And if they are also released on audio of this quality, that will be even better."},{"Title":"Nightmare House","review":"Nightmare House takes you back to the days of horror before &quot;blood and gore&quot; were necessary to scare the pants off you. A very simple haunted house story that grips you from the first page and leaves you breathless at the end. Clegg takes the simple story and adds twists along the way to make it hard to put this book down. The best thing about Nightmare House though is that is it not done, the story of Harrow House is further explored in Mischief and The Infinite.It has been a long time since I have read horror like this. Clegg has returned to the true roots of horror and maybe he will never return."},{"Title":"Nightmare House","review":"I love horror fiction, especially haunted house horror fiction. Until recently, my favorite of these was Richard Matheson's Legend of Hell House. But with the publication of Nightmare House, Douglas Clegg's Harrow has replaced my previous fave. Nightmare House ties together pieces of his previous novels Mischief and The Infinite by describing some of the background of this fiendishly designed house. I loved his straightforward writing style so much, that once I had finished Nightmare House I purchased six more Douglas Clegg paperbacks to read over the summer. He has an imagination to rival Clive Barker at his most hellish. I'd still like to see another book on Harrow from the standpoint of the builder, the grandfather of Nightmare House's narrator. I want to really understand the design of the house, and also try to explore the evil/innocent dichotomy of the narrator's sister. I want to crawl around in Harrow and explore until all of my questions are answered. Nightmare House does answer a lot, though. I highly recommend this book, and basically anything by Douglas Clegg."},{"Title":"Nightmare House","review":"Douglas Clegg never ceases to amaze me. With each book he writes, he explores either suspense or supernatural horror in a way that both reaffirms its traditions and goes a step further.Nightmare House is a direct hit on the old-fashioned stories of hauntings and ghostly visitations from the late 19th and early 20th century, but with some major twists. Set in the mid-1920s, Nightmare House begins as a tale of inheritance: a man at the ledge of youth and middle-age inherits his grandfather's sprawling mansion called Harrow.But when he enters the house, he isn't prepared for its puzzle-box of mysteries and secrets, and its occult past, which determined the terrors within.The real brilliance of this novel is that Clegg manages to explore the psyche of a man turned bad, who once believed himself good. For horror lovers, this book has exorcisms, living burial, hidden rooms of arcana and artifact. There's a tale of a man who so wanted to hide a scandal of his life that he destroyed someone else's life to keep the secret, and in doing so he creates a hidden world.It never goes over-the-top. Clegg manages to rein in the elements, to keep it to the one consciousness of Ethan/Esteban, the unreliable but fascinating narrator of this tale.An extra novella is included after Nightmare House. It's called Purity. In a little more than a 100 pages, Clegg manages to write about a boy with no soul who wants everything and will stop at very little to get it. Until he meets his match in another boy, who is a confusion of wants.Purity is told as a love triangle, a story of classes on a moneyed summer island from the viewpoint (primarily) of the teenager who has no money, and it builds to a powerful, unexpected, blunt climax. While it has a slight Lovecraftian reference (to Dagon), it's really about a boy who wants so much that he can't have, that he is driven to do things that he does not want to do, including murder.While this is not a major novel, in the way that Clegg's novel of 2003 (The Hour Before Dark) is, this book contains two great in-between short novels to tide me over until Afterlife, a book of Clegg's I found on Amazon that's coming out this coming December in paperback.If you haven't picked up a Clegg book yet, pick this one up, and then go for The Hour Before Dark, and Naomi. I can't think of another writer who writes supernatural horror and suspense who matches the depth and variety of his fiction."},{"Title":"Nightmare House","review":"I loved Nightmare House.This was a really creepy tale that begins with just omens and hints of what's to come. The house itself is disturbing enough, but once the haunting begins, I got goosebumps.This is an atmospheric, quietly chilling tale of a haunting with everything from exorcism to burial alive within it. I loved it, and it ended on a really chilly note too.The bonus novel, Purity, was also pretty creepy. It was more of a suspense story about a really evil boy on an island. It had a little Lovecraft overtone to it, but not much. Very dark and then explosive.Nightmare House is an unusual book. It's a historical, set in the mid-1920s. It reminded me somewhat of old-fashioned ghost stories to a point. Then, when it jumped into hyperdrive, it really got twisted. Both novels play with viewpoint and sometimes the horror in your mind is worse than what's on the page.For those looking for more of a gorey-kind of horror story, you might look elsewhere. Nightmare House is quite a read, but not for anyone looking for blood and guts.I just order Clegg's The Infinite and Mischief, both books about the same house but at different time periods. Harrow is a place I would not want to spend the night but I would love to read more about it."},{"Title":"Nightmare House","review":"I loved Nightmare House!This is the first &quot;Harrow&quot; book I have read and I enjoyed it very much. This is a quietly creepy novel which is somewhat different from Douglas Clegg's other more scary novels. I liked how it slowly built up the menacing atmosphere of the house and the ghosts within it.Horror lately is known for its gore and violence which I do enjoy but it is nice to read a story which harkens back to the old time ghost story.As usual Clegg's writing style pulled me into this interesting world and I flew right through this story. As others have mentioned it is a short novel which left me wishing it went on longer. I am excited to read The Infinite, Mischief and The Necromancer and continue to explore this interesting world.As an added treat the book also contains a novela, &quot;Purity&quot;, which previously was only available as an out of print hardback. This story has a similar style to Nightmare House and fits well in this book. This story has very little violence or gore. The scariness of this story is the actions which result from a scorned lover trying to win back his love no matter the cost. This is a great little sinister story!Overall both stories have a quieter aura than most horror novels I have read and are spellbinding! Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"Nightmare House","review":"I just wanted to write and thank Douglas Clegg. He has written a novel, Nightmare House, that revives a bygone era of storytelling. He shows that atmosphere and anticipated horrors are just as scary as in your face blood and guts.Do ghosts exist? Of course they do. Ghosts, the likes of Shirley Jackson and Henry James, are alive and kicking in Nightmare House. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Nightmare House","review":"Was Mr. Clegg not feeling well? Was he being pressured by The Man and had to rush the writing? As I sit here in a state of bewilderment and confusion I have to wonder- what went wrong? I have read quite a few books by Clegg and he always managed to thrill me. This book, on the other hand, was depressingly bad. So, again, I ask, What Happened?With a plot that has been retold umpteen times, Clegg adds neither originality nor stimulation to an old tale. The atmosphere starts out with an air of mystery and soon begins to generate a feeling of being in a trance. The characters were my biggest problem with this book. Concentrating more on the backdrop of the story, Clegg never takes the time to develop what could have been a fascinating cast. Unable to get past the embryo stage, the characters appear lifeless and stagnant. The most interesting characters were transient, the remaining characters given only a brief dialogue and to top it off we are force-fed a weak romance.The only saving grace in this book is the inclusion of the novella. \\"Purity\\". A thriller about a sociopath living on a small island that has decided love is for the taking. Written in a tone reminiscent of Lovecraft, the story is dark and subversive. In only 117 pages, Clegg managed to rouse me from my slumber.My rating? I give it a 2 . Although the main story was inert and spiritless, the novella is a must read. Next time your at the local library, pick this book up.-Bloodymary"},{"Title":"Nightmare House","review":"This was a good old fashioned ghost story, it keeped you turning the pages just to see what happens next.

I am craving the rest of the story of Harrow.

Now I have someone new to read.After I was through I did two things. One was to thank God I wasn't anywhere near a place like Harrow House, the other was to go to my laptop and search Douglas Clegg's website for more titles from him. Now I have a post it note in front of me with several titles from Douglas Clegg. As soon as the book store opens ,I am off on a Clegg hunt!!

So glad Mr. Clegg has written more stories about Harrow. Be sure there's someone home with you at nightwhen you read this one!"},{"Title":"Nightmare House","review":"This book is well worth your time for the bonus novella PURITY alone. It's probably the best thing Clegg's ever written. An intense, extremely well written character study (almost reminiscent at times of the writing of John Irving) PURITY is a pure pleasure to read. I'd instantly recommend it to any horror fan out there, and any fan of good writing and good storytelling.The main attraction, NIGHTMARE HOUSE, is also a good tale, but it didn't leave me breathless the way PURITY did. The second of three novels dealing with the haunted Harrow mansion (MISCHIEF and THE INFINITE fill out the trilogy) NIGHTMARE HOUSE is at times eerie and thrilling, but tends towards a softness of focus that keeps readers from being fully engaged in the characters the way they are in the laser-sharp PURITY.Still NIGHTMARE HOUSE is a fine addition to Clegg's body of work, and I'm eager to read his new novel AFTERLIFE later this year."},{"Title":"Nightmare House","review":"I became a fan of Cleggs many years back.

He also publishes a case book on Louisiana law of Sale and Lease. If you want a historical perspective of Louisiana law relating to obligations (similar to contracts) from the man who wrote that portion of the Louisiana Civil Code, this is the book for you.

This book looks like it has been through a major battle.So many things impressed me. On page 111, for example, they give a 'top of mind' marketing success story for a mortgage lender. This is an industry that loses two-thirds to three-quarters of its borrowers when they refinance or take out a new mortgage. Creating programmatic value for borrowers should be at the top of their agenda; but the industry is tough to budge from their old, reactive forms of relationship. They tend to see themselves solely as bankers, order-takers. Susan and Mary offer an example of a concrete, creative way to both have customer involvement and generate valuable customer insight.On page 157, they do a succinct, focused job of presenting Customer Life Cycle as a concept. Applying life-cycle to customer relationships is a platform in everything I write about and do for my clients, so I was really glad to see it in their book.I'm particularly interested in how they recommend generating customer data, as well as storing and applying it. While, based on my background, I have pretty strong views on market research as a tactical and strategic tool(which differs somewhat from their opinions and experiences), I appreciate their methods for contacting and debriefing customers in Chapters 4 and 8.Bottom line: Customer Chemistry is crisp, professional and easy to read"},{"Title":"Customer Chemistry: How to Keep the Customers You Want--And Say Good-Bye to the Ones You Don't","review":"Mary and Susan really have found the winning formula for maximizing business relationships.

Whenever i get worked up over paying bills, decorating a house, having the right career, blah blah blah. I turn to this book, pick a page and start reading. Some of the poetry is distilled meaning of life. Some would say a woman wouldn't like bukowski. Some probably wouldn't. To me he's like the print version of Tom Waits. Knows the meaning of life and drinks a beer to the struggle."},{"Title":"Dangling in the Tournefortia","review":"The poems in this volume consistently present Bukowski as I've come to see him -- perceptive, self-deprecating, and frequently and unexpectedly funny as hell. There isn't really a bad or wasted line in here. This opinion is based on my knowledge of Bukowski derived from having read maybe 90 percent of his books. If you can have only one volume of Bukowski poetry, this should be it, in good part because it includes musings from his East Hollywood period and the affluent San Pedro days. In this regard, You may notice that Bukowski almost never mentions money or personal finances in his earlier work, but in San Pedro, mortgages, tax accountants, and the price of automobiles enter his view."},{"Title":"Dangling in the Tournefortia","review":"The biggest gripe I have against Charles Bukowski is that he made it look so easy. He's responsible for spawning thousands of second-rate immitators. I am no exception. Because I've spent some time in San Pedro, this collection in particular resonates with me since many of the poems come out of his stay in that harbor city. It's all here: women, booze, puking, classical music, barking dogs, war, annoying groupies, disasterous book readings, etc. If you were to choose one Bukowski book of poetry to read, this is it."},{"Title":"Dangling in the Tournefortia","review":"If you've found your way to this page you clearly either have an interest in Charles Bukowski or in tournefortia, which, I understand, is some sort of hanging plant -- tournefortia, I mean, is some sort of hanging plant, not Bukowski, who is a man. (Can't use &quot;was&quot; here, by God, because Hank will be with us always.) Ahem. Bukowski, of course, is a poet, for some of us, make that for many of us, THE poet, the best damned poet of the 20th century, maybe of the ages.But, having found your way here, you know all that. I'm preaching to the choir. (Unless you are that rare tournefortia afficianado who cares only for plants and nothing for the sublime lines of the master. In that case, you must quit this place for a more horticulturaly friendly environment at once. At once, do you hear?)There are many fine poems in this book: &quot;The Lisp,&quot; &quot;The Man at the Piano,&quot; &quot;One for Sherwood Anderson,&quot; the list goes on and on. It's an outstanding collection, one any Bukophile should own. Hell, buy two and give one to a friend. That, at least will keep them from stealing your copy for a while, at least until someone steals their own and they need another -- damn it! -- right this minute and they know where you keep yours. Come to think of it, maybe you should buy three or four of every Bukowksi title. God knows I've lost dozens of copies of his books through the years. I take solace in the understanding that they are still out there, still being loaned and stolen and loaned again, making the rounds from needy hand to needy hand and will be doing so from now till they fall to pieces or the end of things descends upon us all."},{"Title":"Dangling in the Tournefortia","review":"If you've read Bukowksi, then you know how he feels about the \\"critics\\".

You should own this one!"},{"Title":"Dangling in the Tournefortia","review":"I got into Bukowski through his short stories and novels, but my entire perspective changed with my introduction to his poetry. This is one of the finest of his I have read, hands down. If you are a fan of the man's work, you really can't go wrong here. Booze, old friends, old lovers, old regrets, and new troubles all live in the poems presented here. Just buy it already."},{"Title":"Dangling in the Tournefortia","review":"For those of you who appreciate the less carnal side of Charles Bukowski's writing &quot;Dangling in the Tournefortia&quot; is a great choice. It appears that what is most obviously dangling in this work is Mr. Bukowski's place in line, no longer at the far end of the unemployment line but not one soul away from entering the rest home either. On one hand you have poems like &quot;My Big Fling&quot; that describe how the Chinaski gets into a fight with his woman, storms out to a hotel, climbs into bed with drinks and watches TV...only to find out the next day he and his woman watched the same show from their respective beds. On the other, you have another poem that tells Old Bukowski's story of juggling three girlfriends all half his age (about 50). Much like the rest of us, Bukowski changes, if gradually and begrudgingly, over time and in spite of the critics of his later work this is still a fine piece of his writing. Check out &quot;Screams from the Balcony&quot; if you think that Bukowski spent his whole life indignant to the world. Then again I suppose he wouldn't care one way or another now about our little reviews. &quot;Dangling&quot; is a good book for the most part."},{"Title":"Dangling in the Tournefortia","review":"classic bukowskilong narrative thoughtful poetry carefully planned and executed regardless of how he may have described his own techniqe herethe ending short poem is classic"},{"Title":"Dangling in the Tournefortia","review":"an amazing look at the reality of life as illustrated by one who tells it like it is without shame"},{"Title":"Spelling the easy way","review":"With jobs so scarce lately, I thought I'd spend my time reviewing basic skills while I waited for the phone to ring.

I'm not just saying this; I really like his writing style because it's so down to earth.

Protagonist Luke Lurey is the ex-husband caught in the middle, whose ever-present guidance helps put the pieces back together. And what wicked pieces they end up being. Just like any scandal sheet type magazine of the time, this Harold Robbins offering is pulp fiction at its best. With its effervescent plot scheme and narratively swinging point of view, this \\"fictional\\" delivery by the man who once has been hailed as a master storyteller is one addictive read that surely will please fans of the melodrama, and that, despite the toned-down sex scenes of its time (1962).-----Martin Boucher"},{"Title":"Where Love Has Gone","review":"The name Harold Robbins brings to mind words such as \\"trash\\", \\"sleaze\\" and the like. I have only read a couple of his books and they have been of varying quality, from the awful Descent to Xanadu to the not-bad Spellbinder, and the fascinating Blood Royal (although that last one was written by Junius Podrug).I've heard that \\"Where Love Has Gone\\" is regarded as a roman a clef about the Lana Turner/Cheryl Crane/Johnny Stompanato murder scandal. That may be true; I'm sure Robbins was inspired by it when he wrote the book. But he still makes the characters and the story his own. The narrator is Luke Carey, now happily married and expecting a baby with his wife Elizabeth. He learns that his daughter, Danielle, from his previous marriage to rich sculptress Nora Hayden. Luke goes back to San Francisco to help his daughter, whom he hasn't seen in six years. Through flashbacks we get to know the characters and their history, and Luke and Nora's miserable marriage. Luke narrates most of the book, but there are scenes where he's not present that are told in third person. The present-time story works as a frame story for the flashbacks where the real meat of the story is. And Robbins has created a great, three dimensional character in Luke, and he shows a tenderness and insight into the human nature that I haven't noticed in the other books I've read by him.\\"Where Love Has Gone\\" is not a suspense novel, but it's still a page turner. Highly recommended. This deserves to still be in print."},{"Title":"Where Love Has Gone","review":"Only the author of The Carpetbaggers could have written this explosive novel about the moment of truth for a group of people trapped between a disastrous past and a precarious future.You will meet Luke Carey, who woke up one night to the telephone call that altered his entire life; Nora, his first wife, who believed that her only responsibility was to her ever hungry body; Dani their daughter, fourteen and rudderless in a glittering adult world; Marguerite Cecilia Hayden, Dani's grandmother, who could manage two huge fortunes but not her amoral daughter; and Elizabeth, Luke's second wife, who took a gamble few women would willing to take. --from book's back cover"},{"Title":"Where Love Has Gone","review":"This Harold Robbins novel is one of the most beautifully written novels about humanity.

A lovely tome."},{"Title":"The light of Asia","review":"The Light of Asia is Edwin Arnold's ecstatic homage to the Buddha, delivered as an epic poem. The lines of Arnold's poem overflow with luminescent imagery, painting a vivid portrait of ancient India.Edwin Arnold arrived in India in 1856, in a period when very little was known about the spiritual traditions of the East, let alone the teachings of the Buddha. It is clear that Arnold fell in love with the majestic culture of India, a love which led him to learn Pali and Sanskrit. The Light of Asia was written, in his own words, \\"in the brief intervals of days without leisure.\\"The Light of Asia truly stands alone. Arnold has let the story of the Buddha fill his heart, and his re-telling has its own particular charms and beauty. His portrait of the Buddha is one of perfect love, perfect compassion, and perfect wisdom--his Buddha is a world-redeemer. Even the stoical rocks are moved by his birth.The Light of Asia invites us into Arnold's romance with a world still veiled in mystery. More than that, it invites us into the spirit of the Prince Gautama. Take the moment of Siddhartha's departure from his wife and child--for many, this moment could seem selfish or callous. In Arnold's rendition, it is a moment of infinite compassion, a moment where even perfect filial love and domestic bliss cannot conceal the truth of suffering. Arnold's Prince does not turn away from the highest worldly contentment in search of some yet-greater divine pleasure, but out of sympathy for the whole of humanity. If even love falls prey to death, we must seek out some greater gift for those we love. We must seek the deathless.But if this were all Arnold's poem captured, we would still be left dangling. The Buddha's enlightenment is described by Arnold as rapture. As the Buddha awakens, the whole world rejoices. The trees begin to dance, the birds go into a frenzy, and across India men and women can feel it: something has happened. The unfulfilled has been fulfilled, the seeker has found the sought, the world has been infused by the beyond.The Light of Asia is also relevant from a historical perspective. It captures something rare: an early treatment of Eastern philosophy by a Western scholar which is not merely respectful and well-learned, but a genuine soul communion. This reveals a high degree of courage, a courage which globalization demands of all of us.The dance between East and West continues, and every day the lines become a bit more blurred. As we come into closer contact with new cultures and traditions, may we find inspiration in the enchantment and respect which Arnold felt so deeply for India. May we all find wisdom wherever it appears. May wisdom be the balm for the world's wounds, and the fire to kindle the hearts of all peace-seekers."},{"Title":"The light of Asia","review":"WHO THWARTS IT LOSES, AND WHO SERVES IT GAINS.THE HIDDEN GOOD IT PAYS WITH BLISS,THE HIDDEN ILL WITH PAINS.SIR EDWIN ARNOLD, \\"LIGHT OF ASIA\\""},{"Title":"The light of Asia","review":"It was a fair printing of this book but the free version on the internet was much easier to read and comprehend at UrbanDharma.org."},{"Title":"Rock Climbing Joshua Tree West: Quail Springs to Hidden Valley Campground (Regional Rock Climbing Series)","review":"Got this book this month (December) and have already began picking out new routes I want to do!

The world needs more smart parodies. The people at McSweeney's (Dave Eggers) who produced this book have been spot on before and are always worth giving the benefit of the doubt. The book is beautifully produced. Clearly talented graphic designers had some fun putting this together. The problem (and I think there is one) is with the humor. It's just not clever or funny enough to justify the existence of a hardcover, rather expensive book. Once you \\"get it\\" that it is completely absurd and therefore not really a parody, it's suddenly an overdone bore. I think it would have been funnier if some percentage of the content were \\"real\\" facts, giving the book a launching pad for its absurdity. But how funny is it to see a page of photo-shopped \\"fake\\" noses with unfunny captions? Another example: a chart of thesickening fluids that fill your skull\\"-- a sort of uninspired \\"booger\\" joke without a punchline.I'm reminded of the unfunny DJ in \\"Good Morning, Vietnam\\" who when fired for being unfunny, says, \\"In my heart I know I'm funny.\\" These people are trying way too hard to prove how funny they are. We get it, you're want us to think you are doing something \\"unique\\"-- a totally fake informational book ostensibly for children, but really for---well, that's just it. Who is this for? Who really thinks this if funny who doesn't work for McSweeneys? The sad part is that, in essence, it's a good idea. We do need more smart parodies.

Many family jokes have been taken from Dr. Doris (and Benny), and we truly appreciate those behind their \\"unbelievable brilliance.\\" It was only recently that I discovered they were created by Dave & Topher Eggars, whose \\"Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius\\" also had me in stitches [and tears].

The Hagis-on-Whey books are almost never there! I catch students reading them all the time...out loud to their friends, in the hallway during breaks, and in class (ahem!) when they're supposed to be listening to me!

Those with delicate sensibilities need not open this wonderfully instructive and sometimes comically funny work. Nevertheless, Everett's finely detailed chronicle of a slumping professional third baseman's journey to self-awareness is an affirmation in the best sense of the word. Bringing in a diverse cast of characters- -including a taxidermically-obsessed baseball manager, an abused run-away sub-teen, and a long-suffering elephant who finds happiness in the Oregon hill country- -Everett leads the slumping pro ball player to an epiphany of the soul which concludes with a satisfying Icarus-like journey that is also a moving tribute to the jazz of Charlie &quot;Byrd&quot; Parker.Have fun!"},{"Title":"Suder (Voices of the South)","review":"This book has a main character, Craig, who's a professional baseball player who has hit a major slump in the major leagues and takes some time off. While soul searching and trying to maintain some semblance of sanity, Craig takes the reader through his abnormal childhood and reflects on the antics of his mother who was mentally insane. Although the ending leaves much to be desired, the content of the book will make you laugh, and say, &quot;WHAT!&quot; several times. Craig and his mother will stay with you long after you've finished this novel. The most memorable scene for me was the baseball game with the mother being an unofficial coach to Craig by showing him how to run the bases while wearing a full length mink coat. Happy reading."},{"Title":"Garden of Persephone","review":"Julien is a young English scholar who goes to Sicily to be the envoy and secretary to Roger II, the twelfth century king who was able to unite the south of Italy, becoming involved with the papal politics of the age. On behalf of his employer, Julien, an admirer of Peter Abelard, is sent on a number of diplomatic missions to various parts of Europe. Along the way he meets Claire, and manages to marry her, against the odds.Italy in the twelfth century isn't a place or time I know much about, despite my interest in medieval Europe, so I was interested in picking up this novel. The book is at its best when sorting out the convoluted politics of the 1120s and \`30s, but falters a bit when it comes to the fiction bits.It was very hard for me to really believe Julien and Claire's relationship; one moment they dislike each other and the next they're declaring their undying love for one another. There's also very little passion involved; most of the time, Julien seems to just go through the motions. I never got the feeling that he had much of a personality, and I wasn't all that pleased at his laissez-faire attitude towards the other women he sleeps with. It also would have been great to have seen the teachings of Abelard worked in more. And the ending left a lot to be desired; I finished the book thinking, that's it? In the end, I just didn't care all that much about the characters or what happened to them.However, the time period itself is fascinating; I never knew how integrated Eastern and Western cultures were in Sicily then, or that Roger had a harem! Later, I went on to read more about Roger, and he really was a fascinating guy. The papal politics of the middle ages generally aren't what I'm interested in, but I really enjoyed watching the interplay between Roger and Innocent. I always like an historical novel that manages to educate its readers, and Rotondi does that well in The Garden of Persephone. I just wish his characters were as engaging as his setting."},{"Title":"Sex in the Comics","review":"This is a fine, large-format, serious-minded history of sex in 20th century comics, that would be of interest to comic fans, comic artists, as well as art, social and cultural historians. It is fully illustrated, in both black and white and full color, and includes an index. There is about equal amounts text and examples of comics. This book covers a wide-gamut, from Lil' Abner, to R. Crumb to Cathy, to Frank Frazetta, to Penthouse's Wicked Wanda, and Playboy's Little Annie Fannie, and a smattering of the undergrounds. There is also an overview of comics in various countries throughout the world. There is a fair amount of explicit content, but it is not gratuitous. It has a nice dustjacket, modest on the front, a little more risque on the back. I won't give this book a five star rating, because although this book covers a lot of ground, I'm sure there is a lot of territory not covered, and that someone could go into more scholarly depth on the subject. (For instance, there isn't any discussion of how these comics relate to erotic art prior to the 20th century.) But at the moment, I don't know of another book that is any more comprehensive. Bear in mind that this book is nearly 20 years old."},{"Title":"Sex in the Comics","review":"Less America-centric than Horn's admirable Women in the Comics (I recommend you get hold of the original rather than the 3-volume update), this has many delights and it has to merit the full monte, as the only one in its field before Tim Pilcher's 2-volume Erotic Comics'After 1945, war - except World War II, which was still being fought in some comic books as late as the seventies - seems to have lost most of its sex appeal.' A good thing too, one might think"},{"Title":"The Garden of Eden","review":"I just plain enjoyed this book! It doesn't fit any genre...not a 'mystery', not a 'thriller', etc. Just tells a story about folks living a not quite ordinary life.The characters were likeable. Kind of like hearing the local 'gossip' from your best friend. Rules were bent at appropriate times. People got what was coming to them. And the main story had a happy ending. My only complaint is there were too many questions left unanswered....too many stories that were not ended. Maybe a little too 'real life' in that respect. For example, did the author find his 'true love'? What happens with the town drunk and the widow next door? What do the 'kids' do after HS graduation.....does college end their relationship? I enjoyed the book....but it left me wanting more!"},{"Title":"The Garden of Eden","review":"I picked this book up \\"by the cover\\" near the end of my summer, and totally enjoyed it.

You will love Eve Adam's novel!"},{"Title":"The Garden of Eden","review":"Young state policeman Sam Neely has been assigned to the tiny village of Eden (population: 47) where he fears he will go mad with boredom. But he never gets that opportunity, because things start happening immediately.Eden banker Ed Harris arrives home unexpectedly to find his best friend, Hayden Elkins, in bed with Ed's wife, Anne. With a gun pointed at them, Ed orders Anne to pack her belongings. Anne, he announces, will now live with Hayden, who will treat her as a wife. When Hayden reminds Ed that he already has a wife, Ed replies that now he has two. Ed orders Hayden to make Anne happy. And so the couple head home to Hayden's wife, Matilda, who faints when she hears the news.The town is abuzz with the news of Hayden and his two wives. Some of the more upright women approach Trooper Neely to swear out a complaint of bigamy against Hayden, and a complaint of felony menacing against gun-toting Ed. Neely must investigate. When Neely interviews Anne, she blithely divulges how she and Matilda plan to divide their wifely duties, with Matilda doing the housework, Anne washing the windows, and so on.That is just the beginning of the happenings in Eden, the young policeman discovers. There's gorgeous Crystal Ice, with whom Neely falls madly in love. There's also a young retarded Peeping Tom, a wealthy author who has escaped from city life, and a deputy sheriff who has quite the photo collection. And then there's the comely woman preacher, who has an amazing secret.As one might expect from the author's name, the book is written under a pseudonym, which drove me into a frenzy of deciding on the identity of the writer. After some research, I discovered I was way off on my guess of the author (\\"Eve Adams\\" is the pseudonym for bestselling thriller writer Stephen Coonts --- who would have guessed??) The book reminds me very much of the Mitford series by Jan Karon, although THE GARDEN OF EDEN is a bit racier. Like the Mitford stories, the characters' lives fit together in a pleasing manner, which is very satisfying and uplifting. Besides the interesting characters, a decidedly Southern backdrop, plenty of understated humor, and a lively pace make this a pleasurable read.I have one small quibble: all the women of note are extraordinarily gorgeous goddesses. Descriptions of these beauteous lasses wore thin rapidly, and made the characters seem less real. Despite this minor drawback, I thoroughly enjoyed losing myself in THE GARDEN OF EDEN.[...]"},{"Title":"The Garden of Eden","review":"Everyone knows that Stephen Coonts can write a thriller. Nobody does it better. There are good reasons for that and among the first of those reasons is that Coonts has actually done the things he writes about. His writing does not originate in fantasy, but in his own experience at the controls of a combat aircraft, firing and being fired upon.But Stephen Coonts is not a pilot who happens to write, he is a writer who happens to have flown. He is a true literary man and his passion for the word preceded and is deeper than his experience as a combat pilot. That is a fact that, given the length and breadth of his contribution to American letters, and his continuing availability to us, ought to be celebrated, and it is nowhere more evident than in this book.The town of Eden is not populated by intrepid fighter pilots and international spies, but by small-time bankers, shopkeepers, housewives and lots of people who are down on their luck. There are people who have endured decades of grief; people who have made crazy, inexplicable mistakes; people who have hurt the ones they love the best; people for whom circumstances have left no alternative but patience and humility; people whose reasonable expectations have been denied them, time and again. People who, at very bottom, quietly yearn for something they just can't quite put their finger on.You know, like real life.We have seen and been entertained by Stephen Coonts' mind for decades, but in this book he shows us a piece of his heart, and it is a thing well worth considering."},{"Title":"The Garden of Eden","review":"First off - if you enjoy the standard \\"trashy romance novel\\", then this book isn't for you. Most of what I read is military and historical fiction, with a little science fiction thrown in. (Alternate History is also a big favorite.) But when I saw that Stephen Coonts wrote this book under a pen name, I ordered it simply because I like all of Mr. Coonts' fiction. The Jake Grafton novels, the two SAUCER books, everything. So, even though the cover doesn't resemble the cover of anything I usually read, I got it because of Mr. Coonts. And I wasn't disappointed one iota. You can definitely tell it was written by Stephen Coonts as soon as you start on Chapter 1, because his sense of humor is prevalent in the dialogue from the beginning and continues throughout the book.I'd recently finished the GETTYSBURG trilogy done by Newt Gingrich and Dr. William R. Forstchen. So I needed something to lift my spirits to get me away from the death and destruction of the War Between the States. This fit the bill to a \\"T\\". A great story and characterization filled with excellent humor, and it has a happy ending. No unnecessary violent deaths; and most of the characters get what they want out of life. There is a ~slight~ gap left open for a sequel. Maybe one of these days Mr. Coonts will get to revisit Eden. I hope so. This is a nice story in an age where you don't see very many of those anymore. I went through this book in two short days, because it was just too good to put down.A previous reviewer had a small gripe about most of the female characters being \\"extraordinarily gorgeous goddesses\\". Hey - Eden is a fictitious community. Of ~course~ the women are going to be breathtaking. And the *really* gorgeous ones in this book are certifiably nuts, which lends a hand in making this tale more true-to-life, in my humble opinion. [Tongue planted firmly in cheek.]Long story short - this is a great book, full of laughs; and also some introspective glimpses of what makes people tick. Give it a try."},{"Title":"The Garden of Eden","review":"Let me preface this by acknowledging that this is my first ever review and the reason for it to encourage a sequel, prequel or just another Eve Adams book. My wife was so taken that she got on Mr. Coont's web site and inquired if he intended to write another Eve Adams book to which he tactfully said no.A delightful romp! Stephen Coonts (aka Eve Adams) is well known as a masterful storyteller and in the Garden of Eden he does not disappoint. While this is not a nail-biting, page turning Jake Grafton adventure the plot and character development as well as the humor are pure Coonts. This (probably) West Virginia town of Eden is filled with the most wonderful group of misfits, characters and fine people you could ever hope to meet and our brief encounter with them has us either guffawing or grinning with delight at every turn. One of Stephen's, er pardon me, Eve's characters interjects a little homespun philosophy on relationships that should give us all pause to ponder and the grand finally is grand and gives each of us a reason to be hopeful. The sad part of this enchanting novel is turning the last page and having to leave Eden. I do hope that Mr. Coonts, er, Eve will reconsider and enrich our live with another rendezvous in Eden."},{"Title":"The Garden of Eden","review":"This was an enjoyable book, but I was a little disappointed near the end. It started out good, but lost it's steam three quarters of the way through."},{"Title":"Madras Quartet: Women in Karnatic Music","review":"This book is an introduction to women musicians of the Carnatic tradition. It is organized into 3 sections. The first section is a general history of Carnatic music, especially focusing on the Trinity composers, and later how women temple dancers lost their social status and subsequently transformed themselves to become respected classical musicians. The second section of the book provides a concise overview of Carnatic music theory, especially the varnam and kriti. It also includes information about the instruments used in Carnatic music, their history, structure, and playing techniques. The final section of the book takes up the biographies of the four women vocalists featured on the cover: M. S. Subbulakshmi, T. Brinda, D. K. Pattammal, and M. L. Vasanthakumari. These women did not actually form a quartet, but they were all well known musicians from Madras over the same time period. The descriptions of the women vary from biographical details to scholarly critique of individual performances. At the end of the book are appendices including a listing of charity concerts given by Subbulakshmi, a select discography of women musicians, a glossary, and a select bibliography.The first two sections of the book do an excellent job of establishing the context that the women from Madras were working in. However, the linkages between the earlier sections and the remaining chapters are very weak. Menon also tends to name-drop occasionally, seeming to include mention of as many contemporary musicians as possible. On occasion, she also uses terminology that may not be clear to Western readers who have not studied Carnatic theory previously. Nevertheless, the book does an admirable job of describing how women came to be accepted in the male-dominated world of Carnatic classical performance- -without any help or influence by Western feminists. Menon also makes clear why one's musical heritage is so vital in Indian music by describing how ones learns not only style from one's teacher, but also the very compositions themselves. Compositions are given to students as gifts from the guru, and thus they cannot be learned by outsiders unless \\"stolen\\" from recordings or the like. For this reason, and also to maintain the elite status of Carnatic music by controlling where it could be played, some Carnatic virtuosos would not allow any recordings of their music."},{"Title":"Madras Quartet: Women in Karnatic Music","review":"The author gives a very solid introduction to contemporary musicians and form of music tracking it from the ancient times.Contains several historical facts and light titbits, presented with a reasonably captivating style."},{"Title":"Drawing the Light from Within: Keys to Awaken Your Creative Power","review":"Cornell's well-structured course offers a satisfying combination of basics and exercises that serve to stimulate and encourage individual creativity. The instruction is suitable for beginners, but also has something to contribute for those whose study of art may be more advanced. Exercises guide the student through the basics of composition, painting, drawing, and creating with color pencils. Cornell's aim, however, goes beyond teaching the basics of art. The structure of the exercises includes meditation techniques designed to enhance creativity. Emphasis is placed on learning to use values from light to dark to create compositions that vibrate with light."},{"Title":"Drawing the Light from Within: Keys to Awaken Your Creative Power","review":"When I purchased this book, I was looking for a book that would explain a bit about how to awaken my inner sight and creative energy, a bit about creating mandalas and a bit about beginning art since I have minimal experience with art or mandalas.

There are many good poems in this collection that you really won't see elsewhere."},{"Title":"Smoke from This Altar","review":"Most people know L'Amour as a strictly Western writer. However, I have owned this book of poetry for about 6 or 7 years, and it continues to amaze me. The variety of poetical styles is impressive. There are humorous anecdotes in poem form, love poems, and haunting poems of wanderlust. Naturally, there are a lot of poems addressing wanderlust, seeing as it was a driving force in L'Amour's life. This collection is highly worthwhile if you are a L'Amour fan, and even if you are not."},{"Title":"Smoke from This Altar","review":"I never liked liked poetry until this book. Only Louis could do it!"},{"Title":"Smoke from This Altar","review":"My original favorite poet was Robert Frost. I still love selected poems of his, but he has faded in my esteem as i explored more of his and other people's poetry. I discovered that Louis L'amour had a book of poetry at some point some years back, and being a huge fan of his fiction I just had to try it out. I was not disappointed. I have now read through the book about five times, and still love the way he writes poems. Of course, long before I knew he had written poetry, I told people he was a poet in prose form because of the eloquence of his westerns and other novels. When he wrote of something you could see the sights and feel the emotions. His poetry follows in that as well. If you like poetry, buy this book. You'll never regret it. Mr L'amour long ago bumped Mr. Frost a notch lower on my list. I place \\"Smoke From This Altar\\" on a par with Longfellow any day. Maybe better."},{"Title":"Smoke from This Altar","review":"Ordered this book for my husband, Louis L'Amour boooks is just about all he reads.

I love poetry and read it everyday, and this has become my favorite book of poems.Keep in mind most of these poems were written when L'Amour was a young man our traveling the world, long before he became the revered storyteller of his later years. And with that in perspective, it only makes the work more impressive.If you're intimidated by poetry or just \\"don't get it,\\" this is a good volume to start with. It's not \\"high brow\\" poetry in the old English sense. It won't send you to the dictionary every other word. But it will take you to distant lands aboard ships and ports of call, and it will call to you on the inside like all great poetry does. In short it will move you.If you love L'Amour's novels, do give this little volume of poems a try. Even if he'd not become the popular writer he was, this work would stand on its own."},{"Title":"Smoke from This Altar","review":"I love showing this book to western readers. They're always surprised. People who write Petrarchan sonnets are rare. A book to savor."},{"Title":"Smoke from This Altar","review":"I'm a huge fan of the late Louis L'Amour. I've read about 20 of his westerns and at least 5 of his other novels (Yes he wrote much more than westerns). Almost all 5 stars ...see my reviews.I'm not super big into poetry as in two literature classes I was forced to speak/analyse poems. I didn't like that.However I enjoyed L'Amour's book of poems. Smoke From This Altar was his first book before he became a well known author. For a time this book was hard to get as it was only published in Oklahoma and only a few book stores kept it...not many copies. Later after L'Amour became one of America's greatest authors Bantam published Smoke From This Altar for national distribution. His wife Kathy had several more of his poems put in the back that were not published in the original book. That was nice of her.The book is only 78 pages and the reader can read it in one day. I did, but plan to keep the book in my car or near my Kayak so I can read a poem of his when I have a few minutes of time and want to relate a poem to what I am going. Most of his poems can be read in a minute or less. Here is a book you can read dozens of times and enjoy his poems again and again.Smoke from This Altar has different kinds of poems some short, some longer, some sad, happy and some thought provoking. There were 56 poems in this 78 page book. Louis L'Amour left home at 15 and had an extremely interesting life and visited many countries and had different occupations including being a professional boxer and a seaman. Some of his poems are bases on these experiences.I liked most of his sea poems...5 stars as I was in the Navy and had a small sail boat. I could relate to them. I enjoyed his poem To Giordano Bruno, a scientist/astronomer who was burned alive in 1600 because his teachings went against the Catholic church. As a 40 year amateur astronomer I knew this and really appreciated this poem. I also liked some of the other poems where L'Amour talks about the stars and the heavens.His poem The Gladiator that Kathy put in the back of the book I enjoyed and related it to the movie. Lots of action in my mind.There was one of his longer poems I could not get into and I don't want to go into analyzing of poetry again but I will reread it again later. Maybe I'll enjoy it more.I won't ruin the book by going into all his poems. I enjoyed the vast majority of them. This is is a good book to have close to you so you can read one of his poems whenever you want. Rated 4 1/3 stars but if you are a super lover of quality poetry you may rate it higher."},{"Title":"Smoke from This Altar","review":"Enjoyed this book of poems very much.

Under each of these headings he shows several of his pictures with a brief statement. The pictures and the statement often do not relate to his chosen concept. They rarely relate to his three-step process. Often he omits really significant information that should be covered. For example, in his chapter on perspective he does not point out that using different focal length lenses, with different angles of vision, while keeping the image the same size, will change the amount of background included in a shot.Sometimes he is just plain wrong. In several places he suggests that if he had used a different focal length lens for a subject, changed his distance but kept the exposure and image size the same, he would have gotten a different depth of field. It's an optical fact that if the image size and exposure are the same with different focal length lenses, the depth of field around the image will still be the same.I also can't walk away from the publication itself. The book was printed on a semi-coated stock rather than the usual coated stock of photography books. The color gamut of such paper is less than coated stock and many vibrant colors appear slightly toned down. Too bad. Some of Zuckerman's photos are good.In summery this book is a collection of random tips rather than an organized approach to the subject. And I was frustrated."},{"Title":"Capturing Drama in Nature Photography","review":"As with most of Jim Zuckerman's books, this one was incredibly informative. The 12 chapters cover the areas in photography that are the most helpful in getting the best shots of nature and the outdoors.From perspective to motion to exposure to self-critique, Jim's knowledge of photography is second to none. I know of no one out there shooting who understands the mechanics of this medium more than him. And it shows in his photography, which is simply amazing.This is a must buy for any one serious about seeing and capturing nature better in their photographs."},{"Title":"Capturing Drama in Nature Photography","review":"I purchased this book and I have used many of the artistic techniques and ideas to improve my nature photography. I would advise any one who is serious in nature photography to use the ideas Jim outlined in this book. I can't see how anyone who actually studies this book to not be satisfied with the content. I also have looked at a lot of this authors work and I think he is one of the best nature photographers in the business. His work is outstanding."},{"Title":"Capturing Drama in Nature Photography","review":"This is a terrific book with good recommendations and illustrations, and alike Jim Zuckerman's courses, it is well organized and well written. Jim speaks in the first person with his classes and tells what he has done and in the necessary order.

It makes a series of important points very succinctly (essentially one point on every double page spread) about how to capture the elusive \`drama' in a photograph.

I made copious notes while reading the book and I refer to these notes before I go out on a shoot."},{"Title":"Capturing Drama in Nature Photography","review":"This book is great for developing creativity in nature photography. The author isolates and illustrates different concepts of a photograph, such as perspective, color, light, etc. When focusing on these concepts while composing a shot, one can learn how to make the pictures dramatic like those of the pros. Zuckerman really makes the complicated concept of a \\"dramatic\\" photograph simple by breaking up the concepts to look for in a shot. great picrues too!"},{"Title":"Cooks' Tools: The Complete Manual of Kitchen Implements and How to Use Them","review":"My late husband said that every technician needs good tools.

I mean, kitchen tools were meant to live out their lives whipping up delicious food.I did so love finding pictures of a \\"molinillos\\" on page 135 and didn't even know there was an asparagus peeler.While there are no recipes, there are instructions for assembling various dishes like a Black Forest Cake. You can even learn how to chop lettuce. Who does that? Ok, there is such a thing as a chopped salad. Anyway, you should chop it with a \\"plastic\\" knife instead to prevent browning. I rather like using it to shred the lettuce for sandwich displays.So, you can learn a bit about actual cooking, while seeing the items in use. The \\"How Knives are Forged\\" is well worth the price of the book.Information is included on: Knives, Scissors & Shears, Other Cutting Tools - peelers, mushroom fluter and such, Pounding, Pressing and Pureeing Tools, Crackers and Crushers, Meat Grinders, Grinders & Mills, Boards, Rolling Pins, Piercing Tools, Pastry Brushes, Spoons, Whisks & Beaters, Separators & Homogenizers, Sifters, Strainers, Shakers and Spinners, Food Mixers and Food Processors, Bowls, Cake, Bread and Pastry Tins, Molds & Presses, Casseroles & Baking Pots, Souffl&eacute; Dishes, Gratin Pans, Roasting Pans, Saucepans, Frying Pans, Sauteuses & Deep Fryers, Grills & Griddles, Barbecues, Smokers, Fondues, Toasters, Warmers & Coolers, Racks, Trivets and Diffusers, Cake Decorating Equipment, Papers, Plastics, Foil, String and Cloths, Teapots and Kettles, Coffee Makers & Jugs, Wine Making & Brewing Equipment, Glasses, Yogurt, Ice Cream & Drink Makers, Measuring Equipment and Storage.If you love to cook, you will find this entertaining. Probably will cuddle up in bedwith the book on a Saturday night because your best online friend is busy doing who knows what.

Although he was not at the savage fighting during the capture of Monterrey, he claims to have been there so the reader is left to wonder about his other claims and the accuracy of his combat in which he lied about being involved. Perhaps he had contact with those who were actually there?Sam Chamberlain was in the Mexican War and painted some interesting small glimpses of life & death. Reading his book is almost like listening to a veteran who seems to have been everywhere and done everything (especially with women). Sam Chamberlain relates deaths of soldiers to Mexican guerrillas and duty in the occupation but more often than not, Sam Chamberlain proclaims preposterous pick-ups with a host of women. The reader almost senses the author is bragging to fellow high schoolers in a locker room or to anyone who will listen in a bar, hence the title of the book is fitting \\"My Confessions: Recollections of a Rogue\\". This book would probably be disregarded as pure fantasy if it were not or the fact that sometimes he does detail military and daily life senarios which are proved by others.For those interested the Mexican War, this is a \\"must read\\" book and has been used by historians as a primary source for years because Camberlain recounts many scenes which have escaped photographers and those who made lithographs, including the massacre of Mexican civilians by Arkansas troops in a cave in Northern Mexico.Truth or Tall Tale or Both? Read this book and you be the judge."},{"Title":"My Confession: The Recollections of a Rogue","review":"Truth or not, this book is a fun read.

This book also tells you the different ways to use humor.

Published in a small, soft padded, gift book style, Hal delivers a powerful message of the truth of God's grace. This book will help the reader grasp the ultimate truth of God's most precious gift, grace. Chapters discuss Hal's personal &quot;wild tugboat captain&quot; days, reasons for the necessity of grace, forgiveness and freedom from shame and guilt. Hal, better than any other author, relates the truth of the Christian life. Which is that once the person understands what God did at the cross and the abundance of love that was expressed at the cross, and that in return all Jesus asks for is a personal relationship, people will flock to that truth of grace. Christianity is not about rules, it is about God's greatest gift - grace and Hal brings this message forth in crystal clarity. If you have only read Hal's prophecy works, treat yourself to another of his gifts, writing about grace. This book makes a wonderful gift to believers and non believers alike. Personally I have given away at least 4 books to friends in need of the simple assurance of grace. Read about God's greatest gift today."},{"Title":"The Greatest Gift: God's Amazing Grace","review":"Using layman's terms and simple illustrations, Hal Lindsey does a remarkable job of explaining this wonderful gift called grace.

Josyf Slipyj was Head of the Ukrainian Catholic Church for almost the entire period of Soviet rule in Ukraine. The book details both his life in the Soviet Gulag and his exile in Rome. However, it does not move in a typical chronological biographical fashion. Pelikan instead explains the various philosophical and theological influences on the life of a bishop who gave to the Ukrainian (Greek) Catholic Church both his mind, as a great intellectual force, and his body, in his physical sufferings at the hands of the Communists."},{"Title":"Survey of the Uralic languages","review":"Bj&ouml;rn Collinder's SURVEY OF THE URALIC LANGUAGES, a step on the way to his subsequent comparative grammar, was originally published in Uppsala in 1957. At the time, it was a major work, the first English-language introduction to this language family, and one of the first resources to put the Samoyedic languages on an equal footing with the Finno-Ugric.There is one chapter for each language in the Uralic language family. Essentially, all are structured the same, with basic phonology, a series of paradigms, and finally a commented text in transliteration. Unusually, Hill Mari (\\"the Kozmodemyansk dialect of Western Cheremis\\") represents Mari, while usually one only gets a presentation of Meadow Mari. Collinder found more resources for some languages than others, which is why Finnish gets 129 pages of description while e.g. Selkup gets only thirty. Still, in the case of Kamassian, we should be grateful indeed for its mere 22 pages, since English-language sketches of this late Samoyedic language are rare indeed.While the work was of immense value upon its appearance, it is now dated. THE URALIC LANGUAGES: Description, History and Foreign Influences, ed. Sinor (Brill, 1987) and THE URALIC LANGUAGES ed. Abondolo (Routledge, 1998) have superseded it as a standard reference. And not only have those volumes been written with the perspectives of recent scholarship, they also got professional editing. One of the frustrations of Collinder's survey is the slapdash style, making it seem like a bunch of lecture notes thrown together.Still, Uralicists could always use Collinder in their library, since every little bit helps, and used copies abound."},{"Title":"Immortality, Resurrection and the Age of the Universe: A Kabbalistic View","review":"This small, well-written book contains a collection of essays on important topics in Judaism by one of the most prolific and profound Orthodox Jewish writers of our century. Aryeh Kaplan was a first-rank scholar who was familiar with all phases of Jewish knowledge, and was also trained in physics. As a result, he was in an almost unique position to comment on issues relating traditional beliefs to modern scientific knowledge. This book covers the following topics: The age of the universe, longevity and immortality, resurrection, stars and angels, and male &amp; female. Kaplan has much of interest to say about these topics, including some truly eye-opening ideas. Included in this book are translations of essays from an early kabbalistic sage, Isaac of Acco, and an important 19th century scholar, Israel Lipshitz on the great antiquity of the earth. The hebrew text of the latter's essay occupies the last 31 pages of this 169 page book published by Ktav Publishing House.The reader will be struck by the novelty of some of the ideas on the above topics as well as the scholarship of the author. I, therefore, strongly recommend it anyone who has an interest in these topics and wishes a better understanding of the possible harmonization of Biblical themes and scientific knowledge."},{"Title":"Immortality, Resurrection and the Age of the Universe: A Kabbalistic View","review":"Kaplan does an excellent job of clarifying this distinction in his marvellously approachable book.This book surprised me (pleasantly) in more than a few ways. Science and Judaism are not diametric opposites, and (despite the ponderous title!) this is a down-to-earth, readable source for exciting traditional Jewish views.In his essay on the age of the universe, Kaplan points out that the insights of Jewish tradition have -- from the very beginning -- NEVER been strictly literalistic ones.Kaplan also touches on the dangers of aligning ourselves with evangelical Protestants and others who would exchange the richness of our midrashic heritage for a simple-minded &quot;God wrote it; I believe it&quot; allegiance to the Biblical text. As serious Jews (or Christians, for that matter), we need not adopt convoluted &quot;creation science&quot; theories or look the other way (&quot;study it because it's on the test, but ignore it the second you step into a synagogue&quot;).We need to embrace evolution, NOT with our fingers crossed, but because it is every conscientious scientist's best guess as to how God got us here in the first place. English is not the BEST language in the world, but we use it because it's the best we have to communicate with each other. Same with evolution. Not perfect by any means, but it's the closest we get to articulating the mysteries we thank God for putting us here to ponder."},{"Title":"Immortality, Resurrection and the Age of the Universe: A Kabbalistic View","review":"Let me say that the rating is primarily based on the brevity of the work considering the price tag usually associated with it. The reader will quickly discover that only half of the book is written by Rabbi Kaplan, the rest by Rabbi Lipschitz. Not that Lipschitz's reading is poor by any means, it just isn't what I paid for. Although I found Rabbi kaplan's work extremely interesting, I found it a bit brief. None of the concepts are taken to any depth and only let the reader hang on many topics. Admittedly the complilers associate the work with a collection of lectures and personal notes but I don't think a person could know until after purchase. The true value of this book lies in its openness to new scientific hypothesis and its position that simply a literal reading of the Bible is faulty. I particularly thought the commentary on how two differing opionions are deemed correct, or at least possible, until proven otherwise was refreshing and would be good advice to at least the Christian community. His brief commentary on the resurrection shed some light in my mind on the general absence of its discussion in the Tanakh. Overall, it's a good book and worthy of discussion but unfortunately a bit shallow."},{"Title":"Immortality, Resurrection and the Age of the Universe: A Kabbalistic View","review":"This is a phenomenal book.

She then tries convincing her friends that she's a private eye, and then a one eyed monster. Her classmates see how fun it is to wear an eye patch and they all decide they want one too.

The problem for Becca is that wearing an eye patch might make her friends think less of her. So she makes up wild stories about why she's wearing an eye patch. Is she a pirate, or a private detective, or a monster? Justina's wonderfully charming story is expertly enhanced with the matching illustrations of Mitch Vane who is able to expressively capture Becca's exuberance and light heartedness during her seeming adversity.

The story was very cute and went well with my daughters love for pink.My only complaint is: I thought the author dropped the ball when it came time for Becca to tell the class why she was wearing a patch. I thought there should be more of an explanation. I was hoping my daughter's teacher would read this to her class so they could understand why she has to wear a patch.

My ideal book about glasses or an eye patch would be a book about a great kid, and the glasses or patch would never be mentioned at all."},{"Title":"The Patch","review":"I love the concept of this story! My issue is the book was a bit mature for my 2 and 3 year old since they don't go to school yet. My 2 year old has strabismus with no vision impairment, she does not need glasses but does wear a patch for 3 hours a day. This book resonated with my 3 year and inspired her to help her baby sister become more enthusiastic about her patch. I did not care for the usage of the word stupid either which is why I gave it 4 stars and not the full 5. We do not condone negative language in our home and I was fairly disappointed to see it used in such a useful learning tool. Luckily my girls do not read and I was able to change the word to silly.

The Zone System Craftbook (paperback) by J.C. Woods is one of the best. Much of the book is relatively elementary in the sense that people who know the zone system will find it light (but still worthwhile) reading - e.g. zones, zone relationships, placing gray tones, moving them, expansion, contraction, contrast, etc., etc.. The discussion of expansion and contraction is particularly picturesque and transparent. People who are learning the system will find very few books that are clearer. Wood's book has a modest number of illustrations, but they are entirely adequate to support the presentation. What this book does very well is cover the subject in extremely practical terms that can be immediately put into practice. Much of the presentation is not technical and it is unencumbered by elaborate details of testing or sensitometry. But, for those who wish to refine their technique, later chapters are devoted to a detailed approach to testing and calibration, with and without the use of a densitometer. The books will be very useful to people who are refining their use of the zone system as well as to folks who elect not to delve into a high level of perfection with technique. All in all, if you are interested in learning about the zone system, this is a book you will be very glad you decided to buy. There are others, of course. The Ansel Adams Guides (books 1 and 2) by John Schaefer are also well-written and really loaded with illustrations and useful information. They are much bigger than the book by Woods. Out of print now but also excellent is Schaefer's earlier (paperback) book, How to Use the Zone System for Black and White Photography."},{"Title":"The Zone System Craftbook: A Comprehensive Guide to the Zonesystem of Exposure and Development","review":"It's the best zone system book that has been written so far. It is interesting and very easy to read. It doesn't get bogged down in useless information that fills up so many other books. It's concise and accurate. If you're serious about photography in the least, it's a required reading. It's a must for anybody who cares about his/her photography, unless you're Ansel Adams."},{"Title":"Talking Horse & Other Tales","review":"I enjoyed this book very much.

With chapter titles like &quot;Do You Validate?,&quot; &quot;Might as Well Face It, You're Addicted to ___________,&quot; and &quot;Catechism Cataclysm,&quot; I was able to laugh at myself and others as we take many wrong turns in our life's journey. The book led me to People, Places, and Things where I and others have looked for and not found God or Spirit or Peace. When I finally arrived at &quot;Where to Find God,&quot; it all seemed so simple, so obvious. Yet so elusive at the same time. It made me remember how important it is to take &quot;time outs&quot; during my hectic days to sit in the silence, rub my cat's belly, take three deep breaths, and know that God is everywhere and God is right here where I am.

For weeks leading up to this event and for days after, all one hears is commentary about the look/dress/action/speech of the scores of gods and goddesses that walked the stage that night. And after the masses of people have picked clean all the Oscar glory there is, they turn to the upcoming baseball season to fulfill that emptiness they feel inside with a good old-fashioned sports god.Are you one of them? Are you LOOKING FOR GOD IN ALL THE WRONG PLACES? Marie D. Jones can help you. According to Jones, \\"...our society can only see God in the pretty, the shiny, and the expensive. But God is everywhere...\\" (p. 57).In LOOKING FOR GOD IN ALL THE WRONG PLACES, Jones enlightens the reader as to where God is really found, despite all the misguided attempts by society to find Him in only \\"the pretty.\\"Marie D. Jones, a New Thought minister as well as a licensed pastoral counselor with a master's degree in metaphysical studies, has given God much thought and study and is well-versed in the subject, which couples quite nicely with her lengthy experience as a writer. Jones has been widely published and is even a screenwriter who has produced a children's storybook series.According to Jones, we as a society spend way too much time looking for God in places we'll never find Him - sports and movie icons, wealth, power, so-called \\"gurus,\\" and co-dependent relationships, just to name a few. Her goal is to help the reader find the real hiding place of God, saying, \\"...you never have to go any farther than your own Higher Power within to find wholeness, abundance, and prosperity in all areas of your life\\" (p. 30).While the subject of the search for God is a weighty one, Jones manages to keep it blithe throughout. LOOKING FOR GOD IN ALL THE WRONG PLACES is light on the dry philosophy stuff and heavy on the jokes, puns, and catch-phraseology. Still, Jones manages to make some good points that somehow worm their way into the subconscious of the reader and while he may think he may have gotten only a few chuckles out of the book, he just may find himself worshipping a little differently after the last page has been turned.At the same time, Jones's jokes occasionally work against her ultimate message, as she pokes fun a little too personally and unintentionally sounds a bit taunting. Thus a sensitive reader might find offense at a statement that contains, \\"... a bunch of spiritually inept yuppies with bad shoes and worse breath...\\" (p. 82) and wonder if derision is working against the tolerance and inner love Jones preaches.Furthermore, Jones uses real life experiences to back up or further explain some of her points of interest. This is a good technique in reaching the reader through having been there/done that just as the reader may have. However, Jones seems to have experienced it all - every trap, every bad habit, every broken hearted experience. Opening up one's weaknesses on paper can be healing and humanizing for a writer, but too much of a humble thing can take away from the message as a reader might wonder just how to trust a messenger who's so easily bent and broken.The overall success of LOOKING FOR GOD IN ALL THE WRONG PLACES is that it's an easily understood and lighter look into spirituality that teaches its readers how to look inward and find God. It's a pleasant read unusual in its belief that you can find God and still have fun looking. If you've been struggling, looking for God in those wrong places, this book would be the right place for you."},{"Title":"Looking for God in All the Wrong Places","review":"Superior book by an author with a real understanding of how to talk to people about spirituality, God, beliefs. I read a lot of books of this nature and have to say this is one of my all-time favorites.

Marie is not one to let the Higher Power be cast aside, but to cast aside the \\"God in a Box\\" view that many prefer to keep him in. There is a difference between spirituality, and religion. Thank you Marie, for showing we can and should speak out, each person is entitled to their own opinion, and that at the very least we can agree to disagree. Accepting oneself and contrasting ideas even when they do not fit into the crowd, and seeing that as a positive place, puts oneself above the crowd, which is where all leaders find themselves to be.Review by Tiffany Snow, author of FORWARD FROM THE MIND - DISTANT HEALING, BILOCATION, MEDICAL INTUITION AND PRAYER IN A QUANTUM WORLD.THE POWER OF DIVINE: A HEALER'S GUIDE - TAPPING INTO THE MIRACLE.PSYCHIC GIFTS IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE - TOOLS TO CONNECT"},{"Title":"Looking for God in All the Wrong Places","review":"So rare is it to read a &quot;religious&quot; book that does not get all religious on you. This book is like an old friend, guiding you wisely and wittily along your spiritual path, helping you to avoid the pitfalls and road blocks and making you laugh out loud, too! If you are looking for God, and want to avoid looking in all the wrong places, then you need this book! Rev. Marie is a God-send!"},{"Title":"Looking for God in All the Wrong Places","review":"I don't go for real preachy spiritual or religious books, so I loved this essay-style book on spirituality, and finding your higher power where it should be found, not in all of the outside things we usually get stuck with - alcoholism, drug abuse, sex, power and greed, especially money worship. Also some very timely stuff about how dangerous worshipping religion and nationalism can be, esp. with the war going on. VERY ENLIGHTENING."},{"Title":"Looking for God in All the Wrong Places","review":"With all the hell going on with the war today, there are some really powerful and timely chapters in this great book I found about nationalism, religious fanaticism, etc... Not preachy stuff, or too bogged down, but will get you thinking and shaking your head up and down in total understanding. I like the flow and pacing of this book, not depressing or difficult like some other spiritual books. Lot of humor and wisdom mixed in with personal stuff author went through. I read it fast the first time, and plan to re-read it again."},{"Title":"Looking for God in All the Wrong Places","review":"As a young spiritual person I appreciated the author's personal experience and use of humor. I am not a boring intellectual who wants to read somebody's doctoral thesis on spirituality. This book is perfect for all ages, but especially for readers who like to laugh even as they are being made to think seriously about a very profound subject. I related to so much of material here, and found myself smiling in recognition many times at behaviors and concepts I myself have engaged in. I really recommend this book to anyone who is trying to simplify their life, and their spirituality, and get back to basics and to the truth, especially in these anxious times of religious confusion, where our government is trying to turn us all into &quot;good little Christian soldiers.&quot;"},{"Title":"Looking for God in All the Wrong Places","review":"With all the war, hatred, religious intolerance, bigotry, gay bashing, right wing crap in the world today, this book is a refreshing and honest look at why we humans fail miserably to be happy, loving people. The author doesn't mince words, and can be downright hilarious at times, but that never detracts from the importance of what she is saying - stop looking for happiness outside of yourself and live and let live!Chapter titles are a hoot, based upon famous songs and phrases...great wordplay and clever use of structure and narrative. This writer rocks, and I will be looking for her next book in all the right places!!!"},{"Title":"Looking for God in All the Wrong Places","review":"I got this book from a friend and thought it was such a great read. The author takes on all of our bull and shoves it back in our face with such grace, humor and personal insight you can't help but smile and say &quot;Yeah, that's me alright!&quot; But she never talks down to you, or offends. Just tells it straight like it is, how we always seem to look for happiness and success in all kinds of stupid outside places, then wonder why we are so hateful, miserable, jealous, overweight, and angry when we get them? I love the balance between spirituality, progressive thought and good, solid helpful advise, and recommend this book to anyone who is sick and tired of religion, politics, celebrities and authority figures that tell us where and how we should look for our happiness - and ALWAYS lead us astray.

It seems a bit on the dry side, but that's besides the point: You are probably not going to pick up a linguistic introduction to narrative for entertainment anyway.The book covers basic story structure (in search of a grammar of plot), time (order, duration, summary and scene - i.e. telling and showing, frequency), character, setting, focalization, free indirect discourse, sociolinguistics and more. You have to keep in mind that the approach here is linguistic.The book does not specifically deal with film narratives - if you want to focus on that, I recommend reading Seymour Chatman's &quot;Story and Discourse&quot; or Bordwell and Thompson's &quot;Film Art: An Introduction&quot;. However, even then, you might find the concepts summarized in this book helpful.On the whole, this is a very useful introduction, though it may be tough going in places. Other books you may find useful are &quot;Narratology - an introduction&quot; and &quot;Narrative Fiction&quot;."},{"Title":"Narrative: A Critical Linguistic Introduction (Interface)","review":"Toolan gives us a complete theoretical toolbox that, indeed, contains some sharp tools with which to analyze literary narratives. It's a good introduction, and as is mentioned early on, it's both linguistic and critical. The critical aspect is the book's strength: the author neatly summarizes past research (ranging quite broadly) and argues within the linguistic field in order to set up his own complex position on each aspect of narratology. The reader leaves with a sense of depth and sophistication - Genette, Bal, Halliday are all given due treatment. In particular, the treatment of Genette is so skillfully done that readers of the French critic may well find themselves reaching, instead, for Toolan in the future."},{"Title":"The Conquest of Acre Fortress","review":"When I was younger, many years ago, I visited and toured Israel. One of my stops was the Acre Fortress. This fortress, which had been built in the 12th Century as an Arab fortress for their defense against the invading Crusaders, in its history of over 800 years had never been breached, and as a result, was used by the British during their occupation of Palestine as a prison.Because of its significant history in the founding of the State of Israel, which included the brutality of the British towards the Jewish freedom fighters, Acre Fortress was turned into a museum by the Israelis after becoming a State. &#34;The Conquest of the Acress Fortress&#34; is the true history of a daring escape by a group of Jewish Freedom Fighters from this impregnable compound, the first successful assault in history. The story of this escape had actually been partially told in the movie &#34;Exodus&#34;, a fictionalized history of the founding of the State of Israel. In the movie, the uncle of the hero, Ari Ben Canaan, (played by Paul Newman), who is a member of the Irgun, the Jewish underground fighting the British to force them to leave Palestine, is captured and condemned to be hanged. Ari's uncle is being held captive in the Acre Fortress waiting for his execution. Ari, who is a member of the Palmach, the peace-loving arm of the Jewish Army, saves his uncle from &#34;dying at the end of a British rope&#34;, by helping perpetrate a daring daylight prison break. This segment of the film, which is quite exciting, lasts about 10 minutes. And with the exception of the idea that the Palmach had anything to do with the escape, is fairly accurate.So back to the book... &#34;The Conquest of Acre Fortress&#34; is the factual history of this escape, along with a great deal of background information. It goes into greater detail about not only the prison break itself, but also goes into the background of the people, members of the Irgun and the Lechi. It also talks about the treatment of Jewish prisoners, who considered themselves as POW's, but who were treated as common criminals, one of whom was Dov Grunner, who was prematurely, and secretly hanged just a few days before the escape, and who became a national hero.&#34;The Conquest of Acre Fortress&#34; describes not only how the escape was planned and successfully conducted, but it also points out how this escape showed to the world that the British did not have control in Palestine, which directly led to the UN vote for Israeli statehood. It is brief, concise and well worth reading. In addition, if read in conjunction with the book &#34;Triumph of the Gallows&#34;, one can get a great sense of what it was like being a Jew in living in Palestine, trying to create a homeland. However, &#34;The Conquest of Acre Fortress&#34; is excellent on its own."},{"Title":"The Unknown Soldiers","review":"First published in the mid 1970's, this has been the only book on the subject for many years. An excellent treatment of the racial climate in America on the eve of the war, and the subsequent actions taken by the Army with America's entry in 1917. It provides a stark picture of the treatment given to African-Americans as they attempted to serve. It provides the reader with brief histories of the 92nd and 93rd Divisions, the two &quot;Colored&quot; divisions in the AEF and also gives a summation of the treatment given the returning troops. It has good footnotes and sources, and this edition has the added bonus of a forward by Bernard C. Nalty. If any criticism can be leveled at this book it would probably be that new scholarship in this field has uncovered more facts and new interpratations. Anyone interested in the American experience in World War one should read this book. It is written so that it is accessable to the scholar and history buff alike."},{"Title":"The Unknown Soldiers","review":"When you think you know everything there is to know about American history in general, and World War I in particular, somebody like Arthur Barbeau and company comes along and educates you as to how ignorant you were. This book is a wonder and, with \\"The Unwept: Black American Soldiers And The Spanish-American War\\" by Edward van Zile Scott, provides a remarkable history of Afro-American soldiers in two wars over a period of twenty years.Barbeau's indignation shines through when he asks the same questions a reader must ask about the injustices Black soldiers were subjected to in America as they prepared to depart for Europe, the indignities they suffered while attempting to fight a war to save democracy once in Europe while denied it in their homeland, and the suffering they experienced in Europe and upon their return to the United States after the war. But Barbeau's indignation is muted, reasonable, logical, and unobtrusive considering the horrors he describes Black troops being subjected to and the slanders against the bravery they displayed in spite of poor equipment, if any;poor training, if any;poor, non-supportive, and/or racist commanders;inadequate support; the institutionalized racism of the military that constantly demeaned them by declaring their inferiority in order to affirm white superiority;and the constant effort to develop Black soldiers as a slave-labor force instead of one prepared for combat. The descriptions of the outrages committed against these soldiers as they prepared to return to America and then after they did arrive \\"home\\" speak volumes about the all-important need to support the concept of white supremacy and enforce that of black inferiority in spite of the well-researched and documented facts Barbeu presents as to the fallacy of each.Barbeau clearly establishes that there was more than one war being waged in Europe regarding the service of Black troops. But his documentation of the service and efforts of those troops in spite of their treatment by their own military can only cause one to marvel at the heights to which racial and national pride urged these brave men forward. The history of Black troops in WWI is known at last thanks to Mr. Barbeau's important contribution to an accurate history of warfare and the people who fight it.Barbeau,et al, suggest that the \\"New Negro\\" of the post-World War I period was a direct outcome of the increased pride and dignity Black soldiers found during their service in Europe and which the French military saluted and honored many times with military awards, even though the US military attempted to discourage that recognition in various ways, including the distribution of a secret communication that attempted to justify discrimination against Afro-Americans by the American military and promote it in the French military and general society.Read this book. Add it to your library. You'll refer to it many times in the future."},{"Title":"Ripe Fruit: Erotica for Well-Seasoned Lovers","review":"This erotica was just ok.

It has charming illustrations in it, as well as a wildly imaginative plot line. The vacuum and the penny illustration was one I remembered very vividly.

For all its faults no other tradition boasts such an array of literary and historical talent. Trevelyan's work makes the reading of English history as pleasurable as devouring a great novel. His interpretation is loose enough to accommodate other schools of thought yet structured enough to provide some order to the vast span of history which his work encompasses. The work stresses the progressive elements at play in the evolution of the English parliamentary system and often fails to weigh the fragile nature of reform as it occurred. There is undoubtedly a sense of inevitability about the process which is somewhat contrived. His scholarship often does fail to give a sense of the role played by the other nations of the British Isles in England's development (or for that matter attempt to reconcile England the nation with Great Britain the state). For all that, however, no other work that I have encountered has the same unity of purpose, analytical mastery and literary finesse that can be found in this volume. For anyone seeking to understand English history from first principles, this volume is the best single introduction to English history. For someone already well versed in English history from all angles, Trevelyan's work provides the bedrock or foundation of any considered defense of the &quot;English Tradition&quot;."},{"Title":"Freedom's Port: The African American Community of Baltimore, 1790-1860 (Blacks in the New World)","review":"This is the best book about free African Americans.These are interesting facts from the book.M*lattoes was a term for biracial people,light skin blacks and brown skin blacks.N*gro was a term for dark skin blacks.M*lattoes married m*lattoes and n*groes married n*groes in Baltimore.Both terms are now derogatory.Reverend Daniel Coker (is biracial) was forced to resign because some of the black delegation did not want Rev.

I was also looking forward to finding out what inspired these guys to write some of the most memorable songs ever. I was dissappointed in both aspects.To be quite frank, this book just isn't long enough. If you've never even heard of Led Zeppelin before its a pretty good start, but it reads like the instructions for operating a VCR.There are a lot of good photographs in the book but the author or editor didn't even bother to put the album cover on the first page of the chapter about each album.If you're really looking for more on the greatest rock band of all time, look somewhere else. Most Zeppelin fans will find this book lacking."},{"Title":"Led Zeppelin: Dazed Confused (","review":"Compared to most other Zep books available this one is extremely lacking in details. Information given about quite a few of the songs in this book can be attained by simply listening to the song lyrics. Some of Led Zeppelin's songs have been very well documented through the years, and that info is included in this book. But if your looking for the meaning behind more obscure song (ones that everyone and their dog already know the meaning behind) don't look here.

If your just starting to get into Zeppelin, and know practicaly nothing about the band this book has basic info that you can use."},{"Title":"Led Zeppelin: Dazed Confused (","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. First, it doesn't contain much new information - the stories behind the songs are pretty general, and not interviews of Led Zeppelin. Secondly, the author says negative stuff about the music. For example: &quot;There never was a real ending to 'Whole Lotta Love' and maybe it should have finished a chorus earlier than the final fade-out.&quot; Then on &quot;Hey Hey What Can I Do&quot; he says &quot;It fades out in some chaos, which might suggest it was a trial run for a song weeded out of the final album-selection process&quot;.

It also examines other subjects such as controversial interventions for ADHD, trauma and autism. The book will spark a great deal of argument and some outrage, since there are a lot of oxen and sacred cows being gored therein. But it is long past time that the yawning chasm between science and clinical practice was addressed, and this volume does an admirable job. I recommend this book to all thoughtful clinicans, as well as general readers with an interest in clinical psychology."},{"Title":"Science and Pseudoscience in Clinical Psychology","review":"As a psychologist who is aware of some of the questionable research and clinical practices in psychology I read this book with interest. Many of the chapters were interesting and the criticisms valid. I was disappointed, however, that a book that claims to debunk pseudoscience seemed to have a major blindspot. For example Waschbusch and Hill's chapter examines treatments for ADHD without reference to the controversy that exists about the validity of ADHD as a neurobiological syndrome. There is debate about the unscientific manner in which groups of nonspecifc behaviours are named as syndromes, in the absence of any physical evidence. Discussing treatments for these \\"disorders\\" without mentioning this at all seems a glaring oversight in a book that devotes so much attention to issues of diagnosis and assessment and claims to expose pseudosicence. It hardly takes courage or insight to criticise the fringe elements, but what about blatant pseudoscientific practices carried out by mainstream psychologists?"},{"Title":"Science and Pseudoscience in Clinical Psychology","review":"Although largely aware of the plethora of pseudoscientific nonsence that besets the field of mental health, it is very refreshing to have this collation of information brought together in one volume. As a clinical psycholgist I am confronted daily by people who have been referred to purveyors of unscientific, and often damaging, \\"interventions\\". All too frequently, these people have been referred to such snake-oil sellers by mental health professionals - psychologists, psychaitrists, medical doctors etc. This book, and hopefully further editions of it, should be compulsory reading for everyone seeking to work in the mental health and forensic fields. Only by truly embracing scientific methodology and an unremitting scepticism can we hope to move forward in understanding mental health and criminal problems.

This book has confimed my long-standing fears as a graduate student: That there is much non-science in the field of psych and the profession is openly hostile to those that say so, while at the same time donning the semantically garb of &quot;scientist&quot;. The truth is there is very little science in psych these days, and it is psychology's &quot;dirty little secret&quot;."},{"Title":"Science and Pseudoscience in Clinical Psychology","review":"In the preface, the editors noted that this book will make a lot of people angry, especially proponents of the therapies being critiqued in this book. While this is undoubtedly true for many such proponents, I think it would be a serious mistake for such people to dismiss what is being said in this book. I am one of the top practitioners of Thought Field Therapy and found this book to be of tremendous value and feel gratitude, not anger towards its authors. Having explored many of the controversial, new therapies, I know better than anyone the pitfalls and hazards of drifting into pseudoscience and quite frankly, have repeatedly been dismayed at what I have seen in terms of a complete inability to engage in critical thinking on the part of many people involved in the endless array of &quot;alternative&quot; therapies. Much of the problem, I believe, comes from ignorance of the principles outlined in this book. The list of features of pseudosciences is especially helpful and should be read and carefully considered by all proponents of unconventional approaches. In this way, as Carl Sagan puts it, &quot;deep truths can be winnowed from deep nonsense&quot;.

I recommend it highly to my clinical psychology graduate students, but I think it is also valuable for practicing clinicians and for other people who are interested in the specific topics covered, including recovered memory therapy, autism treatment, ADHD, new age therapies, multiple personality disorder (aka dissociative identity disorder), trauma treatment, herbal antidepressants, and - one of my favorite chapters - substance abuse recovery."},{"Title":"Science and Pseudoscience in Clinical Psychology","review":"Having just finished this book, and based on some of the reader reviews Ive seen here, I feel the need to inject this little comment. This book is a wonderful, long-teaching essay in the practice and importance of critical thinking. This book is NOT a \\"debunking\\" of the need for treatment of several widely diagnosed diseases, discussed in the book (ADHD,Autism or addiction/substance abuse) or a denial of the need for effective treatments for these diorders. The widespread misapplication or non application of sound practice in diagnoses, and treatments of arguably questionable effectivenss are the targets of Lilienfelds critical thinking.Many people who read this book should first become familliar with the \\"10 commandments\\" of critical thinking that Lillienfeld begins his courses with.[...]"},{"Title":"Science and Pseudoscience in Clinical Psychology","review":"Lilienfield does a bang-up job debunking some of the long-held myths in Clinical Psychology. Don't allow that to lead you to conclusion that this book is about bashing the Science of Psychology, however! Clinical Psychology is something quite different from the evidence-based side of the field, and this book illustrated that it is infested with more pseudo-science than science. That's partly because such a large percentage of the public has no critical thinking skills, and cannot see the difference between self-help nonsense and real science. Lilienfield does a good job helping us start on the road toward discerning the snake oil from the medicine.It's almost laughable that one reviewer showers this book with accolades while also touting herself as a top expert in yet another pseudo-scientific \\"therapy,\\" Thought Field Therapy. Lilienfield et al. actually cover that idiocy in this marvelous book, pointing out that there's no such thing as \\"thought fields,\\" and no validity to the notion that TFT has any effect on mental or physical health!

Lorenzo Snow was the fifth president of the Church of Jesus Christ, and was a spiritual titan. He had great testimony of God, and a keen insight into humanities eternal potential. But I think that his most endearing quality is his face. He ahs a holy face that has been worn and wrinkles as he wore out and wrinkled his life in the service of God.His biographer was his sister Eliza Snow, who deserves-and has-several biographies of her own. She was poet by temperament and talent, so the prose flows. Moreover, she has great sisterly insight into the work and osul of the man who was a prophet and also her brother.This classic volume covers Lorenzo Snows exciting life, from his first contact with Joseph smith in Kirtland, OH, his journey with the saints across the plains, and to his missionary labors in England and Italy. There is considerable attention paid to Snow's work with the United Order in Brigham City.I have no complaints, and only praise for this book.

None of the four individuals particularly want to go on this holiday, but they feel obligated to because both couples realise that it might be the last one that they have together. Both couples are struggling to deal with illness. A middle-aged Belgian couple named Annemieke and Jan go on this holiday with the knowledge that Jan is suffering from a terminal cancer. The older English couple named George and Dorothy realise that Dorothy is in the beginning stages of Alzheimer's disease. Despite the depressing idea of couples going on a final holiday while facing their own mortality may seem terribly depressing, Dean is able to suffuse the narrative with comic touches that gives it a great deal of humanity and makes it a rewarding, moving read.This thirty-four year old writer has unusual insight into the complex way a long term marriage can develop a significance beyond the mere routines which come with the bonding of two people. In some ways the individual identity of each person becomes lost because the memories from each of their lives are inextricably linked to this other person. What the characters in this novel are struggling to decide is if they will lose their own sense of themselves if they leave their partner. George tries to meticulously record his past by writing a memoir and Annemieke attempts to completely rediscover a self worth in anonymous sexual encounters. Dean's writing is incredibly enjoyable to read in its richly detailed short chapters and startlingly emotional scenes. At the same time it is able to explore some very complex ideas about the nature of relationships and personality in original, meaningful ways. This is a unique and beautiful first novel."},{"Title":"Becoming Strangers","review":"Against a lush Caribbean landscape, two couples on vacation meet and act out the small dramas of their marriages in a careful study of relationships honed on habit and unhappiness. But in this tropical paradise, an elegant resort that caters to its guests' every whim, both couples will come to terms with the realities of their choices. Jan DeGroot is dying of cancer, although he has gamely fought its determined advance for the last six years: \\"The knife-and-forking of his body seemed to give a perverse impetus to his will to survive.\\" This Northern European couple has been sent on their \\"last holiday\\" by their grown sons, Annemieke DeGroot long trapped in her own discontent, almost anxious to get on with the rest of her life, her beauty fading while she waits for Jan's demise. In contrast, George and Dorothy, an English couple, have been married nearly sixty years, their habits entrenched with the daily bickering over nonsense that has become familiar.George makes friends with Jan, though Dorothy and Annemieke could hardly be less compatible. Yet the heightened awareness of distance brings a flavor of friendship, at least for the men, who surprisingly find a sympathetic ear as they exchange stories and disappointments, lingering over drinks. While Dorothy drifts along in her own musings, George's complaints turn to a more honest appraisal of their shared years: \\"You couldn't tell him that there was any marriage that wasn't equal measure love and hate.\\" Even Dorothy enjoys occasional insights, although she'd rather be at home amid her things: \\"Being an old lady was not as hard as being an old man.\\" With a supporting cast of other resort-goers, a South African with a penchant for honesty who has a short fling with Annemieke, a long-haired, tattooed tile-setter, \\"the Americans\\" who demand their needs be instantly attended and the resort director, Jan and George sort through memories and plans for the future, limited though it may be, while Annemieke thrashes about in an effort to avoid her own shortcomings.The characters are drawn with deft precision, their flaws and eccentricities stark against the lush background of the Caribbean resort. Each couple suffers the detritus of years of marriage, the petty rivalries and jealousies, silences and resentments. The author writes with such clarity that each page bespeaks a glance into a mirror, these protagonists as familiar as the spouse who snores when sleeping or habitually remarks on the other's failures, days of meant-to-do-better, years finally passed. In a novel that is neither maudlin nor depressing, the author carefully manipulates the myriad contradictions of each marriage with a compassionate eye and a talent for incisive observation, balancing flaws, fictions and attributes in an incisive characters study.

We have great expectations and sometimes those expectations don't match up with the reality. In Louise Dean's new book she writes \\"holidays are an agreeable palliative for an ailment mankind barely knows how to complain about: the life we have made\\".Jan and Annemieke are from Belgium and have been given a Caribbean 'last holiday' by their two sons. Jan has cancer and has been told that there is nothing more to be done. His wife, has come along to look for a really good time. This is a couple whose marriage has come apart. Annemieke is tired of waiting for Jan to die. While Jan wants to take a car an explore the island, Annemieke is is restless and spots a man that looks interesting. She initiates sex with a complete stranger, Bill Molloy, who by the end of the novel may be looked at as 'one of the good guys'.At the same time, an elderly couple, George and Dorothy from England have been given the gift of a vacation by their family.These two people turn out to be the kind of folks you would want to meet at any time. George is outgoing and friendly, his wife Dorothy, we find is in the beginning stages of dementia, probably due to Alzheimers. Jan and George strike up a grand friendshipo and Dorothy comes along for the ride.There are several other people who bring their personalities to the novel, one a rich American couple who are the complete package of the hateful, rich, conspicuous Americans. Annemieke gravitates toward this group, and she finds that her aging body is not looked upon as kindly as the others. She is ignored at times and uses Jan's upcoming death as a means of sympathy. Annemieke looks for sex whereever she can find it, and it seems this has been her manner throughtout the marriage. Jan in the meantime reads, takes his morphine pills, and spends his time with George and Bil Molloy.Louise Dean has given us a a book that is completely real. The rich characters are so fully formed. We come to know them and accept them. The writing is so superb that you are tempted to go back to the beginning to start again. I will most certainoy read her other novels. It is rare to find a writer, like Louise Dean, who grabs you with the first words from a new novel.Highly Recommended. prisrob 01-29-12The Old RomanticThis Human Season"},{"Title":"Becoming Strangers","review":"I have read other books by Louise Dean and so was tempted to try this one. Very engrossing. The plot line concerns two couples, middle aged at least, one British and one Belgian, who don't know each other but meet at a luxury vacation spot in the Caribbean. (For both couples the trip is a gift from their adult children). The main character, Jan, is dying of cancer, and this is supposed to be his last big vacation but the long-term strains in his marriage keep bubbling up. The other couple, older, also have deep issues. In the hothouse environment of a resort spa, others are pulled into this dance, each with their own baggage. I found it to be quite engrossing and recommend it (even though the ending fizzled a bit from my point of view). Come on, Ms. Dean, give us a more powerful ending!!"},{"Title":"Becoming Strangers","review":"Dean places her disparate characters in situations where they can choose between generosity or selfishness, honesty or deceit. Along the way nearly all them, in spite of their weaknesses and limitations (and although they often appear ridiculous) choose to give of themselves, in some way, to their fellows--they are full of surprises. Dean portrays the exceptions (the venture capitalists and their hangers-on, including the selfish, self-absorbed, self-pitying Annemieke) with devastating acuity. The scenes contrasting the picnic on the beach with the outing on the yacht are wonderful."},{"Title":"Becoming Strangers","review":"Had to wonder if the author was German or Danish, because the writing style is awkward and thought the novel was a translation or maybe she was knackered when pounding away on the machine with an extreme overuse of the thesaurus. In disbelief that the author hails from the UK.If the book was cleaned up a bit, it would be much better. The social issues dealing with death, difficulties of marriage, loss of youth, alzheimers etc. are important and should be applauded for highlighting what most people find not worth discussing/delving into at length."},{"Title":"Becoming Strangers","review":"Thankfully I only spent $5 on this and little time. This is just one of the worst books I have read in a while. The characters are not developed, the story is slow and mundane, and I dislike how the English (the author lives in London) structures and organizes the written language - it just seems odd. The English phrases are just 'off' to me. There are spelling disparities and punctuation issues too. As someone else said, it almost seems as though some things were 'lost in translation'. I also was not surprised to see one of the five 5 star reviews was from someone in London. Bottom line is, there are just too many good books out there to waste time on this one..."},{"Title":"Becoming Strangers","review":"Louise Dean's first novel is an uneven reading experience. Much of the text is involved in character study rather than telling a story; so the reader trudges through the novel. Of the two main couples, George & Dorothy are older. Dorothy is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and is gradually fading into darkness. She wanders away from the Caribbean resort where they are vacationing, which results in a half-hearted search for her. George meanwhile decides to write the memoir of his life, which entails how to build a refrigeration room for food businesses. The other couple is Annemieke and Jan. Annemieke is a rather cold woman who has suffered through a loveless marriage and now can't wait for her liberation. She has several affairs. The second is discovered with a resort employee Adam, who she then accuses of rape. Husband Jan suffers from cancer and will apparently soon die. All four of the main characters are depressing.Bill Maloney is the most interesting character in the book. He's a minor, supporting character. Bill has casual sex with Annemieke as the book starts. He doesn't know she's married at that point. Bill is a Christian and has a moral code, although he also is comfortable knowing that he's a sinner who will seek forgiveness. His anguish over his affair and the impact it could have on Adam's rape charge is one of the better parts of the book.Perhaps the best chapter is when Annemieke is summoned to the hotel operator Burns' office and has to confront her husband with the rape details and determine whether to press charges. Jan doesn't believe her. Jan appears attracted to a woman named Laurie, but is too sick to try to find love. After these little tragedies, the novel sputters to an end as the couples fly home, work out their relationships, and go on individual holidays. While Dean's storytelling ability is good, her subject matter and characters did not connect with me. Taxi!"},{"Title":"Becoming Strangers","review":"I'm giving this book a generous rating of 2 stars because I did read it at one sitting. But I read it at one sitting because I saw a lot of potential to discuss the issues at hand - the examination of your motivations, relationships, wasted opportunities, etc. when you're coming to the end of life's road.

The contents, in short portray two rays: a) major faiths that have Asian-Indian colors; and b) experiences of people, in their struggle, pains, labor, success (example, IT boomers, technology exporters, or Indian teachers, p. 52) and failure (human smuggling, the picture of an illegal immigrant in American jail on p. 86).The weakness of the book is it tries to cover too much in a small space, about an immigrant population that is the second largest in the continent. In this sense it is a research work, but useful to a school student. It cannot be taken as a reference work for advanced study.History and historiography needs facts and figures, which can be corroborated, NOT by way of gossip. An issue relates to few textual / contextual matters. For instance, a picture carries a note of the burnt train that led to the Gujarat riots of 2002, and the note states the train was bombed by a mob (p. 29). A word about the bombing is pertinent. No worthy source has used the word \`bombed,' in reporting this riot. There are theories of burning the train from inside, or from outside, NONE says about bombing. This subject is sub-judicial as of this date, and interests all human watchers.In trying to be neutral, the book however does not highlight the neutral contributors in the North American Mosaic. Many secular and democratic efforts, by educated and enlightened Indians, continue to contribute their might in making the ends meet. The utility of the book would have been enhanced, if it had separate chapters on US and Canadian narratives-because the twain are not identical in many respects, such as, laws, opportunities, treatment towards Multifaith multicultural and multilingual communities, etc. A socio-pysco-lignuist, searching in this book for accent, acculturation, adaptability, and so on, will have to look elsewhere. Vegetarians will be happy to find some food for thought, but Halal foods for Muslims, and Jhatka food for Sikhs is absent. Further, in this book, Canada gets less than 20% coverage. And in cataloging Canadian contributions, missing content includes first, Haroon Siddiqi (the award winning journalist, editor Emiratus Toronto Star); second, Rohinton Mistry is a writer who makes up a part of the Indian diasporaA misnomer is the title, per se. In America, Indians are natives who are the real Americans (or call them local inhabitants of the continent), and NOT immigrants. The title of the book could be Asian Indians, Immigrants from India-to be precise and communicative-a title not just for publicity stunt.As a Fulbrighter, and who has worked in identifying bridges across Indo-American cultures for over a decade, my book, Indian Contribution to American Studies (co-author: Dr. Mohammed Burhanuddin. Delhi: Anmol, 1997), has much more to offer in understanding how Indians--even if these Indians do not land in America-are, nevertheless, contributors to the glory that is and the grandeur that is emerging in the West.Furthermore, Amazon.com offers an excellent opportunity to compile bibliographies.

How to retain this with the strategic realpolitik of global cold war leadership was a difficult balancing act, especially when many Free World followers were pointedly illiberal. And especially so in the Truman years, with the victory over fascism still uppermost in global consciousness. It was a circle never truly squared in American policy until the Civil Rights Act, and not fully even then. Just as looking the other way at Southern racial practice was necessary for a Democratic win in 1948, so would avoidance of the reactionary trends of foreign allies become strategically necessary for Harry Truman's global cold war alliance.Professor Borstelmann did an excellent job presenting this dichotomy, one of the few studies to openly outline what everyone in high places always uneasily knew about the US/South Africa relationship but didn't care to confront. Better to have a sound present ally in the current struggle, the State Department reasoned, than a potential one 50 years hence, whose mind was anyway more attuned to \\"radical\\" equality than the Soviet threat. The material basis for this alliance was uranium, without which the Free World's military ascendance over totalitarianism was impossible. If that meant compromising principles, well - hadn't these been compromised by a realpolitik alliance with Stalin against Hitler? So what was wrong with doing business with Malan against Stalin?But this \\"necessity\\" did not set well with the non-white majority of South Africa, looking suspiciously like an \\"African Munich.\\" Freedom and anti-communism became opposites, not partners, giving rise to the very revolutionary subversion Afrikaaners and Americans most feared and the strong Communist presence still felt in South Africa. \\"We have every cause to be grateful to the Communists for their active interest . . . and constant denunciation,\\" wrote one African in 1953 [p. 203]. America's \\"difficult middle course\\" was rather made easier by its sense of privilege, quickly perceiving beams in the eyes of \\"distant communist regimes,\\" writes Borstelmann on p. 202, \\"than to feel a mote in their own eye\\" on their side of the Curtain."},{"Title":"Goodnight Kiss 2 (Fear Street Super Chillers, No. 10)","review":"I liked this book because there were not a lot of pages but it felt like the book went on forever.

Neighbors Vincent and Karen Giordano are taking visiting family out so they ask Keith to baby-sit their eight year old daughter Amy, which he agrees to do. These are normal events in a quiet suburban setting.However, the next morning Eric learns that Amy is missing. The police suspect Keith of foul play. Eric and Meredith insist their son is a good kid and would never harm Amy yet deep down in his gut he at least agrees with the prevailing community opinion that Keith committed an atrocity especially as the days pass, the posters fade, and his son seems different. Eric ponders DNA as his father left the family nearly bankrupt; his brother is an alcoholic; his sister is dead from a brain tumor; and finally his mother is suicidal. He begins to look deeper at Meredith wondering if her tree augments the worst from his with the culmination being they raised a teen killer.RED LEAVES is more of a family drama than a typical thriller as the audience observes the emotional deterioration of Eric over the course of the story line. While readers will wonder what happened to Amy, Eric's darkening look at his family members make the tale as his shell of middle class trust in what he loves erodes away with every gloomy thought he makes. Thomas H. Cook writes a deep dark tale with a finale that will stun readers as behind every so called perfect family lies hidden skeletons that can consume those concealing the truth from themselves and others.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"Eric Moore has a good life with a prosperous business and stable family - until a neighbor's child goes missing when his teen son baby-sits her.

However, I know that some felt that it was flat or the characters were not fully developed. I thought it was so visual that it cried out to be made into a movie.

If you are looking for an excellent poolside book, check it out."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"\\"Red Leaves\\" written by Thomas H. Cook was a 2006 winner of the \\"Barry Award\\" for best novel. This novel is in the \\"Suspense/Thriller\\" genre and \\"Psychological Drama\\" sub-genre. Also by Mr. Cook see \\"The Quest for Anna Klein\\" (see my review for this novel).The story deals with the complex emotional and psychological underpinnings of three families whose fates are tied to certain tragic events. The story is told in the first person by one of the main characters in the tale. Typical of Mr. Cook's writing style, the prose is rich and complex metaphorically. The language easily and naturally coaxes the reader onward; drawing him silently into the drama as a participant to the events that unfold.The story is told by one Eric Moore as he grapples with events that indentify him as a son, a father, a brother and a husband. Eric, now a grown man, is forced to relive episodes of his youth and examine what he thought he knew about his relationship with his father and brother in view of the tragic deaths of his mother and sister. With his current family, Eric must face the growing chasm that grows between him, his son and wife when Eric's son Keith is accused of committing a crime and Eric suspects his wife Meredith of cheating on him. Finally, Eric must deal with his neighbor, Vince Giordano, a once friend who alienates Eric with his hatred; a result of his eight year old daughter, Amy, gone missing after having been left in the care of Eric's son Keith. A pivotal point in the narrative occurs when Eric is forced to examine what he knows and doesn't know about the people in his life and hence becomes fraught with the fear and realization that \\"I'm not sure you ever know anyone\\". The tale is steeped in tragedy, born from misunderstanding and desperation, to its final numbing conclusion.This work by Cook represents one of the most thoroughly captivating psychological dramas in this genre. A tribute expressed by the award for the \\"best novel\\". It is a look at our human relationships and our capacity to examine those relationships within the confines of our experience. It examines how vulnerable we are to misinterpretations of motive and purpose and the alienation that can occur between, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, and fathers and sons as a result. It also lets us speculate on the chaos of life to the extent that when we think we have achieved redemption for our mistakes, we can be struck yet again with a tragedy.I highly recommend this novel.Some analysis of reader's comments:A good many readers were upset with various aspects of Cook's plot in the Novel \`Red Leaves'. Having read the comments I offer some perspective on such views. The first thing I would point out is that one of Cook's objectives was to put the reader in exactly the same position as the character Eric Moore in the story; namely that he based what he thought he knew about things almost entirely upon his assumptions of what seemed to be true. The revelation for Eric Moore, of course, is that the impressions that formed what he thought were truths began to look less true and more like falsehoods. So, Cook takes the character of Keith Moore, for instance, and plants the seeds of who he is in such a way that the reader will draw impressions of him that invariably will be false. This is no better done than in the circumstances surrounding the abduction of Amy Giordano. Cook deliberately leaves out details to trap the reader. Some complained that the Giordano's did not \\"look in\\" on Amy when they returned home. However, that detail is never determined from the story. Vince Giordano asks if Keith left the house while he was there with Amy. This single question plants the seed that Amy was abducted before Keith left and the Giordano's returned home. However Vince also asks what time Keith arrived home! Vince's motivation for asking the questions is to eliminate the possibility of another suspect; ostensibly, someone else could have entered the house and observed Amy asleep there alone to return later and kidnap her or Keith could have done so before the Giordano's returned home. The ingenuity of Cook in posing Vince's questions, however, is to lure the reader to assume that if Keith left the house then Amy was abducted while he was gone and if Keith didn't leave the house, then Amy was abducted while he was still there and in any case Amy was gone before the Giordano's returned home - all assumptions false. The key was Vince's last question of when Keith arrived home. That question would have established that Amy was probably abducted after the Giordano's arrived home since it confirmed Keith as a suspect in Vince's mind because if Keith had returned home at around 10pm then Amy would have still been there and Keith could not have been a suspect.In the case of who gave Keith Moore a ride home the night Amy is abducted, Eric Moore provides the answer. When Eric learns of the relationship between his son and Delmot Price, the town florist and one of Eric's customers and Eric learns that Keith spoke to Delmot that night, he reflects upon the car he observed turning around at the end of the driveway when Keith came home. Again, the seeds of doubt are planted when Eric asks detective Peak if Keith and Delmot were together that night and Peak asks why Eric thinks they were together. The answer of course is because Eric believes Delmot gave Keith a ride home only Eric can't tell Peak that since he withheld that knowledge to begin with.Polly turns out to be Keith's girl friend. She is from the \\"other side of town\\" near the water tower and according to Keith has a hard life. Here again Cook artfully plants the seeds of false knowledge. The water tower is where Amy's pajamas are found and where Eric observes some untoward deviant behavior. Keith, however, never visits the water tower or it seems does Polly.Finally, remember that the character of Keith, Eric's son is seen almost entirely through Eric's eyes which are tainted by his inability to see through the falsehood of things he thinks are truths. So we get a picture of Keith Moore that is skewed to the likeness that Eric begins to realize is generated from Eric's innate dislike for his son. As more is revealed to the reader about Keith, the more the reader comes to see the fallacy of Eric's plight in understanding himself and his son and that Keith is not at all what his father thinks he is. So the reader is given Eric's description of Keith that is riddled with false description."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It does a terrific job of showing the full range of emotions that a family goes through when faced with an unimaginable crisis. The book is well written, and I plan to look at the other books by this author. Money well spent!"},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"When I started the book, i first saw that his prose was great. His style is very engaging. It did seem to be a little slow, and a little too dark for me. But i wanted to find out what was going to happen.this is one of the best books i have read in a very long time.My only gripe is that it is too sad, too pessimistic."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"I definitely DISAGREE with the reviewers who have decided to put spoilers of this book on a review page (where people have not read book), especially when the things they are saying are simply not true. They are making assumptions and that's a shame, because this book is the best book I've read this year (and in a long while - and I read a book a week).Red Leaves is gripping from the opening pages and continues to rip at your heartstrings throughout. Cook has presented a family here, very modern in their interactions (or lack of), and we see scene after scene of writing that is both haunting and beautiful at the same time. This is a crime story, but more importantly, it is about the human condition. I found the characters to be very likeable, but more importantly, I found them to be REAL. That's huge in this book. The writing is also both crisp (like red leaves) and conversational, and you should be able to rip through these pages in a few days at most. The ending was very satisfying as I was afraid that it wouldn't live up to the first 2/3 of the book. I also found that it left a little bit of mystery of some of the pieces of the puzzle.All in all, an awesome book. This is my first Thomas C. Cook, so I cannot compare it to other writings of his. All I can say, is that I will definitely read more."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"Eric is a common citizen with common dreams who owns a common framing business. But he struggles with memories of a broken childhood and suffering that he tries to silence with his common life. His son, Keith, is about as normal as any fifteen-year-old boy can be. That is, he is quiet, withdrawn and insecure.However, these common lives are thrust into chaotic disarray when Keith agrees to babysit the neighbor's daughter, Amy, only to find the next morning that she has vanished. Suddenly, the quiet, withdrawn and insecure teenager no longer seems as normal as he once was in the eyes of a small town as they begin to look upon him with growing suspicion. Fighting this same impulse, along with the skeletons of his childhood, is Eric, who now questions whether he ever knew his son personally or knew him only as an acquaintance. As an entire community searches for the missing girl, Eric searches for the truth, the truth about himself, his family, and -most importantly- his son.What can you say about Thomas Cook? There are talented writers, those who can keep your attention and interest enough to continue turning pages. And then there is another class, a step above the talented. There are those who write like a genius painter, where even the most nonchalant brush strokes become a masterpiece. In my opinion, Thomas Cook fits that category. This is the first novel of his that I have read, and it won't be the last. He has a way with words that I -as a writer- can only dream of having. Like anyone at the top of his field, his ability seems effortless. With just a few of his brush strokes, he can conjure an image in the reader's mind that only a photograph could duplicate. He describes expression and emotion that we have all experienced, but could never accurately detail. He is a novelist whose work should be on the shelf of anyone who enjoys fiction; if not for the story that he tells, then simply for the pleasure of reading his work. Red Leaves is a winner in every sense of the word.Reviewed in behalf of MyShelf.com"},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"Thomas H. Cook is a star in the psychological suspense firmament. He writes so compellingly about families, relationships, and sadness!I honestly don't know if I can handle any more of his books, even though this is my third or fourth of his. Every story I've read of his so far concerns a tragic event that destroys a marriage, a family, or a community. Nothing can ever be the same; and any characters who survive the wake of the tragedy are much, much sadder (and maybe wiser). Go into Red Leaves very carefully--it's a downer.Eric Moore is our storyteller, and his teenage son is suspected in the disappearance of an 8-year-old neighborhood girl. In the course of this perfectly paced story, we meet Eric's wife, son, brother, and a scattering of other players in this tragedy. Who could have taken this girl? Even though the missing girl is not their daughter, why are Eric's wife and son acting so differently?Cook carefully steers us to a shattering conclusion, and he does it with grace and skill. He is a very talented writer; and even though we know this story can't end happily, we are so firmly enthralled by the characters and writing that we must see this tale to its wrenching conclusion."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"Nothing is ever as it seems, security is a slender thread broken when we first realize it doesn't really exist, and as Thomas H. Cook says in Red Leaves, \\"Family photos always lie.\\"Eric Moore is satisfied with his life, has nestled into the comfortable sameness of each day. So when his son Keith baby sits for eight-year-old Amy Giordano and she disappears, Eric's watches, stunned, as his life spirals out of control and smashes headlong into the reality of his present and his past.As suspicion of Keith's involvement in Amy's disappearance grows, Eric and his wife Meredith continue to publicly support and believe in his innocence. Silently they are filled with a growing suspicion that their only child might have been involved.Eric's suspicion leads him back to his own dysfunctional family where his father took them from considerable wealth that included private schools, to near bankruptcy, his mother committed suicide, his sister died of a brain tumor and his brother is a near-do-well alcoholic whose shocking addictions are just now coming to light.The ending is unexpected but satisfying. Red Leaves is one man's determination to hold onto a fragile world of what he knows and what is his. It's a story that will leave you asking yourself, do you really ever know anyone, even yourself?I am a fan of Thomas H. Cook. His prose is direct and sparse with just the right amount of description; no more, no less. It contributes to a grand crime read."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"One minute Eric Moore's family enjoys a peaceful, well-ordered life; then a tragic event changes everything, the facade of happiness ripped away, exposing cracks and fissures that have been there all along. Then Eric's son, Keith, babysits an eight-year old girl, Amy Giordano, and the world as they know it changes overnight. The following morning, Amy is missing, her father is convinced that Keith knows what happened to his daughter.Eric has lived a complacent life, at least as an adult, closed off from the memories of his mother's death, when her car plunged from a bridge, the cancer that stole his beautiful sister and the general disharmony of his family of origin. His new family, wife Meredith and son Keith, is vastly different, with a lovely home, satisfying work and a teenaged son beset only with the demons of adolescence. Eric's life is surrounded by a sort of determined sturdiness, like his brick barbeque or his house, built to survive the elements, like \\"bacon and brewing coffee, odors that mark a family man as sure as perfume betrays a bounder\\".Amy's disappearance exposes them all, as Eric doubts his son's veracity, fearful that Keith is hiding terrible secrets beyond the usual teenaged angst. \\"In life, it is not what we see but what we choose to be blind to that sustains us.\\" Suspicion corrodes everything it touches, Eric and Meredith's relationship with their son, with each other, the town's innocence and gradual mistrust of a shy fifteen-year old boy, Eric's fear of what lies in Keith's hidden thoughts. The mystery of the child's whereabouts sets off a chain reaction that affects anyone who saw her that last day, especially Keith. Finally, Eric's suspicion \\"turns into a raging affliction\\" and he wants answers to everything, his father's cryptic remarks, his mother's untimely death, Keith's secretiveness, Meredith's judging, all of it.Cook eviscerates complacency in any form, especially the well-lived life suddenly infected with the seed of doubt, the ugly eye of suspicion cast randomly, searching for some place to land. This distrust eats away the family connections once smoothly aligned, now jagged and distorted, ill-fitted. Meredith grows more volatile, Keith more defiant, the town's facade altered by the loss of an eight-year old girl. The author handles a sensitive topic with fearless attention to detail, the small moments and misjudgments, careless conclusions and dangerous assumptions. The ending is heartbreaking, appropriate to the kind of turmoil unleashed in this story. In an age when everything moves too fast and the answers are too readily at hand, this author spins a cautionary tale that is poignant and profoundly disturbing. Luan Gaines/2005."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"I too was extremely bothered by the plot hole that Mr, Baker pointed out: how could neither parent check on their daughter when they got home that night? Thomas H. Cook is one of my favorite writers, so I thought for sure he would provide an explanation or at least acknowledge the parent's oversight or maybe suggest that a pillow was placed in the girl's bed to fool them or SOMETHING! So, yeah, this was a real flaw in the storyline... well, maybe one of two: the detectives were really unbelievably stupid not to \\"sniff\\" around for another possible suspect. That said, I can only deduct one star for an otherwise riveting read. Cook's books generally transcend the mystery genre, and like so many of his others, \\"Red Leaves\\" is mostly about the characters and that's what held my interest."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"I flew through this book. This was my first time reading a Thomas Cook book, but definitely not my last. I started it one night thinking I'd just read a couple chapters till I fell asleep, but ended up reading half the book!Eric Moore has a good, quiet life. He owns his own photo shop, his wife Meredeth works at the college, and his son Keith is a typical teenage boy who keeps to himself. But then Keith babysits little Amy Giordano one night, and the next morning it's discovered that she's missing. With Keith supposidly being the last one to see her, all suspicions fall on him.Eric and Meredeth are then faced with quite the dilemma. While they want to believe their son is innocent of any wrong-doing, they (especially Eric) can't help but doubt their son's story. How well do they really know their son? He spends all of his time locked up in his room, and seems to have no friends to speak of. And on top of it, he appears to be hiding something about the night Amy disappeared. As Eric's suspicions grow, he begins to doubt other things he thought he was sure of...like the stability of his marriage, and what really happened surrounding his own mothers death, and how well does he really know his brother Warren, who was always the misfit of his family growing up.I only had a couple issues with this book. One was Eric's inability to be a parent to his son. It just made me so mad sometimes. Why didn't they barge into his room and demand to know what exactly he did in there? I couldn't believe they would continually just allow him to crack open the door, and not let them into his room...it's their house! Also, why didn't Eric call him out as soon as he knew his son was lying about how he got home that night? Why wait 2 weeks to bring it up? And that question was never answered! Who did bring Eric home? And why wasn't it explained since it was such a big discrepancy in Keith's story?But overall, I will say I was satisfied. I did feel the ending was wrapped up a little too quickly...that after a whole book of trying to figure out what happened to Amy, and who was responsible, the two paragraphs explaining it away was a bit of a let down. Regardless, Mr. Cook sure knows how to grab your attention and hold on to it throughout the span of the book. And because of this, I'll definitely not hesitate to pick up another on of his books."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"As I write this, I am still very torn as to how many stars to rate it. I DID enjoy this book; however, it was not one of the best books I have ever read. However, when I decided to start reviewing books on Amazon, I promised myself that I would rate every single book I read, not just the total winners.I think you should read this book. It IS good; however, for me, it was just not one that enthralled me. Those are the types of books I give 5 stars to -- ones that just won't let me go while I am reading and after I am done.The previous reviews fully explain the plot of the book, which was good. The author does a good job taking us through the family's past and present. He tells of the characters thoughts and reactions to situations regarding the missing girl and how this crime affects all of their relationships.This is a fast and easy read, and it kept me guessing as to who-dun-it. I found I kept changing my mind as to who really did commit the crime, hopping from character to character, which was GOOD because I did not figure out who did do the deed. However, then at the end when you DO find out who the villian was, I felt like the author just hurried up, gave us the goods, and it made me feel cheated. The end had a GREAT twist, although I found it very disturbing and sad.It is still worth a shot and you really should read and enjoy."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"Justa short note after finishing \\"Red Leaves\\", my first intro to this author. Yes, surely holds your attention and unlike many mystery authors very easy to keep characters and plot in mind. (For seniors, that's considered an asset!)

It takes a little while to shake off the reality woven into the pages. Very well done."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"I felt the beginning of this book was unfocused and dry: as with all of Thomas's books, he plans it this way. How he can weave a gripping page turner out of bland every day events is the magic: he turns over that stepping stone you walk over each day and shows the turmoil roiling underneath.... this book was fantastic. Even tho I was not enthralled with \\"Peril\\", that is my only complaint with any of Mr. Cooks works, and that was still a decent book.

He has a family, good business and beautiful home. He has all this until that fateful day when his teenage son, Keith, babysits an eight year old named Amy Giordano. The next morning, Amy disappears. Of course, all eyes turn to Keith including those of his father who fears the guilt of his son. Keith claims innocence but there is no other true suspect. The truth must come out at all costs. But the answer might lie in the long gone past of Eric's own disjointed family. He will search his past to find out the truth of today.I have said again and again that Thomas H. Cook is one of the very best writers of suspense fiction in the world. His books wring every bit of tension by creating a harrowing situation for an every man who must search his past for long lost answers. The reader never discovers the truth until the last few pages and the truth is always shocking. I have personally purchased BREAKHEART HILL for complete strangers in bookstores if they promised to read the book. Tom Cook has written in many styles. His early works are superb detective novels. He has written historical suspense novels including the Edgar winning THE CHATHAM SCHOOL AFFAIR, as well as, the modern psychological suspense dramas like RED LEAVES.RED LEAVES is one of his very best works. Quite possibly as good as BREAKHEART HILL. It is a book that demands to be read in a single sitting. Tom Cook is a master of pacing, characterizations and lyrical writing. In fact, when I think of the most talented writers in the crime fiction field, his name always comes to mind. Any reader who is not familiar with Tom's books would do well starting with this one- one of his finest in years. If I owned a bookstore, I would give a money back guarantee with this one. Truly great!"},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"It amazes me that not a single previous reviewer noted the gaping hole in the logic of the plot that renders the entire reading excercise an utter waste of time (not mention the waste of money in purchasing the book).The hole is this: Did the Giordano parents \\"look in\\" on Amy when they returned home from their evening out? If so, and if she was asleep in bed, than the suspicion of Eric would be no greater than anyone else in town. If she was missing on their return home than Eric has some major explaining to do.Incredibly this issue was never addressed. It is beyond logic to me that neither Giordano parent would check on their 8 y.o. daughter upon returning home from a night out.Would you?"},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"Red Leaves is an excellent book that I literally could not put down. I read it in one afternoon and evening. The next thing I did was to check to see if it was nominated for an Edgar Award. It was nominated a year after it was published but lost out to Citizen Vince which won the award for that year. There were some minor logical flaws and it was \\"depressing\\" as one reviewer pointed out. But this book was so good that it transcends the crime novel genre and stands on its own as a work of literature."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"I received the book in a timely fashion, and the condition is as was noted. It is in very good condition. I would use this vendor again."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"When Keith Moore tells his father that he's going to baby-sit for eight-year-old Amy Giordano, Eric thinks nothing of it. It's just another comfortable night for Eric, Keith, and Meredith, Eric's lovely and contented wife. Eric and his family have been living out their lives enveloped in a happy and seemingly relaxed existence. But when Amy's father, Vince calls Eric and tells him that his daughter has disappeared, suspicion immediately falls on Keith.Red Leaves is all about how well can we truly know one another, even those who are the closest to us. When Amy fails to turn up, most people in the small town of Wesley are sure that Keith murdered her, or at least had some thing to so with her disappearance. Suspicion mounts when some anonymous caller tells the police who are investigating the case that there's just \\"something wrong\\" with Eric, Keith, and also Warren, Keith's middle-aged drunken brother.Eric and Meredith continue to keep a brave face. As their lives steadily become a prison of recrimination, they continue to stand by their son, all the time maintaining his innocence. Events, however, just don't seem to add up: Keith maintains that he walked home from Amy's, but Eric saw a car pull up and he is sure that Keith got out of it. And what does Keith no about the water tower where Amy's pajamas were found? When questioned by police, he denies going there, but Eric detects a spark of recognition in his son's eyes.Keith is a troubled teenager, \\"a scared type of kid,\\" his mood constantly volatile, resentful, and sullen. Everything he does is desultory, to the extent that it takes on an oddly sinister character, an outward carelessness and indifference. His father sees this as perhaps emblematic of inner and far more serious disarray, and as the cracks begin to break in Eric's armor, and with no credible witnesses and no other serious suspects, Eric begins to suspect his own son.But what of Warren, Eric's enigmatic brother? Like Keith, Eric sees Warren as a loser in life's cruel lottery, locked in failure and disappointment, a member of that despised legion of \\"middle-aged drunks whose one true power must be their unheralded capacity to control their own consuming rage.\\" Eric steadily becomes convinced that Warren knows more about Amy's disappearance than he's letting on.As Eric delves back into his own dysfunctional family where his father squandered their considerable fortune, where his mother committed suicide, and where his little sister Jenny died of a brain tumor, he discovers the weary run of his brother's life, the corrosive nature of his most guarded secret, and the unspeakable cravings that for years ceaselessly gnawed at him.Like the turn of the lens, in the camera shop that Eric owns, everything is gradually bought into sharper focus. Things begin to change as Meredith grows more volatile and Keith more defiant. Meredith feels a terrible sinking feeling, afraid that it's all going to explode, while a wave of deep melancholy washes over Eric; his once comfortable life, now fraught with danger and confusion, along with a terrible mixture of anger and pain. Suspicion has corroded this family, \\"eating through the smooth surface of things,\\" and the mark it leaves is indelible.Author Thomas H. Cook, in stark and austere prose, steadily builds the tension, until deadly secrets are revealed and the characters are forced to confront the dark heart of their souls. As Eric's son, wife, father, mother, and brother become mere shadows, dark and indefinable, Eric begins to realize that half of life is denial, \\"that even in those we love, it's not what we see but what we choose to be blind to that sustains us.\\"In Red Leaves, lives seem precariously balanced, happiness a kind of arrogance, a bounty that we take for granted. It's just so easy for little wifs of doubt about those we love to darken and grow menacing, inevitably shattering our previously tranquil existence. Mike Leonard July 05."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"I don't know why Thomas Cook isn't better known. Perhaps his writing is so good that his subject matter makes reviewers nervous and, as a result of their confusion (is he a serious writer? Is he a suspense reiter? Can one author be both? Scary thought. Best to forget the whole concept) they avoid writing about him."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"What I liked most about this book is that it is about a situation that is almost normal - well, not normal exactly, but it's something that could happen to most anyone. The protaganist is a regular guy who could be me...or you. The central situation that develops is common enough.As a result, as things are happening I found myself asking 'what would i do in that situation or with such and such information?' Is the lead character (and the other characters, to some extent) behaving 'right'? Are they doing what a reasonable person would do?It is kind of interesting because you participate in the story in perhaps a more active way than a normal book where the situations are pretty far out there and characters are nothing like you.At the same time, despite being sort of 'normal', the story isn't at all boring. Instead, Cook is able to keep the suspense and intrigue high throughout.The whole effect is quite engaging and kept me flipping pages pretty quickly.Of course like most of his books, the story is reasonably bleak and sort of depressing. His characters tortured and pained in various ways. And there's ample tragedy. Not a lot of happy talk.Still I highly recommend and it keeps me solidly on the Thomas Cook train."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"This book is really the study of a family during a central crisis, though there are other crises that keep your interest as the plot ensues. I was totally engrossed and somewhat surprised at the ending. For any reader, this is a great book for a long airline trip. It will keep you focused."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"One could accuse Eric Moore of being naive. All the signs of family distress were there. A mother's suicide, a wife's disinterest, a Name-is-Earl-type brother, a lethargic, distant and loner fifteen year old son. But Eric lives in dream world. He thought his family was \\"normal.\\" not exceptional, just normal.But Eric's about to see the light. The harsh glare of reality, strobe-like, piercing like a laser. The female child his son Keith was babysitting goes missing, is presumed dead. And the cops think Keith did it.Page by page Eric's world slowly crumbles. At first, he stands by his son, then as police and community suspicions grow, he begins to question his son's every facial expression, every word, every movement. He looks to his own upbringing for guidance and sees parallels: the dysfunctional relations of his parents, his brother's strange relationship to their dead sister -- the shattering of happy family myths.Eric stares at happy family pictures, sees misery masks everywhere.Meanwhile, the search for a little girl drags on, as does the hunt for the person who snagged her. And the girl's family becomes more desperate.If this book doesn't win an award, the judges didn't read it. I ruined a night of sleep pounding through its pages, and the lessons I learned will live with me. Anyone with a teenager should read this book. It's about trust, confidence, innocence, and what happens when these values are lost."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"Tragedy befalls Eric Moore's small town life when eight year old Amy Giordano disappears from her home. Suspicion immediately centers on Eric's adolescent son Keith, who was Amy's baby-sitter on that fateful night and the last person to see young Amy before she disappeared - we think.This is the first of many problems with this book. Not only does no one know when Amy was last seen - no one even has the sense to ask. Amy's parents return from their night out on the town, Eric the baby-sitter leaves and the following morning Amy is gone with no one having checked on her until she doesn't show up at the breakfast table.After this credibility gap I had immense trouble buying much else in this book which I believe is an attempt to portray how everyday life for an everyday family in an everyday town can be turned up-side down when once in a lifetime circumstances shatter their idyllic existence.Eric passively watches the town prey upon his son - and even he suspects poor Keith of the worst. His loving wife is a shrew with little or no maternal instincts and even the less than satisfying ending left me wondering why I bothered finishing this book. At best Red Leaves would make a mediocre short story - as a 300 page novel it fails completely"},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"I don't think Thomas H. Cook has ever, or will ever, write a light hearted book - like James Patterson going from stories of serial killers to sappy tear-jerkers. That being said, Cook is THE master of the dark novel. The novel where one, some, or all of the characters has a dark cloud over their head and you know something bad will come their way. Red Leaves is not different - very skillfully written story about a family imploding over an incident that may or may not have been committed by one of its members. Readers of Cook can count on two things: A great read and a certainty there will be no happy ending."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"Book spoiler ALERT!This was my first Thomas H. Cook book and I will think twice before reading another.This book was DEPRESSING.It is about a fake family who fake their whole lives from the \\"father\\" and \\"mother\\" and \\"son\\" who supposedly love each other to the other relatives and characters who are also phoney. The author uses the words fake, phoney, etc throughout the book just to remind the reader.The teen-age son was described as a loser and both his parents, police and the town thinks he killed the little girl he was babysitting. His own grandfather compared him to his \\"loser\\" pathetic no ambition uncle. If the girl's parents thought he was not trustworthy, WHY did they use him multiple times to babysit and WHAT type of parents doesn't check in on their child when they come home from an outing late at night? The child could have been taken AFTER the babysitter left for all they know. The parents seemed to want to put their guilt onto the babysitter.Thank God the teenage kid found a girlfriend and an adult male to talk to and who supported him. It is no wonder he was depressed growing up in that household with a mean spirited paternal grandfather, apathetic moronic father, seething witch of a mother and a perverted paternal uncle.Ironically, in the end, this \\"so-called loser\\" teenage boy dies a hero. He proved himself to be more of a man than his father because he called the police OVER his father's objections and saved the little girl's life.I cannot help but wonder IF the father had called the police AS SOON AS HE REALIZED the pizza guy smoked Malboro's, thus letting the little girl free earlier so her father would have no reason to kill the \\"teen boy\\" and himself, then this whole book would have a better ending. Instead, the only decent thing about the book is the little girl lives."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"I've been reading Cook for years and this one is a favorite.

You question how much you trusted your own children. Cook sets up tension that draws you in at the same time you can't decide with whom you think you should identify. The photography metaphor is telling in that it mirrors the search for truth.

Fans of his Edgar Award-winning novel, THE CHATHAM SCHOOL AFFAIR (my first introduction to this brilliant author) will be delighted with Cook's latest novel. Through the cleanest and simplest of phrases, Thomas H. Cook can make people, places, emotions tangible. He pulls readers through his novels effortlessly--tempting them with subtle suspicions, concocting unsettling situations that necessitate closure.RED LEAVES is a novel about an eight-year-old girl who disappears in the middle of the night. Her disappearance ravages the lives of the family whose son was responsible for babysitting the young girl.

I read it with a highlighter and a notepad. I read exerpts of it to my writing class--this is how to do it. This is what we're striving for.The surface story is about the disappearance of an eight-year-old child, but if that's why you're reading it, you'll be terribly disappointed. There are no heroic sleuths in this novel.Scratch a little deeper, and you may believe the story is about how a man deals with his son being the prime suspect in the child's disappearance. Here, you'll be closer to right.The story is about a man who trudges through his life, like a hamster on a wheel, thinking everything is good, and discovers through a stinging slap on the cheek that what he believes--what he has always believed about his life and the people who populate it--is a lie. The story is about the pendulum of human emotion and the extremities to which it can swing; about the corrosive effects of suspicion; about the devastating results of living like an ostrich and the equally devastating results of discovering the truth.This mainstream \\"mystery\\" novel is literature at its finest."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"When an eight-year-girl in the care of her babysitter, Keith Moore, goes missing, his parents first proclaim his innocence, but then his father starts to have his own secret doubts.

This is one of the author's best novels and one that is hard to put down."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"I love most of Cook's books, and his ability to weave two stories in one book, simultaneously, is impressive. His stories are always page-turners, however, Red Leaves is like a diet version of Cook. Less calories but also less flavor.There are several flaws:1. Neither the parents nor the babysitter looked in on the little girl.2. If Keith was such a sulky, suspicious boy, WHY did the parents ever trust him to babysit?3. The real kidnapper leaves cigarette butts outside the victim's window and that doesn't immediately solve the case?I finished the book in 2 sittings. It was interesting, hence the 3 stars, but this story was just too implausible. It is not Cook at his best. The characters are simply dull. You can't sympathize with the accused. You can't even feel bad about all the unecessary injustices because the story is just not as convincing as the drama it unfolds could be."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"The entire atmosphere of Red Leaves by Thomas Cook is depressing. While Eric and Meredith's teen-aged son, Keith, is babysitting for a little girl, the little girl disappears. Suspicion immediately falls upon Keith and in what is probably the saddest part of the book, rather than receiving the love and support of his parents, he has to face their suspicion as well as that of everyone else. Oh sure, they do the right things-- they bring in a lawyer, they mouth the right words to the police, but they don't REALLY believe that their son is not guilty of what he is accused.Under the pressure of the investigation, the family slowly deteriorates as Eric stops trusting Meredith and vice versa. Eric and Meredith are not particularly likeable people, and I can't say for sure whether Keith is likeable or not since Cook portrays him so intently as a sullen teen-aged boy.There are several surprise twists at the end of the book, as well as a few holes in the plot-- who WAS driving the car that brought Keith home the night of the babysitting, and how was the little girl spirited out of the house without anybody's knowledge? However, it was a book that was impossible to put down."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"From Red Leaves:\\"Here is the illusion--a normal day predicts a normal tomorrow and each day is not a brand-new spin of the wheel, our lives not lived at the whim of Lady Luck.\\"Yes, how often to we pass accidents, observe incidents that just missed us, could have involved us, but did not.\\"Suspicion is an acid, that's one thing I know.

This, despite the superb blurbs for this particular book from Harlan Coben, Peter Straub, Susan Issacs, and Joyce Carol Oates.So, I says to myself, the book cannot possibly be headed where it looks like it is headed. This is a master of misdirection. So, to experiment, about a quarter of the way through, I wrote down where it naturally looked like it was going, along with where a savvy reader might second-guess it to be going. Then, about three-quarters of the way through, I wrote down where I thought it was going then.I was wrong all the way around, and delighted to be wrong.

The master tells him again and again that there are no secrets but that \\"A good woman is hard to keep. Oh, return to zero, the master said. Use what's lying around the house.

The eloquent narrator, Eric Moore, owns a camera and photo shop and photography is a motif that permeates the novel. Snapshots capture people at particular moments in their lives, but it is impossible to look at pictures and really know what lies behind the posed smiles.\\"Red Leaves\\" is the story not just of Eric Moore, but of his dead mother and bitter father, his shiftless brother, Warren, his wife, Meredith, and his son, Keith. By the end of the novel, Eric has ample reason to reevaluate everything that he has assumed about each one of these individuals. He achieves \\"the high wisdom that only the fallen know\\" the hard way, through bitter experience.Eric, Meredith, and fifteen-year-old Keith live in a beautiful home in a small town, and life is good. Meredith has a job she adores, teaching English and handling administrative duties in a local junior college. One Friday evening, Keith is asked to baby-sit for eight-year-old Amy Giordano. He agrees and everyone's lives change. The next morning, Amy is not in her bed, and her parents are crazy with worry. Who abducted their little girl? Is she still alive? Since Keith was apparently the last person to see her, suspicion naturally falls on him. The police are particularly interested in the fact that Keith is a reserved and awkward boy with few friends and low self-esteem.Throughout the book, Cook maintains a high level of suspense, using foreshadowing and opening each section of the book with cryptic comments by the narrator made after the events of this novel have already taken place. Therefore, \\"Red Leaves\\" is in the nature of a jigsaw puzzle, whose pieces can be put together only after the last page is turned.The story derives its power from Cook's marvelously descriptive writing and his careful delineation of character. The book's themes are universal: no one is exactly as he or she appears on the surface, suspicion can be corrosive, and happiness is a fragile state that too often dissipates without warning. Cook also demonstrates that, for better or worse, each of us is a product of our particular family history.Although Eric's life seems stable, an unpredictable combination of circumstances turns everything he values to ashes. \\"Red Leaves\\" suffers from a melodramatic ending that I wish had been a bit more restrained, but it is still a compelling and unforgettable work about a family's tragic disintegration."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"In the tradition of Harlan Coben and Nelson DeMille, Thomas H.Cook presents readers with not only mysteries and suspense books but taught psychological dramas. Among the books I've read by him which I really enjoyed are the titles, The Chatham School Murder, Places in the Dark and perhaps my favorite, Breakheart Hill. And his newest book Red Leaves is a welcome addition to a writer who provokes gradual increases of fear which finds readers holding their breaths and gulping down the pages.Red Leaves begins on an ordinary day in an ordinary home in a suburb which could be found across America. But in less than 48 hours this will be no ordinary home with ordinary people, And once again we as readers find ourselves wondering how well do we really know people, even those closest to us.On the surface life seems good for Eric Moore and his family. He is happy with his photo and framing shop and his wife hasa good teaching job at the local community college. They live in a closely knit community where they have friends and good neighbors. And if their 15 year old son seems a bit odd, isn't that just teenage angst, Eric thinks? But undeneath it all Eric's life so good or so simple as wrestles with thoughts about his other family as he calls them. His mother who died in a car crash, a young sister who died, his ne'er do well and iullusionary father now in a nursing home and his brother, an alcoholic and solitary man. And then one night Eric's son goes to baby-sit for aneighbors 8 year old daughter and life for the Moores nothing will never be the same again.This book which begins slowly gains steam as the events and Eric's thoughts and findings begin a downward spiral for which there is only doom for his family. And if the ending was melodramatic and almost anti-climactic, it did seem like the only plausible and possible ending. The characters were well defined and I as the reader felt compassion for all of them but most of all Eric who began to realize that things were never the way they seemed.I have long found Thomas H. Cook to be a wonderful writer of this genre. And my recent reading of Red Leaves only served to confirm my previous thoughts as well. Allonge with presenting us with believable characters living ordinary lives that are about to change dramatically, Cook has the knack of making his readers feel as if they are part of the scenery. As always when I finish one of his books, I look forward to reading his newest one or an older title I haven't read yet. Keep writing them Mr. Cook and this is one reader who will continue to gulp down your titles."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"Like others who didn't find this read a spectacular one, I am surprised at how many 5 stars this book has received. Cook's a good writer & this was an interesting enough story but I found nothing much to LOVE about it. My problems w/ this book are:1. none of the characters, even the young son, were very likable so I didn't care about any of their fates.2. a HUGE PROBLEM mentioned several other times here is that it is not at all believable that the girls parents didn't check on their young daughter when they got home & relieved the babysitter. Keith, the babysitter, hadn't checked on her himself since 8:30 PM & the parents got back at 10PM. So we're supposed to believe that no one looked in on her from 8:30 pm until the next morning.3. It's not believabe that cops wouldn't have looked more into pizza delivery guy.4. My kids are not teens yet but I find it hard to believe that a dad would allow his son to completely lock him out of his bedroom especially after the son has been accused of possible kidnapping/murder/rape. Keith wouldn't allow dad in his room & only opened the door 2 inches when they spoke to each other through the door. Dad didn't even force his way in when he thought his kid may have been smoking pot in there. Yes, he goes in twds the end of the story but so much has gone on by then that it makes no sense. I'm supposed to believe that the parents wouldn't have searched this mystery room while the kid was at school one day?5. Unanswered question about how Keith actually got home that night. I only saw one other poster complain about this issue. I re-read last few chapters to see if I missed something & I'm still confused. Are we supposed to assume that Keith's girlfriend dropped him off? It's never addressed. The fact that the little girl could not have been abducted by a person w/out a car is stressed & the mysterious car seen on the driveway when Keith came home is also mentioned again & again but when story finally resolves, the \\"car\\" issue is never addressed again. Yes, I know that pizza delivery guy had s car but that doesn't help me with the car that Keith may or may not have gottn out of on the driveway that night.6. While we're on the subject of Keith's \\"girlfriend\\", are we supposed to think that she was actually a prostitute that worked at the water tower & he was using the $ that he stole to pay her for her services. This kid is supposed to be a loner & has no friends (male & female) & then we hear he has had some girlfriend across town. That storyline never comes up again & it's a big deal. Also, it's unbelievable that Keith's dad didn't press him for more info about this bombshell. His son opens up to him once in he whole book & the dad doesn't ask him for a few more details?7. Also, if Keith was such a loner, why didn't his parent's find it unusual that he said he was going out into town after his babysitting gig was over that night? With whom? What normal kid just roams around, alone at 11 pm at night? Obviously, he's up to something or he has a friend that he doesn't want them to know about. Keith told cops that he walked around & sat alone on a set of bleachers in the park at 11 PM! That's creepy & any parent would be concerned about that behavior. It's never address by parents or cops!Unbelievable moments & flat/unlikable characters.Not a good read."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"...but certainly not one I'd recommend.

But aside from that there wasn't much that makes this work at all remarkable. The characters weren't believable or full developed.

It's a readable enough book but not one that lingers or has any emotional impact, and given the subject, you'd think it would."},{"Title":"RED LEAVES","review":"Thomas H. Cook is always so interesting. I've never been disappointed in any book of his. This one is no exception, and I was thrilled by it. In a way, it reminded me of \\"We Need To Talk About Kevin.\\" The voice in that book belonged to the teenage boy's mother - ironic and precise as the father's in this one. Each of these novels is crisp, succinct, and pounds, like a beating heart, to the finish. There were some implausible things about \\"Leaves.\\" But the writing was so honest, I could easily overlook them. Reviewers here have mentioned the fact that the family never looked in on their sleeping daughter. I was surprised that they waited until the next morning to call the police and Keith's parents, which originally made me suspect the girl's own parents. A few other minor glitches made me wonder, but still - a book is a success for me when A.

In Red Leaves, Thomas Cook shows the slow destruction of a family after a little girl is kidnapped while the family's teen-aged son is babysitting for her. From the suspicion that falls upon the teen aged son, to the exploration of the house of cards upon which the family is built, Cook thoroughly examines a family that is not what it seems to be on the surface.Although the book itself is of a depressing nature, it was also impossible to put down. It was very difficult to feel sympathy for Eric or his wife, Meredith, as they, themselves, question their own son's guilt or innocence. However, it was compelling in a sick sort of way. The ending was unexpected and, if anything, made the book even more depressing.

In essence, this trilogy will help you to understand addition struggles and stories from the dread time known as: the War of the Lance."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"Fantasy readers should not begrudge Weis and Hickman for returning to the story that started the Dragonlance franchise but they should have concerns. Far better writers have failed to recapture past magic when they returned to past subjects (for example, Hemingway's \\"The Dangerous Summer\\" simply can not live up to the same ground he covered before in \\"Death in the Afternoon\\"). Thankfully Weis and Hickman avoid the major pitfalls. This book does not take any luster off the original Dragonlance Chronicles.\\"Dragons of Dwarven Depths\\" is a solid if unspectacular addition to the series. There is a certain joy in seeing beloved characters interact with one another and the writers send more than a few knowing winks the reader's way since we know more about the plot than the characters do at this point.Some of the best parts of the Dragonlance series focused on the intimate moments; when the companions seemed more concerned with their own survival and what was in front of them than the epic wars for control of Krynn. Weis and Hickman are able to present some very good scenes when they can think small; when Tika and Tas face dangers; when Raistlin, Caramon and Sturm explore a dungeon; when Tanis and Flint look for a lost city. When Weis and Hickman try to show the bigger picture (for example, Riverwind leading an army of refugees or an in-depth take on dwarf tribal politics), the authors simply lose the narrative and the reader loses interest.There remain some problems with the book. This book suffers from poor editing; poor copy editing and poor plot editing. One of the chief reasons Weis and Hickman split the Companions apart in \\"Dragons of Winter's Night\\" is they could not focus on character development when there are too many actors on the stage at once. That's a problem here since Tanis, Tas, Flint, Caramon, Raistlin, Laurana, Tika, Sturm, Riverwind, Goldmoon, Elistan, Gilthanas, even Hedrik the Theocrat. not to mention a host of new dwarven characters and villains, fight for page time. Tolstoy may have been able to pull the strings on so many puppets but Weis and Hickman simply are not up to that level. For example, the first part of the novel shows more focus and depth on Tika than almost any other part of the series. She's invisible the second half of the book. One has to also concede that the first half of the book is much more gripping than the second half-and no, that has nothing to do with Tika.Despite these flaws, the authors are able to hold the book together through good characters and a decent enough plot. If Weiss and Hickman did nothing to take the series to greater heights in this book, they at least did not tarnish their previous glories."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"I have to admit that I came into this book with lower expectations than what I had after reading the original chronicles and I still was greatly impressed. This book was excellent. I couldn't put it down and read it in 2 days. Hats off to Margaret and Tracy for the incredible work they did, I can't imagine it's easy to put your mind in a same place it was 20+ years ago. The book flowed nicely between Autumn Twilight and Winter Night. I have read every series that includes the main characters and it was good to get some more insight about Flint and also more history about how some of the other gods returned.Bottom line if you are a Dragonlance fan, no matter your age, this book is a must read. One thing I do have to complain about is whoever edited this book needs a butt kicking :) I found 20 errors in the first 100 pages..."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"Note: This review is for the Audiobook version.The Audiobook is a tragedy of ... everything. At first, I appreciated that the reader attempted to give a different voice to each character. Although, the first two speaking characters were draconians, and after 7 minutes of scratchy, guttural, and ssssssnakey dialogue, I was fairly annoyed. It really made me appreciate the reader for Dragons of Autumn Twilight.But when she got to Tasslehoff, I had to stop. The reader's interpretation and presentation was quite cartoonish and ... I couldn't help but imagine a retarded gully dwarf clown."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"Dragons of Dwarven Depths takes place in the period between Dragons of Autumn Twilight and Dragons of Winter Night.Pros:Like many have said, it's visiting with old friendsIt is a well written book, as you would expect of Weis and HickmanIt's almost 600 pages, so you get your moneys worth!Fills in some gaps in the original Chronicles trilogyCons:For the first half of the book, the characters are written nearly exactly the same as they were in the original trilogy, however, in the second half, some, particularly Sturm and Caramon, seem different than the characters we know and love. While the characters do grow and change through the original trilogy in a fairly smooth manner, if you add this novel in, it would seem that they jump all over the place.The story follows a similar path. While the first half seamlessly picks up right where it left off in Autumn Twilight, in the second half I found myself saying \\"That doesn't make sense\\" when I thought about the beginning of Winter Night. Without giving anything away (if you have read the original trilogy), the second half of the story deals with the companions acquiring the legendary Hammer of Kharas. In Winter Night, Sturm points out that they had recovered it, and the Dwarven essentially wouldn't agree to house the refugees without the companions turning it over. He's ticked, and Tanis isn't much happier about it. While that storyline is somewhat followed, the way it is written, it doesn't seem like any of the companions should be that upset that the Dwarves ended up with it. Also, it doesn't make sense why Elistan is then presenting it in the beginning of Winter Night.By the end, I really felt like I was reading a novel written by one of the countless authors that have contributed to the series. Those authors tend to go off on their own tangents, or ignore various statements/facts presented in the original trilogies to make their stories work, which I find highly annoying.That being said, it was still an enjoyable read, and far better than most of the non-Weis/Hickman novels in the series. I look forward to the second installment."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"This book was my first from Hickman and Weis, and I enjoyed the experience so that I'm going to read the Chronicles. I must admit I tried the Chronicles when the books first came out, and did not make it far in book one. Everyone I know who read the series loves it, and continues to 20 years later. The author's forward intrigued me on this one, and I feel like the prodical son, who missed so much in the lives of the companions.Dragons of the Dwarven Depths is a standard fantasy adventure. Rich characters, intense plot, and rich narrative makes for excellent storytelling, raising it above the massive amount of other fantasy books. Beleive me I've trudge through many. The companions have led refuges from enslavement in draconian mines to temporary safety. Believing that the draconians will come for the refuges, the companions go on a daring mission to the Dwarven Mountain home to plea for safe haven for the refuges. Here, the problems mount. The Dwarven gates have been closed for 300 years, no one alive knows how to even find the gates, the Draconians with their red dragons know where the refuges are hiding, and internal power struggles threaten the fragile unity of the refuges.It's interesting to see how Tanis and company deal with these challenges, and more, up to the climatic ending. As someone who has not read the previoius series, ...yet..., anyone new to the characters will enjoy the adventure without feeling lost. The authors do a nice job of mixing serious drama with humor--got to love the Kender. Certainly, long standing fans will get greater enjoyment because of their depth of knowledge of the references made in this book.Strap on your weapons or staff and enjoy this strong adventure tale. You will be amazed!"},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"I gave this two stars just because it's Dragonlance. I loved the original Chronicles and Legends, and even found the latest War of Souls not bad. Soulforge and Brothers in Arms were great too.There are a couple good moments in the 2nd half of the book. However, the vast majority of the book is painful to read and incredibly ponderous. I thought at first it might be because I'm older now and had outgrown Weis and Hickman's writing style, but then I went back to the above mentioned books and leafed through them.The curious thing is it's almost as if someone different wrote this novel. It simply doesn't flow at all, and worse, the characters themselves are poorly developed. Raistlin sounds whiny, Caramon is dumb beyond belief, etc.I have no idea what happened, except two theories: first is that there was some sort of time pressure. Second, Weis has said on message boards that her partnership with Hickman is such that she writes and he fills in the \\"nuts and bolts,\\" with ideas on the economy, clothing, etc. So perhaps this time Hickman wanted to try his hand for the majority of a book?Anyway, whatever the reason, after reading Star of Guardians, Legends, Chronicles, War of Souls, DeathGate Cycle, that trilogy with Matthew, Darksword... Dragons of Dwarven Depths is by far the WORST out of them all. Just absolutely painful to try to get through. (even Dragons of Highlord Skies is better, much better written with better flow, although I hate how Kitiara is some lovesick, jealous puppy. I mean, I know she has a thing for Tanis, but please, Highlord Skies was so overdone on that note)(I'm still glad I bought Dwarven Depths though. Happy to support the authors...even bought that HORRENDOUS DVD knowing I would hate it after the previews... A forever thank you for Chronicles and Legends and hours of pure enjoyment!)"},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"I have been a fan of Dragonlance books for years now. From Dragons of Autumn twilight to Soulforgem, I've loved every minute of the series. Until now. Dragons of the Dwarven Depths has the feel of a book put out just in order to revisit old characters. The characters lacked any dept due to the fact that the authors wanted to stay as \\"true\\" to the characters as possible. The problem remains that if a character is denied the ability to grow then they become immediately stale. The story takes alot of energy to get into, and the middle is border-line impossible to read. While the characters lacked any progression the storyline was considerably worse. It was nice to see some old characters again but as Kevin Smith said, he would rather have his characters die out than to overstay his welcome. This book is worth reading as a gift or from a library. I definetley wouldnt recommend buying it though."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"First, a warning: if you are a new reader to the Dragonlance world, don't start with this novel! Start with the Chronicles and its first volume, Dragons of Autumn Twilight. Dragons of the Dwarven Depths is the first volume of the Lost Chronicles, which across the trilogy will narrate selected episodes from the War of the Lance that did not receive detailed treatment in the Chronicles. The Lost Chronicles fill in some of the gaps, as it were.This first volume describes the Companions' search for Thorbadin and the Hammer of Kharas, and takes place, chronologically speaking, at the end of Dragons of Autumn Twilight. Although readers familiar with the Chronicles and Legends or with the AD&D; Dragonlance role-playing modules will know the overall story-line, this does not subtract from the reading experience - rather it enhances it. There are some powerful scenes, in particular for me those revealing the help Raistlin receives along the way...; we see the deeper meaning and significance in these scenes, which the characters in the novel do not. There is a lot of detail - the episode gets a 400-odd page treatment, which is obviously much more than any episode in the Chronicles; this can be slow going at times, especially if one's favourite characters are not involved. But it is great to see Weis and Hickman working again with the original Companions; I eagerly await volumes two and three."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"...it just isn't a particularly good book either, mediocre at best. Perhaps the bar was set to high, the other Dragonlance books that have come from the creative pairing of Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman have been outstanding pieces of fantasy fiction. Dragons of Dwarven Depths? Less so. To begin, the editing is not particularly good with apparent typos and even jumbled word order in some places. Despite these technical flaws however, at least it can be said that the plot is decent.Still, like any \\"prequel\\" book (and this is indeed a prequel to Dragons of Winter Night from the original Chronicles), Dwarven Depths frequently suffers from the reader wondering if things in this story are REALLY how things happened based upon the events of Winter Night. Many of the characters also behave out of character, or at the very least have their flaws considerably magnified, for the sake of adding some character conflict to the tale.Mechanically, Dwarven Depths tries to emulate the style of Chronicles, including descriptive chapter titles though the absence of Michael Williams' poetry and chapter and book illustrations stand in stark contrast to some of the terrific art that was contained in the Chronicles. Looser censorship rules also allow Weis and Hickman to use stronger language at points and all of this works together to leave the book with a decidedly different tone. At times, the objective of the book seems muddled as well. The first several chapters all attempt to retell the events of the first book, Dragons of Autumn Twilight, as if the authors expect the reader to not be familiar with Chronicles. Still later on, moments of dramatic irony and other references suggest that the authors fully expect the reader to have both read Chronicles and the sequel trilogy Legends. This leads me to wonder if the first few chapters were almost an attempt by the authors to reconnect with characters that they hadn't written in many years. If that is the case, then why did these chapters make it into the book? They read more like notes and memories than a novel.Still, things are not all bad. Dwarven Depths does get intriguing in the second half, after the authors have finished trying to retell everything from Autumn Twilight. The prose improves, the story gets more interesting, and aforementioned moments of dramatic irony frequently bring a smile. Fans of the original Chronicles, and the original characters that made Dragonlance popular, will probably find something to like with this book. People who are just looking for a decent fantasy read should probably turn to the original Chronicles trilogy before they think about this book. It isn't great, but in the absence of a group of friends to play the long-out-of-print original game modules that this book is based on, it serves as a decent substitute."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"MW & TH writing style changed over the years and it shows, the pacing of the book is not the same, it's alot slower. I am wondering though if the slow pacing is not due to the duo not really knowing what to put in this book. As a story, it's not bad, but it isn't really anything special or inspired and it does not really fit with the beginning of Dragons of Winter (where Sturm mentions that they had to \\"fight\\" to get the hammer back, well, no, in this book there was no fighting at all in the tomb and Sturm didn't even went in it, only Flint and Tas did.)The first hundred pages are also almost a huge recap of the characters motivations and story so far. This should have been totally stripped from the book IMHO, it's totally redundant and I doubt anyone buying this book has not read Dragons of Autumn Twilight already(and if not, simply put a note to the reader that he should!) another quarter of the books dialogue is about Raistlin playing puppets with Caramon or Laurana saying she isn't in love with Elistan, etc. Basically, you get pages upon pages of text describing characters emotions that are described at lenght in Dragons of Winter Night. It's redundant too but in a backward kind of way :PLast negative point, the writing itself... it's lazy and feels rushed. Typos, repetition, grammatical errors, ugh! Where was the editor? As an exemple, you'll get a piece of text that look like this: Flint is a hill dwarf. Flint has long beard and heavy brows. Flint has... etc. How many time did the author repeated \\"Flint\\" at the start of her sentences? 5-6 times instead of going with something that would have more flow like: Flint, hill dwarf with long beard and heavy brows, has.... Some paragraph look like they were written by a 8 years old who is starting to learn to write and isn't using synonyms or such yet. Even the original Chronicles, written decades before, never suffered from such writing. This can only be explained by lazy writing since they are from the same authors!Now the good: It's Tanis and the gang back for our reading pleasure! And here, we can safely read the book while knowing our heroes won't get killed in some stupid and useless fashion. (To new reader, read Chronicles and Legends and avoid reading Dragons of Summer Flame and anything after that, you'll only cringe at all the uninspired death of all your favorites characters and how they basically screw the world of Krynn with the fifth age.)"},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"I was eager to read this because like many I am entranced by the Dragonlance Universe, and I enjoyed the brief glimpse of backstory- I feel like this might have been intended or at the least contemplated 26 years ago when the first novel was published, because I was always puzzled/ frustrated by the gaps in storyline.Unfortunately the stilted writing, grammatical errors and shallow overview of the emotional depths of the characters ruined the story line for me. It was as if the entire story was dictated to a text to speech and sent off to be published without any effort at... well anything really.Perhaps the most poignant thing I can say about it is I read this three months ago, and despite a strong hunger to know what happens in the other two in this trilogy, I haven't been able to bring myself to buy Dragons of a Highlord Sky."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"This book lives up to the Dragonlance standard in my opinion.

This is written by the creators of the Dragonlance Chronicles. The very people that beta tested the original 1st Edition AD&D; Dragonlance modules. The very people that wrote the novels AFTER they roleplayed it out.Most likely this new trilogy was roleplayed out during the adventuring phase and just took this long to be put to paper for the fans enjoyment. I'll make sure I ask Margaret next time I see her at either Origins and/or GenCon and/or Dragon Con.Oh! And just for bragging rights: Margaret is a great dancer! That dance at Dragon Con a couple years ago is still a highlight of my life!!Now, many of you may be thinking that I'm biased in this interview. But, I read the original Dragonlance trilogy when it FIRST came out. Yeah, I'm old. Older than dirt. HA!!!! I even played the AD&D; 1st Edition Dragonlance modules BEFORE the novels even came out.What's interesting is that when I roleplayed Raistlin he gradually became \\"evil\\" under my watch. I even commented on this to Margaret Weis one of the times I met her.Anyway, I may be biased, but the Weis/Hickman written Dragonlance novels can't be beat.

Excellent novel and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths is about the time between Dragons of Autumn Twilight and Dragons of Winter Night. In this book, the companions have the task of getting 800 Pax Tharkan refugees to safety from the Dragon Highlords. Tanis, Sturm, Raistlin, Caramon, Tika, Riverwind, Goldmoon, Flint, and, of course, Tasslehoff Burrfoot are looking for the Dwarven kingdom of Thorbardin to house all the refugees. One problem, though. It's under a mountain.Once in Thorbardin, though, they've already got enemies. At one time, only Raistlin's diligent study of Dwarven fungi saves them all from a terrible death by poison. Then Tanis, Sturm, Raistlin, and Caramon fake their deaths to capture their would-be murderers.This is one of the best books I've ever read (or re-re-re-read).

I was very excited to find out that these books finally got written to fill in all the missing pieces of stories spoke of in other books. First off I will agree with a few of the other reviewers. There are a handful of type-o's in this book. Missing quotes, misspelled words, missing words etc. HOWEVER, none of which are so bad that it makes the book not worth reading. I have found about 10 or 11. It could be worse, none the less, the book is still worth reading. I also have to disagree when people say the characters don't act like they did in other books. I think this is no where near correct. All of the characters are just like they were years ago when I first read of them. NOTE* This book has little to no character development it is NOT meant for that. It is a continuation of books previously written. If you are thinking of reading this and have not at the very least read Dragons of Autumn Twilight, hold of and read that first. Having said what I have, this is a great book and I highly recommend it, granted you read it in the correct order according to the other related books.

But on its merit as a revisit to the world that turned me into a reader. The world which lit my imagination and the character therein. Krynn, and The Companions.The book had plenty of character growth from the Autumn Twilight. Those who are reviewing it as having not are thinking with their metaplot knowledge in hand. Set that aside and look at the growing relationship between Caramon and Tika as well as the problems that will later plague their marriage in the Legends Trilogy, watch an evolution of the strain that is forming between Caramon and Raistlin, speaking of the Hourglass Mage, more hints into what occured in The Soulforge story as well as hints about his dual nature developed in the story. Some characters did not develop as much, flint most certainly did. Flint and the interaction with the jolly Dwarven Persona of Reorx )who was from the short stories in the book following Summer Flame whose name escapes me) was a great and enjoyable short conversation. The old dwarf learned a thing or two in the Dwarven Depths, about himself, about honor, about the god's and about the impending end of his life.As for dialog I am still smiling about Tasslehoff's \\"Golden Wooly Mammoth\\", \\"No it was big, had wings, a tail, and it was a golden.....wooly mammoth\\".I for one loved it.

Seriously, if I had something else to read I'd be doing so. There are too many characters making their requisite cameos and not enough action. I loved these books when I was a teen. But I never realized quite how stereotyped many of these characters are. If I have to hear about how how gold and lovely Laurana and Goldmoon's hair is, I think I will scream.

Dragons of the Dwarven Depths, the first novel in the Lost Chronicles trilogy, will fill in critical gaps in the original Chronicles saga (Dragons of Autumn Twilight, Dragons of Winter Night, and Dragons of Spring Dawning), the classic trilogy that started the Dragonlance phenomenon in the mid-1980s.With well over 100 novels, anthologies, reference guides, and role-playing games set in the Dragonlance realm, Krynn is arguably the most richly historied, well-traveled, and universally beloved fantasy world ever created. And like the three original Chronicles novels, Dragons of the Dwarven Depths is classic adventure fantasy: nonstop action, masterful characterization, meticulous world building, and bombshell plot twists around every corner. This is not only a must-read for longtime Dragonlance fans but also a perfect place for Dragonlance neophytes to begin their literary adventures."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It had been awhile since I read a Dragonlance novel and it was quit refreshing to do so again. Its not heavy reading, but being thought out it has just enough to chew on intellectually to satisfy the desire for a fun read.One of the ideas that popped out at me was how non-pagan the gods of Krynn seem to be (other than their multiplicity). I wonder if that is in part to Hickman being Mormon? The gods of Krynn produce a setting quite different from Forgotten Realms or many other modern fantasy novels (that I've read) since there is a morality based value system derived from Judeo-Christian theology that underlies the storyThe main plot of the story places deontology against consequentialism. It asks the age old question, does the end justify the means? Can you commit a wrong to make a right? And with holding to Krynn's idealistic value system it answers it accordingly.In a more Machiavellian world the end justifies the means, and its the strong that survive, and man is at the center of the universe existing for his own gratification at the expense of others. Which accurately describes Queen Takhisis and her minions, as well as Satan.Of course our own world isnt quite that simple, and idealistic values dont work all the time. Still it's good to be inspired and shoot for the stars."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"I haven't read a Weis and Hickman Dragonlance novel that I liked since the Legends trilogy way back when. This one drew me in, kept me on the edge of my seat, and definitely reminded me of the glory days of \\"Chronicles\\" and \\"Legends.\\" I give this book 3 1/2 out of 5 stars. In the fast-paced action leading up to the climax, I think the authors cut come corners of logic to make all of the pieces fit together nicely. Namely, when the heroes were prisoners, they were left hardly guarded and allowed to roam freely when they escaped! Also, while collectively the heroes had a major impact, individually, I would have liked to see greater individual impact. There were also quite a few misspellings, which I would not expect from this publisher. But, with that aside, this was certainly a good read, and wonderful story, and adds to the depth of the characters. I highly recommend it and eagerly look forward to the next story in the series."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"First off, do not expect Tolkien type quality from these authors. They are great storytellers and are very capable of writing an enjoyable tale.That said, I have been wanting to know what happened between the first two books in Chronicles since reading them 20 yrs ago. This book tells the tale of how the companions gained entry to the Dwarven kingdom and convinced the Dwarves to house the Pax Tharkas refugees.The story did not go as I had expected given the information from other novels and sources. The story was not consistent in several parts, however, since these are the original authors I'll take what they say as canon.The characters are not the same as they were in the Chronicles. Meaning if you read the Chronicles and the Lost Chronicles in chronological order, the characters would act differently as you changed books and back.Overall the book is good. It is not a literary masterpiece but neither was the first trilogy. If you enjoyed Chronicles, chances are you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"You should keep in mind that 3 stars is above average, and this book is certainly worth 3 stars. I would be inclined to reach for 4, but there is just way to many mistakes. As another reviewer stated, the editor must have been on vacation, or thought he was. There are typos galore, misspellings, and wrong words in a sentence. There is even a case where they use the wrong names for the characters. This is simply poor work, and not acceptable from a company like WotC. It is bad enough to the point where it becomes distracting, and takes away from the reading experience. It may not bother some, but it was very frustrating for myself.The characters are not really what they used to be either. I am not sure if it is because I am older now (as compared to 15+ years ago when I read the Chronicles Trilogy), or if they simply can't capture the magic they once did. Whatever the case, they seem more more forced onto the reader.The plot itself is good though, and has some great reading to it. I would venture to say it is about 100 pages to long, which really could have been 'un-fluffed'.Overall this is a fun romp through Krynn. And it is certainly better than some of the other stuff they have been putting out lately (story wise).Here is to hoping the next installment has an editor that is worth his pay."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"Or so the old saying goes...The dynamic writing duo of Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, proclaim otherwise, however, in their 'new' trilogy chronicling the 'lost'adventures of the Heroes of the Lance. Dragons of the Dwarven Depths is a great corollary off the original Chronicles storyline. The plot revolves around Flint's recovery of the Hammer of Kharas and Riverwind's evacuation of the Pax Tharkas slaves. Despite including the beloved Heroes, this book is really carried by the villians. The brilliant Draconian mage is exceptional in his role as primary villian in the story and I found myself reading on to see his reaction to certain situations despite the fact that I knew what the overall outcome was of the tale.Weis and Hickman have done it again, they have created a great story populated with memorable characters!"},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"Another great story in the world of Dragonlance!I was so sad at the end of the War of Souls trilogy, as I thought it meant the end of the world of Krynn for me... I was wrong, and I celebrated the day I found out that Margaret and Tracy were writing prequels. However, after the Star Wars debacle, I was slightly concerned that this was going to be a \\"Phantom Menace\\". I am glad to say it is not.This book takes place between Autumn Twilight and Winters Night, and revolves around Riverwind's evacuation of the Slave of Pax Tharkas after the rebellion, and Tanis, Raistlin, Sturm Caramon, Flint, and Tas's search for the Hammer of Kharas - used to make the Dragonlances. This book focuses largely on Flint, which awesome considering that he played a much diminished role for the majority of the series. Flint leads the companions in the search and has to deal with the dwarven bureaucracy and xenophobia in Thorbardin. Compounding the difficulty is an especially clever and ambitious draconian who has fooled the world into thinking Lord Verminard still lives. I swear, fans of Tas will love this book - as always he has some of the best lines and gets himself into the strangest situations.My only criticism, [which is not aimed at the authors] and one shared by many reviewers, is the abysmal editing. There were missing words, spelling errors, type-o's and so forth. While this does not detract from the well-conceived plot, it does slow the natural flow of the read. Hopefully the publishers will take an extra week for editing on the next instalment.Anyhow, this was a great read for fans of the series!Relic113"},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"I have been waiting for ages to see if Weiss/Hickman would fill in some of the blanks in the original Chronicles trilogy. I must say that I am not disappointed. Reading this book brought back the old feelings that made the original trilogy such an entertaining read. Weiss and Hickman just seem to have a way of drawing you into their stories and making you fall in love with their characters. The original Chronicles trilogy was one of the first series that I ever read and I have followed them through the years.

I have just finished it and would rank it as entertaining and worth reading for those who have already discovered the original Chronicles Trilogy. I am reviewing this book from an interesting perspective. I initially read the original trilogy when it was first published and have read many (but no where near all of them) books set in this realm over the years. I picked up Dragons of the Dwarven Depths after recently rereading Dragons of Autumn Twilight in theThe Annotated Chronicles (Dragonlance: Dragonlance Chronicles).What you will find in this book is 20 years of growth and experience and it will stand out as being deeper and richer. I am not one to be distracted by the editing errors mentioned by other reviewers so I cannot confirm they are present (but I don't doubt they are either). The authors seem to understand that most readers haven't seen the Autumn Twilight in some time so there is some background there but it didn't seem as heavy as other reviewers had stated. I skipped the ends of a few paragraphs and probably a page that seemed to provide nothing new about Sturm.However, I was delighted to find that this book is less like a good narrative of a game session and flowed richly like a smooth story from experienced writers. All the characters had individual depth, purpose and drive. The banter between these old friends brought you back and you seem to get a better glimpse of what is on their mind and what struggles they are really facing. All this made up for any other minor flaws mentioned or not.My only real complaint is that some of the lines by the characters were out of place. The dialog shows so much improvement over the original trilogy but leaves these more \\"game table\\" quips to stand out as rather awkward. This seemed to be spread evenly about once every 3 chapters and usually from one of the Heroes of the Lance.In summary, I am glad I read it and do feel as if I spent quality time with our favorite heroes once more."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"First, anyone who hasn't read the original chronicles trilogy will find this novel hard going and the simple fact that excellent trilogy, as well as some of the later Weis/Hickman books in the Dragonlance world are what keep the world going. When I saw they were going to write another book about the original heroes, I ordered it immediately and without hesitation. Overall I enjoyed Dragons of Dwarven Depths and realize that Weis and Hickman had to be careful not to do anything too drastic to the heroes, since the before and after were already written about. Like others have noted, ideally someone would read the original trilogy appropriately, but as someone with better memory noted, that may cause problems of its own. On the whole I'm a little tired of a fantasy world getting milked to cash in on readers and several books in this world not written by Weis or Hickman are terrible. All in all, Dragons of Dwarven Depths is a welcome, if not indulgent addition to Dragonlance."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"The number of spelling mistakes, typos, and grammatical errors in this book is off the charts. Literally, there is a glaring mistake every other page. For a major publishing house, WoC, this is unforgivable. For two authors who have been in the business for over 20 years, this is unforgivable.Not to mention that Weis and Hickman have lost the \\"essence\\" of each of their characters. Raistlin and the crew are just cardboard cutouts of their former selves.It's an easy read, and it does have its moments, so if you miss the world of Krynn, I suppose you could do worse."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"I stared at this book on the bookstore shelf for about two months before finally deciding to shell out the twenty bucks for the hardcover version. Reading a story about the old gang was just too tempting. I like others were happy to have another installment of the series with Caramon, Raistlin, Flint , Tanis and the gang for the sheer nostaligia factor. I rank the original Chronicles and Legends series as my all time favorite Fantasy books. Of course, I think that like many other reviewers who were attracted to this book, I read them when I was 13 or so. In the past 2 years I have rabidly expanded my fantasy reading to include Forgotten Realms, other DL novels and the new Eberron series along with other non \\"D&D;\\" fantasy books. I currently read 2-3 books per week in this genre.Unfortunately, I cannot in good conscience say that this was a great book. The characters seemed very one dimensional to me and the storyline was interesting, but not exciting. I understand that the placement of this book makes it difficult to have too much of a grand conflict as that would almost certainly have affected the later series. This fact makes it almost impossible to create a book with a lot of real dramatic suspense or fear of danger for the characters. Also, I am not sure if the characters were intentionally made so shallow due to the fact that they get more fleshed out in later books, or if they were underwritten.At any rate, I would have to say that I was glad to return to the familiarity of these beloved characters but left underwhelmed. It is unfortunate that the DL world allowed so many terrible books to be written under its banner because other worlds have become far more compelling. I also don't like the focus and direction of DL of the newer books on the gods (whether it is \\"the age of mortals\\" or not). DL is in sore need of another band of memorable characters/companions to keep it fresh. However, until that happens I will take this gang as long as I can get it."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"SPOILER ALERT!I felt the book was a little disappointing because it seemed to hand everything to the characters on a silver platter and they spent more time worrying about things than actually doing things.Low on action, high on worrying, and in the end everything was too convenient.But still it is a Dragonlance story and it has all the main characters together (sorta, they end up separated often) so its nice to read about them all again.I also felt there was some weird religious undertones in the start of the book that wasn't in the original Dragonlance Chronicles. That was a bit off putting."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman do a great job filling in the gaps between the first and second chronicles.

Fans of the Chronicles and the Legends will certainly enjoy the added stories that Weis and Hickman are giving us. This book is especially good if you're a fan of Flint.There is some poor editing in the book, more than normal I'd say. Also, if you haven't read any Dragonlance books yet, don't read this one, as you'll just be confused--there is little to no explanation given for the current events. Start with \\"Dragons of Autumn Twilight\\" and go from there.On the whole, I loved every minute of it."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"To Ms. Weis and Mr. Hickman:Loved this installment. Fire your editor.Your Friend,Me"},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"Frankly, I was inspired to pen this review based on the average 4 star rating this book has received. The rating is incredibly misleading for anyone looking to purchase this book. I am a huge fan of the original series and the Dragonlance game world inspired by it for TSR's Dungeons and Dragons. The \\"Chronicles\\" books, though a pretty thorough Tolkien knock-off (well, most fantasy novels are), were hugely popular for a good reason. They told a very inspiring and engaging tale. Dragons of the Dwarven Depths does neither.First, I'm really going under the assumption that Weiss and Hickman did not actually write this book. I'm doing so to protect my image of these once talented authors. With the number of pages each has churned out over their career, I would fully expect their craft to improve, not drop off a steep cliff of purely amateur tedium. The book is rife with typographical errors. In some cases words are missing completely from sentences, mangling the meaning. In other cases, incorrect words and improper verb tense is used. Sure, I understand this is an editor's job, but frankly the writer needs to take some pride in their work as well. If I were a professional writer, I'd be embarrassed if something like this came out with my name on it. The list is too great to present here, but a few gems: \\"At least Tika'd had...\\" \\"Gilthanas forget his complaints about the cold...\\" etc.At one point, an entire portion of the story seems to have been left out. Granted, I was skimming after slogging through about 250 pages word for word so I may have missed something. But when the refugees leave the valley, one small group is determined to stay behind (Hederick was disappointed that \\"so few\\" chose to stay). However, when the valley is attacked, the other group is wondering how long before the attackers discover the valley is empty. Sure enough, the other group then rejoins the first. I suppose the omniscient author told them the other group had left the valley empty...Second, reading this book I got the consistent feeling that I was simply reading some marginally talented writer's description of his previous night sitting at an RPG game table. This is fine and good for some, but I expect to see this on some buried webpage and not in a printed paperback from a respected publisher. The entire work is written from a completely omniscient point of view. Character's inner thoughts are mixed frequently with the dialog and the omniscient narrator even makes their OWN remarks within the text. The end result is an incredibly muddled point of view and one which completely destroys any sort of dramatic tension or intrigue.The book liberally breaks an old writing maxim - \\"show don't tell\\". If you want to know what that means and why it is important, buy this book. You will completely understand why this is such a literary sin after the first 20 to 30 pages. The first 100 pages or more consists of jarring point of view shifts from one characters inner thoughts to the next. My only guess is this is to perform some sort of character description dump to provide an explanation for who these characters are instead of just teling the story and letting them reveal who they are in the process. At one point in the book, the story even shifts freely to the antagonists' point of view and describes precisely how the antagonist have plotted against the heroes. The very next chapter has the heroes \\"wondering if they are in a trap.\\" Really? I'm on the edge of my seat here...I have never read a book which tried to utilize this point of view and I even believe it has been utterly mis-applied in many cases in this work. It has a dry journalistic feel which again conjures images of some bored Dungeon Master giving a recap of the previous game's events to his buddies around a gaming table. As I mentioned, fine for some amateur's blog, but hardly worthy of a printed book.The characters, as even many of those who incredulously gave this book 4 stars have noted, are all poor facsimiles of their former selves. The banter back and forth hardly fits each character in this well established series. The dry and monotonous explanations of their past and the constant mind probing \\"insights\\" for their behavior is just completely unnecessary and unwelcome. In most cases it also makes each character seem shallow and one-dimensional, which I gather is quite the opposite effect that was intended.I gave the book two stars but only because I was a huge fan of the original series and the information within could be useful for background info in a Dragonlance RPG campaign. If you are just looking for a good read, spend your money elsewhere."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"simply amazing! you would understand the story better if you read weis&hickman's dragons of autumn twilight, dragons of winter night, and dragons of spring dawning first. overall this was a really great read!"},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"For those of you who read the chronocles series in the eighties or nineties and reread this beside those books, the author's writing style has matured considerably, but at the same time it appears that they have decided to pad out events to a large extent. In short, this book is not very exciting, although will be a trip down memory lane for those in need of one. There are no cliffhangers in the entire book of note.Do not read this book unless you are a fan of Flint, or at least Tasslehoff (who isn't?). The book seems designed to give Flint more \\"screen time\\" as he doesnt make it to the end of the chronocles series.I would say this book is worse than anything in the chronocles trilogy, the legends trilogy, or the soulforge. If you have already read those, you will probably better enjoy Dragons of the Highlord Skies, the follow-up to this effort. In short, this book is like an old friend who is familiar, comforting, but possibly not as interesting as you remembered."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"It pleases me to no end that the authors found it in themselves to tell another story involving the original heroes. It's like finding a forgotten video tape of old friends. Years ago, I remember expecting to find more detail about what happened to the companions by reading the second Chronicles book, Dragons of Winter Night. The new story is a good sign that there is still a place for the world they forged so long ago.The heroes begin another epic journey in a land unaware of an approaching army. Safe travel is not guaranteed, the characters are challenged to thier wits end, and cell phone chargers don't exist here. I enjoy the imagery descriptions and character interaction for the different settings. It really feels that I've visited the fantastic places they write about.If you can get a used copy of Karen Wynn Fonstad's Atlas of Krynn, it will serve as a visual treat during the journey this book takes you on.Thank you Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman for the magic ruby spectacles!"},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"If you loved the original Chronicles, you will love this too. It reads and feels like it was written at the same time as the originals. All your favorite characters are true. The plot is new and fills in the gaps between the first 2 books of the older trilogy. I am overjoyed that Weis and Hickman are doing this type of work and I look forward to the rest of the series.On the other hand, if you are new to Dragonlance, pick up the Chronicles Series first. In my oipinion, it is the pinnacle derivative acheivement of basic fantasy writing that began with Tolkien. That is not meant as a negative comment. Rather, since all fantasy is basically derived from Tolkien, the Chronicles ranks as the best series based upon his concepts. Certainly Jordan and Goodkind are great also, but their work is a little too far removed from basic fantasy to compare with Dragnolance. Dragonlance is simpler, yet often more poignant, and all-in-all way fun and much more accessible for the times when you need something a little easier to read (in between a mammoth Wheel of Time or Sword of Truth epic)."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"It has been a while since I've read any Dragonlance novels. I very much enjoyed this series and re-visiting these charactors."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman is the first novel in the Lost Chronicles trilogy. For fans of the Dragonlance universe, the Lost Chronicles represent time between the original Chronicles books. In this case, this book takes place between the events of Dragons of Autumn Twilight and Dragons of Winter Dawning. So, those readers who have read those two books will understand the story very well. Before I go further, if this book interests you at all, I think you should read the Dragonlance Chronicles before you read this book. Why? Well, for one those are he first stories involving these characters, but more importantly you will have a deeper understanding of some of the things that happen in this book.The plot itself is typical Weis & Hickman. It's well laid out and concise with not a lot of extra stuff thrown in. I liken this book to putting on your favorite pair of old shoes. No matter when you last wore them, they still feel great when you put them on again. The story of the hammer of Kharas has long been talked about in Dragonlance circles and finally it has come to fruition. As I was reading this I could tell that Weis and Hickman had long thought about this plot line as it was just so well done and fleshed out.The characters in this novel and exactly what Dragonlance fans would expect. All the familiar faces are present. In terms of character development there is not really a whole lot, except for Flint's character. This is for a couple reasons. It's had to develop characters that have been through several series and then come back to them at a point in the middle of the first trilogy and develop them a little without throwing something off down the road. So, I really wasn't expecting too much in this area, but what I got I was pleased with.Now, I do have a bit of contention with the characters and this happened more than once. First, I need to say I am a huge fan of the Chronicles and the characters. I have read the Chronicles several times. Yet, when I was reading this book something felt \`of' to me. It took me about fifty pages to realize what it was. There are several instances during this book where the dialog of the characters in no way matches how they spoke in previous books. I am not talking about little \`oops' in dialog. I am talking whole sections that in no way fit what the characters have always sounded like and said. At times it was so glaring that it made me stop reading and I had to re-read the section to make sure I read it right. Now, some people may not think this is a big deal, but to the traditional Dragonlance fan will understand exactly what I mean when they read this book.Don't get me wrong, I still really enjoyed this book, the dialog just really through me off at times. If you are a new fan to the Dragonlance universe and want the most \`complete' experience. I may suggest reading the Dragonlance Chronicles book 1 first and then reading this book, followed by the Chronicles book 2. That would give you the complete story without having to \`go back' so to speak.Overall, I enjoyed this book and am eagerly looking forward to the next one to be released in July, 2007. Fans of fantasy should all read the Chronicles books. They are truly a great story and one that has endured the test of time over and over again. I, for one, am happy to revisit the characters that I grew up with."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's Dragons of Autumn Twilight was the first \\"true\\" fantasy novel I ever read. This was the book that made me fall in love with the genre, and I never looked back! Much like the first girl you kiss, these two authors have always held a special place in my heart. Even though they haven't written anything that really capture the imagination since the conclusion of The Deathgate Cycle in 1994, I always give them the benefit of the doubt and purchase their new books/series. Sadly, since then Weis and Hickman (together, solo, or with other collaborators) have produced works of average quality at best.:-(Their last Dragonlance offering, The War of Souls trilogy, was a far cry from their popular Dragonlance Chronicles and Legends. This new series, The Lost Chronicles, will explore some of the storylines that were not part of the narrative of the original main sequence. Hence, it boded well for fans eager to see Weis and Hickman recapture their erstwhile excellence. After all, they were going back to their old stomping grounds, the world of Krynn, during the War of the Lance.Honestly, I was pretty excited myself! For fans of the original series, this opportunity to go back in time and once again follow the adventures of the Companions is quite a kick. Characters such as Tanis, Raistlin Majere, Sturm Brightblade, Laurana, and Tasslehoff Burrfoot have all left an indelible mark in the fantasy genre.The predominant problem with Dragons of the Dwarven Depths lies in the fact that there's nowhere near enough material to make a full-length novel. At best, this should have been a novella. Personally, I believe it would have worked best as a short story such as the ones Weis and Hickman came up with for the Tales trilogy.There is so much \\"filler\\" in this book. . . I couldn't quite believe it. There are unnecessary portions filling us in on the back story. Given the fact that one needs to have read the original Dragonlance Chronicles, these parts of the narrative are totally obsolete. Add to that the inordinate amount of time spent journeying and I estimate that a good 50% of the novel could be excised without readers losing much of the story.The second shortcoming of this book lies in the selection of the plotline that would serve as its backdrop. The search for the Hammer of Kharas was not part of the original saga, and there's a good reason why it was only alluded to in Dragons of Winter Night. It was only part of the Dragonlance roleplaying modules because the storyline wasn't that interesting to begin with. As I mentioned, not enough material. . .Nevertheless, the narrative flows well enough, though the writing is a bit clunky at times. Although it's fun to be reunited with the characters we have grown to love, the fact that nothing really happens throughout the novel makes it hard to maintain our level of interest. I'm afraid that even Tass can't save this one.My hopes for the forthcoming Dragons of the Highlord Skies are somewhat higher, what with the search of the dragon orb storyline and the presence of Lord Soth. I mean, come on! This one has to be good!Hence, as fun as it is to go back in time and return to the events that marked the beginning of the War of the Lance, Dragons of the Dwarven Depths is a disappointing effort."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"It felt good to read another tale of the Companions, years after I thought their saga had wound down. I was extremely excited to see that Weis and Hickman were going back in time and finally filling in the gaps that were left when the Chronicles were first written.This book picks up right where Dragons of Autumn Twilight left off, and bridges the gap right up until the first page of Dragons of Winter Night. We follow Raistlin, Sturm, and Caramon (as well as tag-alongs Tas and Tika) to the ruins of Skullcap as they search for the keys to the gates of Thorbardin. The latter half of the book sees Flint accepting his destiny and venturing to recover the legendary Hammer of Kharas.As one might expect, this book does a good job of foreshadowing events from the second 2 books of the Chronicles. We're given some interesting sights into Flint's aging mind, as well as some of Raistin's confused inner-dialogue. The first half of the book also does a good job of portraying Tika's feelings for Caramon.At points, I felt as if the book lagged somewhat. Although some chapters do a great job of furthering character development, some of the sidebar storylines seem like a bit of wasted time, and some of the narrative feels more like an AD&D; dungeon crawl than a novelization by experienced writers. Above all else, I would have liked to see more substance come out of the trip to Skullcap.My biggest complaint with this novel is the fact that it was plagued with terrible editing. Hopefully this will be corrected in later editions. At times names are spelled incorrectly, and grammer errors can be found in nearly every chapter.Although this book had it's flaws, I would still recommend it to anyone who wishes to complete their collection of the core Dragonlance novels, and I look forward to the next two books in this series."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"This is a great first book, however words are mis-spelled, in the wrong order, or just don't make sense.

Kindle or the publisher should lower the cost or fix the problems."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"I know some enjoyed the War of Souls, but it wasn't my favorite trilogy in the DL world, nor do I rank it anywhere near the original Chronicles that \\"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths\\" is trying to emulate. It felt slightly whiny, the characters argued nonstop about every little detail, and the characters themselves were shallow despite what could have been an interesting plot. I really feel the same thing happened here for a good chunk as well.It's a good plot, a plot that has the horrible prequel feeling because you know how it all ends, but a good one. The old companions that we know and some of which we love are back, but are stuck between novels and worse, stuck in a valley with a few hundred starving friends and nowhere to go. Thus, they decide to journey to the ever sealed dwarvish kingdom of Thorbardin and ask if they can stay over, sleep on the couch, you know...just until they can get a job and get their own place...what are friends for, little buddies? But the dwarves don't like freeloaders, so they tell Tanis and company to go do some chores: mow the mushroom fields, clean the chainmail, feed the giant worms, find the legendary Hammer of Kharas that has been lost for 300 years, stuff like that.So good plot and, !surprise! a good villain actually. Dragons and draconians provide for some nice menace and action despite the fact we already know that no one can die and the general boringness of hero versus six goblin fights. The main villain, an Aurak magic using draconian called Dray-yan that is pretending to be the presently very dead High Lord of the Red Dragon Army has probably the best scenes in the whole novel since we don't have any preconceived perceptions about him (the worst go to Riverwind who does the most among out whiny).And THAT is really where this novel hurts. The characters are hit or miss and they just don't seem like the OLD companions. If you don't hit the old beats exactly, then you're in trouble, and Weis and Hickman missed them many times. Raistlin isn't enigmatic but is more spoiled brat. Caramon isn't a trouble brother but a complete moron. Sturm is a jerk, Tika a jealous girlfriend that doesn't like the fact her possible boyfriend dares to have other responsibilities, and Tasslehoff...well Tas actually has a little bit of Jar Jar Binks going.But, luckily for you and for me, the vast majority of those misses happen in the first \\"book\\" or first 200 pages. That was a drudge to read through but the last 200 are a complete joy. The characters are mostly on, the action is nice, the villains are around, Raistlin is smart and pained not a jerk, Tas is funnier than his Jar Jar beginnings, and everyone generally does something interesting to see that the quest succeeds.Final Thought: Its fun to remember and to see those old characters when they shine through. Don't expect a whole slew of wild adventures and you should come out of the novel pleased with what you read. If you get through the whining and praying for the gods to save them in the beginning, you'll find some of the old Chronicles at the end. Hopefully the second novel of the trilogy continues how this one ended.Added Thought: Please do not tell new DL readers/friends to read these chronologically. \\"Chronicles\\", \\"Legends\\", then they can come back for these. It contains a great deal of \\"Legends\\" info for some reason that would help ruin them."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"I'm a long time fan of The Companions, and Hickman and Weis picked up the characters again like they never stopped, but the one complaint that I have is the horrible editing.

It's nearly seamless with the other books, Dragons of Autumn Twilight and Dragons of Winter Night, and could theoretically be read in between them with no continuity problems to the reader. However, there are lots of hints to the Legends trilogy (Fistandantilus, The Abyss, Dougan Redhammer) that those who have already read these series can appreciate the little drop ins. It's always good to see the Companions at work again, though, as always, Raistlin, Flint and Tasselhoff steal the show. The other characters are there, but mostly in a minor role, especially Laurana, Goldmoon and Elistan. Though with a title of \\"Dwarven Depths\\", it's no wonder that Flint takes center stage.All in all, a great book and I can't wait to see the next in a year!"},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"I can't help but compare this to the original Dragonlance Chronicles series \\"Dragons of Autumn Twilight\\", \\"Dragons of Winter Night\\", and \\"Dragons of Spring Dawning\\". The originals had rich descriptions and characters with various personality aspects, motivations, and conflicts. \\"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths\\" is just not at all the same in terms of depth; the descriptions are brief, the characters relatively shallow.More than that, fans of the original series will notice that some of the characters in \\"Dwarven Depths\\" behave in uncharacteristic ways. Perhaps the characters in the Dragonlance series were always *meant* to be the way they were portrayed in this book, and maybe it was the *original series* that didn't convey what the authors or editors wanted to include. Regardless, the difference between the personalities in the original series and in \\"Dwarven Depths\\" is unsettling at times.I don't know if the relatively poor quality of this book's because of bad writing or bad editing, or for whatever reason, but I will definitely say \\"Dwarven Depths\\" is just not at all of the same quality as the iconic original Dragonlance Chronicles. If I were to consider this book on its own merits, I would not purchase it.

I have always enjoyed the Dragonlance books that dealt more closely with Flint and the dwarves and their mountain home, and Dragons of the Dwarven Depths definitely delivers in that area. I thought the book was great and very much enjoyed reading it, although the editing was absolutely horrible. Like a few others have already mentioned there are quite a few misplaced words and others are just simply left out all together. I was very disappointed in this as it was not what I expected or remembered from previous Margaret Weis & Tracy Hickman books. Regardless, if you can get past the editorial shortcomings, Dragons of the Dwarven Depths is a very entertaining book and the first volume in The Lost Chronicles trilogy. I am looking forward to reading the next two books (although having to wait a full year for the next book to come out is a real bummer) and I'm really hoping the editing is much better on the two following releases."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"I wanted sooo bad for this book to take me far away just as the originals did. Well, I've been let down before so I wasn't surprised when I grudgingly had to admit that this volume in the chronicles series was just plain boring. That's not to say that it didn't have it's moments, it was fun to read about the scheming draconian, but that was about all that kept me going. The migration of the slaves into thorbardin was dreadfully slow and uninteresting. The companions travelling by way of skullcap showed promise, but eventually fell apart into ridiculous plot threads that felt contrived and, well, the whole novel just felt like the authors needed some cash and came up with a ho-hum adventure in true crashcourse fasion. It really is an uninspired effort to say the least, and that's a shame cause as far as i'm concerned there was a huge opportunity here to re-create the magic. Thorbardin, Skullcap, the hammer of Kharas, draconian generals, Hederic; all these elements, with all the potential for a fun, great adventure, are sadly wasted. Even the rich personalities we discovered in our heroes the first time around are nearly non-existent. They all seem like pale, diluted ghosts of the companions of the lance, and this in itself made me feel almost heartbroken, like a part of my childhood had lied to me...I'll be fair and say that there were one or two moments outside of the draconians that I had fun with, and i guess the read is worth it if you are a completist as I am. It gave me a small sense of satisfaction in that one regard. But overall, immature and insulting to a true fan that has helped to make Weiss & Hickman as notable as they are by supporting their fantastic world from the beginning.

Second book in this series was much better"},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"Not being familiar with other installments of the Dragonlance Chronicles, I took this on and am evaluating on a standalone book. I thought the storyline was straight forward. A group of refugees from a draconian prison have escaped and have to flee their caves to the dwarven stronghold in the mountains. Their draconian pursuers chase them to the mountains. When they reach it, there is treachery afoot with some of the dwarves. The main plotline that breaks out of this is the dwarf Flint must find the fabled Hammer of Kharas. The plot was, although simple, well-thought out. There was sufficient action and intrigue, but I wasn't wowed by the characters. Sturm the knight was a caricature. Raistlin the mage was one of the weakest wizards I've come across. His brother had about as much personality as a sack of potatoes, and Tasslehoff was the worst character I've seen since Jar Jar Binks. I can't compare this to other books in the series and how it falls into all of it, but it was reasonably entertaining, just not exceptional in any way.Carl Alves - author of Blood Street"},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"As all the books written by Hickman and Weis I enjoyed it greatly.

The next book Highlord Skies has been much better."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"This review looks at the Kindle version of \\"Dragons of Dwarven Depths\\" by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman.Fantasy readers should not begrudge Weis and Hickman for returning to the story that started the Dragonlance franchise but they should have concerns. Far better writers have failed to recapture past magic when they returned to past subjects (for example, Hemingway's \\"The Dangerous Summer\\" simply can not live up to the same ground he covered before in \\"Death in the Afternoon\\"). Thankfully Weis and Hickman avoid the major pitfalls. This book does not take any luster off the original Dragonlance Chronicles.\\"Dragons of Dwarven Depths\\" is a solid if unspectacular addition to the series. There is a certain joy in seeing beloved characters interact with one another and the writers send more than a few knowing winks the reader's way since we know more about the plot than the characters do at this point.Some of the best parts of the Dragonlance series focused on the intimate moments; when the companions seemed more concerned with their own survival and what was in front of them than the epic wars for control of Krynn. Weis and Hickman are able to present some very good scenes when they can think small; when Tika and Tas face dangers; when Raistlin, Caramon and Sturm explore a dungeon; when Tanis and Flint look for a lost city. When Weis and Hickman try to show the bigger picture (for example, Riverwind leading an army of refugees or an in-depth take on dwarf tribal politics), the authors simply lose the narrative and the reader loses interest.There remain some problems with the book. This book suffers from poor editing; poor copy editing and poor plot editing. One of the chief reasons Weis and Hickman split the Companions apart in \\"Dragons of Winter's Night\\" is they could not focus on character development when there are too many actors on the stage at once. That's a problem here since Tanis, Tas, Flint, Caramon, Raistlin, Laurana, Tika, Sturm, Riverwind, Goldmoon, Elistan, Gilthanas, even Hedrik the Theocrat. not to mention a host of new dwarven characters and villains, fight for page time. Tolstoy may have been able to pull the strings on so many puppets but Weis and Hickman simply are not up to that level. For example, the first part of the novel shows more focus and depth on Tika than almost any other part of the series. She's invisible the second half of the book. One has to also concede that the first half of the book is much more gripping than the second half-and no, that has nothing to do with Tika.Despite these flaws, the authors are able to hold the book together through good characters and a decent enough plot. If Weis and Hickman did nothing to take the series to greater heights in this book, they at least did not tarnish their previous glories.I gave the book four stars--but I have to give a lower ranking to the Kindle version. Words blend into one. Spelling mistakes not in the original book can be found in the Kindle version. Spacing is atrocious as paragraphs are jammed together. This comes off as amateurishness and readers should expect better from the published of a well established series like Dragonlance."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"Well, it goes like this ~ I'm happily spending my afternoon reading until I get to page 292 where I notice that pages 293 thru 340 are missing and 40 pages of a different novel, The Measure and the Truth, by Douglas Niles had been inserted.At first I'm peeved and wondering how long it would take to get a 'corrected' book from Amazon. But being the impatient person I am, I decided not to ask for a new book and to just keep on reading knowing I could pick up the gist of the story as I went along.Missing pages or not, I enjoy reading anything Weis & Hickman write.I would have given more stars, but, well, there are the missing pages."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"I had missed that they started this new triology.

But now we are fortunate enough to have Dragons of Dwarven Depths, which tells us of the companions' adventures between Autumn Twilight and Winter Night. But Dragons of Dwarven Depths is much different than the Chronicles...In the Beginning it tells how the refugees from Pax Tharkas cannot spend the winter in the valley they currently occupy for various reasons, one of which is that their enemies have found the valley. In hopes to find shelter for the refugees, the companions journey to find the lost underground city of Thorbardin, all except for Sturm, Raistlin, and Caramon who head for Skullcap in search for a secret way into Thorbardin. Later on Tika and Tas join Sturm, Raistlin and Caramon. At Skullcap Sturm puts on a cursed helm and is convinced he is a former prince of Thorbardin, with the help of the former prince (Sturm), the adventurers meet up with their companions, and find their way in (at the expense of losing the \\"Gate\\" which is actually a huge door, off the side of the mountain). When in the mountain, Flint Fireforge meets with the god Reorx and learns he is destined to find the famed Hammer of Karas, which had been lost to the dwarven thanes for many, many, many years. Unfortunately the current prince of Thorbardin, Arman Karas, thinks himself the one chosen to find the hammer. Who will get the hammer in the end? I certainly can't tell you! But this is only half the story. Dray-yan, a draconian magic-user, has an idea, what if he pretended to be the Dragon Highlord Verminarrd? No one but him and a fellow draconian know the real Dragon Highlord is dead. He plans to be triumphant in what Verminarrd failed at. Winning the world for the Dark Queen. Through this plot he plans to win the favor of the Queen of Darkness, Takhisis', for his race. And that is all I can tell you with a summary.But what I can tell you is that this book is different from any of the Chronicles. For one, the Chronicles always focus on all the characters. And although I did not mention him much in the earlier summary paragraph, Flint Fireforge is probably the main character of this book. It is because the whole outcome of the story is up to flint that I think this book focuses on mainly one character. Something that never happened in a single Chronicles book.One of my favorite parts in this book is when Raistlin's questioning and study of the mushrooms of Thorbardin pays off when the Thanes of Thorbardin attempt to poison the companions' dinner by putting mushrooms only safe in ale in soup. Raistlin managed to tell the companions in time, but if he hadn't...let's just say that Dragons of Winter Night would be rather confusing. This part is a favorite because it shows that smarts can save your life where brute strength cannot.This book is a real interesting, because it opens your eyes to what can happen between Autumn Twilight and Winter Night. And I would recommend it to any Dragonlance fan or otherwise."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"i just finished this book and i got so caught in the excitement that i couldent take my eyes off the pages anyway this book is mostly aboat refugees trying to escape the dragon highlord vermeneered or something i forgot how to spell his name as i was saying they are trying to escape from him with 800 slaves that he forced to mine and make weapons. the plot is, is for these refugee's to find thorbidden a city under the mountain named cloudseeker [a dwarven city]. they try to get the refugees of 800 males females and children into the safety of the city but as little as they know theres a war undergroun to find the sacred hammer of khares. tas raistlin sturm and tanis also flint [main charcters]. they try to agree with the dwarven thanes [rulers of thobidden] to let the refugee's in thorbidden.they find out that the sacred hammer of khares the one they have to get to get the refugees in thorbiddin is also the only one that can forge the dragonlance's [a magical sword]to defeat the dragons and draconins [half lizird half man beast's]. so now u got the main idea i hope u enjoy the series like i can :) :) :)."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"Really tells the whole story of the Heros of the Lance in the best way that weiss and Hickman can do."},{"Title":"Dragons of the Dwarven Depths: The Lost Chronicles, Volume I (Lost Chronicles Trilogy)","review":"It was nice to read about the old crew in a new writing.

There is a reason those missing gaps, as they are called, are only mentioned upon in the novel and never gone over in detail. That's because there isn't anything more to tell us. To go back and try to micro manage a story to death doesn't leave anything to our imagination. After a while it just becomes a paycheck for the people writing these stories and it loses it creative appeal. Be content with the original Chronicles and Legends.

What makes a Baltimore album - the elaborate fruit and flower appliqu&eacute; patterns - doesn't allow for much creativity of design for the quilter. Or does it? Jane Townswick undertakes in her new book to show how quilters can put new wine in old bottles by ringing changes on traditional album blocks. Starting with a significant example of the style, an 1857 quilt from New York state belonging to the State Historical Association, Townswick shows the reader how to update and vary the traditional blocks in the quilt for a fresh and contemporary look that still is clearly in the Baltimore tradition. Townswick also uses fabric selection to update her look, and the effects of including Skydyes and other contemporary fabrics are refreshing and new. The book is full of tricks and techniques for easier appliqu&eacute;.

The book is packed with information on how one can take an antique quilt block and update it.

That is an advantage sometimes if you don't need to wade through all the heavy artillery in \\"Numerical Recipes\\". Algorithms are given as pseudocode, and Fortran code which are easily transcribed into any language, such as VBA. I have owned this since 1980 and this is one of the more heavily worn references on my bookshelf. If you just need to quickly understand and code an algorithm, this is a great book to have handy. I see that used copies are cheap, and available. I recommend grabbing a copy.

It focuses on the life of Marie Balter, a rigorously troubled woman. Marie begins her life as an adopted child and shortly after becomes mentally ill. She spent the first twenty years of her life traveling from mental institution to mental institution. The novel focuses on her experiences while being hospitalized. It is powerful and bleak, but at the same time, it is also an encouraging and uplifting story. Marie later goes on to recover and earn her Master's degree from Harvard University.The book features black and white images of Marie's adoptive family, herself, and some of the hospitals in which she had stayed.It was a very grim awakening for me, and I wouldn't recommend the book to everyone.

At age 17, an indigent, directionless, orphaned Marie entered a mental hospital that would become her home for the next 20 years, save for a few brief periods on the outside. The story, co-authored with psychologist Richard Katz, is told from a childlike perspective. The 20-year-old Marie is no more self-aware than a child, and certainly no more fit for the world. She likes the routine of the hospital, enjoys helping the staff in exchange for cigarettes, but makes progress sporadically. During her tenure at the Castle in the 1950's and 1960's, she was subjected to experimental drug treatments before finding her way, finishing high school and college, getting a job, and preparing for graduate school.Balter doesn't consider those 20 years to be \\"lost,\\" and now uses her experiences as a guest lecturer on the subject of treatment for the mentally ill. Balter's memoir is an excellent counterpoint to Susanna Kaysen's Girl, Interrupted, which is a short memoir about that author's 1967 stay in a mental hospital in the greater Boston area (Balter, too, is from the area)."},{"Title":"The value of post occupancy evaluation to the architect in government (Architectural Media monograph series)","review":"After reading Marie's encounters, it gave hope to all MI.

It was written in the midst of the happenings describing much of the madness while it was going on.The letters were smuggled to the recipient, A. R.

So, the units jump from metric to english depending on the model and words such as whilst are sprinkled throughout the text. The first issue is somewhat annoying as I am used to thinking in English units. Also, the transmission application guide is incorrect (because it is for Australian vehicles).I am only concerned about C4/C5 transmissions...so my nitpicks are regarding those. One, the gear ratios for the C4/C5 are wrong, which doesn't instill me with much confidence. Two, the intermediate band adjustment is given as the same for C4/C5 transmissions. The C4 requires you to turn the screw CCW 1 3/4 turns, the C5 is 4 turns. Lastly, the pictures aren't of the best quality...poor lighting and unfocused pictures abound. I must say though, almost all of the other models have satisfactory illustrations, it seems the C4/C5 is exception to the rule.In summary, I would buy this book if you are going to rebuild one of the transmissions that are held within, but I also suggest buying Haynes \\"Ford Automatic Transmission Overhaul Manual: Models Covered: C3, C4, C5, C6 and AOD Rear Wheel Drive Transmissions, ATX\\", which I consider to be superior to the Ellery manual."},{"Title":"Transmission Repair Book Ford 1960 to 2007: Automatic and Manual","review":"This book is a must for Ford people!!!

Walmsley demonstrates, in interesting and readable prose, how previous assessments of Hutchinson have too often been influenced by the biased and facile rhetoric of his Bostonian peers. Dr. Walmsley successfully portrays Hutchinson as a political and social actor and victim of the tumultuous Boston scene. Through his writing we are able to conceive of Hutchinson as a man who acted for both personal and political reasons. Hutchinson cannot be so easily characterized as simply a placeman for the British. Neither was he a villain who delighted in crushing Boston's radical crowd. Rather, Walmsley shows that Hutchinson was a very human figure who often found himself caught between the intransigence of British colonial policy and the self-serving rhetoric of the Boston radical elite. I recommend this book to both laymen and professionals alike."},{"Title":"Thomas Hutchinson and the Origins of the American Revolution (American Social Experience Series)","review":"Dr. Walmsley has given this generation of readers a frank and new look at one of the central characters of the American revolutionary era.

Him being a \\"lay economist\\" by admission would've made it all the better for him to truly explain to the rest of us non-economists exactly how the deals went down and what the salient details of them were without burying us in economic details that only an econ professor or policy wonk would enjoy. Unfortunately, he errs completely on the side of glossing everything over. At the beginning, I chalked it up to him \\"leading in\\" to the rest of the stories which I thought would have more detail. The more I read; however, the more I was left with the nagging feeling that there wasn't much behind what he had to say besides just stories. I firmly believe that the U.S. does burden countries through overwhelming \\"loans\\" backed up with guarantees of buying U.S. product, but where is the proof? Either John Perkins did much less as an EHM than he let on, or he's making a lot of things up.My other impression of this book is of someone who wants us to take pity on him for \\"giving it all up\\" and then lectures us at the end of the book as to how we can change our lives and change the world for the better. My response is \\"Mr. Perkins, if you saw this as such a noble fight, why didn't you get out long before you became wealthy?\\" Yes, we understand that you \\"had\\" to take the lucrative hush money that came in the way of expert witness fees so you could put together a college fund for your daughter, but we ALL face these types of decisions and if you truly felt slimy for taking the money, you should've stopped long before you did. Further more, why not donate most of YOUR money and time to the cause, instead of starting up independent power companies? What are YOU doing to change the system you so easily helped establish?

John Perkins has written an amazing book. It offers a first person, inside-look at a network of individuals, banks and corporations operating quietly around the world whose goal seems to be to bring everyone in the world under their control. Terrifying. This book kept me from sleeping for nights. Because it is a personal account, it is all the more real. The author writes of his experiences in countries such as Ecuador, Panama and Saudi Arabia amongst others. We are introduced to leaders in some of these countries who had the courage to stand up to this Corporatocracy and the United States - and who ended up dying under suspicious circumstances.Much of what the author writes is not going to be on the 6 o'clock news in America. Our television stations, newspapers and magazines are all owned by huge corporations that have their own agendas. We, as Americans need to wake up and speak out. We need to educate ourselves. And we need to get the word out. Too many Americans simply do not have any idea what is really going on around them.This is an important book. Read it and pass it on."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Six years in Belize (1999-2005)convinced me that Perkins is right on. He can't be totally specific or he'll be sued for libel. So you have to give him some leeway. But I watched Fortis, a Canadian Co. bribe their way to building one, two, soon to be three hydroelectric dams -- a total economic failure for Belize. How could this happen? Perkins explains it.It's interesting to see the spin that the US Corporatocracy (represented, of course, by some of our reviewers here) puts on the book to discredit it.If you want to see how the US victimizes third-world countries, you should include this book in your research."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman offers great insight into the perspective often expressed by Central and South American leaders in regard to U.S. economic imperialism. The author does use unnamed sources that are unverifiable, and at times creates fictional scenes (as the book says, some conversations did not exactly happen, but were pieced together to reveal what the author learned), but these scenes do effectively illustrate his points, as long as the reader keeps their nature in mind. In any case, I recommend the book because it covers some lesser-known recent history and shows how U.S. corporations can use their power to establish themselves in third world countries, often at the expense of local citizens. However, I warn against using the book as the only source of information on the issues discussed because there are many other perspectives."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I enjoyed the way the author tied details of modern history to the events of his life. Very thought provoking. I think it is striking the way the individuals who critique it for a lack of statistics provide none of their own."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"During college I came across numerous critiques and debates over the negative aspects of globalization on \\"emerging countries\\" in how often times quality of life is worsened, not improved for the local populous. In this respect, Perkins's insights are not revolutionary. However, his discussion of how unchecked personal greed leads to the intertwining of political and financial interests to create a new global empire is fascinating. This new global empire, deemed the \\"corporatocracy\\", seeks to advance the interests of unbridled capitalism (read: corporate greed) through a combination of economic and military pressures. What's truly fascinating, and frankly shocking, is that this omnipresent greed is often not the work of handful conspirators, but rather the product of a system that equates materialism and consumption with economic and social development. That's not to say there aren't appalling examples of cloak and dagger conspiracies and purposeful manipulations, such as American support of the House of Saud, the Panamanian invasion, support for the Iranian Shah, and Halliburton in Iraq, but the truly sickening examples are the pervasive and far more subtle manipulations engendered by a system driven by consumption. This book exposes how special interest groups manipulate perception to advance personal interests at the expense of long-term national security and global stability.This book is not \\"political\\" in the sense that it is a criticism of the current administration, or favors Democrats over Republicans, but rather is an indictment of all drivers of global empire, which includes government, media, and finance heads across the political spectrum. Moreover, this is not a criticism of America as some might suggest. It is a criticism of a perversion of the American ideals of freedom, equality, and the pursuit of happiness with the pursuit of ever-increasing consumption. This consumption fuels our need for natural resources, which in turn drives our foreign and economic policies leading to corruption and abuse of our power as the world's sole Super Power. It helps illuminate how this abuse has created many of America's enemies, because our dependence on foreign resources has forced us to create this global empire with little regard for those we seek to bring into our spheres of influence. This unsustainable empire building poses far greater risks to the U.S. than any individual terrorist or rogue nation threat because it is this reckless imperialism that destroys empires. Confessions of an EHM is essential reading to understand how the greed of our past continues to drive the current geopolitical instability. Open your eyes to prevent history repeating itself for the next generation!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I wanted to like this book because I wanted the message to be important. But, to be fair, even though I tend to believe the message, I tend not to believe this particular messenger. Therefore, I can't, in good conscience, endorse this book. However, as a platform for talking about the greater message in books like this one, and in this volume itself, there is some importance to be found in its pages.What Perkins reveals is a blueprint for how business is done in third world countries. That model begins with a team of engineers headed by an economist. This engineering team uses economic data to predict growth rates for a nation and then works out an engineering plan to build the infrastructure of the nation (electricity, water, roads, etc.) to optimize and encourage this growth. The nation then uses this plan to obtain loans from the World Bank or other financial agencies and delivers that money to corporations able to enact the plans presented. This happens, the country has enhanced infrastructure and everyone is happy. Happy, that is, until the debt is to be repaid.It is then that the growth doesn't meet expectations (it almost never does, as the economist has a vested interest in inflated projections) and the country defaults on the loans. This isn't a problem for the Banks, because they just go in and demand changes in the country's economic system, sell-offs of industry or infrastructure assets at low prices to private interests and then, later demand more and more concessions in order to keep servicing the debt. Sometimes it's oil field policy, or land use, or whatever it may be. The point is that poverty increases and unrest increases and money is made and taken out of that country and the world stays unstable. It's not a formula for a humane approach to economic management as it concentrates the wealth into the hands of the few while taking the means of production and economic self-sustainability away from the people. Villages are relocated, families and clans are separated, farmland is consumed, forests are detimbered, and all of that is done to remove wealth from the area, not to maintain the economic base, but to strip it as quickly and efficiently as possible.Is it a conspiracy? No. Of course not. Each individual and each company involved in this process is just doing what they see fit in order to maximize profit. Perkins goes to great lengths to demonstrate that this isn't conspiracy.Is it legal? Yes, it is. Perkins does not make any claims that this is illegal.Is it moral? I don't believe so.There are plenty of liberals, like myself, who would like the discussion of economic responsibility to be more than a name calling tantrum. I believe in making a profit. I own a company and employ people. I don't want to end private ownership of land, homes, businesses. Very few people do. In fact, most of the socialist countries (I'm using this as an extreme example, not an endorsement, so don't overreact) in the world today have private ownership of land, homes, businesses, etc. I don't want the government to control the means of production either. The points that Perkins brings up in his book are important, even if his book isn't believable. The point is that it may not be best for people to be beholden to such large economic entities that can dictate terms of business to entire nations. Corporations are supposed to be for the bringing together of resources that individual private citizens or partnerships couldn't muster to undertake an economic task. That's what they started out as, anyway. But that's no longer the case - and I believe that people in general are worse off for it. When companies can dictate economic policy to nations, they're too large. When companies can bring the power of national militaries to bear upon regions in order to back their corporate policies and actions, I think they're too powerful.Perkins talks about these things in his book and it makes for interesting reading, but by the time I'd read that far into it, there was a significant credibility gap already developed. As a result I have to draw on my own experiences.Large organizations tend to threaten life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Those organizations can be governments, unions, religions, companies, or armies. Whenever the responsibility for actions is so diluted among many people, reckless endangerment can be done in the name of a greater cause and no one need feel any guilt over it.I'll stick with my small business, my small property, and my own conscience. But, this book, I won't recommend."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I wanted to believe this book was genuine; Jerry Quickley raved about this book on Pacifica radio (KPFK), and Amy Goodman interviewed the guy on Democracy Now; I admire and trust these guys so bought the book expecting revelation; whoa! much of the content is obvious, e.g. obviously the US invaded Iraq for the oil and bombed the place for the reconstruction contracts (too bad thats been going a little wrong). That was obvious - to many - in the lead up to the slaughter (hardly a war), and this book came out in 2004. By the author's own admission, the book is a little dated - and perhaps I might add therefore a little unoriginal as well - well, yes! However, some parts of this book were so corny and hard to take seriously, e.g. the Christ vision or dream, that it became very difficult to take the rest of the book seriously; there may well be some truth in the content, but ultimately I came away with the conclusion that this guy has cooked up a bunch of exaggerated baloney - in regard to his own involvement - to make a few bucks off lefties who want to believe; he's still a 'hit-man' if he ever was one. I mean, get a load of his photo man! Doesn't he look just like one of those guys in the informmercials that try really hard to sell you something? and indeed thats the way the book reads.Also, check out the citations; on page 102 (hard back) the author claims that his designed-to-mislead theory of \\"econometrics\\", devised with the help of a young MIT mathematician with an Indian name (and we all know that Indians are great at maths) states their \\"papers [on the subject] were published by several prestigious organizations\\" and that \\"the papers - and we - became famous throughout the industry\\". Now check the citations on page 234. First, almost all the \\"papers\\" are published in conference proceedings - it is important to note that usually written material presented at conferences are short pieces or abstracts that are not vetted or peer reviewed, ie. anyone can attend and write just about anything. Such abstracts are not bona fide publications - they are essentially passed over if they appear in an academic resume and indeed are usually only used in a resume if there is nothing more substantial available. Second, the one journal reference appears to be in 'Consulting Engineer', which I couldnt find on the internet; therefore is probably not much of a journal and indeed may not even exist? Third, the last citation is a compenidium of papers for which the author wrote a foreward - and was published by the company he worked for - MAIN! So, the citations put forward to support the page 102 claims, actually indicate that these claims are bogus. Where does that leave the rest of the book? Bogus as well."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Perkins's confession is a great, principled, admission of how an important tool of US \\"neo-imperialism\\" works. It is hardly the whole picture, but then the whole picture is so complex that it would take a *much* larger book, if not several. \\"Confessions\\" breaks important ground as an insider admission and detailed description of what many observers knew about countries being snared in debt traps by the IMF. (Brazilian educator Paolo Freire wrote, \\"The IMF is not a benevolent institution. It is a world power\\"). Perkins blows the whistle on the calculated plan of using debt to gain political control over governments and siphon their countries' wealth into the coffers of US-based multinational corp's. He also describes the privatized \\"jackals\\" who kill unco-operative heads of state and the backup plan if the first two methods fail: military invasion.So far, so good. What Perkins does not mention (and he has to limit his scope somewhere, of course) is the role Wall Street plays in smuggling money out of such countries (see R. T. Naylor's \\"Hot Money and the Politics of Debt\\") or the role of illegal drug sales in repaying (dollar-denominated) loans to US banks. (See Alfred McCoy's \\"The Politics of Heroin,\\" Peter Dale Scott's \\"Cocaine Politics,\\" and the works they reference). He also says little about the huge US role in training and arming death squads and regular military forces throughout Latin America, although he does discuss the School of the Americas somewhat.In all, I rate this a very good book, especially for those who have not studied alternative literature about US foreign policy. But those new to the field should see it as an introduction to an even more tangled web and look further to get a broader context.Ed Rippy"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Throughout the 1970s, as chief economist for an international consulting firm, John Perkins' job was to convince Third World nations to accept enormous loans for building bridges and dams and power grids. Then, once a less developed country was trapped in the role of debtor, the U.S. government could move in and act like a loan shark.In Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, Perkins accuses the \\"corporatocracy\\" (corporations, banks and governments working in loose confederation to advance consumerism) of advancing empire while rationalizing its actions as aid for the poor.While he worked extensively in Panama, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Colombia, Ecuador, it was in Indonesia that Perkins once attended a satirical puppet show expressing deep cynicism about the American invasion. It would have been mere post-Iraq whining -- except that the puppeteer was skewering Richard Nixon, the nation being invaded was Vietnam, and the year was 1971.Citing British historian Arnold Toynbee, the Indonesians claimed even then that America wasn't targeting Soviet atheists but Islamic fundamentalists. \\"Stop being so greedy,\\" Perkins was advised. \\"Babies are dying of thirst and you search the fashion magazines for the latest styles.\\"Perkins can be melodramatic -- when first recruited by the NSA, he admits that he had visions of a James Bond lifestyle (and he's never entirely rid himself of them). Repeatedly, he tries to reconstruct his anguish in deciding to quit his job at Chas. T. Main, Inc., and he repeatedly goes on about how guilty he felt over the years as he jetted all over the world and stayed in luxury hotels.His Confessions have a choppy feel as a result, though only because he really was involved with movers and shakers in Indonesia, Panama, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Colombia, Ecuador and more.The Berrett-Koehler backlist is full of anti-corporate titles, suggesting an agenda; Perkins would no doubt argue that major publishing houses, as tools of the corporatocracy, would reject his rabble-rousing. On the other hand, Craig Unger, author of House of Bush, House of Saud, and the New York Times were making it common knowledge as far back as April 2001 that Cheney's Halliburton and Schulz's Bechtel, among other wooly corporate mammoths, were sticking their fingers in the Iraqi pie.EHMs may use the methods of the Mafia, but Perkins doesn't regard them as a right-wing conspiracy. It's easy to conjure conspiracies, he says -- that way, the solution is simply to throw out the bad guys, because the system itself is basically sound. No, he says, the problem lies in the system: \\"The corporatocracy is ourselves -- we make it happen.... How do you rise up against a system that appears to provide you with your house and car, food and clothes, electricity and health care -- even when you know that the system also creates a world where 24,000 people starve to death each day and millions more hate you, or at least hate the policies made by representatives you elected?\\"His list of practical recommendations is slim -- raise your consciousness, make your own confession -- but then the usual purpose of an expose like these Confessions is simply to gain entry to the marketplace of ideas. We have to recognize a problem before we can fix it.Then again, some people refuse to recognize the problem of global warming. Some people refuse to believe that America is in pursuit of empire."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"A must read book if you ask me!

It's refreshing to take a break from the TV network propaganda and get some real scoop about our own country. In fact, one of my favorite parts of your book is the following: \\"...We have such difficulty listening to the real story. We prefer to believe the myth that thousands of years of human social evolution has finally perfected the ideal economic system, rather than to face the fact we have merely bought into a false concept and accepted it as gospel\\". Because you see, Mr. Perkins, your description of the immense subtlety involved in the economic hit man business is the very cunning process referred to in Alexis De Tocqueville's book, \\"Democracy in America\\" when he writes that civilization has perfected despotism.

I have read some of the other reviews attacking the book's credibility, but I believe that the despicable interventions into developing economies to make a quick buck are real. Why wouldn't they be? We see that sort of slash-and-burn capitalism rewarded every day in the US. Companies are bought, sold, and merged with no regard for peoples' jobs or local economies. Shareholders and CEOs are the only concern. I started with Perkins' other book on the topic, The Secret History of the American Empire, which is more of the same.That said, it is really important for smart people to start reading credible accounts of the failure of Chicago School economics, which will be revealed as one of the biggest frauds of our day and a true threat to democracy. Selfishness wins in the short term, but true self interest dictates that we invest in fair play, sharing resources, and placing justice above all. In the long run, the success of the community benefits the individual the most. Market forces do not naturally tend toward peace and equal rights, which people universally demand and deserve. Sorry to ruin the frat party."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This is one of those books you wanna give everyone on your Christmas list -- except it's not exactly Christmas reading. Other reviewers here have described the book's contents, so I won't do that.This book answered many questions that have been floating around in my mind for the past several years about the slow slide I've felt the world taking. This slide begins from a certain level of good-will, pride and honesty in the 1950s, to where we are today: in an era of apparent confusion, anger, increasing world poverty and increasing global tensions. Furthermore - and I still find myself shaking my head in utter confusion over this: we now have a U.S. president who turns a blind eye to the environmental destruction that anyone with any credentials assures us will wipe the human species off the planet -- perhaps even in the near future.It's as if the world is careening toward the edge of a steep cliff, everyone can see we're nearing the edge, and yet nobody \\"in power\\" seems even the slight bit concerned. It's crazy-making.Perkins weaves a tale that pulls all this confusion together. He ties up all the loose ends. He makes much of it make sense: The fact that increasingly Americans have no jobs (the corporatocracy takes its jobs overseas to the poorest and pays them $1 a day). Why South and Central America never seem to have leaders who care one whit about them (the corporatocracy destroys the leaders who care -- via assassination, if all else fails). Why America doesn't know about the corporatocracy (the corporatocracy owns every single last one of our media outlets -- and has no qualms about using those outlets to stretch the truth in any direction it deems necessary). Why so many countries around the world are dirt poor (the American corporatocracy intentionally keeps them that way - they're more controllable). Why America is fast becoming a land of the poverty stricken on the one hand, and the billionairesses on the other (the American corporatocracy wants it that way -- we're easier to control). Why very small, mean, and inhumane men have been \\"elected\\" to the U.S. presidency lately (they're willing to lick corporatocracy boots).\\"Corporatocracy,\\" of course, means rule by corporation. As Perkins notes, one seldom hears words like \\"democracy,\\" \\"capitalism\\" or \\"socialism\\" anymore. These systems are passe. All of us, whether we know it or not, are ruled now by a vast web of corporate power. There's really nothing else out there, anymore. We're like serfs in relation to the old Medieval feudal lords, or slaves to the old Southern plantation owners. They swim in their riches; we strain to survive.This is what frightens me most: our Corporate Masters are so secure in their power over us now that they don't try anymore to hide the world reversion to feudalism. Thus you have GHW Bush invading Panama in 1989, killing thousands of citizens of a sovereign nation, and taking that nation's president captive. As Perkins points out, at the time, Panamanian President Noriega was the only person in the U.S. labeled \\"prisoner of war.\\" According to Perkins, Bush simply made phone calls to all the major media and told them to shut up about the invasion, which is why most of us know little about it.And you have G.W. starting a pre-emptive war in Iraq on the lamest of pretexts - and not really trying very hard to cover up the fact that his excuses for invasion change by the hour. And you have a U.S. city wiped out because G.W. failed to extend aid in time, or to relinquish money to fix its levees; and now of course his Halliburton buddies are reaping billions in illegal and overpriced reconstruction schemes. And hold up your hand if you think the poor who inhabited New Orleans' coastline will be allowed to return to some of the most valuable real estate in the country.One negative reviewer criticized this book because it reads like a story and because (he says) it's written on a 6th-grade reading level (Not). Perkins isn't dumb. He wants to reach as many readers as he can with his news. And writing in a fast-paced narrative style will help him do that.There'll be a boatload of reviewers here on Amazon, straight from our Corporate Masters, who will attempt to riddle this book with holes. Perkins is revealing the sordid underbelly of their lair. And there's no shortage of oil money to pay thousands of corporate hacks - if need be -- to write reviews panning this book."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Creating a Global Empire is not easy. In this book, you will find the other side of America. John Perkins identifies himself as an Economic Hit Man who works for \\"Corporatocracy\\" means big corporations network in America.. His mission was simple. He creates optimistically inflated economic forecasts for developing countries which lead big projects sponsored by IMF and World Bank. All these big projects facilitated by big US corporations. As a result of this cycle, money comes back to US and the developing country goes in debt that never can be repaid. But, the unpaid debt gives to US economic and politic leverage against these developing countries.During this process, there were certain assumptions. First assumption was the leader of the developing country was always corrupt. He shows these facts by examples. The other bothering fact was only little part of the developing country's population gets benefit from these big projects including ruling family but the majority of the population gets poorer due to unpaid debt.John Perkins made this cycle happened in Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Columbia. He also worked with Panama. But, Panama's president Omar Torrjos has special place in Perkins memory. Because he had seen the big picture painted by US and he was not corrupt. Also Perkins defines three levels for Economic invasion as described above. First level is Economic Hit Man what he does. If this is not working then Jackal comes to play and the leader gets assassinated. There are two examples for this level. They are Panama's president Torrjos and Equator's president Roldos killed by CIA's Jackal connection. Finally, third level is military invasion like in Panama and Iraq.Perkins worked as Economic Hit Man during 70's when Robert McNamara was the head of World Bank. Book makes sense a lot as a whole with this fact. Because, Robert McNamara was one of the biggest fan of Global Empire as USA. Then, I remember Mr.Wolfwoftz, World Bank nomination and Mr. Bolton's UN nomination by Bush Administration. Is history repeating himself again?"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The book was long, repetive, and in some places quite dull, but it was interesting in that it presents a different perspective on globalization. The author tells us that he was a part of a clandestine effort to make third world nations into puppets of the United States (or at least capitalism.) This was accomplished, he says, by giving them huge, unjustiable loans that they could never afford to pay back. His basic premise is that he was shocked to learn the United States, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and others have ulterior motives when they give loans to poor countires -- motives that go beyond just helping the nation that is getting the money. Well, duh --of course they do. I thought it was common knowledge, perhaps even part of the corporate charters, that lending organizations hope to foster mutually dependent economies between nations so that they will be more inclined to cooperate with one another rather than go to war. Isn't that what the European Union is all about? Are we to get upset about this? During the time frame discussed in the book (70s and 80s), winning an alliance with a country through loans may have been a better way to prevent the spread of communism than going to war with them after the fact. Similarly, it may be wiser today to give financial support to countries in the Middle East and northern Africa even if they can't repay us. In explaining why he felt guilty about his role in building electrical power projects, Mr. Perkins says he intentionally cooked the books on the economic forecasts of the anticipated impact from the various projects in order that he could persuade lenders to loan the money so his company, Chas. MAIN, Inc., would be awarded large construction projects. Maybe I'm missing something here, but this doesn't ring true. First of all, what intelligent lender would have been willing to rely upon economic forecasts of a rookie economist -- a young man with no masters degree and who is merely a junior employee of a construction contractor? But if they did -- and if his numbers were wrong, and a lender got stuck with bad debt because of it, wouldn't that be the last loan anyone would give based on this young man's forecasts? He and his company would have been out of business fast. On the other hand, if his forecasts were consistly wrong, and lenders kept relying upon them in country after country as Mr. Perkins would have us believe they did, then those lenders weren't relying upon him at all. They must have been willing to lend money without regard to the facts. And that would mean Mr. Perkins would have nothing to feel guilty about. Thus, he can give up his whole guilt trip about how bad he felt about his supposed role. This issue isn't explained in the book at all, and to me it is critcial omission. Despite these misgivings about the book, and despite the doubtful reality of the cloak and dagger stuff that the author imagines, I found that some of the stories about individual countries, their leaders, and the impact of the projects on the people helped me to better understand the arguments between those who favor globalization and those who so violently oppose it. Although the author didn't succeed in convincing me of anything, he did give me cause to stop and think a little more seriously about the issues, and I will probably buy more serious books on the subject as a result."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The book sounds interesting enough when reading the back cover, but the stories are pretty shallow, leaving at least me wanting to know more details. He names companies, and some people but much of the book never goes much beyond the cycle of corporate greed and the taking advantage of third world countries by developed ones. He constantly refers to the \\"jackals\\", or CIA who come in to finish a job he supposedly can't, writing like they are some totally different breed than he is. But they were all apparently part of the same machine and not much different from one another. He also constantly laments about how he knew what he was doing was wrong and how his conscious was paying a heavy toll, but all the while he was boo-hoo'ing himself, he's getting paid very well (millions?). Sure he quits and writes a tell all book maybe trying to atone for his sins, while still leading (I'm assuming) a very comfortable life. Meanwhile, the projects and companies present in third world countries he had been such a large part of continue to rape the natural resources of the host country and its people.Aside from this though, the book could have been a lot more informative if he actually spent more time on certain stories. He mentioned threats, but what were they and when did they happen? What proof or evidence does he have that his two close friends and leaders of other countries were killed by the \\"jackals\\"? Why did he continue on that path after his \\"friends\\" were killed by some of his countrymen and cohorts? GIve us some numbers on growth of the companies, or exploitation of these resources. Something we can hold onto as a reader other than \\"they did this and that\\". Not knowing much about \\"economic hitmen\\", it is hard for me to tell where some of these stories should have gone. I was just left feeling that he was just scratching the surface and didn't write much more. Finally, the ending was kind of abrupt. A deeper synopsis of current situations with these companies and countries would been good to finish out the book.Three stars for the introduced information, but not much else for the tell-all author who profited while supposed \\"friends\\" were killed and innocent people taken advantage of."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Though the book written by a supposed insider provides great grist for the conspiracy mill, it is unfortunately less than accurate. Like most such works that have great popular appeal, there is enough truth to it to generate excitement: countries borrow a lot; borrowing is brokered just like in any industry; sales people use all sorts of tactics to get clients to buy their stuff; countries buy a lot of stuff; the process can be corrupted, obviously. That basis in reality is then disingenuously used to propel the author to heights of a weird self important cloak and dagger fantasy.I work in the industry that Perkins describes and advise governments on their economic policy, paid by both government and private consulting firms. A lot of my friends do too. Its true that much money has been wasted, especially in the 1970s when infrastructure projects were big. American companies like Parsons Main profited and still do. My current company also profits, but never have I felt compelled to offer anything but the advice that I felt was best for the country. Certainly, many advisors differ in their opinions and more than once I have advised against taking on a World Bank or other loan. For the most part, however, these loans are conducted on the basis of pretty strong economic rationale.Dunno, maybe things have changed in the industry since the 1970s. I know generally countries have better procurement procedures in place and transparency has also improved in a lot of places. However, even the industry veterans I know would find Perkins' tale a pretty tall one."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Hit Man is support for my two books \\"Ramblings of Sanity\\" and \\"Slavery by Syndication.\\" It details the clever techniques employed, and why truth and honesty (i.e. morality) has become so 'evil' when viewed by overpowering \\"ethical manipulations,\\" and stinted logic - biased by intense greed.I am thrilled with Perkins's cleverness to dodge the bullet of rejection because of his un-fraturnal honesty, and pray that he is more successful than myself in getting the message out, without censorship clipping his wings."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Benito Mussolini wrote that fascism should more accurately be called corporatism. John Perkins book deals with multi national corporations who have their own foreign policy. This book, while informative and entertaining, lacks any historical perspective.

I applaud Perkins for daring to share his story for which many will refuse to believe."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I found this book fascinating. Mr. Perkins explains so many things about events in the world for the last 35 years that I had some misconceptions about -- especially the Panama Canal.I find that the author is extremely articulate. Although I don't understand economics that well, he made complex conceptions about global economies clearer. This book will definitely make readers re-think the role of the United States in world economics if that reader will view it with an open mind.My only problem with the book is his bothered conscience cropping up so frequently right from the beginning of his career but his inability to do something about that for so long. But it makes me ask myself what would I eventually do?"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Perkins has written an excellent expose on the human rights stomping, fascist global empire that is the United States and her out of control corporations; which have spread across the globe like a diseased capitalist virus destroying everything in its path.Dont' be fooled by the media and government spin that these corporations like Halliburton and Bechtel do anything to help these imporverished countries. It has been proven time and time again, as Perkins details so elequently, that our government and corporations have reaped billions in profits while devaluing currency in countries they \\"help\\", they have polluted and destroyed eco-systems and environments, have created poorer indebted societies, and have helped a few chosen locals become billionaires in the process by acts of complicity.This book is an awesome example of one man's struggle to break free form this spiritually damning profession and lifestyle that threatens to destroy this world and enslave all of us under a New World Order.You will never see the world the same again after reading this book."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Is it a jackal?

Confessions of an Economic Hit Man can be read by anyone! John Perkins is a good story teller; all of the stories are fascinating and never droll on. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in how the USA uses economics to control other countries."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The book shows the crude reality of the world in which we are currently living. The power of international banks, corporations and the government nexus is explored in detail. Gone are the days when the invaders used to come and attack with swords, these days the same job is carried by sophisticated people in black suits who come claiming to work for the betterment of the people of the country but the skewed development benefit only the selected few people of the oligarchy whereas the majority of the population still remains in poverty. The poor countries( but abundant in natural resources) are snared in the economic debt through which escape is difficult and when the time comes, the corporations and the government take their pound of flesh( be it oil, land or UN vote ). Famous examples include Equador, Panama, Indonesia etc. The same country which espouses virtues of freedom and human rights looks the other way when the flagrant abuses take place in dictatorship regimes ably supported by US corporations as their insatiable appetite for the resources remain undiminished. When the economic hit man fail in their objective, the jackals are sent ( Assassinations of Omar Torrijos and Jamie Roldos) and when everything else fails, the military is sent."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"FOUR AND A HALF STARS. Okay, this book is not perfect. Perkins is not a professional writer, and his repetitive assessment of the immorality of his past professional work gets pretty mundane. Then again, he did entitle the book \\"Confessions.\\" And the value of this book is quite significant. I am a U.S. citizen, and if you are also then you should be aware that our nation is basically enslaving the rest of the world through economic trickery. Perkins explains that, and explains it well. At the governmental level it is mentioned quite openly: Economic Hit Men are referred to as EHMs, and our government trains them to advance the domination of the United States over other nations. There was the Greek Empire, the Roman Empire, Hitler had his shot, the Soviets had theirs, and now we are carrying the torch. Perkins concludes our style and our empire are the most powerful in history, and it would be difficult to argue with him. READ THIS BOOK, PEOPLE! READ IT!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Almost daily on the news a foreigner is telling us to stay out of the business of his country. But from what I read in the newspapers, all we do is send them massive amounts of aid and build their infrastructure. So what's the problem?? John Perkins explains it. This book answers so many questions, mainly about why the rest of the world 'hates' us.Now if only Mr. Perkins could explain the US immigration policy so succinctly."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"\\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\\" by John Perkins is one of two books I recommend to anyone that wants to get a more comprehensive understanding of what's going on behind the scene of the globalization (the other one is Ellen Brown's Web of Debt). And once you've read this, it's worth continuing with his follow up books. His story is a testimony that could only have been written by one who was really there, in the midst of the events - that's the integrity of it. It is balanced and straight-forward without falling into the trap of judging or blaming. Nothing added and nothing taken away, and yet as captivating and breathtaking as a thriller. It is not another conspiracy theory, rather an effort to mirror a complex reality full of contradictions but where some patterns of hidden control, manipulation and abuse on a global scale can still be discerned and challenged.I have myself a strong relationship to Ecuador, whose process of becoming a debt slave to the \\"American empire\\" is depicted in the book. I have had reason to study the history of the Ecuador, and with John Perkins' story the pieces of the puzzle fall into place - as they do with many other events around the globe where Perkins has been involved. In my eyes, he appears to be a true patriot who wants the US to stay true to its founding principles that once made it a global role model. But the lessons are not limited to the US. From my Scandinavian perspective, the story makes sense and I can easily apply his conclusions on my own part of the world; Swedish banks are trying to carry out their own little empire...In the end, Perkins' book becomes more than a testimony and a captivating story. It is writing at its best; When the healing process of one man provides something of value for everyone."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"CONFESSIONS' author John Perkins writes a withering expose in broad brush strokes. His autobiographic narrative in the first person is an easy read, but the glibness with which he writes about running amok left me unsettled and depressed about a zero-sum game in which all nation-states compete for access to raw materials, cheap labor and overseas markets. Would Perkins have us believe that we are any different than our forebears? Spain, for example, financed its empire for three centuries until the early 1820s from precious ores that conquistadors extracted in the New World and shipped home. Not so different than slave labor at Ausschwitz indigenous natives perished by the millions while they worked their economic hit men's silver mines in Potosi, Bolivia. What is remarkable, however, is the insider's glimpse that Perkins supplies his readers re: the methods used by today's empire builders.Perkins explains that \\"economic hit men\\" from this side of the water stalk their foreign quarry by preying upon the presumed corruptibility of the ruling clique/s in less developed countries. Extending a choice of \\"plato o plomo\\" the predator strikes a devil's bargain with prey who cannot refuse the offer: \\"We'll make you rich(-er) or we'll make you dead. Your choice.\\" If the quarry is corrupt(-ible), then the quarry reaps riches while s/he turns a blind eye or colludes with foreign overlords who proceed to exploit economically the corrupted leader's less developed country. If the quarry is incorruptible, then assassins (what Perkins calls \\"jackals\\") take him out and the hit man's handlers find a more compliant replacement among the foreign country's ruling clique. If the blandishments of \\"lead or silver\\" cannot accomplish their purpose, then mother empire dispatches her armies in an old-fashioned colonial war to suppress the natives and exploit their natural resources.While I wonder whether his autobiography might apppear differently to readers if Perkins had stripped-out any reference to the nefarious \\"Claudine,\\" the sinister femme fatale and purported NSA operative who tutored Perkins early in his career in the black arts of becoming an \\"economic hit man,\\" I believe what Perwkins confessed to is generally how empires operate and always have operated. His analysis of our foreign policy over the past 40 years fits tidily with my own recollections and analyses. Depressingly, however, unlike the quote from the Boston Herald newspaper on the back of Penquin's jacket cover, I did not find Perkins' revelations to be \\"astonishing\\" or even surprising. They were grim and \\"business as usual\\" in my book.It's rare to observe a unicorn or a graffiti-ist who defaces a mailbox. We know history to be a tableau of crimes, but it's unusual to read first-hand the agonized recollections of a well-paid predator whose conscience got the better of him. Perkins never explains why expiating his sins is a wake-up call for us to surrender our venal behaviour and our ignorance or indifference to how empires become & remain empires. Perkins implies \\"what comes around, goes around,\\" and if for no other reason we should consider the world that we will pass along to our children. If only Perkins had started raising his own children in his early 20s instead of running amok around the globe until he retired from his economic clandestine trade in his mid-30s, he might have remained poor and silently desperate like the rest of us.Finally, I am puzzled by the many book reviewers on Amazon's pages who found Perkins' story to be not credible. There would be no disbelief if the author had presented himself as a former soldier-of-fortune who now regrets having looted and despoiled less developed countries. Why is it so hard to believe that white collar thieves in Bermuda shorts are as cunning and resourceful as burly paratroopers who drop from the sky with bayonets at the ready?"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Many have been baffled at why developmental problems so stubbornly persist.This book took a lot of courage for its author, partially because it is the first of its kind to go so deeply into these matters, and partially because the author had to face his own inner demons and complicity. If you find his account hard to absorb looking at other books like \\"A game as old as empire\\" will show that there are many people and many references to the facts. Authors like David C. Korten and Thom Hartmann throw some light on how things got this way, but first hand accounts like these are needed to get a sense for the underlying dynamics and impact of a large part of modern civilization.Denial and depression are possible reactions to these revelations but another world is possible and the current one will keep on changing so I recommend following up a book like this with reading books on contributing to a better future - like the excellent \\"Alternatives to economic globalization\\"The demise of serious alternatives to capitalism together with the global reach of modern technology and cheap oil has created an era on unprecedented corporate progress. The rise of corporate control of the commons and erosion of community control vested in and expressed through governments has fundamentally changed modern society. Much of the previous liberal vs. conservative, free market vs. socialist continuums in thinking no longer really exist in terms of actual problems facing society. The question is how modern progress can be sustained and benefits spread fairly. The free market plays a role as do governments but how can the excesses of overly concentrated power in both be prevented from short sighted global destructiveness? It is indeed a very old game that has been played many times - this time more people can give input and the stakes are arguably higher."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book will leave your hair standing on end. A riveting piece of work; must read material for anyone trying to understand what is happening to America."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"After the first couple of pages, I was worried that this book would be an irrational conspiracy theory (even the title hints at that); but by the end I found myself thinking about the concepts mentioned in the book. The best part about it (in my opinion) is the historical and cultural references that the author inserts throughout the basic story line. This book is not snobby; unlike other political or world cultures books I've read, the author does not assume that the reader knows the background and history of certain events. Instead, he explains and offers suggestions for further reading. The material is well reasoned and thought provoking; I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Many people think that the main reason 3rd world countries default on their debts is because of corrupt politicians in those countries who misdirected the funds.This book says think again. The author, John Perkins, was a lead economist for an international consulting firm. He claims he intentionally projected unrealistic economic growth rates in foreign countries to justify loans for infrastructure projects funded by loans from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.The goal claimed by Mr. Perkins was two-fold: to funnel money to various American corporations (Bechtel, Brown & Root, Haliburton, etc) who built the projects, and to practically ensure these countries would eventually default on the loans so they would be beholden to the US.A lot of reviewers here seem to think this book is a bunch of hooey because of the author's apparent character flaws, flimsy supporting evidence, etc. Given the author's claimed past of \\"doing it for the money\\" it's very easy to write this book off as nothing but a money grab. That's possibly true, but the message is still worth reading."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I read this book based on its rating. It definately is one of the top best-sellers because it made me think about how the US is viewed from the outside. It jump-started my desire to read more about the US Economy and learn how our management of global resources (which in turn fuels our addictive purchasing habits) affects other views of the US.The book discusses a lot of the history of oil resources and how the US made arrangements to acquire this oil. It also alerts the reader to the value of oil and the crux is plays not only on our country, but other emerging countries.I gave it 5 stars because it gave me new insight into arguments when discussing global resources and debates about terrorism. Although it gave me a bad taste of the USA after reading it, I begin to realize that without control of resources, I might not have this opportunity to enter this opinion from the USA into Amazon. Thus, I'll stay neutral and continue more reading."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Fascinating book about the United States world politics. It's not just globalization that causes this, it's as old as time according to Perkins.I think we live in a constant state of ignorance about many world issues and this book sheds a light where it is needed. Another great book is Stop Working by Rohan Hall. We need more books like these to keep us informed."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book is both enjoyable and disappointing. The author lays down his role in life as an economic hitman, his job was to saddle countries with huge debts they could never pay off, whilst building the entire infrastructure of those nations using American companies, thus making people in those companies very rich. The money would never actually reach the foreign nations; it would stay in America as it was America lending the money and American companies doing the work. In order for foreign leaders to accept the debt they would be sold woefully exaggerated economic forecasts, should they refuse, as some did, they'd be murdered and replaced with an American friendly leader, failure to murder them and the military would be sent in, as was done in Panama and Iraq.The manner in which big companies, especially oil companies, behaved once they got into these foreign nations, is touched on and is clearly disgusting. The author knew, when making these deals with foreign leaders that allowed American companies in, that the environment and indigenous people would be brushed aside, poverty, starvation, sickness, and death would be the consequences of his actions, but it didn't matter as he was making lots of money and making a name for himself, although the guilt was never far away.For those following the New World Order activities it does really bring it home, especially the nature in which American politicians move from roles as directors' of large banks or other big companies, into senior political roles, and back again an-infinitum, you do get to see it as an exclusive club and the American government is clearly there for its own wealth creating purposes, to line their own pockets and build an empire solely for the benefit of their exclusive club, at least it seems.The disappointment with this book is that it is very short on details, and a very short book in general, I'm sure there is so much more to tell but he doesn't tell it. It took him many years to write this book as he kept stopping and starting, so I'm guessing that he is either too scared to tell all, as it could put his life in danger (he had been warned off), or that he is so riddled with guilt about what he has done that he just isn't ready to face it in full yet, still this is a book worth reading as it may begin opening eyes to the reality of the world we live in.He does provide steps on what you and I can do to raise awareness of what is going on, now that's all well and good but there is another issue, I doubt humanity has ever known a world without an empire, if America wasn't doing this another country would be, and if America is stopped from doing this then another country will simply fill the void. The real problem is stopping all empire building, but how on earth do we do that?"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I had much higher expectations about getting an inside view, but Perkins superfically goes over a historical record that is all too well known. At one point he confesses to taking a bribe to not publish the book, but who on earth would feel threatened by such a tepid \\"expose\\"? And his incessant moralizing becomes lethally tedious about halfway through. Yeesh..."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The message of this book isn't new: both consciously and unconsciously, America has used its clout to gain an economic advantage for itself, and economic disadvantage and/or disaster for the countries that it exploits. Far better documented and researched books have been written about the topic, but Confessions of an Economic Hit Man became a best-seller, and the others largely did not.Our book club read Confessions, and a lively and raucous discussion followed; therein lies the value of Confessions of an Economic Hit Man: it's readable, it's engaging, and it gets a badly needed conversation out of wine bars, back rooms, and closed door meetings, into the kitchens and dining rooms of Americans that want, and need, to know about the way international business is often conducted. \\"Why are other countries so ANGRY with us?\\" I've heard people ask. This book discusses one of the puzzle pieces to the answer.For a back door, but thoroughly documented and superbly written examination of America's willingness to use actual or metaphorical hit men to accomplish it's aims, readLegacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA. Legacy of Ashes was written with Pulitzer Prize winning talent, Perkins will never be considered for such an honor.Here's the consensus of my book group: there's the man (Perkins) and the message (Wake Up, America!). Perkins himself got a unanimous thumbs down: he whines, he dodges, he doesn't take full responsibility, and in the end he's simply shifted his exploitation from foreign countries to the American public. At NO financial risk to himself (he married very well), he wrote a sensationalist best seller, and has followed this with running high-priced seminars in luxury locations to discuss the topic that the book focuses on, as well as themes of personal renewal and development. BUT, his inadequacies as a person in no way lessen the truth of his claims: American business interests have often been highly predatory, powerfully damaging to emerging economies, and frantically focused on short term gain rather than long term development of legitimate and mutually beneficial trade relationships. Most Americans aren't willing to read annotated, foot-noted serious journalism on our history in the world of international business. But hitmen, we can get into that concept, we groove on gangsters, even if we ARE the gangsters. For getting the message out in a method palatable to a not so choosy public, Perkins deserves credit. I'm guessing that Perkins is raking in far more bucks being a reformed sinner than he ever did as a hitman, and for that, no kudos from one book club in remote Central Oregon."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"While this is readable and ties in several historical threads of the past 30 years, in the result Perkins fails to make his case that development finance is merely a tool of the \\"evil capitalist empire\\". He makes inferences, allusions and assumptions, but he failed to show enough evidence or connectivity to convince one that investing in power plants, roads, ports, etc is a net negative for developing countries. Sure, the world is connected, financed and full of agendas -- lets not throw out the economic baby with caveat-emptor bathwater. Or, as we say in emerging markets, \\"the only thing worse than being exploited by the developed world is NOT being exploited\\". Perkin's \\"guilt\\" wears a bit thin as he fully believes he's sinful, but accepts the paychecks for 30 years before finally letting go and coming clean. Like Democracy, Capitalism is the worst system, except for all the others."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book is not only revealing, it is is historical. It provides a level of detail that offers the reader just the right amount of insight into the world our \\"leaders\\" have wrought, and it does it in the context of history. This information, tied together with G. Edward Griffin's work, The Creature From Jekyll Island, goes a long way toward identifying the puppetmasters in our world, and why we are on a path of self-destruction. While Perkins doesn't offer a solution to the problems he has helped create, at least not in this book, he does want the reader to seek an action plan of his own. After reading this book, you will be compelled to develop one -- that is, if you have any concern for the future of the world."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"there are many great, kind and charitable americans. the presidents and the government represented american....for years, as now everyone knows that there was no nuclear weapon found in iraq, haliburton is still making great money. people like bush family, dick cheney have a lot to do with this company. they made great money. they were the one declaring war. and they were the ones making friends with the dictators of the world. look where it has got america and the world. i hope McCain will not win. and obviously the lady running mate of his. with all due respect, someone who has little education, and pro-live and pro-gun. imagine the future of america and the world in the hands of these duo.this book is an eye opener. the view it presented has tied in with the facts i have previously known.american should care more about the rest of the world and the action of their leaders. indifference can otherwise be very costly"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"It seems that this book is either a love or hate it affair. I think that the book was a useful look into the ethics of American business and foreign politics, but I also think the book is a little sensational. I must however question the motives of all of those who rated the book, it looks like conservatives rated the book very low, while lefties, tended to go the other way. Like I said I think that the book was an interesting look into foreign affairs, I would read this book again."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"...because most US citizens are ignorant about US capitalism's role in world affairs, just as they are about other societies, and about history (including their own).Only 4 stars because Perkin's solutions to the evil wrought by the system he used to work for are a tad naive.This edition, which has new material, is superior to the earlier one.Well written."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I'm a big conspiracy buff, but Mr. Perkins utterly failed to convince my skeptical side. He makes a lot of legitimate points about the Military-Industrial Complex and the behavior of huge American corporations and government insiders and so on, but all his personal tales are too vague to be credible. Also, his history lessons are a bit slanted, to put it mildly. We all need to be suspicious of a book that claims a gullible sap like \\"Smiling Jimmy\\" Carter was actually an equal of the Founding Fathers. What the hell???!!! I'm not kidding - Mr. Perkins really does make that exact comparison. He sounds more like a typical limousine liberal than a real economist. A real economist once made this statement: \\"Making loans to Third World countries is like lending money to your children. Either way, you'll never see it again.\\" This of course doesn't fit into Mr. Perkins' account of the overwhelming success of his putative tactics. And the term \\"Economic Hit Men\\" sounds way too silly - like something pampered Yuppies would dream up in an off-campus bar. Like I said, his individual story is extremely light on facts and figures. Nothing that he says happened can be proved or disproved and when he actually does include some rare figures, his calculations are bizarrely impractical. Eugene Reardon's review already demonstrated how crazy his purported Indonesian load forecasts were, so there's no need to get into that again. All his writing sounds like someone with an English degree, not a business degree, and most definitely NOT an economics degree. His endless dithering and liberal hand-wringing and moralizing keep increasing throughout the book and only get more annoying as he goes on (and on and on and on...). A good leftist screed, but it needs to be taken with a healthy dose of caution."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"An expose of the United States foreign policy; on their unsavory methods to undermine other countries financially to attain leverage on them with duress. The means by which leverage is attained, lies with the two \\"international financial institutions\\" (IFI's). The institutions were founded in 1945 during the genesis of the United Nations as \\"do-good\\" enterprises. The IMF would assist countries trying to keep their currencies tied to the dollar under the terms of the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement. The World Bank would lend money at low interest rates gathered from the rich countries to help poor countries get off their backs.Over the years, the process has become corrupt, with both the IMF and World Bank becoming controlled by the multinational corporations and their banks. When President Nixon went off the gold standard in 1971, the IMF's reason for existence evaporated, because Bretton Woods and the fixed dollar went up in smoke. Now the problem for the big banks like Chase Manhattan, Citicorp and the Bank of America became two-fold:1) As surplus dollars accumulated in their reserves and there were no credit-worthy Americans wanting to borrow, the banks had to think of ways to lend the money abroad or it would sit in their vaults earning zip, which means it really is losing money as the paper dollar - freed from its gold anchor - was inflating and losing purchasing power. Citigroup's Walter Wriston came up with the idea that the surplus should be loaned to poor countries, even though they had no collateral, because governments had to pay off their hard-currency loans or lose their international credit ratings.2) If the countries that borrowed from Chase or Citicorp could not pay back interest or principle and did not worry about stiffing the private bankers, they would have to swallow the non-performing loans. The solution was to have the IMF, looking for something to justify its existence, step in to collect the debt. All it had to do was persuade the U.S. Congress to ante up billions of taxpayer dollars to fill their coffers. They could then go to the deadbeat country and say, \\"We will give you this money so you can pay Chase and Citicorp what you owe them, but you will have to raise taxes on your own people and devalue your currency as the conditions for the loan\\"This book is an account by Mr. Perkins a foot soldier in these operations of the Evil Empire. In extension Mr. Perkins does identifies Bechtel Corporation and Halliburton as agents in this quiet conspiracy to make sure the good old USA flourishes, at the expense of relentless impoverishment of the poorest countries of the world. In his book Confessions of an Economic Hit Man he describes how as a highly paid professional, he helped the U.S. cheat poor countries around the globe out of trillions of dollars by lending them more money than they could possibly repay and then taking over their economies.The scam: Mr. Perkins worked for was a company named Chas. T. Main in Boston, Massachusetts. He was responsible for giving loans to other countries, much bigger than they could possibly repay. One of the conditions of the loan is that they would then have to give ninety percent of that loan back to a U.S. company, or U.S. companies, to build the infrastructure - a Halliburton or a Bechtel. These companies would then go in and build an electrical system or ports or highways, and these would basically serve just a few of the very wealthiest families in those countries. The poor people in those countries would be stuck ultimately with this amazing debt that they couldn't possibly repay. A country today like Ecuador owes over fifty percent of its national budget just to pay down its debt. And it really can't do it. So, we literally have them over a barrel. So, when we want more oil, we go to Ecuador and force them to provide us with access to our oil companies your Amazon rain forest, which are filled with oil. The entire loan with interest finds its way back into the Unites States indirectly, while the host country is left with the debt plus lots of interest, and they basically become our servants, our slaves.Panama: In 1903 with the mammoth effort to build the Panama Canal underway; the United States under Theodore Roosevelt demanded Columbia to sign a treaty turning the isthmus over to a North American consortium. Columbia refused; Roosevelt sent in the marines; who removed a popular commander and declared Panama an independent nation. A puppet government was installed and the first canal treaty was signed; it established an American economic zone on both sides of the waterway. The country was ruled by an oligarchy of wealthy families with strong connections to Washington. A coup overthrew Arnulfo Arias; the last in the parade of puppet dictators and Omar Torrijos emerged as the head of the state. Torrijos was highly regarded by the Panamian middle and lower class as the champion for the people. His fate was an assassination at the hands of CIA.Guatemala: The United Fruits Company had been Guatemala's political equivalent of the Panama Canal. Founded in the 1880s, United Fruit grew into one of the most powerful forces in Central America. During the 1950s, reform candidate Jacob Arbenz was elected president of Guatemala in an election hailed all over the hemisphere as a model of the democratic process. At the time less than 3% of Guatemalans owned 70% of the land. Arbenz promised to help the poor dig their way out of starvation, and after his election he implemented a comprehensive land reform program. The United Fruit Company opposed these measures; since they were the largest and the most oppressive land owners in the country. The company in retaliation launched a public relations campaign in the United States; aimed at convincing the American public and congress that Arbenz was part of a Communist plot and Guatemala had become a Soviet satellite. In 1954, the CIA orchestrated a coup; American pilots bombed Guatemala City and the democratically elected Arbenz was overthrown; replaced by Cornel Armas a ruthless ally of America.Saudi Arabia: A deal was worked out with Saudi Arabia, whereby the Royal House of Saud agreed to send most of their petro-dollars back to the United States and invest them in U.S. government securities. The Treasury Department would use the interest from these securities to hire U.S. companies to build Saudi Arabia new cities, new infrastructure which we've done. And the House of Saud would agree to maintain the price of oil within acceptable limits to us, which they've done all of these years and in return the United States were the guarantors of power remaining in the House of Saud. And in Iraq we tried to implement the same policy that was so successful in Saudi Arabia, but Saddam Hussein didn't buy. When the economic hit men fail in this scenario, the jackals move in. Jackals are C.I.A.-sanctioned people that come in and try to foment a coup or revolution. If that doesn't work, they perform assassinations. Or try to. In the case of Iraq, they weren't able to get through to Saddam Hussein. So the third line of defense, if the economic hit men and the jackals fail, the next line of defense is to send in the marines to invade the country."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"\\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\\" is an interesting book that sheds some light on the mafia like global business interactions. Indebting nations, and impoverishing populations resulting in massive misery and death could be justified by an EHM with bogus statistics, and the illusion of hope for a prospective prosperity that will never take place.When the powerful and the mighty cannot manipulate with threats and money, then they will subjugate with military and war.However, Perkins's book was a disappointment to me, because writing partial truth is no truth, and writing partial confessions for self-glorification and marketing does not earn Perkins a free ticket out of purgatory. His work as an EHM has cost millions of people their livelihood and lives.Confession does not mean remorse. Every time Perkins attempted to have an inkling of conscience, money silenced it, and he was back into the rat race where he started.The information in this book is very limited, that is apparently why Perkins was allowed to publish it.The book might offer the reader some skewed insight into world affairs."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Interesting book. It makes some unpopular assertions with respect to US foreign policy that will rub some the wrong way, but I would only expect the most open-minded Neo-conservatives [oxymoron?] to read this book.Perkins details his exploits in Indonesia, the Middle East and several other locales. It makes you really think if people think about the long term consequences of their actions. Perkins paints a pretty bleak picture of past American foreign policy, which should suprise no-one in being self-centered. This is not to say that other countries are just as self-centered... their not.This is a very quick read.I'm not sure why some reviewers pan Perkin's writing style; the book obviously didn't meet their expectations - which is no fault of the author."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"First off I have two things in common with this author. I was also a Peace corps Volunteer and I have formal academic training in econometrics. Because of this I very much doubt the author's story:-The author mentions he was in the process of joining the NSA when he decided to join the Peace Corps. It surprises me he didn't even mention how he got around the very stringent Peace Corps rule that doesnt allow anyone who's at all connected with intelligence agencies from joining. At the time when he supposebly did the Peace Corps this rule was much more seriously enforced than it is now. This is because the clear distinction of the Peace Corps not being connected with intelligence activities is what allows them to operate in many countries that aren't on the best terms with the US, especially back in those days. This is one of their golden rules and the fact that this is not even mentioned and that his Peace Corps experience was glossed over so quickly makes me: 1) doubt if he really served or no, or 2) doubt his NSA claims.-The author mentions that his mysterious mentor Claudia told him to just have confidence in himself when dealing with bankers who are disputing his economic forecasts, as if the whole field of econometrics is nothing but smoke and mirrors and putting on a good game face can win you the argument. This isn't how it is. Before you can even get to the part in econometrics of trying to forecast something in the future you need to run a regression model based on past evidence, hence verifiable facts. And when you do this there are about a million different statistical indicators and tests that let you know if there is even the slightest correlation to begin with. This part of the field is a very solid. Simply \\"having confidence\\" isnt going to win you an argument if your model comes up with none of the major indicators showing the existance of any correlation. Your game face has nothing to do with an R-squared thats 0. Having confidence and poise isn't going to help you if you're arguing that 2 + 2 = 5. It's going to be pretty easy for the other guy to poke holes in your claim if this is the case. The fact that the author doesn't delve into this even the slightest makes me realize that either: 1) he knows nothing about econometrics except how to spell the word, or 2)he grossly exaggerates how his experiences using these techniques went.-When I was in the Peace Corps I worked with some USAID officials and with some private consultants doing work for them. It's a joke to think that USAID is part of some vast global empire conspiracy. Their agency, while well intentioned, is rather aloof at times and consists of a lot of former Peace Corps volunteers who are not really the \\"global conspiracy\\" type. And contrary to the author's claim that the private consultants wanted developing nations to take out huge loans that they couldnt repay, the ones I worked with who were doing work for both USAID and the US Trade and Development agency were extremely particular about the village I worked in investing the money in a project that would generate a positive return and thus allow them to be paid back. In fact getting thier money back was the number one thing on their mind, not bankrupting us and making us part of some fictional global empire. In the end our proposal was not accepted and we didn't get the money. This isn't uncommon and again the author's claims seem so far off that I doubt if some of the events even occurred.Glaring inconsistencies like these ones above along with numerous smaller ones now have me convinced this book is nothing but pure fiction. Not that its a totally bad book and if it had been classified as fiction, I would've rated it higher.But it's marketed as non-fiction. I also don't think it's that well written either. Except for a few big words thrown in it appears to be written on a junior-high reading level."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"As I got towards the end of the book I couldn't help but think of current events in South America. I look at Hugo Chavez in a different light now. Not neccesarily a positive light, but definitely in a different light. The connection of George Schultz and Casper Weinberger from Bechtel to Gov't positions was very enlightening. Now I realize why some countries do indeed hate us."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Ok, John Perkins is not the best writer in the world, and as others have pointed out, \\"Confessions\\" is at times sophmoric or hokey-sounding. But unless your ability to ingest and understand information is hopelessly tied to perfect delivery, you will quickly see this book is trying to tell us something that maybe -- just maybe, once we carefully validate its claims -- we should all pay attention to. John is suggesting some of the real reasons why wars are waged, poverty exists, leaders are overthrown. Why anyone would read and discard this work as \\"self-serving drivel\\" or \\"childish self-aggrandizing\\" is beyond me -- perhaps these are people who discuss issues simply to spar intellectually?Most importantly, people want to know if this book is a childish fantasy or actually did happen. If this were a court case it might be Corporations vs. Some Guy named John Perkins. How easy it is to think: who the hell is this guy? and cynically begin to dismantle him. and you will no doubt have lots of help. Just like the O.J. Simpson case, you will find TONS of evidence on both sides and could easily pick either one and be justified. Your best bet is to simply ask the question: why would the allegations in the book NOT be true? Perkins' ulterior motive boils down to \\"i wanted to be rich so i risked huge lawsuits and wrote a book full of lies\\" whereas the ulterior motive of the defense might be \\"yes, believe it or not corporations like us actually WILL do anything for money!\\" So, which side you choose depends on your bias towards the establishment vs. the honesty of some guy, when it really comes down to it. We all know OJ is guilty -- we could never prove it, but yeah, we know. Use your gut instinct on this one.The nice thing about \\"Confessions\\" is that it is such an easy read that you fly through it, say \\"holy sh*t\\" to yourself, and then begin digging into verification of the facts or ways you can do something about the issues raised. You get an immediate benefit out of it -- solar panels, ethanol cars, a real understanding of why we might invade a country like Iraq, etc.I wish Mr. Perkins had offered more in the way of direct ways to affect the system. Going to reading clubs, protesting the world bank, come on! Even HE should know that these things will do little to counteract the powers of corporations and globalization. Hell, I would have been more impressed (albeit maybe alarmed) had he suggested blowing up construction sites in south america that destroy poor villages, or sabotaging gas-guzzling cars which lead us to send our kids to die in the middle east. It seems odd that a man who feels he has taken part in an extremely organized machinery that essentially kills thousands the world over does not advocate an even stronger and even more organized resistance movement.Nevertheless, I would recommend this book to anyone who knows nothing whatsoever about globalization and the way the oil industry works. Mr. Perkins' book has nothing in it whatsoever that contradicts any realistic understanding of history. If you are one of those who prefer to think America can hardly do wrong and don't find yourself particularly open to the cultures of poorer nations, then you will NOT enjoy nor believe this book. But for those who are ready to dig for the truth in order to see the big picture of US corporations and how we do business with foreign governments this is a great place to start."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book scares me in that so many people have read it and think it's the truth. The author's premise is that US corporations conspire with the government to get third world nations beholden to the US by taking on huge amounts of debt for infrastructure projects that they don't need. I don't have any problem with the fact that corporations sell projects to third world countries at inflated prices; that it's supposedly public policy is the problem. The author's only proof is that when he was in his mid-twenties he received 'special instruction' from an older woman named Claudine (no last name) at her apartment while he's supposed to be doing research at the Boston Public Library. Meanwhile his marriage is falling apart; gee, I wonder why. Other relevations are equally stunning: he discovers that his co-workers are only interested in making money and not doing what's best for the client country. For an economist, he doesn't seem to know much about capitalism - oh wait, he reveals that he's really not a trained economist, though he has no problems passing himself off as an expert on growth of power load forecasting. He says that he was threatened not to write this book; by whom? He says major publishing houses wouldn't print the book (probably because they suspected it was a fabrication), the copy I have was published by Penguin (to their discredit) - Penguin isn't a major publishing house? That's news to me. The author realizes he's been living a pointless life while sailing in the Virgin Islands with young female staffer from his consulting firm - shouldn't we feel sorry for his angst? Whatever you do, don't waste money and time on this book."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"If you want your eyes to be opened to what really goes on in the world - why thirld world countires remain third world countries - if you want to understand why there are riots held wherever the World Bank meets - if you want to see why the West is despised so much....then this is the book for you. I never knew that any of this happened - John Perkins deserves more attention to speak about this topic. However, you will only get this information for the most part by purchasing this book. Will definitely turn your opinion upside down. A great read and education."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This is an excellent book about how the US corporate/government/banking complex plunders underdeveloped countries without firing a shot. Although some of the reviews challenge the author's lack of evidence, the details of the method is more than corroborated by many other books. Plus, his firsthand involvement is more than enough proof.Perkins not only details specific projects he worked on but also describes how the indigenous people felt about what they knew he was doing. It's incredible that these so-called uneducated savages know more about how the world operates than we do.The author seems intent on showing that this is not a conspiracy, since it happens under both Democrat and Republican administrations. That just seems to prove how insidious this conspiracy really is. It is a dream come true for the \\"one world order.\\"This book should be required reading for any person going into politics or Foreign Service."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"While I'm no expert on international finance I'm sure the book is (loosely) based on real events - it's no secret that various U.S. and international agencies have loaned money to developing nations to improve their infrastructures. However, it would seem that the author has done a substantial amount of reinterpretation and embellishment of actual events in order to sell books. A book about organizations with good intentions from industrialized nations loaning money to developing ones to build roads, power plants, etc not knowing if they would be able to repay the money would sell few copies. Regardless the author was apparently happy enough to profit from his role in these endeavors at the time, though now a changed man and with a guilty conscience, continues to reap the rewards of capitalism by selling books to suckers like me and you.I realize that Perkins now runs an NPO though I don't know much about what it really does other than deliver its anti-corporate message. In the book he frequently cites the greed of corporate America, western governments , and wealthy individuals as the driving forces behind the destruction of various cultures, forests, etc. I'm guessing but his books and speaking engagements must generate millions. So does he lead the humble existance of a man who really believes that greed is bad? Does he give all the money to the peoples he believes that he helped to ruin? I'm guessing not, or at least not much of it. I'll bet he, and probably the next few generations of Perkins, is pretty much set for life. If I'm wrong about that, I will gladly become a believer."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The author of this book has verifiable credentials. There is not doubt that he has been where he says he has and there is no reason to doubt what he has done. Instead of questioning his credibility as most reviews have done, listen to what the man is saying. He communicates a very accurate account of what he (and our country) has been through. To try and discredit this \\"memoir\\" is to say that someone else was there watching and can discredit him. The fact is that Mr. Perkins was at these events. He did experience them. I appreciate that people question what they are told, but no company mentioned in this memoir will dispute what is written as fact. John Perkins held the positions that he states that he held and for the time periods the he claims he held them. The entire point of what the man and the companies he represented were doing was ineffective if you can prove or disprove anything beyond that. What do you need to believe? There is no one to hold your hand.That said, after hearing what is reviewed in this book, there is no reason anyone should let one red cent of profit go to this man. He already has his riches. He has made them consistently since he started working as an \\"EHM.\\" If the turn of conscience that John Perkins has claimed to have experienced in this book is true, make sure that you read or hear (audiobook) everything he has to say on the subject and make sure that everyone you know hears it as well without him profiting.

General Smedley D. Butler's book \\"War Is A Racket\\" is also a must read. Perkins is not a hero to be admired. He always made sure his own nest was well feathered as he continued to participate in what he knew were crimes against humanity. Towards the end of his career he found a safe (for him) time to write this book exposing the whole despicable enterprise. It's hard to believe that this book and his other books and lectures on the subject were done as an act of penance. Most likely they are an attempt to cement his own legacy as a good guy working undercover. Nevertheless, the information presented here is crucial for the public to understand. America's government, now and for most of our history, has been run by the rich and privileged. Our major influences globally are aimed at supporting our private business interests. We've used out-right military intervention wherever needed, or most recently, loans to incur debt that can hardly ever be repaid to force the debtor nations to do business with us.

He indulges into his corporate role as an economist who helped take over foreign governments through fallacious economic projections resulting in amounts of debt equivalent to enslavement. Perkins continues to write about the alternatives faced when men such as him didn't succeed, specifically situations such as those we face now in Iraq.Greed, global empire and corruption are all disastrous truths most would prefer not to touch, but the feeling of ignorance before reading this book towers that miniscule desire to turn the other cheek.Josh L."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"For the people who want to know what is hidden behind the fact that America has become so strong over the years, this is the book to read.

Even if the novel is pure fiction (and I don't know where it fits on the fact/fiction spectrum) it does highlight issues like US/Saudi interdependence, and the history behind our security and oil partnership.

The result -- not entirely unexpected according to author John Perkins -- is massive Third World debt leading to an overall DECLINE rather than improvement in their standard of living, as more and more of the GNP has to go into paying off debt interest.A further claim by Perkins is that this economic imperialism results in loss of sovereignty, occasional regime change, environmental devastation and, not coincidentally, unprecedented loss of natural resources (oil and timber chief among them) to the invading powers -- which are not other nations, but global corporations, mostly privately-held, answerable only to their own directors.These global corporations -- familiar names like Bechtel, Halliburton, Kellogg Brown & Root, Chase Bank, Enron, BP, SWEC -- have traded executives back and forth between themselves and the various \\"pro-business\\" Republican administrations to the point where today it would be impossible to separate these economic raiders from our own national government. For all intents and purposes, US foreign policy is now made by Halliburton and Bechtel, which are private companies.Perkins walks a fine line in this book, between describing the devastation and rationalizing his own involvement in it, and at times the book sounds like a court-mandated community-service project. But get beyond the author's conscience and you can see a piece of the \\"puzzle of why the world hates us.\\"Incidentally, a good companion book is \\"All The Shah's Men\\" by Stephen Kinzer (2003), which describes the first instance in US history where private industry dictated US foreign policy, with devastating and far-reaching results."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I had all of John's shamanic books before Bush stole the election the first time or rather the Supremes selected him as our president with the help of a rather large organized propaganda machine and news media.

It is \\"must\\" reading for everyone.Another book that I feel enlarges the story that John is trying to tell us and which has been 'privished'(see below) is: \\"DuPont: Behind the Nylon Curtain\\" by Gerard Colby. It tells you what a military-industrial/chemical elitist family has been doing to your country since they arrived on our shores in 1799 by being ousted by the French as the worst sort of criminal family.The DuPont family was propelled into prominance by the 'Karl Rove' type of propaganda (lies) that the head of the family wrote for the French royalty to deceive the peasants into supporting measures against their own interests and keeping feudalism in place. These methods are handed down to the DuPont children still today. DuPonts were involved in the Smedley Butler affair (see pg 292) as they are with our present situation. As with the royals, propaganda is the necessary ingredient to keep them in their elitist positions and wealth and turning the country in a feudalist state just like they have been doing for decades to all the countries John writes about.Read both books, they support eachother."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book hardly talks about economics and instead reads like a bad spy novel. Without proper citation or even a shred of evidence its hard to take anything in this book seriously."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This is garbage. Worse than that, I think this book is bad for progressive economics. First of all, I am pretty sure Perkins is at best exaggerating what went on and at worst, a total liar. I don't doubt that there are people out there that make their living by betting against developing countries, and I don't doubt that there are people who have an economic incentive for progressive developing country leaders to fail. But I really doubt that the way these people ply their trade is by having beautiful blonds show young business guys (in this case, Perkins) the dark path by intellectually seducing them in Boston apartments while going around calling themselves hitmen. Perkins raises a number of good points regarding how third world debt is used as a weapon, and how the interests of the people in the global south do not always line up with their corrupt leaders, but his claims of conspiracy (and his role it in) stretches the realm of the believable.And no, just because no one has called him a liar doesn't mean he's telling the truth. It means that his argument is so insanely overdrawn that serious people in positions of power do not take him seriously.Which leads me to my next point. This book is bad for those seeking a more just world economic system. It feeds into the stupid left conspiracies that keep progressive economists impotent. There is a world wide conspiracy! They meet in dark rooms and plot our destruction! Nothing is that simple, folks, and until we give up on fairy tales and start looking at the global economy as it exists, meaning as a complicated world where many powerful people are at cross purposes and few grand conspiracies ever come to fruition we are bound to lose.There are very smart people writing about these issues in a much more serious way. Save your money and spend it instead on the works of Naomi Kline, Amartya Sen or Paul Collier.

A middle class boy grows up in a loving home, attends the best of schools, quits and is \`seduced' by a \`mysterious' woman who works for the NSA who convinces him that he is part of a governmental conspiracy to enslave third world countries and expand the American empire. (By the way, to the best of my knowledge, the NSA has nothing to do with economic affairs - they are analysts and technical collectors - passive not active intel collectors.) The rest of the book degrades into a series of TIME magazine articles, told weakly and held only tenuously together by the information above. Nothing is substantiated, except the author's self loathing and moral weakness, as he details his mea culpa and internal angst.The greatest tragedy is that while there are serious issues to discuss here, his poor credibility and smoke and mirrors explanations muddy the waters. The story dissolves into nothing more than a diatribe against western civilization. I had such high expectations and was misled by the first several reviews. If you are reading this review to consider the book, let me write what you will NOT find inside:&#61550; How do the World Bank and IMF work?&#61550; How did America, in any documentable fashion (we have pretty open records here), specifically influence world events?&#61550; What are economic hit men? How many are there?&#61550; Why the rest of the world was willing to go along with his plans?&#61550; Why would companies support policies that would impoverish their customer base abroad?&#61550; Why would America want to weaken its allies on the front lines of an (essentially economic) war on communism?In short, there is no reasonable discussion in the entire book of economics and US policy. Only internal ramblings and angry venom against social and fiscal conservatives. The author should stick to his other books in spiritual channeling and metaphysics. If you are interested in the topics he should have raised by his title, read Noam Chomsky or Howard Zinn balanced by the Lexus and the Olive Tree and a good economics text-book. In any case, some book that gives these matters thought, not just angry froth and internal angst."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"One might think from the title that the author is about to disclose the inner workings of the IMF and the World Bank, or the conditions imposed on countries who accept loans from the WB, or the economic crisis that results from privatization and other IMF \\"conditionalities\\".No such luck - this is a superficial, repetitive, rambling autobiography of an economic consultant who wants to cash in on the anti-globalization movement.If you want to get a better understanding of how countries are actually impoverished by IMF/World Bank loans, try Joe Stiglitz' Globalization and Its Discontents."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"If you are interested in reading a book about a man trying to rationalize years of his own cowardice and self loathing, then this book is for you. (Although I am not sure that I should write this because he might get one of the \\"Jackals\\" after me).Through his countless stories of his encounters with the \\"locals\\" of the countries his visits during his travels as an EHM (Economic Hit Man \\"As he is self-described\\"), Mr. Perkins attempts to paint himself as a champion of the common man. But the truth is that the hero of our story takes every opportunity through his actions to rob and destroy the cultures of these people who he so treasures. If Mr. Perkins has accurately described these interactions, then he is nothing but a coward. If they are false, then we see another feeble attempt by the author to inflate his own worth and importance.In the descriptions of his work related activities as an economic analyst for a US based consulting firm, Mr. Perkins attempts link his own un-ethical behavior and activities to a much larger global conspiracy. Given the assumption that Mr. Perkins has accurately recounted his own actions, it takes a great leap of faith for the reader to make the connections of his activities to the geo-political events described in this book. There are simply no facts or logic provided by the author to make these connections. In my opinion this is a story written by a self-absorber liar, who is trying to inflate the importance of his existence.But seriously, this book is a waste of time if you are looking for a non-fiction."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book affords an excellent look into the workings of our government that is perhaps given in time for us to do something about them. In the best sense of the word, it is also truly a book of \\"confessions\\" about a man's professional career that left him feeling unsatisfied, and I admire John Perkins' courage in writing it. His change of career was costly - prior to vesting in retirement. The problems presented are bipartisan in nature, and so the book avoids the pitfalls of Right or Left perspective. I also appreciate his volume discounts (available with the first edition, at least), which lend credibility to his message, his hope, and his love of country."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"EVERY American should read this book. By far, the best and most courageous confession ever published."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Finally, the truth is known. It was suspected all along, but now we know. This world is in trouble due to politics, big trouble. I am actually afraid for the next generation if we don't do something and do it quickly to get this world back on the right track. No wonder all of the world hates us so much. We have to much to loose and to much at risk if we don't do something soon. This book should be mandatory reading for everyone, as it's a true wake up."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"CEH is an exciting look into the secret activities of US economic giants and government. I recommend it. The only criticism that I have of CEH is the underdeveloped and naive line of world peace towed by the main character and author, John Perkins. Without sufficient development this theme would have been better if left out."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Author John Perkins has written a most thrilling adventure and most amazingly, it is his own true story of a dramatic awakening of his social conscience. As the chief economist for a secretive international consulting firm with close ties to U.S. intelligence, he was in the jockey position for numerous under-the-table deals, which led underdeveloped countries to take out huge loans that in turn, led to contracts for U.S. multinational corporations like Bechtel and Halliburton. This book reflects an act of great risk for Perkins, as for years, the self-dubbed \\"economic hitman\\" intentionally made unpayable loans to foreign governments in order to provide the U.S. government a monopoly over the economic and political resources of the indebted nations. The National Security Agency held his mercenary tactics in high esteem, and he lived in great affluence as a result.In the most intriguing portion of his book, Perkins dramatically supports the assertions made by Michael Moore in \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\", which tied Saudi Arabia to U.S. interests thereby creating a financial and political alliance between the Saudi royals and the Bush family. This partnership channeled billions of dollars to the Saudis, who were holding their oil earnings in U.S. Treasury bonds. The Treasury Department pays the interest on these bonds directly to favored U.S. corporations, with which it contracts to modernize Saudi Arabia's physical infrastructure. In return, the U.S. government uses its political and military clout to keep the Saudi royal family in power. As convoluted as this deal is, it worked very well for all parties until Iraq refused to participate in the same sort of deal, so U.S. military action became inevitable. This domino effect of events, while not revelatory at this point, is given stark resonance by Perkins' personal account of his participation in these immoral dealings.But he realizes the ultimate fruitlessness of his endeavors and comes clean. While his awakened conscience is refreshing, I am not certain his hopeful messages at the end are realistic. As we know from Enron and the like, for-profit corporations, especially those on a global scale, face strong pressures to maximize returns to their shareholders without regard to social or environmental consequences. Even more sadly, history has shown time and again that an unaudited concentration of power will directly produce the very corruption Perkins discusses. His guarded optimism leads him to suggest we identify steps we can make toward creating a more compassionate and just world. Somewhat idealistic but a worthy objective we all need to discuss and pursue. Strongly recommended reading, even more so in light of the election results."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Where's the option for ZERO stars??? I give it -1 out of 5.Yet another politically and questionably motivated, suspiciously \\"factual\\" autosnobography. Of course, this publishing company's whole agenda is to attack American political and business interests globally. Their every book is an outright assault on and distortion of American wealth, history, values and power. It's kind of funny, kind of sad, that the very economic engines and institutions these guys work tirelessly to assail so ably produce the kind of self-indulgent, self-hating society that buys so many of their rants, making THEM more wealthy, more powerful and more able to take another swat at the beast they seem to so despise. There is nothing hallowed, honest or honorable about these works or their premises, nor this book in particular. I'm surprised nobody has written a book exposing these foolish, anti-American elitists. I really wonder about their backgrounds and ownership interests. I really wonder if they believe any of this nonsense.Let me pause. We all know the US seeks to further its interests in the world both politically and economically. We all know that we have intelligences services that behave on our behalf and against it, sometimes well and oftentimes badly, both here and abroad. We all know that the decisions of our leaders, and our spooks, have caused great harm to a great many people a great many times. All of this notwithstanding, the tale Perkins weaves is, on its face, a bunch of bunk. Meaningless jibberish. No balance of truth. Only single-minded, narrow-minded swipes at America's role in the world.He demonizes the World Bank and its every loan of billions of dollars to foreign countries--the same institution that has done more to advance the lesser developed world than any institution in history. He rails against our armed conflicts at every chance, cosistently siding against our past enemies and leaving you with chills as he seems to retrospectively cheer our defeat. He calls our every moment of generosity and goodwill a faint in our chess game to dominate every nation and enslave the world. This is a diatribe that shows no recognition of geopolitical imperatives, complex international diplomacy, consequence of failing to do what we have done, and so much more. It feels false only because it is. It looks ugly only because this one reviewer has eyes that work. It smells like propaganda only because bullish one-sidedness always stinks. Adjacent truths to his non-truths again notwithstanding. This embellished biography is sophomoric and its five-star apparatchiks need to lay off the cool-aid.Perkins spats a kind of vacuous social-engineering babble--overweighted with complaints and conspiracy as you search for any kind of solutions or facts. He seems to truly hate his parents and resent his childhood. He abuses Thomas Paine and our founding fathers in ways they would have surely called him to guns at dawn for much less. He thinks himself a James Bond turned populist. Only problem is he never quite works for any intelligence service at all in any way, and never once seems to be telling the real story when he relates his experiences with the poor and disenfranchised or the powerful and emperialist. He touts early on some insinuation of romantic encounters with seductive women used as agents to work over our targets, but later reveals he indepently and criminally contracted a woman into a whore for his own business purposes. He purports a conpiracy to crush countries with artificially high loans as machinations of imperialism, when reading between the lines anyone can see the stronger motive to maximize profits and consulting revenues and, a bigger is better mentality. There is this delusory thread in his accounts (consistently in his and only his voice when recounting the so-called words of others) that much too perfectly, and therefore imperfectly, supports his thesis. If it's not the author's repeated, unbelievable \\"qoutes\\" from persons around the globe and across the years that all too snuggly buttress his case, then it's his whining, repetitive self-esteem and character issues. They all combine to grate on the reader, if the reader has any common sense at all.This man was on the periphery of some of our more interesting global misadventures. He was NEVER, and obviously so, central to anything whatsoever. He was a cog in a machine he himself so poorly understands but purports to be so vital to all along. He is grandiose in his humility and false in his \\"confessions.\\" There is nothing of value to find in this life journal, except possibly your further conviction that if you leave these kind of people unanswered, they will continue tirelessly in their work to destroy America from within. That's my hyperbole. Only problem is it's spot-on true."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Did President Roosevelt conspire with Adolf Hitler to start World War II in order to give American companies profits and to lift America out of the Depression?If you think so, with absolutely no evidence to support your theory, then you will love John Perkins' book.With no evidence, facts, or other documentation to support him, he makes 2 essentially major claims:1. he worked to distort economic reports to help third world countries get funds for development they did not deserve or need;2. it was a US government conspiracy to \\"enslave\\" these countries.Now while Perkins may have done number 1 above, he does not prove in any way the second charge.All through the 80's and 90's, corrupt governments were soliciting funds for developmental projects of dubious value. Perkins may have worked for them and help move these projects along. But on many occasions, the US government fought against the projects and funding them, or more specifically the US government fought against funding the UN's, the World Bank's, and the IMF's effort to do these projects.In fact I remember much acrimonious rhetoric coming from the likes of Tip O'Neil and Ted Kennedy about how evil Ronald Reagan was for not giving into the UN's, the World Bank's, and the IMF's request for more money to help in these projects.Many of the conservative press, especially the Wall Street Journal, Forbes magazine, and Investor Business Daily, condemned the very projects and the funding methods Perkins is now saying we supported.Ironic, isn't it, that the very organization that tried to stop this, the US government, is now the one blamed for the problem?Ironic, also, is the implied charge that the America economy is somehow to blame for the funding when in fact it was the policies of the UN, the IMF, the World Bank, and other more liberal organizations and politicians?"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I am afraid that this may be the worst book that I have ever read, not because it is not enjoyable to read, I actually flew through it, but because of how badly the author attempts to deceive the reader.What begins as a novel concept and gives me the hope of being enlightened on how the World Bank, IMF, and the international business community deal with developing nations, ended up as an egotistical rant by John Perkins. I would have sufficed to hear one concrete piece of evidence proving this conspiracy by the US that he talks about. Instead, what I got is the impression that John Perkins feels the world revolves around himself as he uses names he jokingly used to refer to himself and his projects (Economic Hit Man, Saudi Arabian Money Laundering Affair) as if everyone else viewed them as the same. In reality, it does not appear that he was as important as he believed. I would love to tell Perkins that just because once upon a time that he interviewd with the NSA does not mean that they set up his future jobs and made him an undercover employee, so undercover that even he was not told of his true work. The only person in this story who can collobarate any conspiracy such as that he mentioned is a woman named Claudine who was his \\"mentor.\\" Yet, there is no offical records of her working for MAIN, she dissapeared when Perkins left for Indonesia on his first assignment, and although he does not explicity say so, he had an affair with this woman. Based on this, the odds are clearly in favor of the fact that he merely had an affair with this woman, created the mentor story for his wife, and in the process was bragging to this woman about his job which they both decided could be appropriately called being an Economic Hit Man. That seems more realistic to me than that this company, MAIN, hired a woman, off the record, to approach him, seduce him, teach him secret information, and then dissapear without a trace. But that is just my opinion.However, that is just the problem with the book, it is all just his opinion. Despite his being in the industry for over 20 years, Perkins never offers any insights, besides exagerating his own importance, that offer more of an insight into what is going on than I could have found with a scrapbook of newspaper clippings from the events in question. In fact I learned more about his inner strugles and decision to write this book than I did about international affairs. Perhaps that is my fault for not looking close enough into the title: \\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man.\\" It is truly just a confessional, a book so Perkins can justify things that he belives he did wrong and why he did not stop doing them earlier.That all being said, if you are interested in reading the confessional ramblings of an egotistical man who has managed to blur the line between truth and fiction in his own eyes, this is the book you have been dying for. However, if you were hoping to read about the world of international finance through the eyes of an educated participant, that book has yet to be published. There is a reason that no reputable publishing house would publish this book or that there are no quotes from esteemed literary critics on the cover. That reason is not that this book exposes a vast conspiracy as the author repeatedly contends; it is because this book is absolutely terrible."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"John Perkins is somewhat confounding. I was so excited to read about economic espionage and American high intrigue. The book's billing does not match its content. The story does not deliver the promise of the coverleaf. Perkins indulges way too much in himself and a formulaic plotline that seems almost fictional. It feels like a first-time writer's self-published memoir of a life not as eventful as he himself imagines. His vignettes seem contrived. I don't see any balanced reason. There is no real confirmation that his life story is true, not because it lacks evidence, but because it reads like a life imagined instead of a life lived. He squanders many chances to make salient points about America's engagement with the world. This book, however, is all about his ego and very little about the world or his impact on much of anything.If you want to learn the back story on America's dealings around the globe, and something actually current, try America's Secret War. This book is well-reasoned, supported by lots and lots of facts, and comes with very little bias. In the end, Perkins' is too wrapped up in his idyllic, but weirdly made to be tortured, youth and some queer anti-US agenda that makes you question his objectives from the beginning."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I hated this book, and not for its politics.The big problem I had with this book is that right from the beginning it strained credulity to the breaking point. Let's get this straight - there is no way, no how the NSA had anything to do with training this guy to be a so-called economic hit man. The phenomenom he describes no doubt exists, in the sense that big public utility projects financed by international banks can result in serious negative consequences for underdeveloped nations while lining the pockets of engineering firms. And the US policy in oil countries has been an unmitigated disaster (regardless of what you think of the Iraq war if our diplomacy had been successful we wouldn't be fighting it). But this secret 007 world of self-conscious economic hit men is a deranged fantasy.Sorry folks, those of you who love byzantine conspiracy theories, it just isn't so. The NSA sits in a big nondescript building in Washington and engages in technological spying. Anything that has to do with human intelligence is the province of the CIA.Since the book starts with a story that is utterly preposterous and inaccurate, and since this delusion is the foundation of everything that follows, it's hard not to find the entire thing annoying.Part of what made me queasy is that there are truthful observations amid the nonsense. There is plenty that is reprehensible in the \\"corporatocracy\\" and in US involvement in foreign affairs. However, the reality is much more complex and shaded in hues of grey than Perkins' story. The book further inspires queasy feelings because the author freely admits many instances of dishonesty and duplicitous dealing while maintaining a stance of moral superiority. This book made me feel bathed in egotistical slime."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book is not worth the time it takes to pick it up.

I labored through the first half and had to put it down. According to his description, I am an economic hit man. In reality, I work with international financial institutions to help third world and lesser developed nations where they need the help most. There is politics involved. There are government snoops interfering, sometimes playing a big role. That's because governments are involved in these transactions. We're helping a nation, not a business or a school or a small community. When governments are involved, politics is involved. Wealthy, industrialized, civilized, educated, literate, GIVING/LENDING nations don't have lending terms dictated to them by often corrupt, fighting, under-developed, fractious, very poorly managed states. If no portion of these funds were returned to the established, able and capable businesses from the lending nations, the incentives to loan would be much diminished, and the help would be much less likely to be received. If 100% of the funds were circulated within the LDC or related LDCs, a much larger % of the funds would be wasted, stolen or mismanaged and the objectives/projects would fail for lack of expertise or ready means to deploy the funds successfully in the intended projects. If the funds go solely to feeding and housing and not changing the aspects of the recipient country's hobbled economy, then there will be no later and better capacity to self-manage or to repay the funds, and again, the funds would therefore not be made available. This Perkins bloke is full of himself and apparently very ignorant of basic economic facts. He is either naive or . . . I don't know what. But, he's nothing special and his book is even less so. LDC's have a long history of defaults because they are the kind of countries that don't already have institutions and methods and tools well established that allow for proper fiscal management. The size of the loans these days, and of recent defaults and bailouts, have not been determined by the World Bank or IMF nearly as much as the demands and burdensome needs and failures and violations of terms and blatant disregard of agreements from these failed or failing economies. If the remedies are harsh, it's because the problems are out of control. Perkins is selling a bill of goods and as a subject matter expert, I am not buying. Other buyers beware and be wary of these claims."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"If there is ever a books-on-tape edition, William Shatner should certainly serve as narrator.

On to page 97:\\"Oil revenues could be employed to hire U.S. companies to replace the goats with the world's most modern garbage collection and disposal system, and the Saudis could take great pride in this state-of-the-art technology.\\" To this day the Saudi solid waste disposal system remains the envy of the Arab world.

The book is written in a very thin manner, nearly devoid of detail and color - more of a rough screen play than a true memoir. Nearly every other page had some leaden anecdote or other experience that did not ring true. The author's NSA \\"recruitment\\" and his \\"Dinner With Andre\\" education by an older female co-worker into a supposed Economic Hit Man (EHM) was quite unbelievable and literally incredible.

I suspended my disbelief on his quotes and encounters across the years that place third parties consistently in the exact same voice and message, as if they are the same character identified as different persons (i.e., John's personal message being retold through his \\"recollections\\" of the words of \\"others\\").In the end, this just feels like another guy exploiting past experiences and current controversy for financial gain and notoriety. His analysis is sophomoric. His economic credentials and commentary are out of proportion. His confessions read like accounts gleaned from a journal where the writer is trying to impress himself. His encounters are either too vague and nondescript as to carry your interest, or too unbelievable to carry your confidence.I was very interested in this topic. I have read many a tale about the intelligence services and clandestine activities both real and fiction. The area makes for a good adventure and thrill. Unfortunately, Perkins fails to capture you in either realm of fact or fiction. His messages and warnings are dated or seem awfully off point. His angst from his childhood and career feel terribly exaggerated.Basically, I could not follow any point with which to vest my interests, curiosity or obligation as a concerned citizen.

He may have been in or around some key developments. He may have known some people who knew some people. However hard he tried to make it more than this, he never appears to have been a principal participant in these events he details, events themselves that seem kind of ethereal and foggy. Sort of like me claiming personal tragedy over 9/11 because I was trapped on a tarmac for three hours that day. I was touched by it, but come on, not in a personally tragic and direct way. It's also like someone who may sympathize with terrorist complaints or political objections, but only remotely and almost sub-consciously, then writes a book bragging about his or her masterminding role in some attack.It just doesn't compute. This book is hyper-political, overcharged with weird childhood emotions that you never can connect with, and lots and lots of claims without context or substance. This plot is essentially ruderless, adrift in a sea of hatred, loathing and anti-American agendas.I've given it too much credibility by even knocking it for a moment. I'm done.

His whole tone is bogus. Recent news shatters every part of his book, with the G8 forgiving third world debt.
