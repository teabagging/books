If you are looking for a nice romantic read like Jane Eyre or Emma or Persuasion then DON'T read this book. I am sure it is classical literature and makes a nice commentary on society, but as I was not reading this for an English class, I wouldn't know about any of that. I was not analyzing it, I wanted to read it for fun but didn't enjoy it at all."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"A classic, indeed. For someone not too fond of reading, this book has recaptured my interest in the activity. It is a significant and profound notch on the belt of the ever-enrapturing theme of the tragic love triangle. The 1992 film version of the novel is what first captured my attention. After seeing that film I had to pick up the book. It was the first book I've read in months and I'm glad that this was the read I chose. For some, the language may be a bit of a stretch to understand at first, but it quickly becomes 2nd nature (it's no \\" Nadsat,\\" courtesy of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE). The archaic punctuation and diction, as well as the unwarned flip-flop of narrators may lead to some turbulence in the read, but that's nothing a good dose of patience and willingness to reread the page won't cure. A plethora of the more critical reviews have pointed out that many, if not all of the characters are unlikable at least part of the time if not continuously, but I argue that it's their flaws and the causes of their flaws which make these same cruel characters interesting and worthy of our sympathy (sometimes). The novel draws upon very human emotions and very human reactions to those emotions which should satiate any readers' unconscious internal hunger for the exploration of human depth and dynamics."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I read this book because is a must read and I heard it mentioned in many movies/shows that I thought I had to give it a try. I was not interested in the beginning but it turned out to be a page turner although I was disappointed at how it ended, not sure there was any other way to end it but while reading it I wondered if there was a movie about it (never searched to see)...some how I kept picturing Gerald Butler as Heathcliff."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I certainly liked it.... I guess the only thing that is so very frustrating to me and most surely the point of the novel, is the destruction of all involved in this story. The love is not love at all but total obsession and selfishness. Its a cautionary tale. I used to think it was supposed to be romantic, but after reading it and also seeing the BBC version of Wuthering Heights I am convinced that Emily Bronte thought to diadactically show the writer that what some call love is no LOVE at all."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I've always been a sucker for reading the classics and finally got a chance to read this one.

My recollections of the great love of Cathy and Heathcliff's turned to impatience with the angst filled duo and a shocking realization that I did not like either of these individuals well.But that being said, I found I appreciated the second half of the book much more than my first read which I must have barely skimmed with the great love being physically impossible. Nor did I forgive Heathcliff as I once did, because my enthusiasm for bad boys has waned over the years.But the question remained for me, when I was forced to rebuild my thoughts regarding this classic novel, was what made it so, what did it have to offer over the centuries to us today? It is a truly atmospheric novel that presents the cold and cruel world of the Yorkshire moors, which seems to shape people in its own fashion. But the value of the book perhaps, is a look at the many faces of love, and what people will do in the name of love.Bronte's Wuthering Heights is a true classic in that each reader can take a lesson from it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"The story is depressing and confusing, if you are to believe the adaptations. If you are to believe the 1978 one, also tremendously long-winded and boring. The book, however, is not long-winded and it's not confusing either. It's got decent pacing, good characters (even though there are a number of DSM-IV labels that can be distributed liberally amongst them) and passion. Lots and lots of passion. Not necessarily of the bodice-ripping kind, but passion and fury. Especially the latter.Problem is, as much as I enjoyed reading the book and Emily Bront's writing, which is a lot more succinct than her sister Charlotte's, I don't like any of the characters and I have no sympathy for any of them, save for narrator Nelly/Ellen, because they're all a bunch of b*st*rds who deserve a good slap! I know, I know, it was written a long time ago, but I get the feeling that Emily didn't particularly like the people she wrote about either. They're either violent, drunkards, narcissists or just plain emo. But yes, aside from wanting to give the majority of the cast a good shake and yell \\"wake up and smell the coffee!\\" at them, it's still a good read. Yes, even though it's a little bit depressing and everyone hates each other and people die. Some people you're quite relieved to see the end of.The edition I have (Wordsworth Classics - cheap and cheerful!) comes with a glossary to be able to interpret ye olde English. Some of the words feel a bit unnecessary, because they're either fairly common knowledge or you can grasp the meaning by the context, whereas others ... well, any time poor old Joseph opens his mouth, you need a translator. Yorkshire dialect, 18th/19th century, oww. English isn't even my first language, so it was a tad bit difficult to read. The rest of the book wasn't a problem, just the bits in dialect.The book is actually a lot better than any of the adaptations I've seen. Emily's prose is atmospheric and timeless. Some of her words keep being repeated in the adaptations because, well, they're worth it. Notably this one, which is very passionate:\\"My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being.\\"See, that's goosebumps right there. How profound, how passionate, how... obsessive and bordering on deranged! But that's what I like about it. It tells a compelling (and rather violent) story of a couple of star-crossed lovers who live miserable ever after. What would it have been like if Cathy and Heathcliff had decided to get married? That's what I'd like to know.Anyway, it's a book that exceeded my expectations. I thought it'd just be weird and confusing like the adaptations, but no, it was actually pretty good. It was well written, and to think all of that came out of a parson's daughter living a fairly sheltered life in a small Yorkshire town. Just shows how good her imagination was, and her skill with a pen."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This was recorded by Ruth Golding for librivox.org and is available free, gratis and for nothing at that site - as 80,000 people have already discovered."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I read this book because I had to teach it in a literature class about three years ago. The novel is poetical in nature, but it uses simple words to unravel the romantic twist in the novel. Catherine who is the center of the novel is in love with two men in her life one who she loves dearly and the other who she married for money. The two men in the novel Edgar Linton and Heathcliff are definitely in love with her. Edgar Linton shows his love for her by staying as a widower even after Catherine's death. By contrast, Heathcliff seeks to revenge his treatment by the Earnshaw family. At the end of the novel the two men who are in love with Catherine are buried close to her.One theme that stands out in the novel is that of love. What does it mean to love someone dearly? How does loving someone manifest itself in the lives of women and men? Is it possible to carry out nefarious act because of love? The responses to these questions are answered in the way the plot of the novel turns out. Through her prose, Emily Bronte answers these questions. Love to her means to be faithful to a partner despite the person's flawed character. Love can be seen as delicate subject which can lead to someone conducting baneful actions, as well as conducting acts of kindness.In a sensational group of compound sentences, Bronte shows her readers how love can be convoluted sentiment in women \\"My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees.

The book is designed perfectly for the young readers, especially girls. My students were very excited about reading the novel when they saw the cover of the book. The font of the novel is quite large and because of this the book is almost 500 pages; this put off some of the students because they were worried about reading such a large book. However, I explained that it made it easier to read and to take notes in because of the larger print and margins. There is also a pedigree chart in the book and a character reference section that certainly made it more understandable to my students. Also, as we read it, they got more and more excited when they saw how far they would get in just one reading. This book has a Lexile reading score of 880, which is a 6th grade beginning reading level, however, it is quite a difficult read for younder audiences because of the period grammar. My students read quite far above their grade level and most had difficulty with comprehension.

Set on the wild, rugged Yorkshire moors of northern England, this classic gothic novel follows the story of Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw, adopted siblings and lifelong lovers. Narrated through the diary of Mr. Lockwood, a tenant of nearby Thrushcross Grange, this strange and fantastic story tells of a love that transcends all boundaries--even death.Mr. Lockwood is paying a polite visit to his landlord, Heathcliff, when he is expectedly stranded there during a snowstorm. Forced to stay the night at Wuthering Heights, despite Heathcliff's clear displeasure, Lockwood finds an unoccupied room in the grand house. Unable to sleep, however, he stumbles upon the diary entries of a young girl named Catherine Earnshaw, who writes of adventures with her young friend Heathcliff. After nodding off to sleep, Lockwood is awakened when the Catherine's ghost appears at his window, pleading to be let in.When Lockwood returns to Thrushcross Grange the next day, he asks his housekeeper, Ellen (Nelly) Dean, to tell him the story of Heathcliff and the others at Wuthering Heights. Nelly begins her story thirty years earlier, when Mr. Earnshaw brings home an orphaned Heathcliff to raise with his own children, Hindley and Catherine.Though Catherine and Heathcliff are, for many years, inseparable despite Hindley's cruel persecution, eventually the two seem to drift apart. Catherine becomes a proper young lady, and since Hindley forces Heathcliff to work in the fields after their father's death, Heathcliff becomes ignorant and angry. Catherine chooses to marry Edgar Linton, a rich neighbor whom she naively believes will take care of her and Heathcliff. However, Heathcliff interprets this move as rejection, and he runs away for several years.When he returns, he has mysteriously acquires wealth and prestige, though his brooding nature has not been appeased. He has vowed revenge against all of those who have wronged him. When Catherine is confronted by her two loves, Edgar and Heathcliff, she falls ill and dies after giving birth to Cathy. Before she dies, however, she and Heathcliff reassert their undying love to each other.Now, many years later, Heathcliff is more embittered than ever, and he lives to torment the offspring of his long-dead enemies. But he is constantly conscious of Catherine's post-mortem presence, and he is pulled toward eternal love and happiness with her beyond the grave.AnalysisDespite the many narratives-within-a-narrative (the story is a diary entry, often recording Nelly's narrative, who in turn often relates the detailed speeches of others), I found the story surprisingly easy to follow on audiobook. I enjoyed listening to the heavily accented speech of Joseph and other characters, though I also checked a paperback out from the library to understand what they were actually saying!Nelly's judgmental comments about the devilish behavior of Catherine and Heathcliff, which only seems to worsen with time, make the pair seem irresponsible and deserving of any punishment that they receive. Nelly supports this viewpoint with the opinions of Edgar Linton and Hindley, both of whom despise Heathcliff and become frustrated with Catherine, and she portrays the lovelorn couple as ungrateful and spiteful.It struck me as odd that such a seemingly selfish and cruel pair would feel so deeply for each other. In my experience, relationships between truly destructive people such as Catherine and Heathcliff never end well. But their love persists and even grows stronger with each passing year.All of the other characters in the story judge the actions of Catherine and Heathcliff quite harshly, but their persecution only serves to strengthen the depth of feeling between the two. Every time Nelly criticizes their irreverent and even cruel behavior, I felt more sympathy and understanding for them and I began identifying with the persecuted couple. No one believes in them but themselves, and that is what makes their love so powerful and endearing.I found Wuthering Heights to be an enjoyable read; even more than Jane Eyre. Such a powerful story of love and loss ages well, and the unconventional use of an unreliable narrator had an interesting effect upon my view of the characters and story.The very subtle addition of Catherine's ghost, which could be interpreted as real or could be read as merely a figment of Lockwood's and Heathcliff's imaginations, does not diminish the credibility of the story. On the contrary, the supernatural elements throughout the novel only serve to add to the dark, intense feelings between the two lovers."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This book is like nothing I've ever read. Beautifully written yet filled with hateful characters and depressing scenes. Yet...yet, I loved it! Emily Bronte does what few authors are capable of doing successfully; compelling you to care for people and situations you otherwise would not. So unlike her sister, Charlotte, who created a likable, strong character in Jane Eyre, Emily creates Cathy, Heathcliff, and the rest of this brooding, spoiled, and somewhat selfish cast of characters driven to depression and madness by the pitfalls of love--both familial and romantic--and makes you want to never stop reading about them.

I actually really liked this book. It wasn't flawless, but was certainly enjoyable for a classic.The Things I Didn't Like:1. The narration. It was just a mess. It would be a narration inside a narration inside a narration. I had no idea who the \\"I\\" was whenever it was mentioned. And I just find it a tad bit unbelievable that Nelly Dean was a witness to it all. I kept cracking up because I would imagine Nelly hiding under tables or behind doors, listening in on all these intense conversations. I would have preferred it in third person.2. The names. I can't count how many time I was confused because I lost track of which Catherine, Linton, or Heathcliff, Bronte was talking about. I think I ended up guessing more than once.3. Joseph's accent. Oh, Lord. His dialogue was practically in another language. I ended up kind of skimming his parts because it wasn't worth the five minutes it took to decipher one paragraph.The Things I Did Like:1. All the characters. They were just so crazy, flawed, unlikable, dramatic, and awesome. I loved them and I hated them.2. When it was written. It just blows my mind that this was written 150 years ago. Besides the language, it just seems so modern to me. Not the setting, but the plot seems like something people would enjoy today.3. Romantic but not romantic. I loved how every action and conversation was so filled with passion. It wasn't a romance in the traditional sense, and that made it seemed more realistic. Heathcliff was both the antagonist and protagoninst. He definitely wasn't swoon worthy like the other heroes of his time, but he was darker, more coplex.I'm really surprised by how much I liked this novel. I wish Emily lived to write another one."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Published in 1847, WUTHERING HEIGHTS was not well received by the reading public, many of whom condemned it as sordid, vulgar, and unnatural--and author Emily Bronte went to her grave in 1848 believing that her only novel was a failure. It was not until 1850, when WUTHERING HEIGHTS received a second printing with an introduction by Emily's sister Charlotte, that it attracted a wide readership. And from that point the reputation of the book has never looked back. Today it is widely recognized as one of the great novels of English literature.Even so, WUTHERING HEIGHTS continues to divide readers. It is not a pretty love story; rather, it is swirling tale of largely unlikeable people caught up in obsessive love that turns to dark madness. It is cruel, violent, dark and brooding, and many people find it extremely unpleasant. And yet--it possesses a grandeur of language and design, a sense of tremendous pity and great loss that sets it apart from virtually every other novel written.The novel is told in the form of an extended flashback. After a visit to his strange landlord, a newcomer to the area desires to know the history of the family--which he receives from Nelly Deans, a servant who introduces us to the Earnshaw family who once resided in the house known as Wuthering Heights. It was once a cheerful place, but Old Earnshaw adopted a \\"Gipsy\\" child who he named Heathcliff. And Catherine, daughter of the house, found in him the perfect companion: wild, rude, and as proud and cruel as she. But although Catherine loves him, even recognizes him as her soulmate, she cannot lower herself to marry so far below her social station. She instead marries another, and in so doing sets in motion an obsession that will destroy them all.WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a bit difficult to \\"get into;\\" the opening chapters are so dark in their portrait of the end result of this obsessive love that they are somewhat off-putting. But they feed into the flow of the work in a remarkable way, setting the stage for one of the most remarkable structures in all of literature, a story that circles upon itself in a series of repetitions as it plays out across two generations. Catherine and Heathcliff are equally remarkable, both vicious and cruel, and yet never able to shed their impossible love no matter how brutally one may wound the other.As the novel coils further into alcoholism, seduction, and one of the most elaborately imagined plans of revenge it gathers into a ghostly tone: Heathcliff, driven to madness by a woman who is not there but who seems reflected in every part of his world--dragging her corpse from the grave, hearing her calling to him from the moors, escalating his brutality not for the sake of brutality but so that her memory will never fade, so that she may never leave his mind until death itself. Yes, this is madness, insanity, and there is no peace this side of the grave or even beyond.It is a stunning novel, frightening, inexorable, unsettling, filled with unbridled passion that makes one cringe. Even if you do not like it, you should read it at least once--and those who do like it will return to it again and again.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Rather than delve on the contents of this strangest and strongest of English novels, so intensely poetic in its haunting darkness and otherness, I'll comment briefly on the best editions available for a good first contact:A) Text oriented editions (that is, editions with few materials added: normally an Introduction, annotation, and perhaps Charlotte's Peface and Biographical Notice and some bibliographical indications).1. Oxford World's Classics: authoritative text, good annotation,excellent introduction.2. Penguin's Classics: same as above, everything looks a little shorter but is excellent nonetheless.3. Wordsworth Classics edition. This would be a rather fine edition as befitting this collection, if it had a good 1847 text and not the heavily tampered-with Charlotte's 1850 edition. The text itself reflects accurately that of the 1900 Haworth Edition -a careful one-. The wording changes aren't perhaps so worrying nor is the toning-down of the dialectal tirades -although funny and useless-. What is worrying is the disappearance of more than six hundred paragrapph entries (I mean just the paragraphing, not the contents itself!), that makes for a different -and worse- reading experience. Very good and full -if brief- annotation. Mass-market, glued paperback.4. Heather Glen's for Routledge. One of the finest text-oriented editions, especially for the excellent Introduction and Epilogue together with its good annotation, out-of-print for rather obscure reasons. If you find still a very good to fine copy at amazon Canadian branch (or at abebooks.com, it would be a good buy.5. Orchises two-volume facsimile reprint of the 1847 edition. No notes nor any additional material. the books are well produced if a little expensive. Very interesting item, but only suitable for textual scholars or would-be scholars, or otherwise for fetish-oriented WH-maniacs.B) Study-oriented editions (i.e. editions that contain additional contextual information: early reviews, selection of Emily's poems, critical essays, chronologies of the novel or of the Bronte family...).6. Norton's Fourth Edition (current item): OK, the text is still a little idiosyncratic, but the notes are much improved, and so is everything else (with the anthology of poems, and the critical essays). A very fine study edition but also suitable for a first contact, although annotation is still on the scarce side. Good paperback production without flaps but signature-sewn (or so it seems) and good paper and printing quality (albeit with a rather small type).7. Broadview edition by Beth Newman: it's one of the best study editions overall. There are some minor textual foibles and the annotation is decidedly scanty (to make amends for Heywood excesses) but good and accurate, and both Prof. Newman ecellent Introduction and the selection of the additional contextual material is, arguably, the finest ever (including the very interesting document on \\"Brain fever\\"). Materially speaking, it is a good paperback without flaps with good paper and printing quality (like Norton Critical, although I can't ascertain without tearing apart my copy of Beth Newman's that it be signature-sewn instead of glue-only \\"perfect binding). In any case a very good buy.7. Alison Booth's for Longman Cultural. Other of the very best study editions available. The text is deadly acuurate -except for some 1850 unobtrusive detail- on theClarendon 1976 reference critical edition, although the punctuation -like Norton Critical, Broadview's Newman and Oneworld's one- has been silently lightened and modernized throughout. It looks like glue-only \\"perfect binding\\" paperback, but perhaps it is signature-sewn. Paper and printing quality are good enough. The only misgiving I have is the overdone fragmentation of contextual material (good and relevant material though it is): there are 40+ items, many of them very short or they wouldn't fit into 430 pages. One of the best possible buys.8. Onewold's Classics edition. A fine paperback edition with flaps, very good paper and printing quality and (I rather surmise than know for sure) signature-sewn. The text looks like 1847 in paragraphing but it takes in toomany of 1850 \\"improvements\\" and is wrong at some places: it's short of a disaster, but rather non-reliable (in spite of the well-meant efforts by the almost anonymous editing panel who perpetrated it). Annotation is good and comprehensive enough, but the contextual material is rather scanty and run-of-the-mill non-commital.9. Barnes&Noble;'s Tatiana Holway edition (hardcover). To say it promptly the only fault with this lovely edition (but, as stated above in wordsworth Classics edition, a really big fault) is its accurate and reliable 1850 Haworth Edition text. Other than this, it looks as a popularly oriented edition, but with quality marks. The Introduction by Daphne Merkin is good enough, the annotation by Holway is really excellent. Supplementary material is very scanty: the \\"Charlotte's prefatory materials\\" of 1850 (prefixed to the text, which is a pity), and some comments about film and TV adaptations as well as some chosen excerpts of reviews. Material production is outstanding: nice hardcover with dust jacket, good paper and printing quality, the only good available edition in a becoming format (Clarendon Edition is very hard to come by nowadays: say one to three years to pin it down). Don't forget the Franklin Mint editions of the sixties and seventies if you are interested in a very beautiful book with a reliable 1847 text and illustrations by Alan Reingold (and nothing else)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"There is a thin line between love and hate, and once Heathcliff crosses it, we see a grand, passionate and absorbingly interesting man turn into a fearsome thug. Thwarted in his love for his childhood soulmate, Catherine Earnshaw, Heathcliff turns his devastation outward, becoming a hateful -- and hated -- person all across the bleak moors that surround his Yorkshire village.Heathcliff courts and marries the sister of the man whom Catherine chose over Heathcliff, only to torture her emotionally as a way of getting even with her brother. Meanwhile, Catherine slowly wastes away pining for Heathcliff, for although she once rejected him, she eventually realizes that she has made an irredeemable error and can never be happy. Heathcliff sums up the tragedy of their lives in a single question near the end of the novel when he asks, \\"Why did you betray your heart, Cathy?\\"Sound depressing? It's not. Wuthering Heights is a grand and glorious novel that dramatically illustrates the power of love, for good and ill. But more importantly, it teaches us that the only path to happiness is to be true to one's heart, rather than one's head. Had Catherine honored her bond with Heathcliff and refused to bow to the social mores of her day, not only would the two of them been much happier, but all of the many people whose lives they stumbled into would have been much better off.Another reviewer said that those of us who love this novel probably have a strong identification with one of the characters, and for me that is quite true. That's the reason for reading a classic like Wuthering Heights, because when it speaks to you in the clear and true way that Bronte does, you know that you are not alone, and that some things transcend time and place.Think about it -- a prim, Victorian preacher's daughter living on the moors of England before there was electricity can reach across 150 years of time and speak to the heart of a wired American in the 21st century. Pretty amazing, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"\\"Wuthering Heights,\\" Emily Bronte's only published novel, is a saga of two Yorkshire families who live in the remote Pennine Hills of England's North Country. To me the book has always epitomized the best of gothic fiction. The narrative is filled with intensity of feeling, especially Heathcliff's passionate love for his Cathy and hers for him - a love which endures beyond the grave. More than would be lovers, however, the two are soul mates and have been since their childhood. Cathy once told Nelly, her servant and friend: \\"My greatest thought in living is Heathcliff. If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be... Nelly, I am Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure... but as my own being.\\"Yet, the novel is more than a love story. \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is about hatred, cruelty, delusion, frustrated yearning, obsession, deep despair and vengeance. At times its very darkness is depressing and painful. Yet love and faithfulness, which endure beyond death, bring hope and much needed light to this tale; as does a second love story, born from the seeds of the first. The author also addresses the issues of social class here. Both Linton and Earnshaw families are considered gentry. However, the Linton's are a more educated, cultured group and appear to be of a higher class than those who reside at Wuthering Heights. Some of Catherine's most crucial decisions involve moving up in society.The story is told in a series of narratives, none of which are entirely reliable. During the winter of 1801, a gentleman named Mr. Lockwood rents a manor house called Thrushcross Grange in Yorkshire. He has a natural curiosity, and in time visits his neighbor and wealthy landlord, Heathcliff, a grim, forbidding man who lives at Wuthering Heights, a few miles from the Grange. Lockwood also makes the acquaintance of Heathcliff's housekeeper Ellen Dean, called Nelly, and asks her to tell him about her employer and the history of those who reside at Wuthering Heights. He documents her narrative in his journal, and his written recollections make up the main portion of the novel. Much of Nellie's tale consists of memories from years before, her observations of life with the Earnshaw family, her recollections of the Lintons, and her own conclusions, which are subjective. Lockwood, gets his information second hand, from Nellie's perspective. He continually interprets, and misinterprets the relationships and actions of the characters who play such major roles here. So, it is up to the reader to make sense of it all - which is what the author intended.As a young girl Nelly worked as a servant at Wuthering Heights for Mr. Earnshaw, the owner, his wife, and their two children, Hindley, and Catherine. Earnshaw returned from a business trip to Liverpool with a gypsy-like urchin, a dark-haired, handsome orphan boy. He had taken quite a fancy to the lad, a quiet, stoic child, and names him Heathcliff, after a son who died. Earnshaw decides to raise him with his own children. Catherine befriends Heathcliff almost instantly. They share a love of nature, and an emotional intensity unknown to most people. They are able to communicate with each other easily, even as young children, and both possess tremendously creative imaginations. The two roam the moorland wilderness, where they're most at home, like wild creatures of nature, and become inseparable friends. Hindley detests Heathcliff from the first. He is jealous and goads the boy constantly. Eventually, after the death of his wife, Mr. Earnshaw begins to show preference for Heathcliff over his own son, which exacerbates the hostility. Finally, Hindley is sent away to school and Heathcliff is kept at home, at Earnshaw's side.Hindley comes into his inheritance some years later, at age twenty, when his father dies. Cathy is eleven years-old, and Heathcliff about twelve, when the heir returns to Wuthering Heights, and seeks vicious revenge for having his rights usurped by a wretched boy from the slums with no means of his own. Obviously Heathcliff cannot defend himself and is totally dependent on Hindley. He is forced to work as a laborer in the fields, and is treated harshly, as less worthy than an animal. He and Cathy maintain their closeness. They still wander the wild North country and she shares her studies with him. One night they pay a clandestine visit to Thrushcross Grange, home of the Linton family. Cultured, spoiled and very well behaved, young Edgar and Isabella live there. When a dog savagely bites Cathy, it is discovered that she and Heathcliff have been hiding in the brush spying. The girl is seriously injured and is forced to stay at the Grange for several weeks to recover. During her time with the Linton family, Mrs. Linton becomes intent on turning wild, mischievous Cathy into a young lady. She encourages her to become a young woman with manners and actions appropriate to her social standing in society, rather than the wild, headstrong creature she is while roaming the moors with Heathcliff. By the time Catherine returns home, in elegant new clothes, she has become infatuated with Edgar Linton. Needless to say, her relationship with Heathcliff deteriorates significantly, as he feels he is losing the only person he ever loved.Edgar pursues Catherine relentlessly, and eventually, the young woman's desire for social advancement, and an inexplicable fey, self destructive quality about her, prompt her to accept his proposal. However, she really does not love her fiance. She may care for him, but her feelings are much less than what her passionate nature requires. On the other hand genteel women of this period were supposed to have neither \\"passionate\\" nor intense feelings. \\"'Here and here!' replied Catherine, striking one hand on her forehead and the other on her breast: 'in which ever place the soul lives. In my soul and in my heart, I'm convinced I'm wrong!'\\" Thus Catherine acknowledges to Nelly that her marriage to Edgar cannot be one of love. Although she knows that Heathcliff is her true love, however, she cannot marry him because he has been so debased by Hindley. \\"It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; so he shall never know how I love him: and that, not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton's is as different as a moonbeam from lightening, or frost from fire\\". Her powerful connection to Heathcliff is always present, no matter how annoyed she becomes with him. Heathcliff leaves Wuthering Heights a bitter man. He knows that if he had come from a better social class, or had wealth, Cathy would have married him. When he finally returns, years later, a self-possessed, successful, wealthy man, he is obsessed with revenge, and is more adept at exacting it than Hindley ever was.Nelly continues her increasingly complex tale, (which I won't spoil for you), of three generations: of births, marriages, deaths, traumas, complications, a second more hopeful love story and redemption. The most recurring theme is the great love and friendship, the everlasting connection, between Cathy and her Heathcliff, whose difficult nature is almost impossible to understand and to accept - unless, of course, one thinks about his unknown origins and early childhood as a homeless waif in Liverpool. One can only imagine the horrors he experienced wandering the streets of the rough port town, with neither protection nor kindness. What cruelty and meanness of spirit did he learn there? His terrible, inhuman treatment at Hindley's hands certainly played a part in Heathcliff's lust for revenge and lack of mercy, as did Catherine's decision to marry Linton, which must have been devastating for him. Heathcliff remains a dark, brooding, cruel man throughout his adult years and never reforms. He is an anti-hero, at least in my eyes, as he also possesses good qualities, along with a terrible sadness, an emptiness and longing which he shows to Cathy alone.Emily Bronte's extraordinary prose is filled with powerful imagery. Miss Bront spent most of her short life at home, in Thornton, Yorkshire, where she was happiest. She loved the surrounding moors - the wide, wild expanses, unsuitable for cultivation, and full of danger. There are bogs and wetlands on the moors, which can go virtually unseen, and where one can drown. It is also a place of great beauty. The author spent much time walking there with her dogs and was terribly unhappy when she was away. The similarities between the author's natural environment and that of the area around Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange are obvious. Ms Bronte drew inspiration from the regional Yorkshire architecture also, as well as her own personal experiences and her amazing imagination, a gift Charlotte, Emily, Anne and Branwell Bronte shared - with each other and with us. I have read a few Bronte biographies and always felt that the character of Catherine Earnshaw, certainly her intensity and love of nature, was based on Emily Bronte.Keep a box of tissues handy throughout your reading of \\"Wuthering Heights.\\" I wonder if this is the first tearjerker?JANA"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I'm 16 and fall into the vast catogory of Wutehring Heights readers who had to finish it for a highschool english assignment. If I hadn't been, er, forced to read it, I never would've encountered this amazing book. The themes that it encompasses, love, hate, revenge, isolation, are so masterfully blended in this book that I found it extremely powerful. True, it is not a romance - it is so much more. I didn't find it confusing, although Joseph's lines had to be read allowed several times before they were actaully understood. The doubling-up of names just increases the sense of isolation within the book, something which I think is rather important to the story. I hardly find this book boring at all, it's passionate and full of action, something which took me completely off guard. Please, give it a chance. And even though he was a complete jerk, my favourite character is still Heathcliff. *G*"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Is there anybody out there who hasn't heard of Heathcliff, the dark villian/hero of this high pitched and utterly committed work of madness? Oh, I love it. It was difficult for me at first. I'm a writer, but not a natural reader. But once I was into this book, once I stopped asking questions of the narrative and just entered the shadowy world of Catherine and her doomed household, I was quite literally spellbound. Bronte died believing this book was a failure. What a dreadful irony that this quiet, disciplined woman who lived out her life in a cold parsons' house with her brilliant sisters, her drunken brother and her eccentric father (The man memorized Paradise Lost: imagine. And outlived all his children!) never even had an inkling that this outpouring of her heart and soul would become a classic, overshadowing even her sister's highly successful Jane Eyre. Both Bronte sisters had the capacity to create archetypes -- to imprint upon the culture seminal patterns that endure to the present time. One last point: the father was Irish. Madness and genius in the blood, indeed. Enjoy it. I read it over every year or so, sometimes twice in a row. I study it; I watch all the film versions. I just love it, the way it works, its strange cruelty and enchantment."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"The fact that this novel was written when Emily Bronte was only 28 years old, two years before her death, makes one wonder what she would have been capable of had she lived longer and continued writing. I must admit, this was one of those books that I appreciate for its literary merit more than enjoy for its pure reading pleasure. But if the true test of a novel is how visceral of a reaction the reader has to its characters, then this is certainly a fine novel. Each of Bronte's characters is exquisitely developed in his or her own way. And each evokes powerful emotional responses from the reader - mostly negative reactions of anger, frustration, disgust, etc. - but reactions, nonetheless. A well-written character, remember, does not have to be a character that you admire or love; pathetic, self-centered, cruel characters can be the product of exceptional writing, as long as they evoke genuine feelings of revulsion from the reader.And this novel is full of characters that will earn little admiration from readers. Indeed, the only character that was really \\"likeable\\" was the temporary tenant of the Wuthering Heights estate, to whom the story is recounted by Ellen, the servant. Ellen gives her account of the events that she witnessed as the domestic employee of Catherine, a self-centered, melodramatic eccentric who falls in love with Heathcliff, the gypsy who under somewhat mysterious circumstances is brought by her father to live in their home. Despite her love, Catherine marries Edgar, causing Heathcliff to devote the remainder of his years to exacting revenge for her betrayal. What follows is a dark, brutal, sometimes frightening tale of a pathological love affair and its tragic consequences.Bronte certainly did not view the world through rose-colored glasses, if Wuthering Heights is any indication of her personal world view. It can be a difficult read at times, only because the few redeemable qualities of the main characters are so powerfully overshadowed by their flaws, their cruel intentions, and the bleak outlook that Bronte portrays. It certainly deserves its place, however, among the classics of English literature, and its characters, despite their shortcomings (or perhaps because of them), will live long in the readers mind after the final page."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Emily Jane Bronte wrote Wuthering Heights not to show what love IS. But what love can DO to those who are encompassed by desire. This novel is simply brilliant and by far the greatest novel of the Brontes and (in my opinion) the greatest novel ever written. I say this because Emily laid aside all the conventional types of victorian writing and imbued her novel with persons and events that are not ordinary, but utterly fascinating. Almost completely unrealistic at times, yet perfectly sound in their meanings. Some say to me that Wuthering Heights is impossible to enjoy. While others say they dislike the characters so much that they had to stop reading. I also hear that they cannot figure out all the plot twist and turns. But I say, is this not what REAL-LIFE is? There is no certainty of happiness in the lives of Catherine and Heathcliff. Certainly there is no certainty of happiness for ANYONE in the novel. (Which goes the same for all of us.) As wretched as this seems, Emily (in my opinion) did not write a full blown epic of true romance, despite what many say they love about this novel. She took humans and turned them into what is surprizingly MORE realistic. Emily filled them with faults and turned Cathy and Heathcliff into selfish and undeserving people who destroy each other, not out of love, but out of greed and their own unharnessable animal-like behaviour of what love was TO THEM. What they do and say isn't romantic, but a sign (or even a warning from Emily) of what self indulgence and obsession can do to people pushed beyond their limits of common sense. Cathy and Heathcliff brought themselves to believe that their love was REAL, when in fact their grasp of love was (as Charlotte said, PERVERTED.) Unrelenting in it's destructivness, thus leading to the various calamities their actions bestowed upon the (somewhat) innocent people surrounding them. As brilliant as this novel is, the greatness lies in the story telling of the many different characters we meet. The many different view points from Nellie to Edgar to Isabella and Hindley, spread across the pages and show you how they interact and react with one another as they expierence the situations which seem so very wild and incredible yet ring so very true. This (to me) is not exactly a novel about unbending love. But more of a study of the weaknesses that is stored in everyman. Emily gave us a written guide to show that following your instincts and passions is not always the best path to take. And Emily accomplished this with the most brilliant and unsurpassed written novel in history. It's pages burn with life and it's characters speak in tongues which, even now, I cannot always fully understand. Wuthering Heights can be looked upon as a fascinating study of a particular human race (at what could be any time frame) covering the ground of but a few persons, admist the many open miles... Thank you for your eyes..."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"As with other Wuthering Heights editions, I will not delve into the depths of this strangest and strongest of novels, with its haunting poetical intensity, its everyday realism, its display of physical and psychical violence, its metaphysical contents and its eerie beautiful otherness. As the noted critic C. A. Swinburne put it in 1883:\\"It may be true that not many will ever take it to their hearts: it is certain that those who do like it will like nothing very much better in the whole world of poetry or prose\\".By the way, whatever the edition you end up with (or none), don't forget to havea try with Emily Bront&eacute; poems, or a sensible selection from them. I realize that this review is by far too long: so, if you are in a hurry, I think that you can skip safely to the last paragraph (\\"SO WHAT?\\") for practical recommendations.The real issue that we face now is: how much does THIS PARTICULAR EDITION of Emily Bront's novel measure up to its intended goal? How does it compare with other editions currently available?Beginning with the bottom line, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST \\"STUDY\\" EDITIONS EVER, together with Beth Newman's one for Broadview Press and Dunn's one for Norton Critical (4th edition). By a \\"study\\" edition (in roughly the same sense as a \\"study\\" Bible), I mean one that is richly annotated, with an interesting Introduction and a variety of context-oriented documents, such as critical reviews or essays, biographical or chronological items, a selection of poems or other writings... Such an edition must be evaluated firstly by his handling (more or less scholarly or careful) of the TEXT(s) involved, then by the choice of supplementary materials (whether interesting or not, balanced or else), in third place by the quality and accuracy of the Introduction and notes, ending with very important issues of design (user-friendly, beautiful) and material production (durability, paper and print quality, binding).IN SUMMARY, lest I get too long and formal, this is a well cared for, accurate and reliable 1847-type text, springing out of the University of Virginia electronic texts, but tightly controlled by the 1976 Clarendon Edition one (by Hilda Marsden and Ian Jack), and silently adapted as punctuation is concerned (resulting in a friendly version, which the scholarly reconstructed punctuation of Clarendon is not).THE INTRODUCTION is short (11 pp) and well planned so that it opens ways for understanding, but can be read before the novel without spoiling anything.It sounds a bit like run-of-the-mill material, but this is a deceiving image(Alison Booth's command of the material is always there).THE ANNOTATION IS VERY GOOD and extensive enough, with full and right glosses of the dialect tirades, and accurate, to-the-point information on biblical or literary references, or contextual ways and means.In that most elusive of references, the one about Milo (of Croton) in Chapter IX, however, Alison Booth edition slips a little, like many other good ones (with Clarendon doing a little better, the ones getting the story right if not in full are Barnes&Noble;, Wordsworth Classics, Penguin/Nestor, Broadview/Newman, Oneworld Classics and the excellent but ill-fated Routledge edition by Heather Glen). According to the Geography of Strabo, Book XII, which is the only source for this story, Milo in his old age tried to tear apart in two a tree half split and with a wedge to retain it open. He then exerted all his force with his hands, opening the gap wide enough for the wedge to drop off; the tree closed (it requires an ever increasing force to continue opening the trunk -this is Hooke's Law in physics-) and trapped the hands of Milo, who was then devoured by wolves.It is regarding this story that we read in the novel:\\"Who is to separate us, pray? They'll meet the fate of Milo!\\" (who also tried unwisely and deadly to SEPARATE something). Saying in a note, as Booth does, \\"In the classical fable, Milo, an athlete, tried to pull a tree up by the roots\\" is a little misleading (not only do we lose the \\"separation factor\\", but also accuracy. Milo is neither a fable nor a myth, but a real human being with a place both in time and on earth, mentioned with consistent witness by two of the best historians of the time, other than Strabo. As to the stories connected to him, nothing is known for sure when we go into the details, and so the label \\"legend\\" is most appropriate).The CONTEXTUAL MATERIALS are well chosen and presented. The only problem, and I think THE GREATEST PROBLEM with this otherwise excellent edition, is that there are 40+ items of this material and only 130 pages to fit them in: it looks hopelessly like a motley medley of maddening fragments, with, say, ONLY FIVE OF EMILY'S POEMS, which is both a pity and a blunder. There are interesting curios as the \\"Table of the average yearly wages paid to domestics... according to their rank in a household\\".More important are the pages devoted to Yorkshire dialect (too scarce) and ballads (very good). There is also a fair amount of space (11 pages) allotted to \\"cultural dissemination\\", that is, works of art (songs, theatrical or musical adaptations as well as TV or movie ones, sequels...) deriving from or related with the novel.The data included are very good and complete except for the chapter on translations in which, just as an example, only two translations into Spanish are listed, and only one in current use although it is barely acceptable: there are by now no less than TEN Spanish translations easily available; some are very good, some are rightly annotated, none is both things together and none is based on the 1847 text (but on the 1850 one).MATERIAL PRODUCTION is... fair enough, as far as I can tell without ripping apart my copy. A not-too-bad paperback, perhaps even signature-sewn but without flaps (with cover corners and even front-edge vulnerable). Paper quality looks good (time will tell) and printing quality is excellent. Design is clear and user-friendly(I will not comment on the typeface they use for big headlines, perhaps somebody will love it).SO WHAT?If an accurate and reliable text and a rich annotation are a must,then stick to this Longman Cultural Edition (by Alison Booth).If you can make do with a generally reliable text with a few errors, some idiosyncratic readings and inconsistencies and, besides, you don't mind a scanty annotation (but with full dialectal glosses), and you will appreciate the finest choice ever of contextual materials (but with only EIGHT OF EMILY's POEMS) as well as a MOST INTERESTING and thought-provoking INTRODUCTION (29pp), then choose the Broadview Press edition by Beth Newman (be sure not to pick their earlier one by Christopher Heywood!).If, on the other side, you may accept a generally reliable text and a very scanty annotation (but with full dialectal glosses), and you would appreciate the best presentation ever of early reviews and similar materials (Charlotte's prefaces for 1850, and some letters by Charlotte) and you would enjoy a really good and wide enough selection of EIGHTEEN EMILY's POEMS, then don't miss the elegant and no-nonsense Fourth Edition of Norton Critical (by R.J. Dunn, with almost the same text, for good and worse, of the late and mourned William M. Sale 1963 1st edition).Have a haunting reading!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I read this book aloud to my wife 23 years ago. At the time, I was working as an apprentice at a winery on the Rhine River. There was an old medeival castle across the river from our room. It was the perfect setting, as we two were the only English speaking people in the town. I think now is the right time to review the book, because I can only recall the feelings left behind by this powerful work of literature. Most of the plot and many of the characters have been long forgotten, leaving only the residue of strong emotion. I have read many works of powerful fiction by the world's great authors since then. But not one of them affected me emotionally the way this extraordinary tale did. I remember one gray German morning finishing the chapter where Heathcliff digs up the body of his beloved Catherine because he has gone mad in his desire to hold her close once more. And then off to the Altenkirch Schwanenkellerei I went. I spent the rest of the day working quietly in the cellars of the winery, deep inside the mountain with mold hanging all about, and brooding over the maniacal behavior of these highly romantic, insane characters. I've never been able to shake the feeling entirely. There is something so entirely timeless about this work, as though it were a piece of ancient literature, old far beyond the 1840s setting, something so utterly classical and piercingly primordial, it's as though you already had the genesis of this material in your DNA and it only required this story to bring it back to life within you. You recognize the spell it weaves because it speaks to the humanity in you so clearly, it is as though you have been secretly drugged. The English language has rarely been utilized as well as it has here, and I dare say you would need to go back to Shakespeare to find its parallel. Romanticism reached its high water mark with this novel. Ms. Bront has now become immortal because of her creation, and in the Pantheon of world literaure, she stands among the Titans. If you are a native speaker of the English language, you can hardly consider yourself educated if you have not read this astounding novel of romantic love and uncontrollable passion."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This may be entirely shallow, but I bought 8 of these books just because I was obsessed with the cover design.....they look so great on the shelf, and I am sure they are good reads too!

'Wuthering Heights,' in my opinion, is one of these novels. On the surface, it is a love story. But deeper than that, the characters could be any of us. How many times have we been our own worst enemy? In this story, the characters make decisions that we, as the reader, know are the wrong decisions. Yet it is easy to identify with the mistakes that the characters make. Any of us could (and have) made those same wrong decisions. Perhaps this is why this novel has resonated with so many readers and made the story so timeless.Read it for a good story, then think about it later and put yourself in the character's shoes. I think you'll find it illuminating and something that will stick with you a long, long time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is almost unique among classic literature for the point of view from which it is told. Various people who are not principal to the story are telling what they saw to a man new to the area. So the amount available for telling is much less than were the story told from the all-knowing point of view of most novels or the first person point of view. It is astonishing how well the author uses this limited point of view to relate the passions and fears of the principal characters. Anyone who has not read Wuthering Heights as an assignment in high school or college should read it for the enjoyment. It well deserves its reputation as a classic of English literature. The book has been made into movies a number of times, so many people who have never read the book are familiar with the story, or at least to the end of the first generation. Even if you know the story, you will enjoy the beauty of the book as literature. The book is also a powerful statement against the limitations in legal rights of women at the time. It is this powerlessness which produces the tragedy in the second generation. So the book can be read as a women's lib argument; I have no idea if the author intended to make such an argument; it's not being in any way a polemic makes the point in a very matter of fact way, but the reader is aware nonetheless.Read Wuthering Heights if you can; you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I have to disagree with previous reviewers who called Heathcliff evil. I dont believe so at all. He is a driven man full of passion and emotion. And when his life is shattered he scrambles to find some dignity, pride and content. It is through unfortunate circumstances surrounding him that he never finds them no matter how hard he searches for them.Heathcliff grows up with Catherine. They share a special connection throughout their childhood and adolescence. Catherine is the only person who can talk him out of a mood, cheer him up and make him laugh. He shares his dreams and secrets with her. Heathcliff is deeply in love with her and for a time believes that love is returned.But Catherine is a foolish and sometimes cruel girl who is a product of her upbringing. She knows Heathcliff is a poor nobody of dubious lineage and she doubts that he will ever amount to much. She wants to marry someone who is her social equal, someone who will keep her in style and give her social standing. So she selfishly marries Linton without even once giving a thought to anyone or anything else. The fact that Linton is Heathcliff's sworn enemy doesnt bother her for a second.Heathcliff is completely devastated by the marriage. Not only does the love of his life becomes completely out of his reach, she also becomes the wife and the lover of the man that he hates. His heart and innocent youthfull illusions shattered, Heathcliff leaves and doesn't return for many years.Catherine meanwhile realizes her mistake. She is completely bored in her marriage, more she is a very strong woman and runs roughshod over her husband. Her husband's weak character disgusts her, but she is trapped. There is no way out of the loveless marriage. She has made her bed and now must lie in it.Heathcliff spends years yearning money and accumulating a fortune just so that he could prove to Catherine and to everyone else that he is in fact worthy of her. He comes back to rub the fact in her face. He wants to make her hurt as she made him hurt, to show her the kind of a mistake she made so that she could regret it for the rest of her life. Heathcliff comes back a harsh and a bitter man bent on revenge. He wants to get his back after having his heart ripped out.But revenge does not bring him any satisfaction, for Catherine is near her deathbed. She dies giving birth to her daughter. And now Heathcliff is left with nothing. His life has no more meaning without Catherine in it, for the second time in his life he has the rug yanked out from beneath his feet. He vows to bring revenge on the Lintons and that becomes his only reason for living. The hate and the anticipation of revenge sustain him through years.Many years and many deaths later, Heathcliff has achieved no satisfaction. His life is empty and he is all alone. He lives with Catherine( the daughter) and his knephew. He hates them both, Catherine because he blames her for her mother's death and Hareton because of his father. All of his attempts at revenge have brought him no solace. He is just a shell of a man, sustaining from day to day with no real purpose. All of the people he hoped to bring revenge against are all dead and he is tired of living. And so ends a life full of passion and volatile emotion, anger and hearbreak. Only in death does Heathcliff finally achieve his peace.There are no words to describe how much I loved this book. It took me on an emotional roller coaster from page one and until the bitter end. I could not help but symphasize with Heathcliff and experience emotions as he was feeling them. The book is incredibly powerful, emotional, dark and brooding with some light relief at the end. Its heartwarming to know that Catherine's daughter at least found some happiness. But the thought remains, Catherine and Heathcliff never did..."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This book is often unfairly labeled as a &quot;Gothic romance.&quot; Well, obviously that is one way of looking at it, but I don't see what &quot;romance&quot; has to do with it. The main characters, Cathy and Heathcliff, have one of the most twisted and obsessive relationships I have ever seen. I wouldn't exactly call it a romance;more of some bitter love that the orphaned Heathcliff cannot let go of when Cathy marries another, has a child, and dies. He spends eternity taking out his revenge on the later generation, making this one of the darkest ideas of love that I have ever read. But then, that's why I like it. It shows that sometimes romance is not that pretty. In fact, it's pretty darn self-destructive. A great read, my favorite out of any I have ever read before."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is a surprisingly modern novel given that its authorship predates our modern understanding of psychology. Like many modern novels, Ms. Bronte has also explored the darker side of human passions and psyches more thoroughly than the sunnier side. Heathcliff will remind you of classic characters whose lives were twisted by fate like Captain Ahab in Moby Dick, Erik in Phantom of the Opera, Quasimodo in The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, and the mysterious prisoner in The Man in the Iron Mask.If there were ever two star-crossed lovers who have captured the world's imagination since Romeo and Juliet, they must be Catherine and Heathcliff. Yet, unlike, many such pairs, their unhappiness is heavily influenced by themselves.As you contemplate their story, you are constantly drawn to the thought, \\"what if\\" thus and such had occurred differently? That's part of the great power of the story because it has so many unexpected twistings and turnings. A reader's expectations from a love story are turned upside down, sideways and diagonal from where those expectations normally rest. As a result, you'll probably decide this isn't a love story after all . . . but a tragedy. Taken from that perspective, you'll find yourself hearing echoes of Lady Macbeth and King Lear as you contemplate what occurs when the natural order is disturbed. Few English authors since Shakespeare have captured that sense of what can happen when the universe is disarranged.What's great about this story? It's pretty simple: Emotional intensity in the writing; deeply memorable characters; doomed lovers; and a haunting glimpse at unshakeable obsession.What's not so great? The story development itself is pretty awkward. Much of the story is told in flashback which steals power and immediacy from the narration. If ever a story cried out for being told in the first person (by Heathcliff, Catherine, Edgar Linton, Hareton and young Catherine), it's Wuthering Heights. The transitions from one key moment to another are often very abrupt. Sometimes it is 150 pages later before you get the full sense of what Emily Bronte meant to convey in some of those transitions.What's less than great? The characters aren't nearly as appealing as those you'll usually find in a novel dealing with these issues. In that sense, the novel is more realistic than fictional . . . which helps create some of its immense power. It's probably a worthwhile price to pay.Whatever you think of Wuthering Heights, you owe it to yourself to read one of the most moving tales that has ever been written. Pick a time when you're feeling reasonably happy to start the book. Otherwise, you may find your mood to be more than a little darkened for a few days."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"As the editor of this volume, I wanted to point out its differences from many other editions of Wuthering Heights. This one contains the short story, &quot;The Bridegroom of Barna,&quot; believed to be the most influential source for the novel. It also collects essays about Emily Bronte that are not published elsewhere with the novel. I may be biased, but I think this is a great edition of the novel and is particularly good for college classes on the book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"How do you define a classic? Some might say that which stands the test of time. By that definition alone Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" merits the designation of classic. To the best of my knowledge it has been made into four films. I've not seen them all but would surely recommend the version starring Sir Laurence Olivier, Merle Oberon and David Niven. It has been assigned reading in countless high school and college classroom, and printed throughout the world in numerous editions.Now, Penguin Audio gives us the opportunity to enjoy this story of love not meant to be in a superb audio edition read by Prunella Scales and Samuel West. Fans of the incredibly popular BBC series \\"Fawlty Towers\\" will remember Scales as Sybil. Here, she is Cathy incarnate and a prime narrator when assuming the voice of Nelly Dean. A popular actor with the Royal Shakespeare Company, West brings both pathos and drama to the hopes and final bitter heartbreak found in Heathcliff.As we hear in the voices of Mr. Lockwood and housekeeper Nelly Dean, Heathcliff was an orphan with no home to call his own so he came to Wuthering Heights where he is not only given shelter but also friendship by Catherine Earnshaw, daughter of the wealthy owner. But, eventually Heathcliff asks for more than friendship - he proposes marriage. When he is cruelly rebuffed his love turns to a desire for revenge.How sad that Emily Bronte lived for only 30 years. How fortunate for us that her legacy is the incomparable \\"Wuthering Heights.\\"- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights, considered a defining work of Gothic Romance literature is essentially the narrated story of two individuals at the end of the 19th century, Catherine and Heathcliff, and their passionate love for each other which is never consummated. The story takes place basically in two estates in Yorkshire&iexcl;s moors, and its intricate plot involves two generations of characters living in these houses.I found Wuthering Heights to be very a very enjoyable book mainly because of the unbridled emotional intensity present in the story. Each of the characters are bounded by love or hatred, often to a very twisted and irrational extreme. The passions of these characters eventually lead to great acts of cruelty and vengeance, creating a very vibrant, tragic, and intense storyline.I also liked the fact that there very few actual characters in the book, however Bronte manages to make them very vivid, and their personalities and relationships with other characters consistently changes throughout the story as a result of events. Often I would really pity certain characters, or feel shocked and angered at many of their actions; it&iexcl;s simply very hard to not be almost pulled into the book&iexcl;s setting. Until the last few pages of the book, it really seemed as if the anguish and torment of the characters would continue endlessly. Therefore I was quite amazed Bronte managed to create a tranquil, satisfying ending, however I do feel that the ending was just a bit TOO satisfying, since it didn&iexcl;t leave me with very much to think about.Overall, it&iexcl;s a very beautifully written book vivid even in its descriptions of the beauty of the Yorkshire countryside, and one that really stirs the reader&iexcl;s emotions and feelings. This is definitely a great read for anybody in high school or above."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"While I know this is considered a great Classic Romance, I failed to see the romance or the greatness. I decided to read this because I had never done so. I regretted that decision within three chapters. I was determined to finish it to find the wonder of this work that I had heard so much about. I failed to find it in all of it's almost 400 pages. It was a tedious read and nowhere near the great romance I was led to believe. While the last few pages were a payoff, they were not worth the torture of the previous ones."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Not what I was expecting.

The narrator did an excellent job bringing the characters to life. This is a wonderful story though a bit depressing. Many classics from that time are written with a an overwrought, tradgic mood. If you can handle that, it is a good story of a dysfunctional family, revenge and love."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Anyone who is a frequent reader of this blog knows of my aversion to classics. I don't typically enjoy them, I always have to force myself to finish them, and I usually just end up giving up before I finish altogether. This book started out similar - it took me a really long time to get invested in the story and characters, I read it very slowly, and I was pretty sure I was going to hate it by page 50. Fortunately for me, though, I ended up enjoying the story when I (sadly) forced myself to continue on. (Thanks, Classics Challenge, for that little push!) I am SO proud of myself for getting through this and actually feeling like I somewhat enjoyed the book. Someone described this book to me as almost like a soap opera (can't remember who...), and that individual is completely right. There is so much drama in here... it's crazy. I definitely felt attached to the characters, even with all their unpredictable drama, and I'm glad that I finished the book and got to appreciate it. I can't really say that this is one of my favorites, but it is a pretty decent book, and I can see why it is dubbed a \\"classic\\"."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"After reading \\"Jane Eyre\\" by Charlotte Bronte, I knew I had to read her sister's only novel. Quite an interesting contrast to the love story of \\"Jane Eyre,\\" but unique and worthwhile nonetheless. A great classic by a 19th century female writer...read it!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This is an interesting book in that people tend to take it in one of two ways. People either feel that Ms. Bronte is drawing a love story between Heathcliff and the 1st Catherine, or that Ms. Bronte is pointing out the 'terrible truth' of the failings of romantic love. I myself lean towards the latter. For one thing, the 1st Catherine dies 1/2 way through the story.The story is basically this. Mr. Earnshaw (father of Hindley and the 1st Catherine) brings home an abandoned child. (Heathcliff) At the risk of oversimplifying, Heathcliff is basically responsible for rifts in the Earnshaw household. (For one thing, Hindley, with some justification feels that he has lost his father's love to Heathcliff.) Heathcliff seems to bring out the worst in both Hindley and Catherine. While we may sympathize with Heathcliff from time to time, he basically represents vengeance and destruction.Moving on, you will probably notice that while that while certain characters display passion for each other, the happiness DOES NOT last into the marriage. We may be tempted to think that Nelly Dean is in fact Emily Bronte herself scoffing at the characters she created.Moving on, the 1st Catherine (who married Edgar Linton) dies leaving behind one daughter Catherine (2). The widowed Hindley dies leaving behind a brain damaged son (Hareton). The story then switches focus to Hareton, the widower Edgar, Edgar's daughter Cathy (2), and Heathcliff's son Linton. It is interesting that Edgar is the most likable once he is a widower trying to raise his daughter. Heathcliff remains a character of darkness and vengeance bringing pain and torment to the surviving characters. (For someone who is famous for loving the 1st Catherine, he sure doesn't mention her much. Nor does he seem to have any problem treating her daughter wickedly.) There is something called false imprisonment, as well as kidnapping!I don't want to ruin the book for those of you who haven't read it. But there is an interesting resolution that to some extent gives the romantic at heart what they want. However, at the same time, Heathcliff's expansion of character is limited. While many see this as a romantic novel, Miss Bronte is offering us an interesting reality check. (Passions are often short lived, and do not often last once marriage and reality set in)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"When I first started reading this novel I thought it got off to a somewhat of a slow start, and when it switched the narrators I got a bit confused. As the novel progressed and told about the relationships present between Heathcliff and Catherine I got very interested. Throughout the novel I noticed the absence of mothers present in the novel. I found that part of it very interesting and really wonder why Emily Bronte made it so that all of the children lost their mother figure. I recommend this novel to anyone who has to read a \\"classic\\" novel for any type of educational purpose. My only advice to anyone who reads this book is wait like 50 pages before you decide to give up on the book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is a classic love story between dark, handsome Heathcliff and beautiful, lovable Catherine Earnshaw. The differences they had in life never came between their strong willed love. This is a book for EVERYONE. I believe that this should be read by each person sometime during their lifetime. There were things I liked about the book and things I didn't, but the good outweighed the bad.I loved how Emily Bronte, the author, switched from the point of view of one character to the other because it gave me a better idea of what the story was about. In addition it was nice to know what all the characters thought everything that went on. That made it hard for me not to put down the book, although I had to in order to live my life.My next praise of Wuthering Heights is the way that the setting and the characters are described. With all of the vivid words in this story it made me believe everything that was happening. I really began to see the surroundings and feel the way Heathcliff and Catherine did about each other, and how much hatred Hindley and the rest of the world had towards Heathcliff, with the many astounding words that she used to write this wonderful book.Now to the one thing that I disliked about Wuthering Heights, it was hard to get into. The first, oh maybe, 5-6 chapters were gloomy and not to exciting. It seemed as though it would never get better and more interesting. Surprisingly, it gets better every second you read on.To wrap it up, Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte is a stunning book. I recommend it to everyone to read in their lifetime. This book proves that it doesn't matter if a book was written a long time ago because it will still capture readers for many years to come. The good outweighed the bad in this story because of the vast description and how well it is written."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Emily Bronte is a brilliant and flowing writer, but there were definitely times when I was completely lost and confused. However, I think it's because of the way that she writes this novel that makes it so captivating. It's terrifying and romantic, it's seemingly unbearable and it's light and easy. It's definitely the best of both worlds. A romantic and thrilling tale of love and evil. Who doesn't love that? Not to mention the writing is second to none.But, regardless of how much I love this story, I did have to take a star away just because of how many times I had to stop and go, \\"wait ... wha? erm ... but I thought ...\\" And yes, in the long run, it makes the book that much greater, but it can get frustrating (especially for one not used to that type of reading) and confusing.But, yeah, a true classic."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is written with such charactorization, that well after reading the novel, I am still deep in thought about the psychology of Heathcliff, and those that tell their interpretation of their interaction with him (Lockwood and Nelly Dean). This novel is great for someone who has ever loved and lost, and not had their way, as life often does not turn out the way we intend. I love the way Bronte writes, with the deep meloncolic undertones. It makes me yearn to read another of her novels, however, that is not a possibility. That's all she wrote (besides a collection of poetry). My favourite quote from the book is when Catherine Earnshaw confesses to Nelly that she really loves Heathcliff despite her agreement to marry Edgar Linton: \\"So he shall never know how I love him: and that, not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton's is as different as a moonbeam from lighting or frost from fire.\\"To me this distinquishes the love of soulmates, between the casual love we create in order to socially fuction; fear from remaining single, money, social status. Brilliant novel!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"It is a shame Emily Bronte didn't live to see her novel gain the success it deserved, but it is fortunate for the rest of us that she at least lived long enough to write it. Wuthering Heights tells a fascinating story that is extremely difficult to put down despite it straying well outside the traditional territory of novels.The story offers very few sympathetic characters, and much of what it relates is horribly distasteful. Yet the characters are so interesting and the writing so skilled the reader sticks with Bronte through all the trials and tribulations of the inhabitants of Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange.The story covers about a 25-year period of time in two families whose destinies are tied together by a horrid orphan named Heathcliff. Heathcliff is arguably one of the most despicable villains in literature, as for the sake of his twisted love for Catherine he quite thoroughly and deliberately ruins the lives of almost everyone in those two families, not even sparing his own son his vicious rage. The vengeance he wreaks for his perceived wrongs is thorough and brutal, almost impossible to imagine, yet fascinating to watch.My one complaint would be Bronte's use of phonetic spelling for one of the secondary characters. Joseph's dialogue is virtually impossible to understand in sections, although fortunately his character is not vital to the story. The rest of the writing is quick and entertaining, making the story move quickly and keeping the reader's interest.The reader may assume, as I long did, that a novel written so long ago would be likely to be of more interest in some high school English class than to be read for pleasure. Such prejudice should be set aside, as Wuthering Heights is too good a book to be so ignored."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Jane Eyre is a classic novel from Charlotte Bronte and this unabridged audio recording is highly recommended to people who read the book and loved it and are interested in hearing the book being read.

Now many years later I have again found this truly remarkable novel. Its style ranges smoothly from horridly wicked, to loving and caring, to darkly comedic. Heathcliff is perhaps one of the most wretched characters in literature, and his love affair with Catherine is truly unique. This is almost like \\"Jerry Springer\\" for the 19th century.

I absolutely loved this. I'm not going to give you a great literary dissertation here. I just have to say I loved it. There was love, destruction, reconstruction, sorrow, mindlessness, drunkeness...all marvelously narrated to the reader. I was truly impressed. I'm forever kicking myself for not reading Austen & the Bronte sisters earlier on. The saddest thing about reading these (and other) classics is that you know going into it that the author won't be writing anymore wonderful works. Take the time to read this..."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Though 'Wuthering Heights' has garnered a reputation as an overly romantic sentimentality, this is not what the book is about at all - and this nonsensical assumption has pervaded popular culture and discouraged new fans. Though 'Wuthering Heights' is, above all, a love story, it is sordid, melancholic, shocking, and filled with characters that are markedly maniacal, self-centered, and cruel. This is, of course, peppered with Early Victorian verbosity, dramatism, and rambling plot, but its content, and the memorable anti-hero that it creates in Heathcliffe, are far less so. Violent, emotional, yet touching, the book creates its indelible charm in its slightly overblown examination of the darkness, but vulnerability, of the human soul."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This story is one of revenge. One day, instead of returning from town with gifts for his two children, the main patriarch instead brings back a \\"waif\\". This street kid, Heathcliff, who is the ridiculed underdog upon arrival, attempts to destroy two families and take their land.I always felt that Heathcliff was an illegitimate child that was claimed one day by his father for some unknown reason (mistress mom died?). For me, this explained the \\"lost soul mate\\" type comments made by his step (or real?) sister and her instinct not to marry him as the right thing even though she did not love the man that she did marry. You decide.Heathcliff is on of the most evil antagonists you will ever read about. He not only wants to win, but wants to destroy absolutely everything that his enemies value.The story itself has three stages which correspond to the three generations of characters. While this in and of itself is not interesting, the way Bronte manipulates the timeline is very effective. Most of the book is told not by the narrator, but by one of the family servants.Also interesting is the prevalence of mysticism versus traditional religion given the backdrop of both when it was written and the time period in which the story was set. The spirit world is front and center.This is not an uplifting book, but the talent of the author should not be missed."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I have to say that I never would have read this book, had I not read \\"The Well of Lost Plots\\" by Jasper Fforde. There's that once scene where Thursday and her boss appear at that \\"Anger management meeting\\" at Wuthering Heights, and the characters originally invented by Emily Bronte all explain why they hate Mr Heathcliff so much. It made me curious - who is this Mr Heathcliff, and why is \\"Wuthering Heights\\" in constant danger to explode from the emotions it contains?So I got me a copy, and I was fascinated. Not only have I never read a story that contains so much hatred, and revenge, and wild emotions - the characters all seem so real, and so fatal in their set ways - and Mr Heathcliff surely is a wonderful, interesting, enchanting character. Emily Bronte might not be as well-known or famous as her sister, but this book definitely is almost as good as Jane Eyre.If you're not sure whether you want to read this yet - read !The Well of lost Plots\\" first, and then you won't be able to live without!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"In Wuthering Heights the characters and households are so easy to visualize, yet when you get further on your perspective on the novel change dramatically. The relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff and Cathy and Hareton are so similar you'd believe they were the same people. Both catherine and Cathy, although they loved Heathcliff and Hareton, turned to Edgar and Linton for status, which played a very important role in the mid-ninteenth century. Yet Catherine was never able to follow through with her love for Heathcliff, while Cathy was able to wed Hareton after Edgar and Heathcliff's passing. The households of Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange are extreme opposites. Wuthering Heights is on a bleak, desolate hill, tormented by extremely rough weather. Thrushcross Grange is located in a warm, cozy valley. The inhabitants of Wuthering Heights, most likely due to the morose attitude of Heathcliff, are very gloomy and not welcoming to strangers. Thrushcross Grange is a very open, inviting household, with cheery inhabitants.In a simple page, all your views of the characters and the surroundings can change. When going through the novel, you must feel some pity for Heathcliff. But when the novel begins and ends, he can disgust you with his horrible ways and actions. Upon his death, Wuthering Heights, always a gloomy household, became cheerful and inviting.The relationship between generations is almost invisible. You'd come to believe Catherine and Cathy were the same people, and Edgar and Linton could be brothers. As with Heathcliff and Hareton. You see Cathy follow in her mother's footsteps in her love life, and Edgar and Linton were both frail growing up. You notice those characters have almost everything in common, yet there is always one difference. In Cathy and Catherine's case, Cathy was able to marry the one she loved, but Catherine died before she had the chance. Edgar was more refined than Linton, and was better able to stand up for himself. And Heathcliff, unlike Hareton, had some education, and was smart enough to stand up for himself.I thorougly enjoyed reading this book, it would've been even better without horrible deadlines*ahem*, but all in all I found the novel's characters and settings to be so creative and ever changing. I don't think I could've written this book in a lifetime. Of course I'm a VERY slow writer. Especially when there are deadlines, but... that's another story for another day. Too bad, you might have found it really good. Oh well. It might make you laugh too. But I shall not say anymore. I'm just going to make you ever so sad. Maybe you'll hear it someday. Wow, I'm really managing to drag this out. This should be worth extra extra credit. The suspense is just killing you I'm sure. Anyways, this was an excellent book, and I'm very glad I read it. Not to mention we're going to read Great Expectations next. Yay!? Goodnight, America."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I have just recently finished the book Wuthering Heights and have found it is a very interesting book.In the novel, Nelly Dean is telling Mr. Lockwood the story of Mr. Heathcliff, who is the landlord of the houses Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange.Mr. Heathcliff was a young, poor child when he was adopted into the rich Earnshaw household. As Heathcliff grew up he fell in love with Catherine Earnshaw, daughter of Mr. Earnshaw, and loved her throughout the rest of the novel. Once Catherine is old enough she decides to marry Edgar Linton for his social status (i.e. money, looks), and hopes to bring Heathcliff up out of the power of her brother Hindley. Heathcliff regrets her decision and runs away for three years.When Heathcliff comes back he is very wealthy and wishes to see Catherine after his time away for so long. After meeting with Catherine, Heathcliff is very upset at the fact that she married Mr. Edgar Linton. Heathcliff finds out that Isabella, Edgars sister, has fallen in love with him and he thinks it will be a perfect way to get revenge on not only on Catherine, but also Edgar Linton. Heathcliff marries Isabella and takes her to live and Wuthering Heights with him, where she is quite miserable due to the lack of hospitality. During this time period Catherine dies after she has her daughter Cathy, and Heathcliff is miserable because he never got to show his love towards her. At this point Isabella runs off to Gimmerton, the local village, and has a child named Linton which she asks her brother to come pick up so that Heathcliff could not torture him with the anger he had towards Isabella. After Edgar picks up Linton, Isabella dies and Edgar comes back to the Grange. The next day Nelly brings Linton over to the Heights because Heathcliff says its \\"his property\\". Young Cathy falls in love with her cousin Linton, even though he is always sick and moaning, and eventually marries him. Linton dies one night and Heathcliff taks control over both Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. Young Cathy falls in love with Hareton, son of Hindley Earnshaw, and marries him. Heathcliff eventually dies and everyone lives happily ever after.I personally wouldn't have picked up this book myself if it was up to me, but my teacher had us read it in his class and im glad i did.

I especially love reading novels that take place in the past yet can be related to now. One thing I do recommend - when you start reading this book, as you piece character personalities and profiles together - write them down! Make a family tree! That is the one confusing part of this book but by getting things down on paper you help yourself to enjoy the book more and not worry so much about who is who ;)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights can easily be compared to a soap opera. Personally, I do not have an inclination towards soap operas, but this novel, written by Emily Bronte, was done beautifully. One of the most complex characters in literature is perhaps Heathcliff. His motives are sometimes opaque but his emotions are so real. The reader can identify with his heartbreak and anguish. The despair created by the love triangles throughout this novel is breathtaking. There is symbolism on every page, making Wuthering Heights an in-depth work of literature. This novel is truly a romantic classic, and personally, my favorite."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I think this book evokes controversial responses from readers because of the ending and because of their failure to interpret this piece of literature. Wuthering Heights is not just a love story--it's a story of relationships, class struggles, the angst of the soul, passion, remorse, and regret. It is about everything that makes us human, e.g. the power to choose between good and evil. It is about obsession and how it can kill the soul. The story is masterfully written, filled with symbolic representations.

The frame narration is wonderful, it adds to the mystique and ambiguity that surrounds the whole situation. Heathcliff inexorably attracts and repels as does Catherine. It's one long huge piece of poetic prose. It disturbs, it frightens, it causes one to look at a darker side in a new light. The book is amazing, Emily Bronte was a woman way beyond her times.

At first, I felt it strange that the hero of this story should be an unbelievably evil villian, but I later understtod that Heathcliff was not your conventional love-sick melodramatic hero, and how Emily Bronte could make this character appear deserving of sympathy and even a little admiration, is nothing short of literary genuis. I had come to that conclusion years ago- you had to love a man who could love like that. I felt his character was more rounded than any character I've known.

The title tells it all: Yes, &quot;wuthering&quot; is an alternative spelling of &quot;weathering&quot; -- we have entered the heights of wearing-down. You will find it incredible the depths Heathcliff sinks to in order to exercise his obsession. Bodily violence, to be sure, but also, and mainly, torture of the soul. You will shake with revulsion and frustration when reading of the wrongs Heathcliff perpetrates. Can anything good come out of this Hell on Earth?

It is a very tragic obsession between CAtherine and Heathcliff that lasts well after the latter dies and one can really feel the love between them. And the most riveting character in this story is the demon that Heathcliff transforms into as the story progresses. He is truely one of the most sinister characters I have ever read.

To be honest the only way I could survive the book was to read the cliff notes. But halfway through the cliff notes I was struck by the developing relationship between Cathy and Heathcliff, and my opinions altogether changed. I re-read the entire book, and could at last understand the story, the torment, the love, the fury, the power of what Emily had written, a real love story, with the real sentiments that occur when people of different upbringings clash, and somehow, in spite of such brutal hatred and jealousy, love dawns, and it survives the storm of hatred that continues for many years and a couple of generations.

There is not one character in this book that I pulled for. Not one that I wanted to see come out on top.

I felt no sympathy for any of the characters and just wished they would all die already, as seemed to be the prevalent theme throughout the novel.I also found it somewhat disturbing how easily people married their first-cousins back in those days. I get it - it's the 1800s, but really does Cathy have to go from marrying one first cousin to the next? Is there no one else in this town that she is not related to?!I was really hoping to enjoy this book - especially considering this is such a \\"classic\\". But I find myself underwhelmed and wonder if people have just not picked up better books in their lives to find more interesting. I'm just glad I got this as a free download and did not waste a cent on it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"\\"I don't know if it be a peculiarity in me, but I am seldom otherwise than happy while watching in the chamber of death, should no frenzied or despairing mourner share the duty with me.

And I absolutely loved this. I have never read a book told in such a way as this one is, from the perspective of those who aren't really the main characters; it was such an interesting way of telling the story. The characters were all so intriguing: I loved how I could pity and hate Heathcliff at the same time, and find Cathy frustrating yet endearing. And of course, the love story was passionate, heartbreaking, and engrossing.Regardless of your age, I recommend that you read this book. I'm 14, and this is definitely one of the best novels that I have ever read. My only regret is that Emily Bront? did not write more!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I don't think there is another book as famous as \\"Wuthering Heights\\" where the perception of its contents and the reality are so different. The unbridled, doomed and forbidden love between Heathcliff and Catherine would seem to be the original Harlequin romance. How NOT true. Instead of a love story the real \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is conflict, anger, evil, betrayal, loss, mystery, revenge, debasement, regret with a large unhealthy dose of bonding.Having seen the 1939 movie when I was 7 or 8 years old and not knowing what I was watching for many years I was struck by the story. But the producers of that version win the award for most creative re-interpretation of a book in the 20th century. For fun I looked at 5-10 minute clips of the the 1992, 2009 and 2011 versions on YouTube (I read there are 17 screen versions to date). In those short passages it's clear that each film tries harder to reach the emotional pitch of the book by being more true to the storyline. None beyond the first have been commercial successes and I think it's because the intensity of the book is in the narrative not the dialogue. While Heathcliff is increasingly dark and willingly evil with each version the films cannot bring out what he's thinking because - well we don't know what he's thinking. All we know is he's very angry and would really like to have Catherine back. The movies create monologues that don't exist in the book. By filling in the blanks it takes away from the mystery that is forced on the reader to speculate on Heathcliff's character and motives.I found appeal in Bronte's willingness to portray Heathcliff as nearly the devil; a man wronged and willing to exact revenge for eternity even on his own family. It's painful. Heathcliff's bitterness goes on page after page and year after year. No \\"victory\\" seems to satiate him. It's incredibly intense and he only gets worse as he goes after more innocent victims. His villainy has no bottom.I started the book thinking I was in for a more elaborate version of the 1939 movie. I finished knowing I had read something far different, more challenging, provocative and modern. Much is made about Bronte's ability to write this - where did the ideas come from? what was she thinking? If she were a man would there have been as much focus on the writer instead of the book? Fortunately those debates have receded while the freshness and originality of the story have remained."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"It's unfortunate that Wuthering Heights often gets lumped into the category of Victorian chick lit, because it probably has more in common with Dickens or Balzac than with Jane Austen. The various film adaptations often make much of the love between Heathcliff and Catherine, but that doesn't begin to cover the scope of this book. Wuthering Heights is no conventional romance novel. It is in fact an epic examination of human wickedness involving an ensemble cast that spans two generations over the course of almost 50 years. Filled with powerful imagery and unforgettable characters, it makes for a profoundly entertaining read.Heathcliff, a gypsy-looking street urchin from Liverpool, is adopted by the Earnshaw family, who live among the moors of northern England at the secluded estate of Wuthering Heights. Mr. Earnshaw treats Heathcliff as his favorite, much to the consternation of his eldest son Hindley. When the father dies, Hindley seizes the opportunity to retaliate against Heathcliff, revoking his favored family position and forcing him to labor in the fields. Meanwhile, Heathcliff and his adopted sister Catherine develop a love for each other, but due to his servant status, dirty boots, and surly demeanor, she spurns him for her more elegant and refined neighbor Edgar Linton. Heathcliff resolves to revenge himself upon all who have hurt him, and the following generation of Earnshaws, Lintons, and Heathcliffs must also suffer the repercussions of his passionate vengeance.The joy of Wuthering Heights is that there isn't a single character in the book who could be described as a good person. They are all at best selfish and petty, at worst deplorably evil. All are set on destroying each other, not through murder or violence, but by making each other's lives a living hell until one by one they gradually drop dead of sorrow or destitution. Emily Bronte's unrelenting audacity in depicting the cruelest, basest aspects of humanity is so refreshing it's a joy to read. Yet over and above its sensationalistic pleasures, Wuthering Heights is undeniably a meaningful piece of literature with an intricately constructed plot and keen insights into human nature. It offers important lessons on the poisoning effects of resentment and vengeance upon the soul, as well as the resilience of the human spirit to rise above adversity and degradation.The one drawback of Wuthering Heights is its narrative voice, as told through the perspective of a visitor, Mr. Lockwood, which results in some rather convoluted constructions (Lockwood says that Nelly said that Cathy read in a letter that Linton wrote that Heathcliff told Hareton . . . ). The story would have been better served by a third-person omniscient perspective. Nevertheless, Wuthering Heights deserves its renown as a classic of English literature. It's a shame this is the only novel Emily Bronte ever finished. Let the chick-lit label be damned; real men read Wuthering Heights too!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"(Spoiler)Wuthering Heights is one of the most perfect novels I have read. Here are my thoughts on what makes Wuthering Heights an outstanding read and why it's considered a classic:Characterization:There are no extraneous characters introduced into the story. Each person serves a purpose and is often complementary to another character in the book, like a mirrored reflection or a duality, sometimes the same, sometimes opposing; i.e., Catherine and Heathcliff, Edgar and Isabella Linton, Hindley and Heathcliff, the younger Catherine and Hareton, Mr. Lockwood and Nelly, Nelly and Joseph, the two families at Wuthering Heights and the Grange, the mother Catherine and the younger Catherine, and Isabella and Heathcliff. The relationships among the characters are complicated and evolving. If you were to take one of the characters out of this story, the plot development would be negatively altered. The plot is character-driven and tightly woven throughout the story.Tone:The tone of the story is brooding and dark. The sensuous feeling is foreboding, first exhibited in the setting which Emily Bronte describes in detail. There is an element of overarching suspense and aversion to the characters: the morose Heathcliff; mother Catherine who dies of a brain disorder; the drink of Hindley; the tragic life of Isabella following her marriage to Heathcliff; the delightful younger Catherine who succumbs to depression after coming under the control of Heathcliff. The depressing scene and dysfunctional characters that greet Lockwood's arrival prompt him to ask Nelly to explain the history behind Wuthering Heights.Societal:I was struck by how Emily Bronte weaves the social status of the characters into the story: Joseph and his barely intelligible English; Nelly, the servant and principal narrator, and her portrayal of others from an inferior social position; the many differences between the upper class Lintons and the middle class Earnshaws; the emphasis on social structure with less opportunity for upward mobility, which impacted the \\"heart\\" of the story -- mother Catherine sacrifices her desire for Heathcliff to achieve a higher social status by marrying Edgar. The characters' traits, flaws, and attributes within the structure of society make for believable people that the reader both loves and hates.Multi-generational:The differences between the generations were striking: Heathcliff and mother Catherine seemed unable to change with the passage of time or grow as individuals. They were locked into extremisms that became dead-end roads. Eventually, their flawed natures doomed them to early deaths, providing an opportunity for the next generation in Catherine and Hareton to overcome the past. In contrast to their parents, they were able to adapt and redeem the past, and through their transformation, the reader is filled with hope for the future. The multigenerational aspect of time adds to the completeness of the story--this is a family with a history, a past that threatens to destroy the future.Spiritual/Psychological:Emily Bronte probes deeply the psychological aspects of people's behavior and the ramifications of the dark side of human nature. The story touches on the spiritual nature of the individuals, with references to the small church, the recurring battle with death, the repeated references to ghosts, and Joseph's incessant recitation of Scripture.Themes:The many themes are timeless--love that is forbidden, prejudices that hurt people, the meaninglessness of life without hope, hate that destroys, the vindictiveness of human nature, and the darkness of the soul without God.Setting:Established in the first paragraph, a \\"perfect misanthropist's heaven. \\" Right away, I am told a lot about this story in a unique way which encourages me to keep reading.Classic Author Similarities:I am struck by the fact that many classics, like this one, have been written by individuals who have experienced tremendous suffering. I wonder if there is a relationship between a giftedness to write great stories and the degree to which one has endured hardship. Perhaps the strong emotions that are pent up in a tortured soul find solace in the pen as a healing balm.Risky:Creative, original stories take risks. For instance, there isn't one protagonist versus one antagonist in Wuthering Heights. Ninety-five percent of the story is dark and unsettling; the story reinforces negative stereotypical issues and characters. The orphan is the troublemaker and destroyer of the family, perpetuating a common \\"myth\\" with adoptees. Joseph uses the Bible in a beguiling way to demean people, contrary to the Good Book's ultimate purpose. The submissive role of women and their inability to escape from abusive husbands or families is also perpetuated in Wuthering Heights, reinforcing the long-held notion that women are inferior to men. Despite these risks, Emile Bronte creates a masterpiece.Fictional Dream:Emily Bronte immerses the reader into a world that is vivid and dream-like, with colorful characters and a complex plot. She uses literary techniques that make this is a compelling read, one worth pondering after the last page is finished. It's a shame she died so young--what other books might she have written?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is timeless literature. I read this piece when i was about fourteen, and, although difficult to follow and differentiate between the Cathies and Lintons in the beginning, Bronte unraveled this work very thoroughly and revealed a ghastly and revealing story about two selfish lovers.Heathcliff is truly the most despicable character imaginable, and for his feisty spirit he is one of my favorite characters.Catherine is selfish and a character i feel a strong connection to on some levels.Together these two complete a classic tale, which i would have fallen in love with no matter who the author. However, I am truly impressed with Emily's gal to have written this grizzly tale. For its time, this type of literature is a bold one, and for a women to write? Forget about it! That's a piece beyond the story I absolutely relish.I advise anyone interested in reading this to pick it up and enjoy (possibly making notes, or just trudging through the beginning like i did, ha) But definitely read it twice over, at the very least, for a truly enjoyable (and understandable) read.Anything below five stars for lack of clarity is no fault of the author, and is simply a problem with anyone reading the book. Yes, it is confusing sometimes, but there are pieces to that which complete the complex puzzle of revenge and human indecency."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I really liked Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff is a \\"little\\" disturbing. When I first started reading it, I was like what? But, once I got to chapter 2 or 3 things started making more sense and I couldn't hardly put it down. Once I finished the book, I went back and read the beginning and it makes sense because you know the whole story. Very good, if you like the older, classic style. I would recommend it!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"The first thing a lot of people who have read this are probably going to ask is \\"Why not 5 stars?\\", and indeed, one may be subjected to stoning for giving only 4 stars to such a well respected piece of classic literature. However, I have my reasons: for one, the book becomes a bit difficult to follow at times- when you have Cathy Linton Earnshaw, and Cathy Earnshaw Linton, and the one who is dead won't stay dead, that gets a bit confusing to begin with. There are a couple of other similar instances when the reader may have to turn back to see just which character is involved in a given encounter. Also, it seems to never be very well established just how Heathcliff went from having nothing upon his departure, to being wealthy upon his return. Perhaps not necessary for that to be fully explained, but at least some explanation would be welcome. Emily Bronte does one thing exceptionally well, which is painting a picture of Yorkshire and The Moors with words. Maybe people who are better readers than I will enjoy this more. I did enjoy it, by all means, thus the four stars, but I was not as enthralled with it as many others have been."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"A young lady, 29 years of age, published a book under the name of Ellis Bell. It was so abhorrent to the public, critics wanted the 400 pages of \`pure repugnance' to be burned. Yet as the horror and outrage grew throughout the world, so did the number of copies. How had this young, sickly woman who lived a life of desolation and strife, caused such uproar in our hearts as she led us through hers? Wuthering Heights can be examined through the events, ideas, and personal observations within the text to decipher our own personal experiences with reading this novel.The book begins through the narrative of a man named Mr. Earnshaw. Earnshaw is a tenant for a man named Mr. Heathcliff. From the beginning page of the novel, we find Heathcliff to be rough and with a dark presence in him. The man has come to stay the night before heading down their land to his recently purchased house. Yet the owner of the land makes a very unwelcome first impression on the young Mr. Lockwood. Immediately entering the house, Lockwood get attacked by dogs, and laughed at for his fright. This dreary setting to start off a book happens in a residence named Wuthering Heights. The place Lockwood has recently bought is called Thrushcross Grange; the book will solely revolve around these two houses. Thrushcross Grange is 4 miles away from Wuthering Heights, and Lockwood, returning from his visit from the heights, tries to return to the Grange during a storm. Yet he is unable to make the journey and is force to stay at the Heights until morning.A maid leads Lockwood upstairs into a room that Heathcliff has forbidden. While he lies in the eerily dark room, he finds that names have been carved into the wall next to the bed. Deeply carved into it are 3 woman named Catherine with different last names. A quote on age 35 describes the mood in which the chilling names rang into the night, \\"In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window, and continued spelling over Catherine Earnshaw--Heathcliff--Linton, till my eyes closed; but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark, as vivid as spectres--the air swarmed with Catherines.\\" He also finds a diary written 25 years earlier, and with curiosity for the strange inhabitance of the household, he ventures to read it. Within the diary, a girl named Catherine Earnshaw writes about a day she experienced at Wuthering Heights. She talks about how her and Heathcliff must suffer through long sermons and put up with the hatred her brother has towards Heathcliff. We now are aware of 3 major characters--- Catherine, Heathcliff, and her brother named Hindley. Lockwood falls asleep soon after, and has a frightening nightmare in which a hand grabs him and cries the name \\"Catherine Linton\\" and demands to be let in through his window. She will not let go of him, until he continually rubs her wrists on the glass she broke trying to get in through the window. He wakes up screaming, and tells Heathcliff that there is a ghost named Catherin in the room. Heathcliff runs into the room and as Lockwood shuts the door, he is heard crying out for his apparent lover. Following this occurrence, Lockwood asks a maid named Nelly to tell him about these people's lives. The story begins there.Nelly begins by telling us of her own experiences at Wuthering Heights. She is the nurse of 2 young children--- Catherine and Hindley Earnshaw. Their father is expected to come home one day with presents, yet he brings home a young gypsy boy instead. He is quiet, yet with a strong-will. His name is Heathcliff and the father favors this boy above his own children. Throughout the 3 children's childhood, Hindley is jealous of Heathcliff. Yet as strongly as Hindley and Heathcliff hate each other, Catherine loves the boy. The two were inseparable, and their connection went deeper and deeper with age. When their father dies, Hindley is the head of the household and Heathcliff is turned into a slave. This strong connection turns from childhood playmates, to a deep emotional attraction towards each other. They were both alone in the world, trying to only protect themselves and each other. The connection is so strong, that no amount of physical force could drive these two apart. She was the rebellious teenager, eager for adventure, and ignorantly falling for the boy. Heathcliff was a dark character, who was hardened by the cruelty he received, yet utterly infatuated with the girl. The two young lovers plan to run away together until one night, when they sneak over to Thrushcross Grange to spy on the upper-class family. Yet they are heard, and as the two mischievous trespassers run away, a dog catches Cathy's leg and severely injures her. Cathy stays there to heal for months, and Heathcliff is banished from their property. She becomes close to a formal and respected man named Edgar Linton.As Nelly tells Lockwood of these events, she seems to have an eye for every happening, and an ear for every story. She observes that after Cathy returns home, she is changed. She is now dressed in fine clothes, and an air of superiority. A quote in chapter 8 shows the effect of her changing her affections for Heathcliff to Edgar Linton, \\"Doubtless Catherine marked the difference between her friends, as one came in and the other went out. The contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak, hilly, coal country for a beautiful fertile valley; and his voice and greeting were as opposite as his aspect.\\" The young girl is attracted to his wealth, and reputation. While their relationship grew closer, her and Heathcliff grew farther apart. Eventually it came to the point that Linton proposes to Catherine, and she talks to Nelly about it as she tries to decide her answer. Yet as they discuss, Heathcliff is listening the entire time. Catherine says that she cannot \\"degrade\\" herself to Heathcliff's level; it is then that Heathcliff leaves in a rage. However, he departs right before Catherine says one of the most important lines of the book. She says in chapter 9, \\"would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; so he shall never know how I love him; and that, not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same, and [Edgar's] is as different as a moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire.\\" With this reference, we learn that she is literally stating, \\"she is Heathcliff;\\" their persons are so similar that they are the same.Throughout this entire time Hindley marries a woman he is deeply fond of, and she becomes pregnant. However, his wife gets sick and dies while giving birth. Hindley becomes a different man after the death of his wife. He turns into an alcoholic, and vows that if he ever sees that baby he will smash its brain. While a life went out of the world, a new one came in however, and the baby boy was named Hareton. Nelly is the sole caretaker for the baby, and treats him with loving care as he grows up.Yet after Heathcliff leaves, Catherine spends the next few days searching for him and sickening herself. She waits for her childhood companion to return for 3 years, but eventually marries Edgar. Thus Nelly and Catherine move from Wuthering Heights to Thrushcross Grange, leaving behind baby Hareton with his drunken father.While the new couple settles into Linton's beautiful, fresh, and crisp home, Nelly starts to notice some aspects of their marriage. Linton listens to everything Catherine says otherwise Catherine will get extremely upset. He gives her everything, and she constantly complains to him. The entire story changes when one day Heathcliff arrives again. He has a new \\"darkness\\" in his eyes, and is now very rich. We will find that his personality has changed from being a boy with anger towards his oppressors, to a man with a psychopathic idea of revenge and love.Immediately, the two have a passionate connection that Linton cannot even compete with. Eventually it gets so bad that Heathcliff threatens to kill Linton, and he must call in help. Linton banishes Catherine from seeing him again, and she fakes a disease to try to get his attention. Eventually however, Linton grows frightened with his wife's health and nurses her night and day. This causes her to keep up with her illnesses and starve herself.Throughout this time, Heathcliff revenges upon Catherine for marrying Linton so he eloped with Linton's brother, Isabella. Isabella is utterly in love with Heathclifff, however he despises her. When Linton hears about his sister's elopement, he disowns her and vows that he cares nothing for her. Catherine is so utterly caught up with jealously with Heathcliff's action, that she grows into a new person. She would lay in bed and stare blankly at nothing for hours. Within 7 months after Heathcliff's return, she becomes so frail and weak that she can no longer move. She is also 7 months pregnant, but Nelly never mentions that until after the baby is born. Heathcliff finally finds a day where Linton is absent to come into her house and find his Cathy. Upon meeting each other, they are overcome with this attachment and lust that completely controls their bodies. Heathcliff lifts Cathy in his arms, not fully aware of the severity of her condition. This roughness causes blue marks in the lady's skin as the maid observes from afar. They kiss repetitively, apparently not aware of anything around them. Yet as hours pass, Linton makes his way home. Nelly pleads for Heathcliff to leave; yet Cathy pleads for him to stay. He leaves Cathy just as Linton comes into the room, and he is overcome by horror at how rabidly her strength had decreased. She died in her husband's loving arms.While this story ends, a new one begins with the child born in the hour of its mother's death. The baby is name Catherine as well. Edgar mourns for his wife for weeks, yet eventually he welcomes the baby in. Nelly calls her \\"angelic,\\" and everyone loves her at the Grange. Yet during the happy days of the baby Catherine's growth, treacherous things take place at Wuthering Heights. We so far have been unaware about anything that has happened at the Heights. Yet Isabella arrives at the door on a frigid winter day, with a deep gash on her neck. She ventures to tell Nelly her entire story from the day she elopes and onward. She tells Nelly how she was attacked, and banished from sleeping in the same room as her husband. She was made fun of, and kicked around. The day that made her run 4 miles through a blizzard, while bleeding profusely from the neck, was a shocking revelation of events.Hindley Earnshaw had told her on a previous date, that she had better make sure her husband's room was locked, because Hindley would shoot him the night it was not. This chilling experience shook the young lady up, and she tried to stay out of the two men's evident hatred towards each other. Hindley plans to kill Heathcliff, but Isabella warns him of coming into the house. Heathcliff believes she is trying to kill him as well, yet is able to attack and almost kill Hindley. Afterwards, she gets into an intense argument with Heatchcliff, and she tells Nelly of her feelings towards her oppressor. She says, \\"it is better to be hated by him than loved him.\\" As she departs, he savagely throws a knife at her neck. Isabella runs away and gives birth to a baby boy named Linton.13 years later, young Catherine grows into a beautiful lady, loved and nurtured by everyone around her. Yet as she grows up, she yearns to go outside of the walls of the Grange. They hear news that Isabella is sick, and she wants to give her nearly 13-year-old son to her uncle. However, the day he arrives, Heathcliff sends for his son and the frail boy never gets to live in a house of safety and solitude.4 years later, as Nelly is out looking for Catherine, she finds that the girl has escaped and ran up to the Heights. Nelly retrieves the foolish girl, and notices that Linton has become extremely sick and frail. She is very angry with Catherine, yet Catherine continues her interests with the Heights and Linton. Catherine and Linton start sending letters to each other, and become romantically interested.. We find through the course of events that Heathcliff manipulates Catherine into marrying Linton while her father dying. He grotesquely locks Nelly up in a room for days until finally she is released and her and Catherine are able to return to see Edgar before he dies. Nelly is not allowed to follow Catherine to the Heights, and finds a few months later that Linton dies, and Catherine is left trapped into a lifestyle under her insane father-in-law.The story ends here because Nelly has no more information to portray. Lockwood, who has been patiently listening, returns to the Heights to find that Heathcliff died, and Catherine is now in love with her other cousin Hareton. Hareton grew into a strong, muscular, mysterious, and rather illiterate man of 23. Heathcliff had bribed the man burying Catherine's coffin, to attach his coffin to hers--- much to the neighbor's detest. That way, he claims, \\"Edgar will not be able to tell us a part.\\" The book ends on somewhat happy terms now that Heathcliff is out of his misery and the new lovers are now together.In my opinion, the book was harshly realistic to what we live through today. It captured not only my attention, but also my emotions. Heathcliff was such a threat to society within the novel and outside of it that it was shocking to read about how strongly his heart was displayed just through words. When reading along, your entire being went into his character. It was repulsive, and horrific to imagine the things he did, but somehow understandable. When we can truly understand how he loved, then it is somewhat clear how he hated. Our villain of the story is not the man that viciously threw a knife at his wife's neck, or tore a young lady away from her dying father. Instead the true villain lies in what love can be turned into. Young Catherine did not love Linton, she only felt sorry for him. Heathcliff did not have the kind of love that will stay by you always, with compassion and gentleness. Heathcliff only attained the emotion of the past--- clinging on to the deep attachments of the wrongs people had done to him, and the only person that ever treated him right.When Heathcliff forces Catherine to stay at his home, and abuse his son and his nephew's emotions towards their cousin, I saw a similarity in Heatchcliff's own experience. He told Hareton to take Catherine out into their garden, \\"but try not to stare when she isn't looking.\\" Yet while she is out with him, he would try to make the sickly Linton jealous. In my opinion, I saw a pain in Heathcliff that he could only suppress by making others suffer.When examining the author of the book, we find that Emily Bronte lived on the moors of Yorkshire, England. The moors are deserted, stormy, and dangerous. The moors can represent Bronte's own life, and also the characters in the novel. All main characters of the novel can be compared to the bleak yet fierce aspect of the place where they live. It says Catherine Earnshaw Linton was buried \\"in a corner of the kirkyard, where the wall is so low that heath and bilberry plants have climbed over it from the moor.\\" She was neither buried in the church with the Linton family, or in the Wuthering Heights graveyard. This can be taken as the idea that she was caught between her wild childhood lover, and her caring protective husband. In our lives today, we can live two lives and get caught in the middle. Whether it is a person in love with two people, our faith, or our character, we can all struggle with living in two different worlds. Following Catherine's death, both Edgar and Heathcliff followed her to her grave. Edgar lived a life of happiness; he moved on with his life. Heathcliff lived a life of despair and solitude, only finding comfort when the ghost of Catherine haunted him. Our lives can be defined by how we are treated, what we lost, and who took that away. Yet we also can move on, and choose to forget those things--- not living in the moors of our devastated, uncivilized emotions. This brilliant novel can truly open up to one's heart and mind as you allow yourself to experience the words of Emily Bronte's inner being."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"reviewer:alysalovesbooks:)I am 16 and I thought this was going to be pretty boring and just...blah.But it was actually pretty good!I admit I only read this book because I had to do an assignment for my English Honors Literature class.It was slow and uninteresting at first but NEVER GIVE UP ON A BOOK right?Well, as I read on,it became more interesting.

I think one of the most amazing things about this novel is that the characters aren't exactly likable and yet you love them anyway. I love Heathcliff, though admittedly I wouldn't ever want to date him. I think Heathcliff is one of my favorite likable bad guys in literature along with Severus Snape. I would really recommend this book to anyone looking for a love story that transcends time and life. One of my favorite things about this book is that it's not just some simple love story where the guy falls in love with the girl and then something bad happens that threatens the relationship but it all works out in the end.

Well, . . . ummm . . . I didn't.It wasn't until almost ten years later, when my wife recommended this book to me, that I finally &quot;bit the bullet&quot; and read it.&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is a dark, sometimes tragic, love story. The characters have a depth to them that causes the reader to become emotionally involved with them. I found that I was cursing Heathcliffe on one page, and pitying him on the next.My only regret concerns myself more than the book. The ever-decreasing attention span of Americans today made me feel at time that the book got a little long. Perhaps if I weren't so distorted by a sitcom mentality where conflicts are resolved neatly in thirty minutes (minus time for commercials), I wouldn't have felt this way. In other words, the fault here is with my reading of the book, not with the book itself. Just be prepared when reading it.But read it nonetheless!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"this is a really good book that i had to read for school and i have not finished it yet but i look forward to an ending that is even more twisted then the previous chapters"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering heights is a book whitch everyone should read. it is a facinating love story between two wild individuals.

Bront didnt get deep enough into the characters thoughts and emotions because she wrote it from a third person perspective, that of Nelly Deen. And what was Joseph saying?! I just skipped over his infrequent lines. Also, she should have made it longer, she just zoomed right through the lives and loves of Catherine, Heathcliff, Edgar, Miss Catherine, and Linton, who were all very interesting characters. Those characters were so interesting that the reader should have gotten to know them better! But, it is a classic everyone should read. Also, I found myself quite enraged with Nelly throughout most of the book because she was the main hindrance in the loving relationships between Catherine and Heathcliff and that of Miss Catherine and Linton. She was stern and not understanding of the young mind and definitely not a romantic. And, I thought she was mostly exaggerating about Heathcliff, untill the end where I saw how he treated Hareton and Miss Catherine so poorly, and then i saw that maybe Nelly was right!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Amazing book.

Neither Heathcliff nor Catherine are heroes--rather they are the villians who want to love each other, but are thwarted by circumstance.

All in all, the material is promising.Unfortunately, the writing is so convoluted and verbose that you'd need a machete to ... your way through it. And \\"...\\" is an accurate verb; typically whole paragraphs and pages are filled with needless complications so that it's more like deciphering a code than reading a story.

But, it looks like it will be a great read. The book came as promised. It is a paperback - but a high quality one. If you are looking for this classic, I do recommend this printing."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I've never before written a negative Amazon reader review. As an author, I know how much they can sting, and I try to limit myself to only reviewing books I've really enjoyed. However, since the author is long dead, I doubt I can hurt her feelings. And if by my words I can possibly prevent one other person from undergoing the suffering I've endured, I'll feel that my job here is done.I decided that at the age of 52, it was time I started reading some of the classics that I'd missed along the way. I read PRIDE AND PREJUDICE first, and though I found Ms. Austen's writing to be tedious, the book was mildly entertaining. I thought I'd try Emily Bronte's WUTHERING HEIGHTS next. I'd always heard how romantic the story was, and no less than three people, upon seeing me with the book, told me, \\"You'll love it! You'll absolutely love it!\\"Please tell me you're kidding.This book is wretched. Painful to a degree I've never before experienced. I've read books that put me to sleep, books I found impossibly dull, books I found too stupid for words. But I have NEVER hated a book so much in my life. The characters in their entirety don't possess a single redeeming value. They are miserable, obnoxious, hateful excuses for human beings. Even the DOGS are hateful. Why should I care what happens to any of these awful people? Why should I care if they've made themselves miserable through their own choices and then spend the rest of the book whining and complaining about how pathetic their lives are?I hadn't realized just how much I loathed them until halfway through the book, when a major character died, and all I could think was, \\"THANK GOD! THANK GOD!\\"And then, there's the dialect. Ah, the dialect! I could tolerate it if it was used sparingly. But when a certain character goes into a speech that lasts for half a page of small print, in a language that can only be described as Not Even Resembling English (yes, I know it's supposed to be Scottish), the result is unbearable pain. Every time this character speaks (which is, thankfully, not often), I find myself puzzling over his words in an attempt to translate them into something that seems even mildly coherent. Sometimes, it's possible to do this just by context. At other times, I shake my head in bewilderment and disgust and simply move on to a different page. Considering how slowly the story moves (is there a storyline? a point to all this suffering?), I could probably skip entire chapters and not miss anything.I'd also like to know where the romance is. Since everybody in this book seems to hate everybody else, with the notable exception of the uncouth monster, Heathcliff, and the spoiled-rotten, obnoxious Catherine, I can't fathom where that might lie. Am I too dense to understand? Or has the literary world been tricking us for 150 years, convincing the sheep of the world to follow along in praise of this \\"romantic\\" classic?I think I would rather have my fingernails pulled out forcefully, one at a time, than finish reading this book. I'm halfway through, and life is short. Am I really willing to spend that much more of my short time here on earth torturing myself just for the satisfaction of knowing I actually read the dreadful thing? I think not.I also think my foray into the classics has ended right here. I'm off to read some Robert Parker or Janet Evanovich. Maybe even some Jackie Collins. Anything to cleanse my palate of the terrible aftertaste of Heathcliff and Catherine.To each his own. I know there are people who rave about this book, people who love it. I'm glad somebody does. Every book deserves to be loved by somebody. But in this case, with this particular book, that somebody will have to be Somebody Else.

That was the ONLY reason that I finished this book. It was a huge task just to finish a page of Wuthering Heights; it was almost impossible to complete it. I enjoy characters that I can care about. I like to be able to really feel like I want something for a character. If that happens, then I want to finish the book; I want to know what happens to the character. I found with Wuthering Heights I hated Catherine and Heathcliff. I wanted them to die. I was supposed to be sad when things went wrong in their lives, but instead I was so happy. They were selfish, cruel, horrible people and I wanted them to DIE! Was I really supposed to like these selfish people? Since when is love a selfish thing? This is supposed to be a marvelous love classic, but where is the love? Love isn't just about what makes oneself feel good. Love is a kind, caring, sharing thing. Catherine and Heathcliff were selfish, cruel people. They deserved each other simply because they would make each other miserable."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I'm not ashamed to admit that a good half of my personal library is comprised of classical novels and plays and that I read them because I genuinely LIKE them.You heard me right. I LIKE them. I read them for ENTERTAINMENT, not because they were assigned reading in classes (although I've made \\"friends\\" with a great title or two via that route as well).The Bronte sisters' novels enjoy love and hate from readers. I don't think there's a soul who just feels lukewarm about their works. I've read a couple and liked and kept most of them.\\"Wuthering Heights\\" stands out to me as one of the WORST novels I've ever read in my ENTIRE LIFE. Given the number of novels I've read in my entire life that's saying a lot.WH is very well-written. Emily Bronte CAN write. Style/technique isn't the issue. What is the issue is her abysmal failure to engage the reader because of her deplorable characters.Heathcliff and Catherine are frequently cited as one of the \\"power couples\\" of literature along with Rhett & Scarlett, Romeo & Juliet, Antony & Cleopatra, etc. They may be kindred spirits but there is none of their behaviors ever signifies they know a thing about love.Catherine Earnshaw isn't even an interesting character. She is a charming, selfish and silly young woman who fulfills the Victorian stereotype of choosing \\"a good match\\" over wild love on the moors with Heathcliff. This may have been the sanest thing she did. Maybe she recognized H's bizarre fixation on her as unwholesome and knew she'd never live up to it in reality.A lot of women get swooney over Heathcliff as a sort of alpha-male anti-hero. I'm female and I CAN'T STAND this guy! He isn't alpha, he's WEAK as skimmed milk.How psychologically disturbed is he, let me count the ways. Inferiority complex, obsessive attachment to uninterested female (Cathy turned him down whatever her \\"real feelings\\" might have been) that borders upon incest (they're not blood kin but they are raised together); inability to \\"forget the one that got away\\" and MOVE ON; child abuse/neglect with clearly murderous intentions; wife/spousal abuse; kidnapping and coerced marriage and even theft of personal assets...Give me a break this is no alpha male, this is a psychopathic CRIMINAL!If you sigh and say, \\"Oh but he did this all because he LOVED Catherine!\\" I will slap you. Truly I will.A REAL alpha male would be broken-hearted by the rejection of his \\"true love\\"...then he would have moved forward and continued with his life and discovered \\"true love\\" (as in love that was returned to him without bizarre psychological games).Heathcliff is a loser in every sense of the word.

Also the writing of the local dialect of one of the characters I could not understand a single word. I hope that his converstions were not pivital to the plot point because I had to keep skipping every part in the book because I had no idea what he was saying. All I can say is Catherine needs to grow up and Heathcliff needs to get a life. Classic, yeah right!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I first read Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront at the tender age of fourteen, and remember quite clearly that it was my birthday, and my mom and dad took me out to the movies. One glance at the poster and I declared we'd go watch Wuthering Heights starring Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, and that was that. I was transported by the thwarted romance that played out on the bleak Yorkshire moors. Of course I had to go read the book straight after, and while my youthful self probably didn't \\"get\\" half the relationship dynamics or the full depth of the dialogue, I nonetheless knew this is a book I'd need to reread at some point.Fast forward 20 years (gee whizz, it's been *that* long) and I downloaded the book from Gutenberg.org - a far cry from the battered paperback copy I inherited from the family home, and was immediately transported - again.Wuthering Heights is primarily a story about relationships, and of people who wilfully twist and allow others to twist them. We are first introduced to our narrator, a chap by the name of Lockwood, who has rented the grand Thrushcross Grange (complete with its own park lands). I get the idea the chap is a bit of a poseur, who's quite oblivious and gauche when it comes to how he relates to people. Self-absorbed. I missed this in the first read. Kudos to Bront for having a narrator I'd cheerfully slap. I mean, the fool goes blundering in to visit the inhabitants of Wuthering Heights when it's perfectly clear to anyone else with half an ounce of common sense that they do not appreciate the intrusion of a stranger.But Lockwood is our narrator, and it's clear the mystery presented by the relationships he encounters captivates his imagination to the point where he's determined to uncover they mystery that has presented itself. (My inner cynic cheerfully comments: \\"Well, what do you expect? They didn't have reality TV in those days.)Not one to take a hint when he's not wanted, Lockwood plays voyeur, and an ill-timed visit results in him having to spend the night at Wuthering Heights and subject himself to the ghost of Catherine - one of the key scenes.But the story's layers get peeled back. Lockwood's housekeeper at Thrushcross Grange is none other than Ellen (or Nelly, as she's know by those who're familiar with her), who grew up with the main participants in this drama. Her narration of past events is then retold by Lockwood, so once again our perceptions as readers are coloured by the lens of yet another viewpoint. We are faced with not only the opinions of Lockwood, but that of Ellen. Unreliable narrators both, but in their opinions, we view our main players with a degree of separation. We vicariously live out the unfolding tragedy from a safe distance while debating on characters' true motivations.Most often, Wuthering Heights is pegged as a romance and, to a degree I agree that romance is an underlying theme but I prefer to view it as a tragedy, of characters denying their true natures and being destroyed by the prolonged act of revenge.We enter a complex interconnecting web of relationships and the intermingling of two families. Always, Heathcliff is the outsider. Bront suggests that he is dark, perhaps of gypsy stock, and Catherine and Hindley Earnshaw's father brought the foundling home. The lad was closer in age to Catherine than her brother, and the two were soon inseparable. But when Catherine's path intersects with that of the wealthy Lintons, and specifically their son, Edgar, she is soon torn.The unsophisticated Heathcliff is her dark half, an animus as such, wild and unfettered, yet Edgar represents culture and an artificial construct of what \\"love\\" is supposed to be. Catherine is at a quandary, and it is her decision to marry Edgar that sets the wheels in motion for the unfolding drama.Yes, this is a tale of thwarted love, but it's also an illustration of how individuals will consciously choose a path that can only lead to damnation. What I found fascinating was comparing my initial response as a teenager to how I felt about the novel now, twenty years later. I recall feeling so sorry for how rotten Catherine's life turned out. Now? Well, I'd dearly love to shake some sense into the girl. All the characters are unlikeable. There is nothing romantic about Heathcliff's all-consuming passion for Catherine. And Catherine is a wilful, stubborn girl who's used to bending everyone around her to her whims, unmindful of the damage she is causing to herself and those around her.This made me think, however, about the relative ages of the characters in the story. They were but teenagers themselves, who behaved as such. The only difference is that in those days, folks getting married as young as eighteen was not unheard of. Now, you sit back and think about how your life would have turned out had you married your first sweetheart (you're excused if it's two decades later and you're still happily married to your first love).I think about my first love and where we'd be now if we were still together, and probably miserable as all hell to boot. Let's not go there. I'm glad I never felt obligated to marry someone, and that when I did finally get married (yes I married young at twenty-two) I'm still very much in love with the man but glad I'd had experience with other relationships.And lastly, Heathcliff. Wuthering Heights is really his story, if you ask me, and he suffers a bit of a dog-in-the-manger syndrome. He cannot have happiness, and has focused his entire existence on ensuring that no one else will have happiness. Heathcliff is ultimately tragic, but I don't pity him, as he mastered his own fate. In the end, he cannot bring himself to carry out the final act of his schemes, and loses the taste for revenge. Instead, he turns the sickness inward. The world continues without him, in spite of his machinations, and he consumes his own heart.Wuthering Heights falls under the category of the Gothic novel, along with the likes of Frankenstein. Supernatural elements are hinted at, and I suspect it's left up to the reader to decide whether these exist. This is one of the novels that I recommend to all aspiring authors to read. As a study on character development, Wuthering Heights is essential. Yes, the language usage takes a little getting used to but if you can get into the story, you'll gain an appreciation as to why this is one of those classics that has inspired film and music. (Go check out Kate Bush's music videos on YouTube.)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This book can be so depressing, but I love it!

It centers on the relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff, or rather the lack of a real one...the basis of their passion for each other is pretty thin, which makes the depths of Heathcliff's obsession with her pretty hard to understand. That characterization didn't seem true to life to me anyway---rather than being passionate about one thing to the exclusion of everything else like that, people are usually passionate in general or mean all around, not this precarious mixture of the two.The story really picked up for me in the latter part, when Heathcliff attempts to continue taking out his grievances on the subsequent generation, whose ultimate fate redeemed the novel for me. So, definitely worth a read, just make sure to stick with it all the way through to the end. Still, I definitely didn't love it as much as I did Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"i was so glad to find this amazing edition for such an affordable price! it was in great condition, exactly as the description said. thanks so much!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This book was mentioned in several of the other books that i have read so I thought I would see why it was referenced so much. I really liked this book. Emily creates these characters that have depth and strong emotions. Cathrine and Heathcliff are doomed from the get go, their chilhood spares them no humanity for them to retain in adulthood. Heathcliff is horrible and is often referred to a an evil man, true but Cathrine still loves him. Though she loves him she is so concided and horrible herself she refuses to be with him. I cannot tell you how horrible each of the characters are in Emily's novel you must read it for yourself. Please don't misunderstand me when I say horrible I mean the behavior and attributes of the characters not that they are poorly written or lacking in depth. Even thought this characters are the complete oppsite of good I found that I wished for their pain to stop. Each of the characters were in such a constant state of torture I could not really blame them for acting the way they did. They say that misery loves company and Emily's novel could not paint a better picture. It does take some adjusting to the way it is written the wording and phrasing are not of this era. But once you get started and get a feel for the writting style you will become consumed by the characters and their pain. I thought this book would be just another one of those old dull reads but it is so much more. I know its old and hard to understand at times but is so worth the read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"It took me a long time to get around to reading Wuthering Heights, and I have to admit, it was a slog. It's not that I have anything against novels from that time period; I count Jane Eyre and the works of Jane Austen among my favorite books. But Wuthering Heights did not live up to its reputation. The characters were universally unlikeable and unsympathetic. The story was meandering and ultimately unfulfilling. And the \\"love story\\" - more of a story of unreasonable obsession - did not move me. So count me among the few who did not fall in love with this novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I didn't really like this book, because it was just boring, and I couldn't understand what they were really talking about. It just didn't interest me, and it was confusing. I didn't like the characters too much and didn't get them. I think this book could've been better, and I personally wouldn't want to read it again. I had a hard time getting into it, the whole time I was reading it. It was pretty boring."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I just recently finished reading Wuthering Heights, and to be perfectly honest I have to say that it's a terrible story.The basic plot is centered around Mr. Lockwood and his visit to rural England and the house called Wuthering Heights where he is told the life story of a man named Heathcliff along with his love for Catherine, his hate for his bother (and his brother's son (Heraton) and his neighbors at Thruscross Grange and their son (Edgar) and their daughter (Isabella) [who he marries] and the son that he has with Isabella (Linton) and the extra hate that he gains when Edgar marries Catherine), and his story of revenge against the afore mentioned individuals who he hates.That brings us to the novel's problems. The true highlight of a novel is not its story, but rather its hidden significance, and while Wuthering Heights does bring out the extreme emotions that can be associated with love (i.e. passion, jealousy, spite), it does so in such a way that kills any male reader. It's true -for some reason, the ladies who read this book tend to like it much more than the guys.Perhaps the reason for this is the fact that the novel, with all deep and meaningful thoughts written in, reads like a victorian era after school special. Catherine totally had a crush on Heathcliff, and Heatcliff liked him back, but Catherine started hanging out with the wrong crowd -Isabella and Edgar. After a while Catherine just didn't want to hang out with Heathcliff, and one night she got so out of hand that she totally made out with Edgar! Heathcliff finds out and totally gets made, but he moved to another school for a year so it was okay then. Besides, his brother was mean to him. The next year he totally surprised everyone when he came back! Catherine was soooo regretful that she made out with Edgar, and she wanted Heathcliff back -but Isabella had a crush on him too! They totally got in a cat fight that day, saying how much they both hate Heathcliff. The problem was that Heathcliff was soooo made at Catherine (still) but had a crush on her (still) so he totally made out with Isabella! Then Isabella dies, then Edgar dies, then Heathcliff brother dies, then a few people get married until Heathcliff finally bites the dust.You're probably thinking that I have blown the story out of proportion, but the sad truth is that I haven't. In actuality, Heathcliff and Catherine do fall in love, but they never admit it to each other -they always bicker and argue and yell about how much they hate each other until Catherine dies. Just like how middle school kids will talk about how much they like so-and-so, but not to that individul. In actuality, Catherine does marry Edgar, Heathcliff does run away, and on his return Isabella does admit that she has fallen in love with him, Heathcliff does marry Isabella for revenge, and the rest of the story is then about people dying and Catherine's daughter Catherine and how she was forced to marry Heathcliff's son so that Heathcliff would get extra land when his kid died.Touching love story, isn't it?While some might call it a wild romance and a true testament to our inability to control the strongest of human emotion, I find that the love story is very elementary (on the account that it really does read like an afterschool special) and at the same time blown up -almost like Emily Bronte was a love-starved victorian era woman longing for a romance in her life (which she was) and the rest of the story was just a simple story where people are mean to each other and then die.Sorry Emily Bronte!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I am aware that this is not a novel meant to put a smile on your face or make you think of flowers and rainbows etc. But I was unable to get any enjoyment out of this book because the characters are so completely ridiculous in their courses of actions. Granted, the theme of the book is how hatred, jealousy, envy, and the like can overcome a person's soul, but she took it too far. The overblown &quot;love&quot; between the characters would invariably be followed by an act of viscious cruelty. Many of the good reviews for this book are from high school students. The reason most of them liked it, in my mind, is because they are immature and have idealized images of the emotions described in the book and how people would react to those emotions. We all know what it is like to love, to hate, to lose, but even under the most painful situations no one would act the way these characters did."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I know this may sound disrespectful to all of you connoisseurs of fine Brittish literature, but I hated Wuthering Heights.

Number one, isn't it supposed to be a 'tragic love story' between Cathy and Heathcliff? Well, Cathy is his daughter in law and CATHERINE is the one he loves.How can it be a love story when they are practically brother and sister and never showed each other much affection anyway?? And why does everyone die from catching a cold? Living in England ain't that bad and also I could not understand ONE WORD of what Joseph was saying! The narrative in this book also confused me a bit.I'd start a chapter believing Nelly to be narrating only to find out half way through that it was actually Mr Lockwood. Also what really confused me was Who was Ellen? Was it another name for Nelly Dean?? This book was quite clumsy,and how did Emily Bronte turn a useless story into a 400 page novel? The only decent part of the book was when Catherine is dying and Heathcliff holds her and actually kisses her.That is the only part which shows their true feelings. Also Nelly was a back stabber - Every secret she was told by Catherine and Cathy and even Isabella, she tells someone else!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Did not like this at all. The fact that it was short was the only reason I finished it. I am not too sure what the appeal of this book is to others."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This book is nothing special. I personally don't see why everyone considers this to be a masterpiece. First off I can't see how Bronte can turn such a stupid story into a 300 page novel. Another thing that bothered me was the narrative. The story was almost completely told in flashback and that flashback often broke into another flashback and a couple of time broke off into a third flashback. Another thing that was bad was the referce to the characters. One sentence she wold call Isabella Mrs. Linton then she would call Catherine Mrs. Linton also. Same situation with Mr. Heathcliff and Linton Heathcliff. Not to mention the fact that there were two Catherines which just added to the unproffesionalism of this book. What the heck was Joespeph saying!!!! Overall I believe reading this book was a complete waste of time and I would defenantly not recommend this book to anyone else. If you are looking for an enjoyable book from that era I strongly suggest you read Jane Erye by Emily's more competent sister Charlotte."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"No doubt about it, this book is a well written classic that generations continue to enjoy. I did in fact enjoy this book and got absorbed in the story. I was told this book was a love story; however, it is not just any love story. This book had depth and angles not only about love. In Wuthering Heights, as the years went by the Earnshaw's and Linton's became very dysfunctional. It seemed that there was no order in the family households. Most of all, I enjoyed the characters Emily Bronte created. Catherine Earnshaw was such a passionate character, her words moved me like no other book had. I was inspired greatly by Cathy's passion, &quot;It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; so he shall never know how I love him: and that, not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton's is as different as a moonbeam from lightning,or frost from fire (73).&quot; That paticular passage has always been my favorite. I felt so sorry for Heathcliff even though he became revengeful; however, I believe he was driven by passion himself. Catherine and Heathcliff were my favorite characters, but all the other characters were very important too. Altough the book is 'wordy', I throughly enjoyed the storyline and characters. So I have decided on ranking Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights an eight. Futhermore, I recommend this novel to anyone searching for a good book.

This is nothing like Jane Eyre or Pride and Prejudice. It does not have the spirite or the heart of those two books. For years I tried to figure out what was wrong with me that I should not love such a classic. But now that I am more mature and a more seasoned reader; ...It just is not to my taste. Sometimes I like books that others do not and sometimes others like books that I dont. This book lacks the hope and sense of awe for life that I desire in a novel. For me the hero and herroine must be worthy of my time and attention. Something good in them must prevail. That just doesn't happen here. This story is really sad because it is a love story writen by a woman who never know what it was like to love and be loved in return. IF she had she would never have writen this abusive version of love. But you know as well as i do that some women truely belive that abuse is love. So like I say to each his own.P.S.

It's a timeless book for everyone, combining elements that make it enveloping for both men and women. I must confess I have a hard time keeping myself interested in many classics I have read, but this one was different.

According to my teacher there are 43 but I have not found that many. This makes me detest the book.

Why did Mr. Earnshaw bring the boy Heathcliff home with him? Was Heathcliff his illegitimate son? Why does Catherine Earnshaw marry Edward Linton and not her true soul mate Heathcliff?As an English teacher, I am always reminded that sometimes the great novels of classical literature, like Wuthering Heights and to Kill a Mockingbird, would not get past the inquiry letter to the literary agent stage today. Why? Because both books have horrible beginnings. The reader must persevere in order to get to the meat and bones of the story. In the case of Wuthering Heights and to Kill a Mockingbird it is worth it.Catherine and Heathcliff are undoubtedly selfish human beings, but their love for each other is so powerful and damaging the story is a must read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I don't know if I can add much to what has aleeady been said about Wuthering Heights.

I immensely suspect that confederates of Heathcliff have either not read the second half of the story or are ignorant to the terrors of domestic violence. Where the plot lays asunder, I'd remark that Bront's ability to truly abhor me in the chilling degradation of Heathcliff and the ghastly haunting story that ensues, greatly pulls together an all around unsettling finish to an otherwise unremarkable tale. Over all while I can only fault the book for the story, the writing was much to my liking and I may very well come back to it in later years with a different eye.

It centers on the relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff, or rather the lack of a real one...the basis of their passion for each other is pretty thin, which makes the depths of Heathcliff's obsession with her pretty hard to understand. That characterization didn't seem true to life to me anyway---rather than being passionate about one thing to the exclusion of everything else like that, people are usually passionate in general or mean all around, not this precarious mixture of the two.The story really picked up for me in the latter part, when Heathcliff attempts to continue taking out his grievances on the subsequent generation, whose ultimate fate redeemed the novel for me. So, definitely worth a read, just make sure to stick with it all the way through to the end.

Cannot find these classics in the stores and this way my kids will be able to enjoy as well."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I first purchased the novel a couple of years ago while I was still a teenager, and the book was difficult at first read. Over the years I've reread the pages again and again, in particular the beginning pages, which introduces us to Lockwood, who is first person narrator. The book is still difficult because of the layers, reading into first person commented. There is also a chronology in the narrating, and a complicated connection between past and present. Also the diction is complicated because two people are telling the story at the same time, because mr Lockwood is listening to Nelly most of the time.Nelly is a clear narrator of story between Catherine, Heathcliff, and always includes the involvement of everyone else (Edgar, Hindley, Isabella, Nelly herself), and also the second generation (Hareton, Linton, the young daughter of Catherine who shares her name).Catherine passes away very soon since giving birth to daughter Catherine, and her ghost lives on, in the spirit of her daughter, and in Wuthering Heights. Her ghost touches Lockwood early in the novel, before he reads her diary material, and he possibly closest sees her in the daughter, whom he says is beautiful. Lockwood has never met the first Catherine, but he has met Heathcliff. Lockwood is intrigued by Heathcliff, and by the story Nelly tells. We find out that Nelly is only two years age difference with the first Catherine, and apart from being the objective story teller, she is also passive narrator, because she is immediately involved with the subplot at the same time. She talks to Catherine and Heathcliff, she doesn't understand their love, but she looks after young Catherine at Thrushcroft Grange since her mother passes away. Also the relationsip between Catherine and Heathcliff is platonic, as told by her, and there is never physical or sexual interaction told by Nelly. Catherine had her daughter with husband, Edgar, not Heathcliff, but she never kisses, sleeps with or has sexual or physical interaction with Heathcliff, and critics sometimes pay attention to that happening when they read the novel. Less of the elder Catherine is told because she passes away under halfway through the course of the book. Most of the connection readers continue to feel is still platonic.The novel is very beautiful, because of the nature described about Wuthering Heights and Thrushcroft Grange. We know it is a world removed, as young Catherine marries Linton first (first cousin through Isabella and Edgar being siblings), then she marries Hareton (first cousin through Catherine and Hindley were siblings), but being married to cousins is still a taboo today. This makes it less surprising the novel was so controversial when it was first released, and critics sometimes still find it difficult to get interpretations around Catherine and Heathcliff's love, but although the novel was heavily criticised when first released, it found a place in critics' hearts over a vast amount of time. Readers can eventually come to understanding the book after reading and retracing, and in the end it was always worth the effort of rereading."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Everyone I know who read Wuthering Heights hated it. Said it was sad and the people were horrid. I actually enjoyed it. Yes, they were silly people who held in their feeling until it was too late and concentrated on revenge other than trying to make the best of life, but that's what makes it so great. Plenty of life lessons in this novel. I loved the ending. How one person could find a way and make everything right.

I read it because I was forced to. I was determined to dislike it. Even after starting the book I continued to criticize the foppish Lockwood wandering inanely about the moors in the classroom.There is no comparable book I have ever read. Its impact stays with you forever. Other reviewers are for more eloquent, but the vivid imagery and violent emotions of the protagonists is unparalleled. I have recommended this book to family and friends over the years, badgering them into reading it. The result is often the same. It was not what they were expecting and simply a great book.

If I could I would have given this book 3.5/5 stars for the excellent use of language and talent for create a setting."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"It took me a few days to get over my initial distaste for the main characters, and this book in general, before writing a review. This book was not well received in its time and I understand why. Victorian England was not interested in perusing books with such irascible characters, as it didn't fall within their idea of how ladies and gentlemen of the period should behave. Heathcliff and Cathy are two people who are as twisted and tempestuous as the moors in which they live.Heathcliff is brought to live in Cathy Earnshaw's family as a small child by her father. He is greatly disliked by Earnshaw's son, Hindley, because he regards Heathcliff as an upsurper, and does all he can to torment the newcomer. Cathy takes Heathcliff on as her playmate and from that moment on the two are inseparable, running as wild and unchecked as the windy moors surrounding them. Heathcliff grows to love Cathy fiercely as he becomes a young man, but Cathy begins to take an interest in the quiet, refined way of life at Thrushcross Grange, the home of their wealthier, more respectable neighbors.Upon returning from an extended stay at Thrushcross Grange, Cathy is transformed from the wild, ill-mannered and incorrigible girl, to a seemingly calm and civilized young lady. She has caught the eye of her neighbor's young son Edgar and has designs to marry him. Cathy confides this to her servant, Nelly, who asks her if she does not care then for Heathcliff. Cathy expresses disdain for Heathcliff and remarks that she could never marry him. Unbeknownst to her, Heathcliff has heard this conversation and quits the house. Cathy continues to elaborate upon her feelings and reveals that though she finds Heathcliff coarse and unrefined, she loves him deeply to the extent of proclaiming herself to be Heathcliff. She cannot see herself ever separating from him because loving him is like loving herself--both are as one person. Nelly is exasperated with her talk and tells her that Heathcliff has overheard their conversation. Cathy panicks and stays up all night waiting for him to come home. He never returns and does not come back to Wuthering Heights for another 3 years.By then Cathy has married Edgar, but pines for Heathcliff. She is immensely happy with Edgar until Heathcliff comes back bent on revenge. He takes that revenge by running away with Edgar's younger sister. Despite the fact that both have hurt each other deeply, Heathcliff and Cathy continue to love one another with a dangerous, wild and destructive passion. That passion consumes and destroys everything around them and when Cathy finally succumbs to her end, Heathcliff continues his embittered path of hatred and destruction, revenging himself on his wife, his brother-in-law and their descendants.This was such a hard book to read because I internalized all the horrible feelings Cathy and Heathcliff exuded. I didn't like Heathcliff, I resented his love for Cathy. How is it that he can hate in such reckless abandon with the same heart that he uses to love Cathy and then treat her daughter with such contempt? How dare he profess to love when he hates and despises so cruelly. He has no compassion and, by God, I would have shot him if I was Cathy Linton.Emily Bronte wrote a book that breaks convention and draws comparisons between men and women, society, religion and class. It is superior to Charlotte's \\"Jane Eyre\\" and Anne's \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\" which though well written, are products of convention."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I should probably like this book more than i did, but every page felt like a labor. Later, a professor told me that it was spoof/commentary on Jane Austen, and that made me like it more.

Instead, I found that Bronte broke barriers by producing two very real characters.Cathy and Heathcliff's story explores the consequences to the character's decisions. Bronte does not gloss over the reasons for the decisions (money, greed, breeding, retaliation, etc), but those reasons play a minimal role. Instead, she chooses to show how a human reacts to a good/bad decision, and when life doesn't go his or her way.My suggestion for reading Wuthering Heights is to place yourself in Cathy and Heathcliff's shoes and figure out if there was another choice for their behavior."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"(Like the curmudgeonly CAT in the COMIC...get it?)Great old-style classic novel. One of Henry Miller's favorites; that's what attracted me to it.I liked the style of the narrative, largely told through the reminiscences of the housekeeper Nelly. This is one dysfunctional family!Like many novels from this period it's all about the interpersonal relationships; there isn't anything external happening to anyone here of any particular consequence. But the masterful storytelling and imaginings of the authoress really do make this a worthwhile and rewarding literary journey.Read it! Classics rule!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I have very mixed feelings about this book. While it's a beautiful book, and I will probably read it again, I could not stand the story! All of the characters are horrible people, in my opinion, and the only thing that kept me from throwing the book across the room was the last two chapters. If I had not had to read this for class, I would not have finished it at all - though I am certainly glad I did finish it.If you're looking to read the Classics, definitely do read this. Same goes for if you're looking to read a classic romance, or one of the Gothic classics. However, if you're looking for a \\"good\\" book, one that will leave you happy or going \\"aww,\\" you're at the wrong book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Okay, everyone has heard of this book so I probably don't need to give a review, but I will anyways.=) Some have seen the movie adaptations of this book as well so some already know the storyline and what this book is about.I absolutely loved this book. I couldn't stop reading until I reached the very end. I had seen both the 1939 and 1992 movie adaptations of this book so I already knew what happened, but the movies don't capture the essence and emotion of the story as well as the book can.Heathcliff is the gothic romance hero with traits that I think many romance writers use in their own heroes: brooding, mysterious, darkly handsome, and harsh (though of course, not so tortured and brutal). Cathy is gay-hearted and a wild beauty, but also selfish and manipulative in her behavior and actions. Both characters are so realistic in their human emotions and failings that you can't help but empathize with them and hope for that happily-ever-after you know will not occur (as the story is told in flashback so you already know their love was doomed). They are two people that are meant for the other, and each hold flaws and are not always the most likeable of characters.I found myself going through the \\"what-ifs\\" scenarios: What if Cathy hadn't spurned Heathcliff for the more wealthy and civilized Edgar? What if Heathcliff hadn't left to make his fortune to win Cathy? What if Heathcliff hadn't decided to seek vengenance and revenge on those who prevented their union?What made this book so tragic to me was the fact Cathy knew instinctly what she was doing (by accepting and marrying Edgar for position and wealth) was so wrong! She was going against herself by rejecting the fact that they were indeed soulmates and meant for each other. One half of a whole:\\"In my soul and in my heart, I'm convinced I'm wrong!\\"\\"I love him; and not that, not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton's is as different as a moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire\\"\\"My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath--a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind--not as a pleasure, but as my own being\\"Despite her confessions of the heart, she goes through with her folly and dooms herself and Heathcliff and all those they encounter, and this passes on to the next generation. Her actions causes obssession and borderline madness in Heathcliff that continues long after Cathy dies. Even though he becomes so cruel and unlikeable in the second half of the book, I couldn't really hate him, knowing what he went through in the first half of the book. Although what he went through doesn't excuse his behavior and actions, you still understand the reasons behind them. You can hear the pain and anguish in his soul when he asks Cathy why she did what she did:\\"Why did you betray your own heart, Cathy?\\"\\"Because misery, and degradation, and death, and nothing that God or Satan could inflict would have parted us, you, of your own will, did it. I have not broken your heart--you have broken it; and in breaking it, you have broken mine.All in all, this book is dark, despairing, emotionally wrenching and passionate. Be warned, this book will make you cry."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This is a true classic. No movie has ever done it justice. The parallel structure within the characters' genealogical table is phenomenal.Highly Recommended.James Conroyd Martin, Author of PUSH NOT THE RIVER and AGAINST A CRIMSON SKY Push Not the River"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This compelling story of hate has enthralled readers for generations with good reason. From the classic scene of Lookwood encountering Catherine Linton's ghost, I was hooked. Though the plot is not always fast-moving, it is strong and compelling. It is fun for readers to draw parallels between the two generations outlined in this novel. The atmosphere of the novel is one of mystery, set up early in the first few chapters. Though most of the characters are despicable in some way, hearing about their lives through Nelly's eyes is irresistible. The novel is littered with violence, and the \\"moral\\" of the story is unclear to the reader, as it possibly was to the author herself, yet it does make a few important points. Love is not everything, for example, is stressed from the moment that Catherine Earnshaw becomes a Linton. With vivid imagery and extremely psychological characters, Emily Bronte created a classic truly deserving of the title."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I read this novel when I was a junior in high school, and I really did not enjoy it. I was an avid Jane Austen fan and usually read the sweet, courtship novels. Now, as a college graduate, I decided to re-read this classic to see if I might enjoy it more now that I am older. I must say that I was really taken by the spectacular writing, and the poignant view of human nature at its worst. Although Heathcliff and Cathy's romance is disfunctional at times, the extreme hold that they have on one another (even after death) is compelling. I really enjoyed this book, and I recommend it to all of you who have a dusty copy sitting on your bookshelf.

Lacks the crackling wit and sparkling satire of Miss Austen's works, and focuses on a love between Heathcliff and Cathy (neither of whom can the reader relate to, for they are larger than life and their peculiarities are never explained)which is, of course, doomed. Lockwood is the only character whom we can possibly hope to understand, for he tells the reader about himself (he is the narrator, except when Mrs. Dean is telling the story to him) during the course of the story. Maybe it's just me, but I found it depressing. Now, I can cry over a realistic novel like Sounder or Bridge to Terabithia, but these dudes and dudettes (forgive the modern Yank term, I do that sometimes (&lt;:) are acting really stupidly for no apparant reason.

Only Heathcliff sparked my interest, as my heart went out to him as he was tortured by Catherine, who must be the meanest social-climbing b*tch in English literature. Finally, about halfway through, Cathy dies (thank God) and the book really takes off. I could not put the book down as Heathcliff returns to carry out his revenge, and destroys the lives of basically everyone.

That is how people had described it to me. I honestly don't understand what is so classic about this book. It was too dark and I couldn't enjoy it.I hated Heathcliff and Catherine. He was spiteful, miserable, and menacing. Of course this wasn't his fault. He had a tough upbringing and Catherine made it worse, by choosing to marry someone for convenience knowing that Heathcliff loved her and she loved him. Catherine was whiny, selfish, and spoiled. She was such a witch,I really hated her. I hated her more than Heathcliff. She married Edgar and had a happy marriage until Heathcliff re-appeared. It was all downhill after that.After a three year hiatus, Heathcliff decided to come back for Catherine. He made everybody lives miserable. I didn't understand this romance that existed between Heathcliff and Catherine. It just seemed like an obsession.

While Heathcliff seems the obvious steward of evil and badness in the novel, after careful introspection, the reader discovers that immorality and badness seep into the hearts of many other characters. Though perhaps not as insidious at the outset, most of the major characters experience a moral deficiency and by the completion of the novel, have acted in a way that makes the distinction between themselves and the clearly wicked Heathcliff more nebulous than before. Bronte startles the reader into the realization that regardless of conformity to Victorian social mores, each person nurtures a seed of immorality within themselves. Though there may be people who are excessive in their depravity, Bronte skillfully reminds us that an image of evil exists within everyone."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights is a classic novel from Charlotte Bronte and this unabridged audio recording is highly recommended to people who read the book and loved it and are interested in hearing the book being read.

The problem is that for the most part all those things stink and always have so what are these comparisons saying about this book.

Several months later I picked it up and gave it a try. I'm not sorry I did. Thinking about it now I start to realize what is so good about the book: it's author's compassion for humanity. All characters in this novel suffer a great deal (partly because of their own stubbornness) but retain their essential humanity: they still need to be loved. And while reading it you can feel the author's longing to be loved herself. So this is what made me read through the book: it speaks directly to your heart in a way you can not ignore."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I'm very partial to the novel itself, but this treatment of it in the Norton Critical Editions leaves much to be desired.1. One big advantage of the Norton Critical Editions is that they have footnotes. This one, however, is extremely sparing of its footnotes, only giving one every fifty pages or so -- and that's usually to clarify a Biblical allusion. You're supposed to know a lot of other things, such as that \\"bairn\\" is Scottish dialect for \\"small child.\\" Terms like that pass by unremarked on, so don't think this version is going to help clarify all those dialect words you've been wondering about.2. The font is small and uncomfortable to read.3. The essays in the back, the other reason to buy a Norton Critical Edition, are somewhat absurd. Part of the mystery of \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is that its author seemed to have zilch for sources: the whole composition seems to have sprung whole from her fertile mind. So what do they do? Print her juvenalia poems, her sisters' writings, etc. Not much that will actually help you achieve a deeper understanding of the text.The only advantage I can cite of this edition is that the footnotes (praise Heaven!) translate the ramblings of that screwball Joseph into plain, readable English.Boy, do they ever need to come out with one of these for \\"Wuthering Heights\\":The Annotated Pride and Prejudice"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is an amazingly dark and twisted romance novel containing the most repulsive characters you'll ever meet in all of Bronte fiction. . . . And I absolutely LOVE it! The Bronte sisters seem to have had real talent when it came to dark fiction romance and are quickly becoming my romodels in the genre.The story is about love -- but above everything else, it is about revenge. Heathcliff's revenge to be precise. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's start at the beginning, shall we?::SPOILERS::::LOCKWOOD:: Lockwood is, well . . . a bit of an idiot. He's the sort of idiot who's exceedingly cheerful and can not strain past his own nose to see that his company is unwanted. He is new in the neighborhood and has moved into Thrushcross Grange, an estate not far down the road from Wuthering Heights. His landlord is the master of Wuthering Heights, a sour, grumpy, very cross man named Heathcliff.Lockwood presses his company upon his grumpy landlord and is introduced to a number of startlingly unpleasant people. When a snowstorm settles in on the Heights, Lockwood is forced to remain among his grumpy hosts, whose sour dispositions are so frightening the tension in the air could be cut with a knife. Lockwood can not understand why everyone is so cross, snappish,and rude, and attempts to make several weak jokes at supper that fall into a miserable silence on his part.When everyone present refuses disdainfully to accompany him home, Lockwood wanders home himself and comes down with a bad headcold. At Thrushcross Grange, he enquires after his landlord and his sour company. His maid, a woman named Ellen Dean, is more than happy to tell Lockwood the unpleasant tell of love, revenge, and death. This is how the narration of the storyof Wuthering Heights really begins.::HEATHCLIFF:: I absolutely love Heathcliff. He is the dark villian but also the sad hero of our tale. No one knows precisely where Heathcliff came from. He was found by Mr. Earnshaw, the man who owned Wuthering Heights and happened to have two children already of his own. Mr. Earnshaw took the dark \\"gyspy\\" orphan Heathcliff home to Wuthering Heights and favored him so much that his son, Hindley Earnshaw, was roused often to violent jealousy and set out to make Heathcliff's life a living hell.Mr. Earnshaw's daughter on the other hand, a wild pretty girl named Catherine, found in Heathcliff the playmate and soulmate she didn't know she'd been waiting for. The children ran wild together on the moors and were as close as if they'd grown together in the womb. Both had short tempers and wild dispositions and were nasty, unpleasant people to cross.Heathcliff was very in love with Catherine, and she with him. But when the two of them grew up, Catherine decided that she could not marry Heathcliff: his station was too low. Therefore, the stuck-up girl reasoned that the best thing for her to do was to marry Edgar Linton (the young man who happened to own Thrushcross Grange just down the road) and by this young man'sriches so help Heathcliff rise on the social ladder.Heathcliff was so stung by this rejection that he disappeared into a storm one night and did not return for many years, at which time he exacted his revenge against Catherine and her overbaring elder brother, Hindley.Yet not only does Heathcliff later in life mistreat his decieved wife (he throws a knife at her face, I believe), but he also treats his son, Linton Heathcliff, with open scorn and distaste. For Linton has none of his father's looks, but his uncle Edgar's instead, and is very sickly and poor.Meanwhile, Heathcliff is so tortured by Catherine's departure that he thinks he sees her everywhere. He even returns to her grave and attempts to dig her body up with the intention ofholding her close again but decides that he will defy everyone and be buried beside her. Thus, the rest of his life is spent exacting his revenge on those who harmed him and their children.::EDGAR LINTON:: Tall, blonde, effeminate Edgar is as weakminded a fellow as can have been invented. He knows full and well that Catherine Earnshaw is in love with Heathcliff, that she brags about how wonderful Heathcliff is, that she stood outside in the storm all night when Heathcliff disappeared and called his name -- but Edgar Linton wants her anyway. It's like he's dying to be used and abused. And moments after Catherine has flown into an appalling rage and even proceeded to beat him violently about the head with her fists --Edgar asks her to marry him and she accepts. Oi.::CATHERINE EARNSHAW/LINTON:: There's only one way to explain the tantrums and absurd pleas for attention -- Catherine Earnshaw is an obnoxious brat. She drove her father to drink as a child and frequently commanded her way with tantrums that followed her straight on to womanhood.When Heathcliff returned from his travels to visit her, she bragged tactlessly of her love for him to her husband and even proceeded to go on long walks with Heathcliff alone. When Edgar finally got the guts to banish Heathcliff from Thrushcross Grange, Catherine flew into a rage and deliberately made herself ill. But her true love for Heathcliff was confirmed at last when the lovers held each other prior to her death and wept miserably cheek against cheek. Such a tender love scene I've never known until I read Wuthering Heights. I don't think even Jane Eyre compares.Catherine was angry that Heathcliff had married her brother's sister (Isabella Linton) just to get her back for marrying Edgar, and Heathcliff was angry that Catherine chose Edgar over himself. But they forgave each other just before Catherine died and Heathcliff was ever after half a man without her.::ISABELLA LINTON:: This girl is as much a fool as her absurd and abuse-loving elder brother. She falls headover heels in love with Heathcliff without the slightest encouragement on the latter's part and \\"provokes\\" her future husband with fond looks and sighs. Heathcliff, seeing opportunity for sweet revenge, leaps on it and has soon run off with Isabella and married her with the intention of horrifying Edgar (whom he, needlessly to say, hates with a passion) and his lover Catherine.Like most fools, Isabella Linton gets exactly what she deserves. She is treated very poorly by her husband, who curses at her and calls her by unkind names, and laughs with scorn in her face as he watches her realize he is not the \\"gallant\\" and \\"noble\\" creature she had imagined. Isabella soon learns that handsome men are not always kind and finally stands up for herself. Her sharp tongue is rewarded with a knife in the face, and she flees Wuthering Heights, the unhappy home of many by now.::HINDLEY EARNSHAW:: Hindley, of course, lives to see adulthood and even marries. His wife, however, dies giving birth to their son, Hareton. Hindley falls into a miserable state and begins to drink heavily -- so heavily that on one occasion he nearly kills his son by accidentally dropping him from an upstairs banister. He is still a dismal drunkard when Heathcliff returns to Wuthering Heights intent on revenge. With Heathcliff returned, Hindley (like most of the people kin to him) loses his mind and paces every night with the intention of shooting Heathcliff dead in his sleep. For Heathcliff has taken advantage of Hindley's drunkeness and has won over the whole of Wuthering Heights in several card games.The doctor of revenge has checked in!I've never been so astonished, so happy, so moved by any story than by Wuthering Heights -- and I've read some good books!This is an awesome novel full of romance and despair, and I recogmend it to anyone who could sit through my bantering and actually read my review! Enter the dark recesses of Heathcliff's mind and see what it's like to be the devil!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I have read this book at least three times.

I highly recommend that everyone read this book at some point in their life."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is a classic only in the sense that it was written in the 19th century. But it is a compelling story w/ dark, violent passions, and emotions of love and hate. Heathcliff's only goal in life is to seek revenge on anyone associated w/ the Earnshaws and Lintons. His love for Catherine is evident, but his hate is chillingly cruel and violent that touches everyone between the two estates. Only when he is w/ Catherine is he pacified. Catherine is torn between her true love Heathcliff, and her duties to marry someone of her station in life. But she doesn't understand her love and emotions for Heathcliff. (Which makes me believe she's too childish, spoiled, and bratty to handle her emotions rationally or she's a manic depressive). It's a dark passionate story that is compelling to read. Unfortunately it's also hard to follow in the third person narrators. The long winded descriptions makes the book drag (which explains the 300 pages). And what in heaven's name is Joseph saying? Are most uneducated people of countryside England so hard to understand? This book isn't for the light reader. If you want something easier and more light hearted, go for Charlotte Br&ouml;nte's &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot; Or books by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Emily Bront happens to be one of the three famous Bront sisters and also the middle of them. She had led a dark life without parents but managed to get by with her siblings and each made it to literature fame in different paths. With \\"Wuthering Heights\\", Emily Bront had created a shocking romance that's been unimaginable and has been read for around 165 years.In 1760, we are taken to the title farm and meet a poor gypsy boy from the streets and is taken by a farmer named Earnshaw of the place and then makes him a part of his family and renaming him Heathcliff and while trying to be use to his new life. While his new family is uncomfortable with a poor boy in the family and mostly with his stepbrother Hindley he begins a relationship with the farmer's daughter, Catherine which goes off good. Some years later, Earnshaw and his wife are dead and Hindley is now married and plans to take over the authority of the family while Heathcliff and Catherine's relationship continues to grow. But as they grow into their adult years, more troubles fall into their lives and their romance is left in a tragic bind and will leave both of them in darkness.It's no Hamlet, Jane Eyre or even Romeo and Juliet. It's a novel completely in it's own creativity. The story takes many twists and turns that you'll probably find yourself lost in. The characters are very vivid and lifelike and the plot is so surprising and will shock anyone. It's a shame Anne Bront only wrote one novel, since we would've able to see what other novels she would create. But \\"Wuthering Heights\\" will always be a novel that will show a truly tragic tale of romance."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"When first started reading this I expected it to be about two lovers who were somehow being driven apart. And although that proves to be true, it's far more complicated than that. Filled with hate, revenge, and anger, you can expect to find very little happiness in this book. As for the characters, I found it impossible to like any of them except for Hareton. You have characters who are so self centered and filled with rage, that in their time of weakness you can't even pity them for they're that despicable. But don't get me wrong, each character has their moments that make you want to forget all their flaws, but those moments are limited.Emily Bronte created a book about love and hate, and what they can do to people. Driven with love and hate, people do crazy things and this books goes to show you that. And although this book had it's slow parts, I still found it to possess a well thought out story. And as for the ending..well that part I enjoyed."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Emily Brot's \\"Wutheting Heights\\" is a two sided coin. The whole narrative is contructed over doubles and juxtapositions -- with elements arranged into pairs. From the basic conflict of love against hate, the writer brings up the most and lest noble feelings and actions -- always making pairs and putting one against the other.To begin with, the narrative is divided into two distinct poles, each representing a different generation. Structurally speaking, the first part -- the one that includes Catherine, Heathcliff, Isabella, Edgard -- is stronger and more important, while the second segment works as a sort of anticlimax dealing with the love of the second generation --young Catherine, Linton, Hareton. Another double point is that there are two Catharines, being the second one the daughter of the former. They both have many resemblances, physically and psychologically. But the young Catharine is an amalgam of her mother's and father's personality.\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is a generational drama. Two generations have to face the same problems that they parents had. But at the same time, Bront deals with the gap of one generation to another. The same dramas do not have the same conclusion. Time has passed, minds and behavior have changed. In this fashion, the book tackles life as a process that is in constant change.Places are also battling against each other. The main stage for the action is the Wuthering Heights, while the other part of the narrative happens in the Thurshcross Grange. The first, as the name gives away, exploits the wildness, the extremity, the unstoppable love. On the other hand, the Grange represents the social status and the aristocracy. At the same time, they represent Catharine inability to choose between Heathcliff (WU) and Edgard (TG).Despite not being a success when first published in 1847, Brot's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" became a cult with time. Nowadays it is considered one of the most important novels ever written. Not a bad change for a book that received much critics when published and the writer had to use a masculine pen name in order to be considered serious.As Gothic novels go, not only structurally is \\"Wuthering Heights\\" a very brave effort, but also thematically this book defied its genre. Following the gothic tradition of the late XVIII Century, the books has elements like supernatural aspects, moonless nights, valorization of the grotesque. But, despite these strong points, what remains more popular in the book is its characters and their love story, Catherine and Heathcliff.The narrative is told by many different narrators from various sources, like letters, diaries entries etc, therefore there isn't an unbiased narrator. Nelly tells most of the story to Mr. Lockwood. She watched most of events she describes, however she remains as an unreliable narrator, once she injects her own view of the facts and characters. That is why it is so important to read between the lines in this book.Thinking of more contemporary concepts, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is like yin and yang, dealing with two basic principles of the universe: love and hate -- both inhabiting the same people. Since the novel deals with the human nature, Bront's single novel is timeless and appeals to most readers."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I first read WUTHERING HEIGHTS as an assignment in 10th grade English class and was struck by how emotionally twisted the characters were. I also wondered if I was reading the book the right way, because I found a lot of the story very funny.So I decided to pick it up again recently and realized what a timeless, brilliant book WUTHERING HEIGHTS really is. It's as emotional and labyrinthine as any soap opera -- but so much more worthwhile. These are some of the most strongly-drawn characters in literature, and they will pull you right into the story with their caprices, turnabouts, fripperies, and cruelty.First-time readers may find the beginning a bit slow, but please don't be discouraged by that. A really wild, romantic -- and, yes, after all these years, still pretty hilarious -- story awaits you. This is a book that can move you to tears and make you laugh out loud.First-time readers may also have trouble keeping track of the two Catherines and who's married to/in love with whom. Even while rereading it, I had to remind myself who was who, who's the child of whom, who's the mortal enemy of whom -- but it is absolutely worth it. So many people go on about how romantic this book is, and it certainly is, but let's not overlook the sheer drama and insanity of this book.This book is more about obsession than pure romantic love. There, I've said it. This book will make you glad that your life is not like this. But any time you need a shot of histrionic behavior and violent obsession, Heathcliff and Cathy are waiting for you at WUTHERING HEIGHTS."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"...when you have nobody to love you...lonely like the devil and envious like him...nobody will cry for you when you die!I don't consider &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; to be a love story or simply a book about love, hate, and revenge, as it is often wrongfully described by many. I dare not say this is a social work either, but it is somehow concerned with broad issues such as social and familial oppression, the subordination and the disadvantaged nature of female lives at that time, the brutality of the patriarchal power, the unjustices of the inheritance law, etc. The most striking thing about this book is that it is concerned with extremities like love and hate, human and animal, life and death, masters and servants, earthly and divine.Of course the relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff is maybe one of the main things of, at least, the first part of this work: they're like almost two waterdrops, both showing a fondness for freedom and nature. But their relationship (I don't know why I hesitate to call it love) is kind of dysfunctional, for lack of a better word. Maybe it's because of the lack of a mother for both of them, maybe because of their upbringing in an atmosphere of patriarchal brutality.And maybe it's not a pure coincidence that Heathcliff's origins are obscure: when he first appears at Wuthering Heights he is dirty, ragged, starving and houseless, ill-treated by the patriarchal and he is refused education. As a critic simply put it, Wuthering Heights can hardly be described as a social novel, but it deals with many social themes, as Heathcliff might be seen as a representative of, maybe not the dispossessed, but at least of the oppressed; on the other hand Edgar reads a great deal, but his reading seems more a means of escape from the emotional turmoil which surrounds him rather than a pleasure per se. Besides, towards the end of the story, Cathy begins to educate Hareton, which later leads them to falling in love, as preposterous as this might seem earlier in the book: their previous enmity and hatred has been forsaken in favour of union through learning. Interestingly, as this is happening, Heathcliff, formally the force for energy (not a positive one), now acknowledges the draining of this energy and the lost of his faculty of enjoying their destruction and his being too idle to destroy for nothing (I have to remind myself to breathe-almost to remind my heart to beat: conscience has turned my heart to an earthly hell).If the first part of this work depicts a fierce and passionate but also binary view of the Yorkshire moors society, the second part of it is about reconciliation, education, development and, thus, progress. At the end of the book the powers are much more balanced, the relationship between sexes more egalitarian, as E. Bront seems to emphasize the need of the society to develop and move forward with necessary cohesion.Or at least this is the way I see this novel, much more a social work rather than simply a book about love, hate and revenge, and that's what makes it, in my opinion, one of the best of its time. But hey, every reader may see and interprete it his or her own way: I guess this too is the beauty of literature, as that of music and art in general."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I had to read this in my senior year of high school and found that I could NOT put it down. I would linger after class to talk to my teacher about it, and finally she told me I could keep the school's copy for my own use. She could tell how much I loved it! I practically have tears in my eyes when I reread the first few sentences. This is the saddest, and yet the most hopeful book I have ever read. It's so beautiful, and Bronte has taken cares to describe the human condition of loneliness she doubtlessly felt during her own lifetime. These are some of the most realistic characters in all of literature, and YOU WILL NOT REGRET PICKING UP THIS BOOK!!! I can't even fully describe how much I love this book. Honestly, it changed me. The story is unforgettable, and exquisitely profound. I urge you to open your heart and let this book move you too."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Before reading WH, I knew its reputation as a dark novel but was taken aback a bit by the grinding dreariness and cruelty of the story. Noone who has read Jane Eyre will confuse Emily with Charlotte. I had also heard it described as a tragedy but, while it certainly has its tragic elements, it lacks the defining element of a truly gripping tragic story--sympathetic characters. In short, WH seems to defy easy classification and I suppose that's an important part of its allure.While I found the first three chapters, which establish the odd and mysterious inhabitants of Wuthering Heights, to be a bit slow in gathering momentum, the remainder of the book heightened my interest as the narrative of past events unfolded. I disagree with some reviewers who found the prose to be overdone and difficult to read; I enjoyed the narrative style and diction and found myself immersed within the wild moors setting. The story itself is compelling and, if one can stifle the desire for a hero in shining armor to alleviate the persistent suffering found within the pages, the flawed characters are fascinating.Putting aside some very minor problems such as the plausibility of the detailed recollections of Nelly Dean which constituted the bulk of the narrative, my primary issue with the book is the ending. In particular, I found the Cathy/Hareton union to be a bit difficult to believe and, more importantly, the potential suspense and suprise around the death of Heathcliff to be an opportunity lost by the revelation of his passing before its description within the narrative flow.Taken as a whole, WH is a very enjoyable read and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I know that I will be tarred and feathered for denouncing the &quot;20th Century's favorite 19th Century novel&quot; but I have my reasons why as you shall see. Most of the novel rests entirely on Bronte's ability as a weaver of words, and not on her creation of characters. Bronte tried to imitate the passion of Lord Byron's characters and succeeded only marginally. Out of all the characters in Wuthering Heights only Heathcliff is strongly developed in the sense that although we may despise him at certain times, we always feel a sense of empathy, even compassion at times. For the character of Catherine Earnshaw/Linton one feels only contempt, with a thin veil of sorrow. It is the same feeling one has for Miss Havisham in Dickens Great Expectations. Catherine senior is a deceitful, destructive force who almost succeeds in passing on her vices and moral depravity onto her daughter. Unlike Dickens Great Expectations however, we see no reason in her madness, which is one of the failings of Bronte's novel. To most readers she is just a spoiled little rich girl who wants to have her cake and eat it too. This is never expounded on in any great length and Bronte, while not explicitly saying it, seems to condone it as a perfectly good reason to go to Edgar and not Heathcliff. It is at that point in the story that we have nothing but total contempt for Catherine senior and nothing else. But there are many morally bankrupt characters that populate great literature and they do not take away from the story, Dickens Miss Havisham and Estella, come up once again. The difference between Catherine senior and these characters is that Bronte's character is shown as a weak, whining woman with no clear direction either in her life or in the plot of the story. She is in short the airhead of the story. It is a very negative portrayal of women and I'm surprised that Bronte devoted so much time to this character. Her daughter Catherine junior is a much stronger character in every way, but here again is another downfall of the book. The characters of Catherine junior and Hareton Earnshaw are cast out of the spotlight in favor of concentrating on Catherine seniors whining. These characters, along with those like Nelly Dean and Lockwood have far less substance than they should. Bronte should have devoted more time to Catherine and Hareton than she did. Overall, I think that Heathcliff saved the story from bombing terribly, and Bronte's prose also contributes to the beauty of the book, but she was no Lord Byron. Bronte simply did not understand plot and character well enough to make this the novel it could have been, which is a terrible shame. Although some people indict this book as just being a 19th Century soap opera, its fault rests not in the plot being too unrealistic and trite, it rests on the fault that the reader only gets to know a few characters really well, and of those characters only Heathcliff is given the attention he deserves."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Charlotte Bronte is a great writer. I read Jane Eyre twice and comprehended every word, every nuance. Wuthering Heights was another matter. So much of it was obtuse. Just a little while ago, I read a very helpful review here by an English teacher no less, who said he had trouble comprehending the story the first time around, but he has read it again and this time it was a completely different and positive experience for him. I certainly have benefited from this particular review because now I am going to read Wuthering Heights again with a different attitude. It is not easy reading; it is a deep book. You have to concentrate, but I know I can do it, and I am going to do it! Even though I saw the movie before I read the book (I thought the movie starring Merle Oberon and Lawrence Olivier was outstanding), parts of the book were still obtuse. If I hadn't seen the movie, I suppose the book would have been a total imposssibility. I don't mean to seem so negative about Wuthering Heights, but I have never in my life read a book where I had to concentrate so much; it took the pleasure out of reading it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Enjoying a great novel sometimes requires a willingness to accept confusion, at least initially. Many readers who have trouble appreciating &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; are put off by the work's first 50 pages. The novel begins with a focus on a fastidious hypochnodriac who is not actually the main character and who never even has a first name: Mr. Lockwood, a tidy little man who enjoys observing love from a distance but is terrified by its proximity. He has no idea what's in store for him. Urged by his doctor to rest his over-wrought nerves, Mr. Lockwood rents a beautful manor in the apparently idyllic Yorkshire moors of northeast England, a decision he will soon both deeply regret and enjoy. In the novel's opening pages, Bronte successfully integrates Mr. Lockwood's mistaken conclusions with the reader's: 1)Mr. Heathcliff must be a gentleman [He isn't]; (2)The young lady by the hearth must be Heathcliff's wife or perhaps that of the coarse young man who also lives there [She's neither; she's actually a widow, and the coarse young man should be the house's master]; and (3)Catherine Earnshaw is a spectral demon with the power to return to earth in order to continue terrorizing those whom she once loved [Maybe she is; maybe it's only a dream], and so on. All of these errors in judgment are completely understandable, and during the course of the novel they are all satisfactorily explained. But initially, the situation Mr. Lockwood, as well as the reader, encounters is very, very confusing. Mr. Lockwood gets nearly everything wrong, and to a reader accustomed to lucid foreshadowing, Lockwood's mistakes are perplexing. What IS going on in this strange, strange house? Confusing the reader, however, is actually part of Bronte's strategy to transport Lockwood, and the reader as well, to a world of pure imagination, a realm of stormy passion where all thoughts are expressed in poetic speech (regardless of the damage they may cause), a world where one character is another character as well (&quot;Nelly, I am Heathcliff&quot;)--in short, a world that would be utterly abhorrent to the reader's rational faculties but proves irresistibly attractive to his emotional and aesthetic dimensions. So the novel's first few pages deliberately disorient the reader, encouraging him to abandon an everyday world where the apparent equals the reality, where most sane people restrain themselves, spending most of their days and nights in balanced, rational pursuits. Bronte's novel, restricted geographically to the Heights and the Grange, is a buttonhole in reality, through which the reader slips without fully realizing it from a more or less rational environment into a world where ghosts are not entirely unexpected, lovers dig up the corpse of their beloved, drunken louts drop their babies from stair landings, middle-aged men repeatedly curse--even brutally batter--younger women, and lovers punish each other to prove the depth of their love. &quot;Toto, we're not in Kansas anymore!&quot; Bronte's world would disintegrate if it were evaluated by generally accepted rational, moral precepts. Bronte instinctively realizes this fact and, within a matrix of purposeful confusion, seductively transports the reader from an everyday world of clearly articulated right and wrong where love is primarily a dalliance into one where love consumes entirely, lasts well beyond mere physical death, and is not the least bit concerned with traditional concepts of right or wrong, appropriate or inappropriate, acceptable or unacceptable. With meticulous attention to specific details and complex time frames, Bronte ultimately explains away all of Mr. Lockwood's and the reader's initial misunderstandings. If the reader--allowing for some intentional confusion in the novel's opening pages--continues reading, he will be rewarded by Bronte's ability to transport him into an utterly fascinating but repulsive, familiar but impossible world that is the essence of imaginative literature. Bronte's novel--populated by comic and tragic characters, set in beautiful but deadly landscapes, focused on restrained civility juxtaposed with passionate intensity--undoubtedly deserves its rank among the world's greatest romances and imaginative literary creations."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Emily Bronte is not as well-known as her sister Charlotte who wrote Jane Eyre, that, it must be said, far surpasses Wuthering Heights. I'd like to think that every book has a good, universal element we can relate to. And they do. Wuthering Heights is a story of revenge, passion and metaphysical love. It is a Gothic novel set appropriately in the bleakness of the Moors in England. Emily Bronte brings out a gorgeous narrative. It is confusing because it has the points of views quickly shifting from one personage to another. Nelly tells it for the most part. But the love story is incredible. Heathcliff and Catherine, as selfish and cold characters that they are, share a love that binds them even when they are apart in life and in death. It can be romantic. But the reason they teach this in school is because of the scholarly attention it receives, being a Bronte product. I think Jane Eyre may be of higher calibre but Wuthering Heights has its brilliant moments. It is a classic. I say it has many colors because we can be disgusted by the course actions of Heatchliff as he orchestrates his revenge on the people around him. We can also dislike the snobbish personality of Catherine and her choosing money over true love. But we can also sympathize for the lovers as human beings. This is a drama that can take place anywhere on earth. It is human drama. Bronte is as much in the same line as other universal writers including Dante and Shakespeare. Yes, Emily should be proud of her masterpiece. At times boring but worth reading on your own. I highly recommend this great work. Try to see beyond the boring parts and into the love and universalities !"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I just finished reading this book like ten minutes ago. This was one of the strangest novels I have ever encountered. At times I dislike it, at other times I was compeletely captivated by it, and now that I'm through with it, I am utterly haunted. There are more detailed reviews on this site about Wuthering Heights but I'll go into what I liked and didn't like and you'll forgive me if the story description that I give isn't 100 percent up to par with everything that happens because frankly alot of stuff occurred and it would be impossible to fit it all here. Catherine and Heathcliff are two people destined to be together as they have been inseperable since they were children and Heathcliff was adopted by her father Mr. Earnshaw. But as they grow older, people try to keep the two apart. The neighbors, the Lintons, have a son named Edgar who Catherine becomes friends with also and this will bring trouble in the future. Also, Catherine's brother Hindley hates Heathcliff because his father doted on him. This will bring more trouble. And finally, once they are fully grown, Heathcliff overhears a part of something Catherine says about how it would be degrading to marry him. Intensely hurt, he leaves for years and years before he can hear her proclaim how much she loves him with a passionate love if ever there were one. She marries the Linton boy Edgar and Heathcliff returns. A tragedy occurs and he uses every fiber of his being trying to get even. To say more would be major spoilers I think, so I'll leave it at that. Now to the good and bad. The narrative is told by both Catherine's nanny and by this other guy who came to rent a room from Heathcliff and sometimes I had trouble telling who was speaking. Also, I felt that it could've been cut shorter in some places with the dialogue, but these are minor problems really. So what's good about this novel? CATHERINE AND HEATHCLIFF. These two deserve to be together and you can feel that whenever they are in one another's presence. I have never read a novel that made me feel so strongly for two characters. Many times I became physically ANGRY that things were happening to drive them apart. Never has this happened. I found myself silently seething about some of this stuff. You really have to read it to fully understand what I'm talking about but so much happens against Heathcliff and the entire world is stacked against him and then Catherine goes and marries Linton. I felt betrayed by that, by a CHARACTER IN A NOVEL. Then later on when there is no longer any hope for the couple to be together at all, I felt such anguish for Heathcliff. It was a real anguish that he was being denied, even as he did despicable deeds to exact revenge. And I'm a guy, not some 16 year old girl. Another thing that was great was how Emily Bronte crafted her characters. Each and every one of them at some time or another does something shameful or mean or just plain evil. But I always understood their motivation and could not hate them for what they did. I felt compassion for some of them as if they were actual flesh and blood. Lord have mercy, why couldn't they just be together? There is something about this book. It is filled with such anguish, such unrequitted love, that it lingers and stays with you. It is the saddest book I have ever read and it will stay with me for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"The book is mainly narrated by Mr. Lockwood and Ellen Dean.Mr. Lockwood is renting Thrushcross Grange near Wuthering Heights. A man named Heathcliff is his mysterious and rude landlord. Lockwood asks the housekeeper, Ellen Dean, to tell him the story of Wuthering Heights and its inhabitants.She goes on to tell him the story of Heathcliff and Catherine and Wuthering Heights. The first part of her story is of how Heathcliff came to live at the Heights, the seond half of the story is about how Heathcliff takes his revenge as an adult.It's the depth of love that I really like in the book, that timeless love that Heathcliff and Catherine possess. The woman is dead for God's sake, and Heathcliff continues to love her and she haunts the Heights unwilling to leave her soulmate behind. That's what I call true, enduring love. Catherine and Heathcliff's love affair affects everyone they come in contact with. There's no escaping it.Bront creates these imperfect and passionate characters, some of whom are borderline evil. I love the drama within the story, the setting of the dark and stormy Yorkshire moors sets the mood just right. This is a story about love, revenge, family and grief. It's a classic gothic love story that is not soon forgotten. Thank you Emily Bront for creating one of my favorite anti-heroes in literature, Heathcliff."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"But it's not a love story...

I loved every page but I am completely at a loss as to why Heathcliff is so adored. He isn't a romantic figure especially not in the latter half of the book and Cathy is so selfish and spoilt that they can't be together.Brilliant examination of passion gone wrong but not a romantic novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This classic of English literature has certainly stood the test of time. From the commencement of the novel with moody images to its likewise saturnine conclusion, Bronte's work with tone and characterization sets the bar high for authors of all kinds. The raging zealousness of love that so possess Heathcliff and Catherine melts off the pages in molten waves - truly, has a romance so deluded and inherently doomed ever been described so well? The passions of Romeo and Juliet seem lame in comparison. But never have protagonists been so unlikable. It is hard to sympathize with either one of them, which is the major disappointment of the novel. It is with relief, then, that the romance between young Catherine and Hareton is established. Innocent and true without the sadness that is a trademark of Heathcliff's obsession, the reader begins to glimpse the true meaning of love. The book is intensely readable and page-turning, accessible and unique. The bulk of Wuthering Heights is a psychological exploration of what the past does to a person - it does not so much examine a passionate affair than it does the consequences of actions undertaken by the abused and misguided. Surely Bronte's masterpiece of the human soul will linger as long as Heathcliff's intensity for his lost idol."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"The outdated writing style takes a little getting used to, but once you do, it's good. It's incredible to me how the author, with her unusually limited experience of the outside world, who probably never had a boyfriend or lover in her life and lived a secluded life in a remote part of Yorkshire with her sisters and died a virgin, could have created such an incredibly realistic and well-drawn character like Heathcliffe. I love the fact that he's flawed and I love the chemistry between him and Jenny. It's just amazing to me that so much passion could lurk in the heart of such an isolated and inexperienced soul as Emily Bronte. I don't suppose she and Charlotte got any real romance or sex as governesses. Emily's poems are full of originality and vision, but it is her novel that's a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Told in alternating flashbacks from the perspectives of two narrators, Wuthering Heights is the gothic love story of Catherine and Heathcliff.

As the noted critic A. C. Swinburne said in 1883: \\"It may be true that not many will ever take it to their hearts: it is certain that those who do like it will like nothing very much better in the whole world of poetry or prose\\".So it has been for more than a century. Nobody should miss this strangest and strongest of English novels, so hauntingly beautiful and intensely poetical in its dark and eerie otherness. By the way, don't miss Emily Bront's poems, or a good selection of them.The issue now, is this PARTICULAR paperback edition (Wordsworth Classics, 2000). What do we get and what not, how does it compare to the other editions in the marketplace.To begim with, it's ONE OF THE THINNEST EDITIONS EVER, light on your pocket and cheap as airborne luggage (6/8 inch vs., say, one full inch for Penguin Classics edition). The mass-market paperback, is as bad as you fear, and then some... for its paper quality and binding. A bit surprisingly, printing quality is good enough. The Introduction (18 pp) by John S. Whitley is not bad, perhaps one bit askew for the intended readership (I don't feel myself at ease with those Freudian interpretations). The Bibliography is good and so is the annotation at the end of the book, three pages in small type that aren't user-friendly, specially in the handling of the dialect tirades.So, it looks like a good edition, were it not for the outrageous material production; but then, Penguin's and Oxford's aren't so much better as paper quality and binding go, although their type is easier on the eyes and the printing quality a little better. And, mind, when I speak of bad quality paper, it's a matter of Penguin browned pages in only five years, and Oxford's little better behaving of slightlier browned pages in ten years. Wordsworth Classics pages haven't got brown so far but they sure will do (when you make paper out of whole timber logs, it always happens).The worst thing, by far, is the text itself. It's a careful and accurate 1850-type text, that follows that of the by then very distinguished Haworth Edition (1900), the same text used by Barnes&Noble; Classics noteworthy hardcover edition. Of course, there are texts far worse than that, namely Modern Library, Chatham River andTime-Warner ones, not to mention Gutenberg Project's most corrupted electronic text.As you probably know, the 1850 text was edited, or more precisely, in all good will tampered-with, by Charlotte Bront (who didn't like her sister's novel at all). The changes in the text from the 1847 edition were pervasive, and detrimental: there were some hundred of small stylistical or grammatical \\"improvements\\", now as useless as then; a toned-down, sweetened version of York dialect paragraphs that looks decidedly funny and almost as hard to understand; the punctuation was brought in line with Victorian practice (which isn't ours, anyway): professional, light and discrete, syntactical in concept, instead of Emily's rather inconsistent usage, rethorical in concept, as 18th century's prose and specially poetry had been. Even WORSE was the urgent need to save printing space at all costs, which resulted in the disparition of more than 600 paragraph beginnings (I mean just the paragraphing, not the paragraph contents!). Overall, it makes for a worse and distorted reading experience. Many of us (I don't know HOW many) think 1850 is a no-go textform, and would like to see it no more in the intricate textual history of this work.TO SUMMARIZE: I recommend strongly NOT to buy this edition, in spite of its real merits. And then what?If durability is not a must and budget is tight, go for either Penguin's Classics (Pauline Nestor) or Oxford's World Classics (Patsy Stoneman).If durability is a must, and budget is not so tight, then go for one of the best context-oriented, \\"study\\" editions: Broadview Press (Beth Newman),Longman Cultural (Alison Booth) or Norton Critical (Fourth Edition) (Dunn).If what you are after is a nice hardcover edition, the options are greatly reduced:you may try Barnes&Noble;, with the selfsame ignoble text as Wordsworth Edition, or go for a good copy of the 1978 Franklin Mint edition, the one with the Alan Reingold lithographs, with a very good 1847 text and no Introduction or annotation other than Charlotte Bront Preface (NOT to be read BEFORE the novel) and full and right glosses as footnotes for the dialectal tirades (the first edition to do so, as far as I know)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This purely wonderful novel is indisputably a classic, with many wonderfully unique and complex characters that are, at the same time, very hard and very easy to relate to.

I didn't enjoy this book at all, and to be honest, I don't really understand why it has been referred to as a &quot;classic&quot; when it has, at best, a flimsy plot and several of the characters are little more than one-dimensional stereotypes, not unlike characters in a modern-day soap opera.I'll admit, it does have it's strong points at times, such as the profound symbolism used throughout the book and the imaginative descriptions of moments such as Mr. Lockwoods dream about the late Catherine, but personally, I found it to be overly melodramatic, and at times, tedious.

Yet, we must read it if we are in an English Literature survey course.It is ponderous going... a classic of dreary proportions, encumbered by a depressing plot, set in dismal surroundings and peopled by dysfunctional characters.However, many other readers, many teachers and professors, many literature critics, genuinely love this book.- Perhaps it appeals to their current mood, or it speaks to having shared, in some way, the experience of one or another of the characters?- Perhaps they have loved long and deeply and found their love unfulfilled? Then Heathcliff speaks to their hearts.- Perhaps they have moved beyond a deeply felt love, for reasons that they cannot fully express or understand, all the while, still keeping deep in some hidden recess of their psyche, that love that will remain first or best or purest? We can see, then, why that reader might be drawn to identify with Cathy.A sad aspect of the book, however, is that it seems so hopeless, so dark, so fatalistic, so depressing. An over identification with these characters might have an adverse effect on a susceptible reader.The reality is, if you are more or less happy in who you are and who the other beloved people in your life may be, then you will probably find very few connecting points with these benighted main characters. If so, I will offer you this hint......Watch the DVD of Larry Olivier and Merle Oberon, dear student, before you read. They play fast and loose with the plot, so you still have to read the book to ace your test or write your essay. But at least you will have some visual hints of beauty to keep in mind as you labor with this challenging novel.If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"When my English teacher assigned this piece of Gothic literature instead of the prescribed novel \\"Frankenstein,\\" my curiosity was piqued. Though I had questioned her taste in literature throughout the year, I felt that this novel would be her redeeming point, the thing that would bring her class together.I couldn't have been more mistaken.Wuthering Heights is the story of a man who rents a small mansion from another man, and decides to pay his landlord a visit. Or so it seems. What the novel truly is can only be decribed as a farce on human emotion. It follows the passionate, and often violent, semi-romance between Catherine Earnshaw and her adopted brother Heathcliff. Bronte's poetic language eased the physical reading of the novel, but shrouded the actual plot in deeper mystery and chaos than it had managed to do itself.A novel filled with one amazing plot twist is intriguing; one with several shockers is unexpected. Wuthering Heights, however, conatins more curves and unexpected turns than a New Orleans back-road. This would keep the reader alert and willing to continue . . . if the characters were not blatantly predictible, and completely imhuman. The love-struck heroine/antagonist Catherine Earnshaw declares at one point that \\"Nelly, I am Heathcliff!\\" While intended to be a moving statement, modern psychology student would be more likely to call it stage one acute paranoia. Indeed, this particular educational slave had to struggle through only six chapters of poorly created characters, morose settings, and a plot that seemed more thrown-together than created, before literally guessing his/her way to passing every exam.Back to Ms. Bronte's plot devices. This novel is almost like watching a child play with dolls while talking aloud. Listen to your young daughters; \\"Suzie came home, and did this.\\" A thoughtful pause will follow, and then something else will hapen to Suzie. Then something else. Whatever comes to mind will happen, regardless of whether it makes good storytelling or not. The novel takes the same approach, with a plotline that could only be deemed a line in Lovecraftian geometry.All in all, Wuthering Heights demonstrates fluid and powerful use of the English language . . . but isn't that the purpose of poetry? With predictably unpredictable characters, stale settings, and a plotline that almost refuses to exist, Wuthering Heights could be summed up only in the words of another English teacher: \\"It's General Hospital with an English accent! She's making you read that!?\\""},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Good book... Heathcliff is an immensly passionate character with incredible animalistic qualities.

I hated the story and mostly I really hated the characters. I wanted every one of them to die and wished they had done so sooner. And, honestly, I don't think it's very good writing.The main characters, Heathcliff and Catherine, are impossible to like. Heathcliff is cruel and vindictive, and Cathy is petty and weak. They are both so selfish that it's hard to believe that they're even capable of loving, and it's impossible to want them to be happy. This takes the angst, tension, and hope out of reading their story, and there's nothing to replace those key aspects of reading a novel like this but disgust. Most of the secondary characters are equally unlikeable or at least unsympathetic, so there's no one a reader can identify with in the real story. It's hard to believe that so many people's lives could be ruined so dramatically and irrevocably, which makes the book seem pathetically melodramatic and more than a bit ridiculous. It's unrealistic but not at all fantasy, it's tragedy with no one to feel sorry for and romance with no one to love, it's gossip that no one wants to hear. Furthermore, while reading this I was disturbed and surprised to find grammatical errors!I expected to love this book, and really wanted to, because Emily Bronte's fantasy world from her youthful writing really appeals to me and I wanted her to become a favorite author of mine. But this is just awful."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"The Bronte sisters were extremely remarkable women. They have left a literary place in history. Charlotte Bronte was the most popular one; she wrote Jane Eyre, one of the most popular fiction novels in history. But there is definitely room for Emily Bronte. Wuthering Heights, Emily's only novel is -- without a doubt -- the work of a genius. The tragic love story of Catherine and Heathcliff is one of the most memorable ones I have ever read. Also, I love the backdrop of the story. The story took place on the untamed Yorkshire moors in England. It symbolizes their wild love -- or more specifically, Heathcliff's wild ways. I love a story with symbolism. It saddens me to know that this is the only novel of Emily Bronte. She would have written other books if she hadn't died the way she did. I am consoled with the fact that she has left us this incredible book, a book that will be treasured forever."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This edition is the first i have ever read, im sure there are better ones out there.

It was a little hard to understand the text as im not used to way things were written back then, but overall it was a very good read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I stumbled upon a song called Wuthering Heights a month or so ago. It's an eerie, etheral composition speaking through the voice of Cathy to Heathcliff. The first time I listened to the song I thought the singer, Kate Bush, was speaking a bizarre and foreign language. I cannot say I enjoyed the song initially, but I admired how the singer had crafted such a haunting, vivid, and singular melody. You should listen to it--I must warn you that you may dislike it.I read the novel, Wuthering Heights, years ago in middle school and have forgotten most of the story. The song piqued my interest in the novel, and I began reading it yesterday. It has been described as, perhaps, one of the most original novels in the English language. Its wild and untamed story, written on the windswept canvas of the moors of northern England, is written in an excited and lyrical manner. Heathcliff and Cathy are so vivid in the imagination of the author they they violently spring to life in the conciousness of the reader--at least that has been my experience. I wonder if I will ever experince such overwhelming passion, though I guess it's well that I haven't, as it borders on the psychotic. Even the fundamental boundaries of one's own being are broken down in the cyclonic relationship of Heathcliff and Cathy.It has been a long while since I read any fiction, and I am truly enjoying this fine example."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Bronte's Wuthering Heights is a haunting story of love and hate, where human emotions and passions are presented through a range of excellently developed characters. The story is taut, the narrative is engrossing, and the novel has all the drama to make excellent movies. The novel is an underrated study of human psychology, of love, of jealously, contempt, revenge and of character and how it transforms through time and relationships. People call it the greatest novel of unrequited love; it definitely potrays love, hatred and melancholy in the same vein. Perhaps Heathcliff, who loves and hates with all the harshness of his character, leaves a lasting impact on reader's fancy, to make a memory of this novel as one about only hatred and unrequited love. Read it to discover the passions that makes this Bronte novel a classic."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"The movie American Beauty reminds me of this book. Both pull off the near impossible task of presenting the reader (or viewer) with horrible nasty people and then at the last moment making us see them as simply angry human beings fully capable of redemption and understanding, even if its too late to do anything with their lives.The book starts out with one of foppiest of English fops touring the Manor with a utter contempt for these people and their ways. The stories that he hears from the servants only confirm his view, but they are intriguing. No one tells what they want to tell and there are times when you want to strangle the servants telling the stories (especially the one that PURPOSELY hid a note that would have eased some of the tensions because she didn't feel that it would be right. How many interfering old bitties like this are in the world? Probably more in the Victorian era.)The love between Heathcliff and Catherine might have worked out in different circumstances, if Heathcliff had not been the hated adopted gypsy child, if Catherine's brother hadn't been an idiot drunk, if Catherine hadn't been pledged to marry the idiot next door. Of course, then it wouldn't have been such an intriguing novel. Heathcliff comes back the conquering hero to find that Catherine is married and her idiot brother is still a drunk and he can't have her so he plays dangerous games with people's hearts and gears everything to his twisted revenge. Included in his schemes are the marrying of Catherine's sister-in-law and the corrupting of Catherine's nephew (the son of the drunken idiot).It's pretty rough going and you want to like Heathcliff at least more than the rest of the people in this book, but he gives you no room to excuse his actions. He's just horrible. Then like Kevin Spacey at the end of American Beauty, he reveals himself and comes to a point of self-reflection and repentence that fulfils the hope you had for him at the beginning of the book. It's very rare that this happens and its believable, but in this case it's very believable."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Emily Bronte was well ahead of her time in writing this incredible love story. The plot was very complex, yet the intricacies of revolving a story within a story within another story never created an error. The author wrote on some very specific issues of the day and one would need to formally investigate the book in order to find any mistakes. This is a story by Mr. Lockwood who really comes in at the end of the story. He meets his new landlord Heathcliff and is able to discern some very strange happenings at Wuthering Heights. His servant, Nellie Dean, narrates most of the story as she lived it. She and Joseph are the only people to live through the three generations and the only one able to recount first hand knowledge. This is a love story, ghost story, and story of oppression all in one. Emily Bronte was able to describe the ill-effects of English property law in the 19th Century. Primogeniture--the law of inheritance, where only the eldest male child could inherit family estates without a contrary will, often could result in the younger siblings being turned into mere servants. This is how Hindley came to own Wuthering Heights and why he was able to ruin Heathcliff. There is much effort from various forces to keep Heathcliff and Catherine seperate. There is also much symbolism regarding various images such as locks that represent keeping people prisoner, or of dogs that demonstrate the character of their owners. Much forshadowing is accomplished with great sophistication. This was written from a &quot;Realist&quot; perspective and yet there are elements of &quot;Post Modernism&quot; included as in the case of ghosts and supernatural happenigs. One might question whether or not Emily Bronte Believed in the Supernatural and considered it as real and natural, which would then relate it back to Realism. There are many twists and turns and the symmetry is flawless. We have two seperate parents who are neighbors. Each have an elder boy and a younger girl. Heathcliff is a foundling who is regarded as a &quot;gypsy&quot; (possibly a slave child or illegitimate child of Mr. Earnshaw), The son of the Lintons (Edgar),marries the daughter of the Earnshaws (Catherine), and they have a girl named Catherine. Hindley, the son of the Earnshaws marries outside of the family and produces a son, Hareton. This helps to keep the incest down a bit. Heathcliff who was raised in the Earnshaw home marries the daughter of the Lintons (Isabella) and they have a child Linton Heathcliff. This child ends up marrying the younger Catherine and when Linton dies, Catherine marries Hareton. So in effect she has married two first cousins. The characters grow up in a very oppressive atmosphere. The servants are actually treated better than the children who are often whipped or starved. This is &quot;Gothic&quot; like in the dark, dreariness that seems to envelope the families and the frequent use of punishment. Even the environment is unfriendly often times. The moors are dangerous and the weather is often rainy or cold and snowy. It is a sad story with the only hope coming in the end when Hareton and Catherine marry and reclaim rightful ownership of Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange, which had been taken from them by Heathcliff."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I am repelled by the absurd peregrinations of Bronte's spiteful, petty-spirited, self-absorbed characters. The character of Heathcliff is that of a nightmarish beast, and Catherine isn't much better. And yet Emily Bronte wants us to LIKE these people. I read this book at the same time as OTHELLO, and to be honest I found my self liking even Iago better than these shallow fools -- at least Iago probably deserved to be a lieutenant! If this is a classic, then so's the phone book. It's ludicrous, witless, and excessively overwritten to boot. At one point, the reader of WUTHERING HEIGHTS will realize that there have been five (or so) mawkish death scenes, some fights and scuffles, and countless effusions of absurd and overblown emotion. And yet one is less than halfway through the book, and Bronte's still wuthering along as if the reader were yet awake. Again, I must compare it to OTHELLO, and find that in all respects it comes up short -- Othello even has better Moors. It's not a classic -- it's a really old British romance novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is an incredibly hard to read book since it is written in old-English.

I have just a few seconds ago finished this book and I am completely speechless...but not with admiration.Yes,PERHAPS Emily Bronte might have written this well but EVERY other aspect of this books is extremely flawed. Good literature it may be to some but good characters, morals, story it is most certainly not. I completely 100% agree with a reviewer who wrote that she hated Heathcliff being described as some alpha male. Reader, believe me, he is the farthest thing from it. How can all these people talk about WH as being a love story? Some call it Powerful Love, Passionate Love, Strongest Love that Could Ever Exist, etc etc. Believe me when I say Heathcliff has ABSOLUTELY NO LOVE for Catherine. Nor she for him. All of it is just a matter of obsession. Their \\"attachment\\" to each other is purely selfish. This book has not ONE admirable character in it. All are either foolish or wicked. Heathcliff is nothing good and honest but obsession, jealousy, cruelty, baseness, dishonesty, and selfishness are the elements of his character as well as Catherine's I might add. Perhaps if Emily Bronte would have brought out all the folly of the characters and spoken of their error it would have had some merit. But the book starts off in bad and till the end no one grows or improves their moral characters. If the wickedness of a person can only be erased by extinguishing the the person himself what moral is there to be learned at all? I had not the slightest big of emotion except relief when I finished this. When I read a book I feel so engrossed in it, almost as if I know every character and am part of their world. HA!

Examining it from a technical point of view, the narration is stilted and poor, the characters are flat, the writing is childish, and it's much too bloated. The entire story could have been summed up into about forty pages or less, and I think it would have been more \\"passionate\\" and surely much more believable if Emily Bront had written the book in third person, not first person.Mr. Lockwood begins narrating the story, which is perfectly fine. I'd thought it would be a normal first-person narrative, until I discovered that the true narrator is Nelly Dean. In everyday speech, or even in telling a lengthy story (as Nelly is), no one actually speaks like they're writing a book (\\"'Yes,' she said, looking at me.\\"). People speak like, well, people. They stammer and stumble and interrupt themselves, especially when they're trying to narrate a story. Now, this sort of stilted narration is tolerable for a certain period of time--- the real issue I have with this book is that each and every character has the same style of speech. Each of these flat, poorly developed characters speak and narrate in the exact same way--- except for Joseph and the other uneducated characters, whose rare bouts of dialogue are generally incomprehensible.Heathcliff is supposedly the main character, but he is anything but a hero...although I do admit he is the most human. That doesn't say much, however. I really can't imagine any of the characters being portrayed as heroes. And the ancillary 'narrator,' Mr. Lockwood, is nothing but a stand-in for Nelly Dean. Of all the characters, he is the flattest, and he seems to have very little purpose in the story.To top all that off, the story isn't nearly as \\"amazing\\" as it's made out to be. It is advertised as revealing some of the \\"terrible truths about men and women,\\" but the characters are so unrealistic and childish that I can't even think of them as being true men and women. 95% of them fail to act their ages, by the way. The book is about thwarted love, yes, I understand. But the passion is just as believable as the characters are, and there is a disturbing lack of justice in the story. The whole book screams, \\"Who cares?!\\"Overall, I don't recommend Wuthering Heights to anyone, even though it is hailed (for whatever reason) as being a work of searing beauty and one of the most wonderful classics today. It is one of the worst books I have ever read, technically and metaphorically and creatively speaking. But who knows--- you may enjoy it.[EDIT: This review expresses my opinion about this book...my opinion only, and nothing more. I don't think it's mature for people to make illogical judgments (for instance, \\"people who thought Wuthering Heights was badly written aren't such great writers themselves\\") about others simply because they do not agree with them about a book. Everyone is entitled his/her own opinion, and therefore, no opinion is right or wrong.]"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Letters formed, words flowed, as Emily Bront moved the ink across the pages. In 1847, around the age of 28, Emily saw the culmination of her writing, Wuthering Heights, published. Emily also heard it bashed, criticized, and spoken of as worthless in her life time. As the year 1848 rolled around Emily perished from the earth. We do not Emily's personal opinion of her book when she died, but her sister, Charlotte Bront, around 1850, wrote an introduction to Wuthering Heights. It was then that the book burrowed its way into the hearts of society. Since then some have admired Emily Bront's intricacy of characters and format of plot, while others still hold to the idea that the book is morbid.Set in 1801, the story travels back in time to the beginning of Heathcliffs entrance into Wuthering Heights, it then once more progresses, ending in 1802. Emily Bront's novel, Wuthering Heights, weaves the lives of Catharine Earnshaw and Heathcliff. Mrs. Nelly Dean, for the bulk of the novel, is relating their lives to Mr. Lockwood, a new tenant at Thrushcross Grange (which is owned by Heathcliff, who lives at Wuthering Heights when Mr. Lockwood arrives). Intertwined with other impressionable characters Catharine and Heathcliff's lives are poured out. Catharine, a stubborn, saucy, selfish girl, grows up with her parents, her brother Hindly, and Heathcliff - a young starving gypsy boy brought home to Wuthering Heights by Mr. Earnshaw to live with the family. Mistreated and degraded by Hindly and scorned throughout life by all, save Mr. Earnshaw and for the most part Catharine, Heathcliff grows bitter and vengeful. As time progresses and Heathcliff's bitterness thickens his love, his life, his Catharine, dies. She dies married to another man and giving her last breath baring her husbands child. All that Heathcliff then feels is left, is to live sadistically and desperately grieved among the ashes of his life.Wuthering Heights depicts love, loss, hurt, dread, selfishness, brutality, vengeance, and in a strange way a restoration of peace. As one reads the tale, one is aghast at the behavior of the characters' and nauseated by the plot. Yet, one is intrigued by the intricately woven details and structure of the novel.The novels strength is its style; personable characters that are intermingled with larger then life characters; and its tangible setting on the moors of England laced with a supernatural essence. Emily Bront captures the Romanticism ideation of the 19th century in such a way that one gets pulled into the era, into the lives of those at Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange.Regardless of the well written tale and excellent method of describing the mind set of those in the 19th century, having this idea of the supernatural intermingled with the real; the novels weakness is loud spoken. The characters of the novel are insufferable, and the plot dark and selfish. Leaving one sick to the stomach and ones mind plagued by terrible images after reading certain portions.Through the strengths and weaknesses of the novel a lesson is brought forth. If one lets selfish ambition and revenge rule their lives, they shall live a sad desperate life among ashes. Instead of a pleasant life, by forgiving and moving towards reconciliation and freedom from the chains of abuse. It teaches that each person has a choice; to do good and bring happiness to themselves and others, or to do evil and bring pain and suffering upon themselves and others. Though the novel in totality impresses this upon its readers and concludes this in the end, I feel there are other ways of learning this lesson.I can not recommend the book; for although the conclusion brings about a lesson reaching that lesson is inner torture. I was excited to read Wuthering Heights for the title intrigues. Now that I have finished the novel I am even more excited to let it alone, to let it die among the ashes.I rate this book with one star because it is well written, not for its content."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"These books should still be required reading. HOW AWESOME and timeless.Thank you"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Emily Bronte sure knows how to write about destructive love! I thought both Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff the stupidest people ever! I could hardly understand Joseph's tongue...perhaps because my language is too polished:)Ok, maybe I'm being too harsh. Wuthering Heights really isn't that bad. I actually understood it (for a thirteen year old, you've gotta give me credit)It was written nicely as Ellen {Nellie} Dean for the orator of Heathcliff's complete past. Catherine is pretty stupid though. And Heathcliff stupider for not trying to convince her to marry him BEFORE she married Linton. But I felt pretty sorry for Heathcliff when he called for Catherine the night that Lockwood spent the night. My favorite character was Hareton because i loved his speech! It was funny when almost every time he spoke, he sweared. I have to say that I hated Linton for being such a weakling, even though he could hardly help it. Despite Heathcliff's trickery with Isabel and hatred for Cathy, I couldn't help liking him a teeny bit, because he's just so unique! I really wanted Hareton and Cathy to make the match, and i positively despised Heathcliff and Linton for making him look so stupid. And i just loved Hareton's &quot;thundercloud&quot; face! Go ahead and read Wuthering Heights. You'll probably both hate and love it. It was a rather exciting and tiresome novel.

This story reflects a clear vision of how ill-fated love affairs can have a disturbing affect on the soul of a person. This is a common scenario to many stories. A person will feel completely alone in the world, yet there will be that one connection with a person who rests the same level as that person. Their thoughts will become intertwined to the extent that one will not be able to disconnect, mentally, from the other. In point, that one person will not allow themselves to be detached from that destined soul-mate. However, the other person in the relationship will realize the seriousness of possible feelings and so escapes to another love. This tail is common.Heathcliff, an individual faced with the crushing challenge of winning his love, Catherine, back.

This story reflects a clear vision of how ill-fated love affairs can have a disturbing affect on the soul of a person. This is a common scenario to many stories. A person will feel completely alone in the world, yet there will be that one connection with a person who rests the same level as that person. Their thoughts will become intertwined to the extent that one will not be able to disconnect, mentally, from the other. In point, that one person will not allow themselves to be detached from that destined soul-mate. However, the other person in the relationship will realize the seriousness of possible feelings and so escapes to another love. This tail is common.Heathcliff, an individual faced with the crushing challenge of winning his love, Catherine, back.

The reader finds him/herself loathing each and every one of them. The only non-loathsome character is the doctor, and he's minor to the extreme. Heathcliff is of course abominable. Edgar Linton is appallingly stupid. Hareton Earnshaw is animalistic, but at least he's got the excuse of Heathcliff's abuse. Catherine Linton (the elder) is absolutely disgusting, easily and by far the most evil character in the novel, surpassing even Heathcliff. Even Nelly Dean is a waste of humanity. If it were not for her constantly making a hash of her meddling, none of the tragedy would have occurred to such a great extent. Whether her meddling is malicious or just through sheer stupidity is immaterial; she remains an awful character.That said, the story is absolutely riveting. Emily Bronte's one substantive work is truly a masterpiece. Her descriptions of the moors are wonderfully evocative, but it is her characters who are her main triumph. Despite the sheer horridness or stupidity or weakness of her characters, she nevertheless makes each of them - and their motivations - utterly believable. Even Heathcliff's excesses are believable, and the elder Catherine's petty maliciousness is also totally in tune with the selfish nature she is depicted as having. The younger Catherine Linton's stupidity is easily accounted for by her protected childhood and Nelly's inexcusable lapses. Everyone has a perfectly plausible reason for doing what they do, given the natures given them by Bronte. Is it then their fault that their actions create such misery?The only flaw with this book is the ending. One character has triumped utterly, and then inexplicably collapses with hardly a struggle. Another character overcomes a strong antipathy to a further character and changes attitudes utterly. Unlike the rest of the novel, the motivation is not believable. It is inconceivable that such a complete adjustment could have happened in so short a time. Perhaps it is true that the novel has come full circle, but I can't help but think that its grip on the reader would be still the stronger if it left us with the vision of the horror which appeared to be the future for its well-deserving characters."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This book is a classic! It is strong drama that captures your attention. It is worth reading."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Who of us hasn't wanted revenge on someone else in our lifetime? That is Heathcliff's main goal in WUTHERING HEIGHTS. Despite his love for beloved Cathy, Heathcliff wants a desperate revenge upon her family. After all, it was her family who supposedly ruined his life.Personally, this was a book much closer to real life than would be preferred. The main goal of a book is to transport you into another time, place, or dimension--a life beyond your own. However, this classic by Emily Bronte manages to bring to mind one's own everyday troubles. The writing is technically superb, but the story could be better. However, after more than a century of being a noted classic, the opinion isn't likely to change."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I am another one of the huge group of students who had to read this book for a Literature class, but unlike many, I loved it! First I am going to say that I agree entirely with the review &quot;Not likeable, but likeable.&quot; I love the way the whole plot was set slightly hidden behind the characters' personalities and emotions.

I found the characters unbelievable and their behaviour utterly inconsistent.However, let us give Bronte her due: the book is marvellously structured, with the story told by Nelly Dean contained in the story told by the narrator. Moreover, through the character of down-to-Earth, jolly Nelly Dean, Bronte makes plausible a story that would never be believed otherwise.It's a pity she had to waste her talent as a writer on a such a pointless story, centered on an incoherent, cruel, mean character like Heathcliff.

Its author, Emily Bronte, led a reclusive and private life, much of which is revealed through the events and characters of the novel. I feel that it rightly belongs among the great novels of British Literature, due to the controversy and interest it caused upon its publication."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I had to read this book for my high school English class. Although I took the easy way out and read the &quot;Cliffs Notes&quot;, I found them absolutely enchanting. I later took time to read the book for myself. Bronte uses such magical words and compellingly tragic sentences to blend this book into a masterpiece of Victorian Literature. Through Heathcliff and Catherine she proves that hate, no matter how strong, will always be defeated by love in the end."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"The best the millennium has to offer as the greatest tale of star crossed lovers. Also includes my favorite literary character, the tortured, sardonic, passionate, dastardly, impossible-to-imitate Heathcliff. The relationship between him and Catherine, who is herself a pretty unusual tragic heroine in that she is a selfish, bitchy girl with little to redeem her, is one that still grabs my guts after reading it so many times. I can see people getting confused at the beginning with Mr Lockwood/Nelly/Mrs Heathcliff, all that, but come on everybody, are we all too lazy in the 20th century to read a page twice if we don't understand? You'll get to the good stuff."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"As a high school junior, i was skeptical of reading an old book by an even older writer. I thought that it would be as dry and bland as all the other books presented to me in class. What 15 year old would look at a book called &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and presume that inside it was every emotion and feeling that someone could ever experience? Now, as a senior, I have re-read it several times over. It has become a part of my permanent literary collection and a part of me. The words and emotions of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; have taken over my soul. As cruel and painful as some of the emotions of the book may be, I need them.

I was shocked by how dark and Gothic it was. I can't imagine what people must have thought when it was published. If I could pick two words to describe Wuthering Heights it would be \\"passionate\\" and \\"bizarre.\\" I've never read anything like it. I knew as I was reading it that I wasn't supposed to like Cathy. She has a passionate temper that was very unlikeable and yet I couldn't hate her. In fact, I related to her in a lot of strange ways. I kind of agree with Edward Cullen's assessment of the book that it's not a love story but a hate story. The ending was what made me like this book. A lot of the characters are run madly by their passions and I thought for sure the ending would be nothing but a disaster. I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong. If Eclipse has made you curious as to what happens in this book, give it a try. You might actually like it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Re-reading this novel after 20 years I am still struck by its primal power, as if it erupted from the depths of Emily Bronte's soul and devoured its creator in its wake. This is the anti-Jane Austen novel. It is even the anti-Charlotte Bronte novel. Charlotte flirts with the darkness while Emily jumps into its chasm. The bond between Cathy and Heathcliff is forged in Earth, Heaven and Hell and cannot be sundered by all the efforts of humans or their institutions.Although never stated in the novel, the implication that Heathcliff is a bastard son of Mr. Earnshaw and, therefore, Cathy's half-brother has been hinted at more explicitly in at least one film adaptation of the novel. Even if such a thought entered Emily Bronte's mind, she was straining the limits of decorum and literary taste even without another scandalous level of meaning. She wisely omitted such a possibility. The Heathcliff/Cathy bond is so powerful that it frightens even the family that first witnesses it. Heathcliff's obsession is akin to Ahab's for Moby-Dick, created just four years or so later. Love/Hate are merged into one emotion that transcends boundaries of Good and Evil and this force runs roughshod and heedlessly destroys all the victims that happen to stand in its way.Like her doomed heroine Cathy, Emily Bronte died at a very early age, within one year of the novel's publication. One wonders what kind of follow-up novel she might have written had she lived. Would she have reigned in the primal inspiration and tailored her creations to suit the prevailing customs of her society? It is futile to speculate. The early death of the creator is perfectly matched to the dooms of the creator's characters and the one-of-a-kind quality of this wild novel.Although the novel bears a sophistication and complexity of narrative structure, especially for a first time novelist, there are certain weaknesses. The dialect dialogue of Joseph is a hindrance and absurdly out of place alongside that of other characters who speak without so many apostrophes. Later schools of realism might cast aspersion on the florid language of relatively uneducated characters. The power shines through the weaknesses, however, and this is a unique novel. There are echoes of it in later novels but few, if any, other contemporary novels exhibited such boldness of subject and structure."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights may be my all-time favorite novel. Heathcliff and Cathy's relationship resists - or defies? - categorization. It's as elemental and everlasting as the moors themselves. Love isn't a sweet confection in this book and is the all the more appealing for that reason."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Love is very painful and it is full of lust, want, and the things that made you go standing up in the morning when your mother introduced you to your future husband. It is very French, and it said, everything under the bright burning sun causes more money than you can shake a stick at. And it creates even more chaos than you wish for, still, no fond memory there. All said and done was a walk together in the grave undisturbed. Just once. It made an example of all those who loved must suffer a loss of conscience, and all that sweets and whatever the people who works must be driving all the tenants of Wuthering Heights into a crack wooden planck of a ship that is full of water 3 inches deep. When they do decide to take a chance on life, and fall for love, it does not catch them, but leads them into the most unromantic ideals of commitment ever. To be in faith with their long lost friend full from the beginning, end, and with no lacking in the middle. How was it possible, but that these people have no contacts with the outside world of travels to the continents, and little words such on this and this day, does not suffice. It is said lover takes in the shape of all form and shape, but it takes generations to heal a broken promise and mend the wounds. [Please, to have breath for a day, and to let escaped chances slip buy once again means that whatever your parents have gone through was not as romantic as you would imagined it. That seems to be the central message, beside peering through the soul.]"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This should be the \\"Book of the Year\\" for every year from 1847 to today - 154 years worth!

And yes it is rather bleak, but powerful nonetheless. The love of Catherine and Heathcliff transcends all concepts of earthly love and their deep soulful connection is rather more of a curse than a blessing for them.People either love this book or hate it, but don't pass judgement until you read it on your own.

Whether it is unconquerable cruelty or the amount of abuse it takes to break a naturally good spirit and turn it black with bitterness and spite, both Bronte stories that I have read dwell solely on the darkest aspects of life. The only silver lining in this story is that eventually perhaps, after enough suffering, fate will turn your hand. Eventually. Maybe.If that is your thing, you will appreciate and perhaps enjoy this book. As for myself, I prefer books that vary in sentiment.

Our &quot;cultural&quot; memory of this great English novel is that it is a story of romantic, wild passion, and unrequited love. No doubt our preconceptions are heavily influenced by the famous film made many years ago. The reality is quite different. Catherine is a rather vain and willful girl who rejects Heathcliff because of differences in their class and upbringing. Heathcliff is full of hatred and resentment despite the great kindness shown him by his master in adopting him literally off the street. There is nothing romantic about the relationship between these two--they hurt each other constantly despite their almost spiritual bond. After Catherine's death, which occurs only halfway through the book, things turn bleaker still, as Heathcliff wreaks revenge on all around him. The wild, harsh countryside and climate, beautifully evoked by Bronte, echo the violent emotions that drive the lives of the characters. How cruel these people are to each other--how hard is Heathcliff's heart that he hates Catherine's daughter most of all. I confess that I found the unrelieved bleakness hard to take at times, and the redemptive conclusion a bit contrived, but it's a great work of English literature nonetheless--and to imagine this book was written by a young woman with virtually no experience of the world!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"WUTHERING HEIGHTS is without a doubt the greatest romance novel I have ever read. Anybody who has ever had a hopeless love for somebody else will understand the torment that Heathcliff and Cathy went through.

Definately."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"The book is written wonderfully, you may call it gothic romance, but the book's really got a style and genre of its own. Now, I only say this for GREAT romance novels, like the Brontes. The language greatly affects the way the story is expressed. It is told in a subtle and bumpy manner, going way ahead of the reader, its many pauses for the narrator gives the reader time to think the thing over, like the guest. Basically, the style and format is a fascinating one, it truly does intrigue the reader to a certain level. Now, it is hard to say if Heathcliff is the kind of man a girl would want( not that I'm a girl ), he is, if you want someone who truly loves you, he's not if you don't want someone to go CRAZY over you. It is--I think--clever of Emily Bronte, to leave this question for readers to consider as they sit comfortably in their beds reading this romance. But if you read it carefully, you will see that the narrator does not form a very high opinion of Heathcliff, yet the latter did deserve the revenge he got. Now, here we have another controversial point for us readers. Thus the novel is a quick one, without all the slow( at least very slow )descriptions and it forms different points of interest as it moves along just pulling the reader in. As the reader gets to the end he/she will feel a shocking yet not surprising end. The ending is a satisfactory one after chapters after chapters of points pointing toward the end. After all, the end is a slope for the way the novel is going. All in all, the book is satisfactory, and something that will--in a way--haunt the reader in later times. It is a masterpiece with all those interesting formats which I will never forget."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I see Bronte's classic novel as the celebration of imagination and the boundless possibilities that dreaming and strongly believing in the make-believe of dreams, as children can only do so well, presents to the reader. Heathcliff and Cathy were happiest when they cast off all of the pretentious cares, and embraced the simplest of things together. As with most classic novels, death is misunderstood; Death was only symbolic of that passage into a reality they both shared all along- a realized spirit of happiness. If anything, it is a strong and encouraging message that the flawed things we most trouble over in life are the very things not all that important. As one modern book puts it, &quot;Don't sweat the small stuff. It's all small stuff.&quot; One might argue that even in death, the romantic flaws would carry on; the distractions still beckoning. To the contrary, this classic novel is the celebration of whatsoever things are beautiful, gracious, carefree, simple, and worthwhile in right here, right now living. In biblical terms, Except ye be as little children..."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I'm thirteen years old, and a HUGE reading fanatic. So one day I pick this up, and start reading. At first, it's pretty hard, but then you start to get along with the writing style. This took me a LONG time to read, but it was definately WELL-WORTH it! It's hard to explain what it was about, but I'll help you best I can. So there's this guy(Mr. Lockwood) and he is the current tennant of Thrushcross Grange. Through the whole story, a servant named Ellen(Nelly) Dean is telling him the history of the people who lived there, and in Wuthering Heights. I'd say that the story is mostly how Heathcliff ruined the lives of the Earnshaw and Linton families, but that is just my point. The story basically starts off about Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff. Then, to the point after that, it comes down to start about Catherine Earnshaw's daughter, Catherine Linton. It's really good, and really hard too! Consider it a big accomplishment to have read it, cause it is amazing!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"It's been a while since I've read this book, but I remember that I was entranced by it. It's a wonderfully tragic love story. I found it very romantic and a suprisingly easy read. Once you begin it you won't want to put it down. However, my only complaint is that some of the characters have the same name so it's harder to keep track of who's who."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"All of the novels of the Bronte sisters exhibit a genius of passion well surpassing their age. Emily Bronte's WUTHERING HEIGHTS, however - though perhaps not quite so endearing as the novels of her sister, Charlotte - possesses the most adeptly pondering prose, egregiously fathoming the terrifying extremes of love and hate.Born amidst the feral landscape of England's Yorkshire moors, the Earnshaw family and their ramshackle farm estate, Wuthering Heights, are at the center of this manifestly heartrending story. Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw, with the help of several servants - most notably their poignantly observant maid Nellie, and their pious and stoic manservant Joseph - are raising two children: a son, Hindley, and his younger sister, Cathy. On a cold and drizzly evening, when Hindley's but a teenager and Cathy still a very small child, Mr. Earnshaw returns from Liverpool carrying a young urchin he'd found starving in the streets. Despite wary opposition from his family, he adopts the four or five year-old child and names him Heathcliff. Mr. Earnshaw, over the next several years, develops a fond affection for Heathcliff that surpasses even that which he feels for his own son. Mrs. Earnshaw dies not long after Heathcliff joins the family, then Mr. Earnshaw dies several years afterwards. From thereon, Hindley relentlessly vents a deeply embedded bitterness borne of jealousy upon his adopted younger brother.Hindley's hatred of Heathcliff is the force that drives this story on. His sister Cathy, however, from a very young age is as drawn to Heathcliff's quiet thoughtfulness, as he to her flighty impulsiveness. The two of them nurture a very deep friendship as children, which grows to an almost otherworldly love as young adults. This tempestuous love gets devastatingly shaken not only by Hindley's efforts to keep Heathcliff in the drudge, but also by wooings for Cathy from a wealthy blue-eyed suitor from Thrushcross Grange, a neighboring estate. This young strapping is Edgar Linton, and he as well as his sister Isabella cut a very severe contrast to Heathcliff. The Lintons are fair-haired, refined in manner, and have very openly expressive countenances. Heathcliff, on the other hand, casts a dark, gloomy aspect: intensely handsome despite dirty, messy hair and thick-browed brooding eyes. Truly Cathy's audacious, tempestuous spirit, wild as the blustering wind on the Yorkshire moors, is pure soul mate to Heathcliff's moody, devil of a gypsy, hot-blooded heart. \\"My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods,\\" she says, \\"time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary.\\" Never - in all of the novels I've ever read - have soul mates been so intensely, so uncannily written.The only fault I find in this story is the utter lack of endearing qualities in either Cathy or in Heathcliff. Each displays, at turns, some form of careless frivolity or ruthless cruelty in either their actions or their words. And though I certainly cannot help but feel for their struggles and their pain, neither are the type individuals with whom I would possibly want to become a friend. They are amazingly self-absorbed, and wholly blinded by the radiance of each other.Mistake me not, though - reading WUTHERING HEIGHTS was indeed a wondrous experience. The writing interweaves the earthly elements, the people, and the landscape haunted by their ghosts with a deftness that's extraordinary. There is undeniable genius here - a brilliantly intense story of a love that refuses to be thwarted, coursing through the heart and soul of the next generation, thence onward, and beyond the grave."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"\\"Wuthering Heights, by Emily Bronte is one of the greatest romances in history.\\"-Kristen Murphy.Within the text of this book, Emily describes events that take place revolving around a romance. The main characters of this book are: Catherine, Cathy, Edgar, Linton, Hareton, Hindley, Isabella, and Heathcliff. Isabella is very spoiled, and soon has a son that dies (Linton). Heathcliff's love life turns into a mess and turns into a lonely old man. Hindley is a jealous and rebellious child that soon becomes jealous of Heathcliff. Hareton is Hindley's son that eventually marries Catherine.Throughout the book the characters run into a lot of problems and adventures. For example, there is a tremendous amount of tension that burns off Heathcliff. My favorite character in the book is Heathcliff. The reason that I like him so much is because he keeps your eyes open. He is always changing, his appearance and his location.The themes that are reveled within the book are: Good vs. Evil, Revenge, Crime and Punishment, Passion vs. Rational Love, Ignorance vs. Education, and Selfishness. The characters display these themes in many different scenes and emotions.My overall opinion of this book was excellent. I would not change anything at all, and I believe that the ending is perfect. I would recommend this book to anyone that in joy's romance novels. It is a novel that keeps you wondering and not knowing what is going to happen next. You may think that you know how this book is going to end, but really you don't. This book sits way ahead of all the other romance novels."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"There is only one way I can understand this story, and it is to read Wuthering Heights as a parody of all other romantic novels. Just think about it: what would a typical romantic hero look like in real life? What would dark, intolerable passion look like in real life? What kind of ends would said hero be willing to go to in order to satisfy a love so intrinsic to his being IN REAL LIFE?Trust me, if you read the book from this point of view, you're going to want to continue reading just to see how far Heathcliff is willing to go to satisfy his desire.YMMV."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I had always heard about the 'classic' love story in Wuthering Heights, but I never thought to read the novel until a few months ago. The main character Catherine Earnshaw is an idealistic, strong willed girl on her way to becoming a well-respected lady. One day her father brings Heathcliff, a brooding and mysterious orphan, into their home, and Catherine is immediately drawn to him. After her father dies, Catherine's brother Hindley takes over their home, Wuthering Heights, and Heathcliff is forced to be a servant. Heathcliff is in love with Catherine, and Catherine apparently feels the same way until she betrays Heathcliff to marry Edgar Linton. Outraged and hurt, Heathcliff leaves Wuthering Heights.Heathcliff returns a year later with the intellect and money of a gentleman. Heathcliff stays at Wuthering Heights with Catherine and Edgar. Heathcliff elopes with Edgar's sister, Isabella, finally getting his revenge on Catherine and Edgar. Isabella eventually regrets the marriage because Heathcliff really doesn't love her and abuses her.Catherine become pregnant, but she dies while giving birth. Before passing away, though, Catherine talks with Heathcliff, and they forgive each other. Catherine gives birth to a daughter who is named Catherine after her mother. The young Catherine grows up with Heathcliff planning a romance between her and Isabella's son Linton.As I was reading the first few chapters, I couldn't figure out why the book was a classic. However, I continued on and became completely engaged in the description, the characters, and the intense love story between Catherine and Heathcliff. Once I got past a fourth of the book over a few weeks, I hit the fascinating part that starts with Catherine's betrayal of Heathcliff and his subsequent revenge. I finished the rest of the novel in less than a day because I couldn't stop reading until I knew how it ended. The language sometimes is a little heavy and hard to follow, especially in the beginning, but once you read about the tumultuous relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff, you'll be sucked into the story. The characters are all well-developed and realistically flawed, so that you can really imagine this story taking place in another time and place. The love story with Catherine and Heathcliff is probably the strongest and most significant love story I've ever read, for there are so many thing wrong with their relationship -- Catherine can't embrace Heathcliff for who he is even if she does love him, Heathcliff is set on getting revenge on Catherine for marrying Edgar -- but the thing that is the foundation of their whole relationship is a fateful, unbreakable bond."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Did you, or did you not, want to kick Heathcliff and bite Cathy? Because I did. Yes, indeed, I did. No other book people have irritated me half so much, by just doing what I didn't want them to do. Kudos to Miss Bronte for such engaging characters, but one star off for spite because I like happy endings best. ;)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"They might as well call it a Soap Opera From Hell---Heathcliff's married to the sister of the woman he loves, Catherine. Catherine loves Heathcliff, but couldn't marry out of status, so she marries this Ergar guy for the money.Then, Heathcliff goes nuts and plots vengeance on everybody, taking the kid, Hindley, and teaching him to hate his father, making everyone alcoholics, chasing his wife off in tears and fits of misery, ruining the half dozen lives of the people around him.How can they call it a romance novel?! Days of Our Lives has better plotlines, Dante's Inferno had more heroic characters.This book's great---interesting to English Majors and Gothic [people] alike."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Did it ever occur to you Heathcliff might be the illegitimate child of Mr. Earnshaw, the 'surprise' he comes home with. Didn't it cross your mind how awfully coincidental it must be to join two complete strangers who are in fact, in no time, 'soulmates', at one point Cathryn even says: I AM Heathcliff. In fact, they feel so much alike mentally, they therefore love eachother beyond the grave. There is never a scene where they actually love eachother physically. I think they are half brother and sister. It would explain so much.....For why would a middle-class farmer come home with a boy, an orphan? And his strong feelings for him, he must be treated as their brother...Well people, that is because HE IS!! They look alike (mentally) too much to be coincidental,unaware they recognize eachother, and not as lovers but unconciously as real family. The extent of their resemblance can only be genetic. The book itself is a masterpiece because it leaves everything in the dark and the reader may guess the real circumstances. When your book is finished, it still 'haunts' you. Please read it and have a nice time with it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I am sorry for even hearing about this novel and i am very upset that it was required reading in my high school. It is horrible out-of-date novel about a guy named Heathcliff, and that's where i fell asleep. The description of things in this book take up 8 lines at a time and are unecessary! I don't reccomend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I recently read the novel Wuthering Heights, by Emily Bronte. As a student, I would not recommend this book to other readers. Unless falling asleep after every chapter of a book classifies it as good, Wuthering Heights is only good as a bedtime story. In the novel, it is said that Heathcliff and Catherine are in love, if this is so they wouldn't have spent their times together trying to hurt one another for pleasure. Heathcliff would have not wished that Catherine not rest in piece because she didn't mention him in her last breaths of air before dying (even though she was unconscious). This relationship that the author portrays as love, really is not love. It is more of a hate than anything. Another thing about this novel in which, I did not quite enjoy was its exaggeration in descriptions of everything. It is great to describe things well enough for the reader to create an image on what is happening in the story, in their mind, but don't push it overboard. For example, Liam O'Flaherty an author of short stories and novels uses great descriptions in his works. In his stories, he was able to create a mental image of the story in reader's imaginations, without letting the story get boring, and without over doing it. The thing is in Wuthering Heights, Bronte explained things out far too well and made the story less interesting. So coming from a student, I would not recommend this book to another student."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This is supposed to be \\"one of the most famous love stories in the English language\\" (this is what the back flip of the Oxford University Press edition says), but where is the love? The characters are all selfish and self-obsessed, especially that monster Heathcliff, who even tortured his own son to death for he is hellbent on his imaginary revenge. The other characters are not much better, they are all psychologically immature and unstable, relishing on mentally and sometimes physically abusing others. As a book it also has little about the social institutions of the period, the story takes place within two households, which eventually merged into one with a couple of (I would say incestuous) marriages. The characters are also not very believable (for example, how do they earn their living? How did Heathcliff make his fortune in a short three years? The author does not say). They die far too easily from grief and anger. They have just one thing in mind: to hate and torture others around them. They have little interactions with other people except within their shrinking inbred gene pool. They seem more like the manufacture of a mentally ill social recluse, which I think more or less fits the description of the author herself. It is altogether a very dark and sordid story.I think Emily Bronte could actually write, but what a waste of her gift!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I gave this book 4 stars because after having read it 1 week ago I'm still thinking about it. I still can't decide whether I loved it or hated it. Many people think this book to be about love but I think it's about the opposite...hate. Pure evil takes shape in this book in Heathcliff. Heathcliff's obsession with Catherine is palpable and turns him mad with hatred for everyone and everything in his path. This book is dark, cold, unfeeling and wicked. The death can almost be felt and smelled from the pages. If you enjoy books about death, illness, hatred and obsessive love then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"actually, i didn't find this to be the book that it is pumped up to be. I braced myself for an exciting deep love story, tragic..instead i was bored. The style was not for me, I found it difficult to read, and in the end was just plain dissappoited. Maybe my generation is too tained by TV, James Patterson and Danielle Steele for us to appreciate the finer works."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Lockwood, the tenant at Thrushcross Grange, visits Heathcliff his landlord and the latter says \\"walk in\\" in a manner that sounds like \\"go to the deuce\\" to Lockwood. When Lockwood visits Wuthering Heights for the second time the area sees heavy snow and he is marooned there over night with Miltonian ice and snow around him, his hades complete with a half dozen four footed fiends like the hounds of hell inside. Catherine is even pretending to weave some black arts to tease Joseph. So we see that Bronte has painted us a picture of hell at Wuthering heights with, as we shall see later, Thrushcross Grange it's polar opposite. Dante Rossetti said of this novel: \\"The action is laid in Hell, only it seems places and people have English names there.\\"After retiring for the night Lockwood reads the names Catherine Earnshaw, Catherine Heathcliff, Catherine Linton written on a window ledge. This series of names tells the story of Catherine Earnshaw to her relationship to Heathcliff and then to marriage to Edgar Linton, read in the opposite direction it is the story of her daughter Catherine Linton who marries a Heathcliff and ends up an Earnshaw. Lockwood goes to sleep and dreams of going with Joseph to hear a Reverend Jabes Branderham preach on Seventy time seven and the first of the seventy first which was in a book he had been reading, and that Catherine had scribbled in. In a truly funny scene Lockwood is exposed as the first of the seventy first sinner: \\"'Thou art the man!' cried Jabes ... Brethren, execute upon him the judgement written. Such honour have all His saints!' With that concluding word, the whole assembly, exalting their pilgrim's staves, rushed round me in a body; and I, having no weapon to raise in self-defence, commenced grappling with Joseph, my nearest and most ferocious assailant, for his. In the confluence of the multitude, several clubs crossed; blows, aimed at me, fell on other sconces. Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counter rappings: every man's hand was against his neighbour; and Branderham, unwilling to remain idle, poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit, which responded so smartly that, at last, to my unspeakable relief, they woke me\\".Bronte paints in Heathcliff as a goblin that digs up graves and torments the living but she also lets us look a little deeper and we see his torment at the loss of Catherine. Symbolically, I suppose, Wuthering Heights represents Romanticism in decline while Thrushcross Grange depicts the emerging Victorian values. Bronte gives us two main narrators Nelly Dean and Lockwood and we see most of the story through their eyes. Virginia Woolf said \\"It is as if Emily Bront could tear up all that we know human beings by, and fill these unrecognizable transparencies with such a gust of life that they transcend reality.\\" Emily Bronte's numinous and gothic Wuthering Heights compasses a literary zenith as the finest English novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Perhaps it is the signature of excellence that the character reviews of this novel are varying but the accolades given to the novel itself are not.I think the essence of the novel is in the housekeeper Ellen herself who tells most of the story. She herself had a hand in the senior Catherine's death. When Catherine was gravely ill, Ellen believed her to be a hypochondriac. Again and again Ellen speaks as negatively of the senior Catherine as she does fondly of the junior Catherine. Like all the characters, even the storyteller Ellen needs further examination. I, for one, found Heathcliff to be a sad, depressed man with many regrets.This novel is not an easy read, but an incredible one that has some of literature's most intriguing characters."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights By Emily BronteThis book is mainly about a love story.A servant,Heathcliff,falls madly in love with a woman that lives in the house,Ms.Cathy.

Wuthering Heights is a work of genius, and a work of art. It is a well-written novel with an original, unique and solid plot, extremely well-done setting, good action, dialogue, etc. All these aspect alone would give the book 5 stars.What makes me say it needs an extra star are the characters. No other novel I know of describes its characters better, or makes them more realistic and belivable. You will never forget Heathcliff. He's a person so set in his cruel ways as to be almost unbelievable - it's hard to imagine someone like that could exist. And yet Emily Bronte pulls it off with her writing. She makes you BELIEVE. And as far as I know, that is the primary purpose of a novel.Don't be fooled by the fact that it's old and a classic. Reading it, none of that is noticeable. The writing is fresh, original, and beautiful. You won't be able to put it down. And when it's finished you'll wish it had lasted just a little longer, like you do when all great novels are done."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This is the most shocking 19th century novel I have ever read! And even though if the story happened today, the principle characters would probably end up on a talk show, I found it to be highly articulate as well as entertaining!I'm not sure why many people said this was a slow paced book, I found it to be quite the little page turner! The only thing that slowed me down at all was trying to decipher Joseph's speeches, but even that adds a bit of comedy to the story.I feel as though the narrative is being told as one sits eagerly in a sewing circle awaiting juicy details about their boss. I found that even though the double narrator makes me wonder greatly about the reliablity of the story, I also think it adds a great deal of the entertainment! I don't trust the condescending and conceited Lockwood, nor the flighty, biased words of Nelly, but they are what makes this story so great!It's fabulous to see a book that still holds a reader's interest today, (instead of just spouting off long tangents of philosophical thought) to be in the canon of great literature!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I loved the story.

But I felt that if I was going to be an English Major I should have some knowledge of this book. This is not the drum I march to. Also, this book does not really match &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot; Nevertheless, it is still an important piece of literature. Emily Bronte presents us with very beautiful images. She also offers us deep psychological insights into human nature. She also makes the characters fairly convincing. Emily Bronte also does a pretty good job in helping us to see why the characters act the way they do, and she does keep us in suspense.

Wuthering Heights in general gets 5 stars from me, and there are plenty of other opinions about the story for you to read. I just want to add something about this particular edition, because it made me laugh in surprise when I opened up my package. This edition is very elegant, but it's very different from your average hard-backed novel. It's very compact and the pages are very thin, like a pocket Bible. The only reason I don't like it so much is that since the pages are so thin you can see the ghost of the words of the preceding page through the page you're reading. You get used to it as you read, but I prefer a print of more substance. Other than that, the cover is pretty, it's hard-backed, the pages are edged in gold coloring and it comes with an attached ribbon bookmark. The print is also average sized, so it's definitely readable, and the small size is advantageous if you want to carry it with you in a purse or on a trip."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"These books are wonderful!

I was completely submerged in the world that she created and tangled in the emotions and desires of its characters. While I prefer the story of Pride and Prejudice, I wasn't as steeped in the story when I read it as I was with this classic novel about forbidden love. Just don't watch the movie adaptions they are bleh. Even with the handsome Matthew MacFadyen who plays Hareton in one movie and Mr. Darcy in the p&p movie with Keira Knightley. But this is a classic for a reason, read it! I read this paperback by the way"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Emily Bronte must have had a great imagination, yet a brilliant sense of reality when writing Wuthering Heights. I say this because so many real problems are apparent in her slightly modified storybook characters. Problems that are faced all the time-orphaned children, undying love, and more than once characters are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Bronte's characters are unlike any I've come across. They are multi-dimensional, and unpredictable; they can be shady and suicidal.Events can unfold in the novel abruptly, or very slowly. At the turn of the page, the main character could be dead, or a new one brought into the world. Nevertheless, the events of one hour could take up two chapters, at the least. Some can be surprising, and quite disturbing, others awaited and welcomed. But, these events are almost never predictable.Many things are repeats of volume 1 in volume 2, but Bronte somehow manages to make a totally different story of the second volume, and you are not bored. There are parallels between the houses, characters, and events. Some of which will most likely be talked about in your language arts class. :)In conclusion, everyone should read Wuthering Heights at least once in their lives. Yes, it's fairly difficult to read and the tests may lower your grade substantially, but you will have attained something from reading it that no other novel can come close to. So whether you read it on your own time, or for a report, along with someone, or all by yourself, just read it!~ L ~"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Okay, maybe that's a bit harsh. Heathcliff is not satan, but he does possess many demonic attributes. I have to say that he is what dragged me through this story. His evilness is nearly absolute and bent on destruction of everyone in his life. But I still have to ask myself why, which may go to say that he is unsatisfactorily explained in the novel. I understand his love for Catherine and the hatred inflicted on him by Earnshaw, but I still can't grasp the depth of his cruelty. The moral freedom he possesses is also astounding, as he worries not about heaven or hell, only about his own personal heaven, in the ground, with Catherine by his side. To me, that may be where his true strength lies.My next favorite character would probably have to be Ellen"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"How could a girl with little or no contact with the outside world write a novel such as this?

Truely lovely."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Ah, Heathcliff and Catherine. Literature's first twisted, truly dependent couple, coming together in one of the most original books in the english canon. What a treat.Emily Bronte's first and only book details the generational struggle between the Earnshaws, a poor farming family, and the Lintons, a wealthy group at Thrushcross Grange. The tragedy's catalyst is Heathcliff, a dark and rebellious boy of unknown parentage whom Mr. Earnshaw brings home and raises as his own child. Earnshaw's son, Hindley, hates Heathcliff with a fierce passion, but young Catherine is immediately drawn to the boy. As they grow older, they realize they are soul mates, but Catherine, attracted to the power and wealth at Thrushcross Grange, marries foppish Edgar Linton, incensing Heathcliff so greatly that he leaves Wuthering Heights for years, traveling the world and becoming a wealthy man. When he returns, it is for revenge, and soon his hatred tears apart the lives of not only Catherine, Edgar and Hindley, but their children as well.This has to be one of the most intense, fiery novels ever written. Bronte describes her wild, moorish surroundings with such vigor and passion that the moors themselves become a character. She also steers clear of nineteenth century melodrama and typical characters; there is no 'winsome heroine' or 'dastardly sneak' or 'good guy.' Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. Though Heathcliff and Catherine are the primary focus of the novel, you will find yourself rooting for them one moment, then rooting for someone else the next. Bronte makes her characters real people, with a psychological depth and acuity uncommon in most nineteenth century literature; indeed, in literature in general. Everyone has their faults and their virtues. You will feel anger and sorrow for everyone at least once in the book.Bronte's dialogue burns with passion and intensity. When Heathcliff and Catherine allow themselves to finally express their love, it's with as much scorn and fury as adoration. Heathcliff seems to be straddling the line between embracing his soul mate and strangling her. Catherine, even at her most vulnerable, is still an impassioned and taunting lover. Each character has his or her own distinct voice; Nelly Dean, the childhood nurse of Catherine and Heathcliff and the story's primary narrator, immediately comes across as a pleasant, solid and mundane creature, while the villainous Hindley makes you want to black his eyes at least twenty times before the book's over. Bronte created characters of flesh, blood and SOUL. These are real people, really real people. You don't see that often. The characters and the brilliant description and evocation of the Yorkshire moors drench the story in a gorgeous, wild, dark mood. This book gets the heart racing.Emily Bronte wrote one of the great novels of all time on her first and only try. Wow."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"For some reason I expected this to be a Pink novel. Much on the contrary, it's rather black. It is a little masterpiece with no true Romanticism (or maybe yes). It is more of a Gothic novel, at least in tone and atmosphere. A man recently arrived to the Yorkshire moors is told, by his maid, the story of neighbors Earnshaw and Linton, and the Earnshaw's adopted and misterious stepson, Heathcliffe. The story spans decades of pure hatred, envy, horrible offenses and revenges, as well as despise for the human race. Each character lives immersed in their own bitterness and pain, with very little communication between them. BUT, beneath this surface there is love, the love between Catherine Earnshaw and her step brother Heathcliffe. In a way, it is a pure love, but it is also somewhat twisted and inevitably star-crossed. Out of this ill-fated love, a more normal and hopeful love will be born, but that you'll have to find for yourself.For me, the best thing about this novel is the creation of an environment, the handling of the medium within which the tormented characters live. It is constantly tense, brooding, foreboding, with periodic explosions of anger, agression and grief. It is somber, macabre and rainy, like the place where it occurs."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Opion of Book:The book was pretty good, but a little confusing. Her language was a little out dated and hard to understand, but nothing to bad. The writting style is sort of informal because she has a narator and they lived and visited Wuthering Heights but a little hard to understand though.Support of Opinion: It was confusing because there were two Catherines and many people came from the Earnshaw family or were related in some way. She used very big words but ones taht went with what she was saying. It was about true love and more so romantic so that was a plus. Nelly helped narate the story and she was Catherine's maid so that was a little informal basis.Personal Preference: I like this book because what can I say, I'm a hopeless romantic. Some parts were sad though that was the only bad part..Recommendation: YES! I would recommend this book, exspecially to anyoe who likes romance and believes that true love will win out no matter what."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"To those who wish a first contact with the British literature, I invariably recommend reading the novel Wuthering Heights. After readind such book, one grieves the excessively early death of Emily Bront, and, yet, wonders seriously whether she would have been capable of producing another masterpiece to equal her first, had her fate been different.The characters of this incredibly intense story acquire so vivid a uniqueness as the narrative goes on that the reader, sometimes, even becomes unable to distinguish the characters from the \\"real people\\" around him, for he is inevitably beguiled into feeling for them all kinds of sentiment; from love to contempt, from pity to hatred; in a wild kaleidoscope of feelings which no sensitive reader will ever forget.But probably, the greatest triumph of this story is the character Heathcliff. Emily Bront creates a being singular in all its ways, especially its revengeful impulses. She renders Heathcliff something more than human, a true entity!, as she describes his life in that ingeniously exerted gossip fashion. By revealing to us only as much information as the closest person to his whole story (Nelly Dean) has, the writer presents him more as a legend of a superstitious countryside place than an ordinary person.Besides the gossip fashion used throughout the book, there is another element that helps make Heathcliff rather inhuman: his emotions; the consuming love he feels (which becomes more than idolatry for a godess after Catherine's death; she becomes the whole purpose of his \\"unlife\\"), the savageness of his worst outbursts of anger, the malignity he had to infuse to his personality in order to endure the harsh live that succeeded his misterious being born, and other traits which the heedful peruser shall most certainly divine from the many passages of the book.I just entreat that the new readers beware calling Heathcliff essencially evil; you try to analise the life he was forced to bear since his beggning, even before his being rescued from the streets of Liverpool by Old Earnshaw, ere trying to draw any unfair conclusions about this quite unfortunate being.Not only Heathcliff, but all the other characters call our attention in this heartfelt romance: It is quite impossible for Catherine Earnshaw's fierce wildness to pass unnoticed to us; she is the true representation of the unbridled spirit of those moors in her fits of passion, and her actions can reverberate as a thunderstrike on the people who love her, thus casting on them shadows of despair and sadness as swarthy as the ones that dwell in her soul at the moment. It is also interesting to perceive that the fact of her being a woman, a simple wife, and therefore having no great pihsical or social power of which to avail herself, does not render her harmless to the hearts of those who dote on her, for she has, and knows how to use, the power to hurt them in the most grievous way anyone could ever hurt; by degrading the greatest idol and reason of their lives, which is herself. Curious indeed is to notice that both the whole of her hate and the whole of her love are always bestowed upon the same people; another trait that leads back to her main one: her heart brimful with wildness.Actually, one could make thorough analyses concerning each of the rich and allegorical characters of this book; the puritan curmudgeon Joseph, the sweet younger Catherine, the noble - hearted rustic Hareton Earnshaw, the standard good - natured housemaid Nelly Dean, and so on; this is only a space for a brief review and recommendation however, and thus I ought not to indulge with composing an extensive critique on this amazing and unforgettable work of art; even because I would refuse to consider any article I could write in the moment completely worthy of being bestowed upon such a masterwork due to my having less time to spare for the performing of so important a task than I should now.Finally, i wish to praise and call the readers' attention to the skillfully written end of Wuthering Heights; with Heathcliff lying as an unearthly, unnamed interloper beside Edgar and Catherine; as what he had always been throughout his hapless life."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Let's admit it, as good a writer Emily Bronte was, she wasn't as good a writer as her sister, Charlotte. Her only major work, WUTHERING HEIGHTS clearly illustrates that. The writing is superior to most fiction that one reads today and the story is rather interesting. Yet, it failed to catch my attention as easily as JANE EYRE did. There are very few likeable characters in the story (the young Catherine Earnshaw, the housekeeper, and the narrator) and the ending seemed rather hasty. Nevertheless, WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a classic and for good reason. It examines a love that defies death, how important our relationships with other people are, and the value of words. It takes awhile to get into the book, but once one passes the first few chapters, it's hard to put the book down."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This book is exciting and interesting, a good combination.

The novel was good, but it didn't interest me. The relationship with Catherine and Heathcliff wasn't a relationship that I appreciated. She was treated bad as a young child, and had to live with a man who loved her, but miss- treated her. So in my opinion, the novel was too mature for me and I'll probably be interested in the novel when I get older."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Love this classic story by Emily Bronte and loved reading it on my ipad.

I just didn't enjoy reading it. The basic story was good, the characters complex but most were not likeable. The moors where it took place were so isolated, there wasn't much interaction with any others except at W. H. and at the Grange. I felt everyone was mentally afflicted in one way or another.

Aside from that, however, I found it quite lacking. I personally found the story to be dreadful and unpleasant.

Therefore, I was unsurprised when I read it and discovered that it was THAT twisted. However, it was also gripping and very interesting. You do not expect a woman in the 1800s to write a book with such romantic passion - because that is where the darkness comes from, the passion that two of the characters have for each other.I really enjoyed this book, though I must admit I was feeling a bit down after I read it. This book will definitely have you re-think Romance. Do you really want that all-consuming love? A love that causes anger, hatred, even death?If you are a fun of romance and old-century books, do not hesitate to pick this book up. If you like gloomy moors, and tales of strife, you shall like this book, too. This is a perfect combination of the two genres.Good reading!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I especially enjoyed the add-ons at the end.

I've read it twice and every time it breaks my heart.It's wonderfully written and a must read for anyone that hasn't had that pleasure yet."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is beautifully written. I fell in love with Emily Bronte and her cadence of language from the very first chapter.Sadly, I loathed the characters. I sympathized with Heathcliff in the first half of the book and was disappointed to find myself hating him in the second half. I despised Catherine Earnshaw from her introduction in the story until her death. The only character I liked at all was Hareton, and I was happy for the way things turned out for him.Reading Wuthering Heights made me appreciate Jane Austen so much more than I already did! Emily Bronte's female characters continually made me wistfully think of Austen's Elizabeth Bennett, and long for her to inhabit Thrushcross Grange instead of Catherine Earnshaw. The difference between Austen's female characters and Bronte's is shocking. I definitely take the existence of strong willed women in modern fiction for granted, and this reminded me how ahead of her time Jane Austen really was. I would love to read a piece of Austen fanfic in which Elizabeth Bennet bashes Catherine Earnshaw over the head with a frying pan, usurps her as mistress of Thrushcross Grange, and gives Heathcliff AND Mr. Linton a sound thrashing.I was surprised that some describe this story as romantic; I didn't find one word even remotely romantic! I appreciated the Gothic and supernatural elements and the wonderful, descriptive writing style. I have a beautiful image of Thrushcross Grange and Wuthering Heights in my head; I can picture the houses and their rooms, the landscape, the gardens and the hills. Despite the personalities of the characters, I really did enjoy this story and I'm glad to have finally read it.I especially love this new Penguin Classics Deluxe edition. Ruben Toledo's cover is even more gorgeous than the Amazon picture portrays, and the pages and binding are high quality. I definitely plan to purchase the rest of these Deluxe Editions that Penguin has released."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I will refrain from giving a plot outline. Many have already done this and it is such a well known story that many people are familar with it having not even read the book. It is one of the greatest stories of love between two people that are too much alike to really understand each other in the English language. Is it an easy happy read no is it a realistic view of a violently passonate love that is doomed yes. You don't read this book for moon light and romance you read this book for the complete realism in it. We all want happy endings in life. Wuthering Heights gives us a more realistic view of what we all live through. Emily Bronte was over a century before her time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights has been reviewed ad infinitum, but I wanted to say that this is one of the most beautiful books I own.I was looking for a series of classics that I could purchase in hardcover to spruce up my personal library. I stumbled upon these special editions from Penguin Classics, with covers designed by Coralie Bickford-Smith. I love books, but these books still make me giddy with delight when I pick them up. The covers have so much character and they're sturdy. The fonts are classic and easy to read, and the paper is substantial. The ribbon bookmarks, that match the cover, are a really nice touch. The only bad thing I can say, and it's so minor, is that the binding is a little stiff when the book is new. It loosens as you read.There are more titles available, though some are still exclusive to the UK. I truly hope Amazon and Penguin make all editions available in the US and keep them coming!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is about the relationship between two people named Heathcliff and Catherine. Now, from everything I knew about this book before I read it, I thought the novel was going to be a great love story full of romance and hugging and declarations of devotion. Boy, was I wrong. At the heart of the book is a revenge drama carried out by a man so consumed by hatred that he makes Palpatine from the first Star Wars trilogy look like a nice guy.Heathcliff was raised from childhood with Catherine Earnshaw and her older brother Hindley, but Heathcliff was not related to them. Mr. Earnshaw brought Heathcliff home with him one day after finding him living the life of an orphan on the streets of London. I kinda suspect that maybe Heathcliff was a secret love child Earnshaw had with a mistress in the city. But that's just my take. Heathcliff rapidly becomes Earnshaw's favorite, even more so than Hindley, much to the son's disgust, which fuels an intense hatred and jealousy that only gets worse after the elder Earnshaw dies. Up to that point, Heathcliff had always been treated as a member of the family, but afterwards Hindley treats him as nothing more than a common servant to be abused and made to work his hands to the bone. And by abused, I do mean actual physical beatings. Catherine, the great love of Heathcliff's life, decides that he has nothing to offer her and instead marries Edgar Linton, the son of one of their neighbors. Hindley too, gets married. The only one left out of this whole lovefest is, you guessed it, Heathcliff, and he leaves the windswept moors only to return years later to exact his revenge on both families Monte Cristo style.I was really caught off guard by this book. Like I said, I was expecting a romance instead of a Shakespearean revenge tragedy. That's not to say there isn't a happy ending, but that it takes a long and convoluted path, wrought with broken lives and bittersweet death. What turns Heathcliff into such a monster is that both he and Catherine know that they were meant to be together but she makes the decision to reject him based solely on improving her social standing. And let's be frank, the supposed social mobility she craves doesn't amount to squat when you live out in the middle of nowhere in some backwater Gothic swamp. To me, I can almost see precursors to Faulkner's decaying nobility. Something else that really struck me about the novel was its haunting theme of sexual frustration. What Heathcliff and Catherine feel for each other is very sexual. There isn't any idealistic or poetic flowers growing out of each other's imagination. They see each other for what they are and love each other for what they are. Neither of them were cannibals but I almost felt like if they could find a way to eat each other, they would have.Bronte does a virtuoso job of moving between time periods and showing different generations of the Earnshaws and Lintons as the children of both have to deal with the legacy left them by the destructive failed love of Catherine and Heathcliff. The main narrators of the story are not the two main characters. Instead, the tale is told by Nelly, a maid just a little older than them who was a witness to everything that happened. She tells the story to a certain Mr. Lockwood, a man who is renting a house from Heathcliff many years after all this has gone down. Emily moves from present to past to future and back again during different chapters that really seems a more postmodern way of looking at things. This book was far ahead of its time in terms of novelistic technique.Bronte even takes up the issue of racism in Wuthering Heights, as part of the reason Hindley and the Lintons look down on Heathcliff is because of his \\"dark gipsy skin\\".I look at Catherine as a coward who recognized that Heathcliff was who she was meant to be with, but in her superficial thinking, she was more worried about marrying well (weren't all women of that time the same) than marrying for love. Marrying for love was for peasants. If you had money or land you had to marry an equal or someone higher than you. She chose wrongly and a lot of people had to suffer for it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Beautiful book. I love the fabric cover. There is also a ribbon book marker in each of these books in a coordinating color!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This is indeed a classic. Truly a great book. It's kind of understandable that it received a lot of negative reactions when it was first published, because the lead character, Heathcliff, is one of the nastiest characters ever devised. And the second most important character, Catherine (Sr.), isn't all that nice, either. Still, this is one of the best books of its time period and a must read for anyone interested in 19th Century literature."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"After reading Wuthering Heights, my love for litarature and the &quot;classic&quot; books have increased impressively. No, i did not read this for school, I read it to broaden my list of vocabulary words. (my ideal goal in life is to be an author, and i will be one). It pains me to see the thrashing reviews of a great book by high school students who simply shouldn't be reading books like this, not yet, or perhaps never. You can't really call this a romance. or, not a Traditional Romance anyway. The love affair between Heathcliff and Catherine is obviously doomed from the start. People continously say they hated the characters. I didn't. I loved them! Heathcliff and Catherine the most. Not that i didn't hollar at them when they did the idiotic things that became repetitive, as I've seen happen in real life. In fact, the only character i disliked was Nelly Dean, who seemed determined to ruin the already corrupt relationship Heathcliff and Catherine shared. This story is so true to real life. It's so bitter, so gothic. There's not a happily ever after in this novel, folks. I love tear jerkers, and that is what this book is. One thing that Emily Bronte is marvelous at, is her description. Her words plant a vivid picture in my mind. And she doesn't need to go on and on with describing either. She can make a place seem real with one paragraph! Read this book. For whatever reason, read it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I LOVED Wuthering Heights.

I couldn't! It's not perfectly presented, but the novel does entice the reader into the bizarre world of Wuthering Heights. I normally read war novels (lots of blood and violence) and honestly, Wuthering Heights in some ways is as violent as they are. It is both disturbing and satisfying. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"If you are devoted to the Brontes and to _Wuthering Heights,_ you will probably want to swallow twice and pony up for this facsimile of the original edition of the novel. There's something breath-taking in seeing it as Emily Bronte, with only a year or so to live, saw her own work in 1847. The crudeness of the text--typos abound--somehow corresponds to the roughness of the sensibility that produced it. And since the original publisher wanted to spread it out so as to sell thicker book, it's easy on the eyes.The book is sewn in heavy, orangish cloth and feels substantial; in these days of flashy, cheaply produced volumes, this two volume set is a happy throwback."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is, with Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" my alltime favorite book. I've read it several times, beginning at age twelve. Even when I was too young to understand all of its complexities, I still appreciated its highly atmospheric qualities and the magic that makes it timeless.Over the years, I've asked myself, time and time again, just what it is about \\"Wuthering Heights\\" that gives it such power. I've finally come to the conclusion that \\"Wuthering Heights\\" endures simply because its characters dare to feel things and act in ways the rest of us don't. We all have times when we're tempted by obsession and revenge, but most of us don't act on those temptations. At times, we all feel driven almost to madness and we all have a wild side (some of us more than others) that finds perfect expression in the character of Heathcliff. In this book, the characters are always threatening to break the bounds of respectibility and civility.While some people see \\"Wuthering Hieghts\\" as the ultimate love story, I've never found much love in this book, not even between Catherine and Heathcliff. What I have found are obsession and revenge. Love would have watered this story down; obsession and revenge crank it up. Love is an acceptable (even prized) emotion; obsession and the desire for revenge, though felt my many, are definitely frowned upon. The fact that Emily Bronte allows her characters to give in to obsession, to go mad, to exact revenge, gives her novel a distinctly disturbing, unsettling power.There are many criticisms of this novel that attempt to analyze what Emily Bronte was trying to say. Many compare the domesticity of Thrushcross Grange to the isolation and wildness of Wuthering Heights. These ctiticisms don't interest me in the slightest. No matter how educated Emily Bronte was or wasn't, she certainly didn't study psychoanalysis and she certainly didn't write her novel keeping the finer points of analysis in mind. Emily Bronte was, by all accounts, a highly imaginative girl who cared more for the world of fantasy than for reality. Approach her book as literature; enjoy it and don't attempt to \\"pull it apart.\\"Many people have said that the \\"second generation\\" in this book redeems the one that preceded it; i.e., Cathy and Hareton redeem Catherine and Heathcliff. I can't agree with that assessment. All of the characters in \\"Wuthering Heights\\" show themselves to be capable of violence and obsession (even Edgar). I think, in seeing the \\"second generation\\" as restorative, we deny many of the passions inherent in this book. Catherine and Heathcliff are the characters most given to wild emotions but they are not the only ones; all of the characters can and do resort to violence when it suits their needs.\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is one of those rare books: a truly inspired masterpiece. It has a very unsettling, disturbing, even fascinating quality about it because it touches the darkest regions of our soul. Heathcliff is the dark side in all of us; the side we don't enjoy even acknowledging and Catherine's failure to deal with her obsesion reminds us that we, too, can fail, we all are vulnerable to Catherine's fate.\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is a stormy, unsettling, often violent book that explores the darkest side of human nature. Its beauty is raw and savage; its emotions spill over the constraints of civility and common sense. It's a powerful book (one of the most powerful in all of literature). It's a work of genius that's truly unforgettable."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Before I put in my two bits, I made a point of reading other reviews and most of what I read I agreed wholeheartedly with, But for the other 10%, I was extremely dissapointed. For those of you who complained, and said that Wuthering Heights was a dull and boring book, maybe the book isn't the problem, and you are. Could it be possible that you need to open your narrow vision and broaden your veiw of this worlds literature? I am fourteen and I totally understood this book. I was wrapped up it the whole time, and there was never one part that I thought was boring. I admit, at times it was confusing, but never boring.This book is without a doubt the best written peice of work I have ever read. The description blew my mind, and as for the characters, they were fully developed and I was able to bring them alive in my mind as easily as I ever have in any other book.Brontte made it so easy to imagine Heathcliff that I had to make no effort whatsoever on my part to bring him to life. As for Catherine, she was developed so well that I can honestly say I saw her as a real person.This novel left me wanting nothing more but a sequel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"It's strange that as a lover of literature (it was my major in college too), I haven't previously read Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte. I'm surprised that it wasn't assigned for any of my classes. I've read and loved Jane Eyre by Emily's sister Charlotte multiple times and Wuthering Heights has literally been on my shelf for years waiting for me to read it.Last week I decided to cross Wuthering Heights off my to-read list.I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting. You can't not have some expectations about Wuthering Heights. It's often a favorite novel of other literary/pulp fiction characters. A well-written, darkly romantic ghost story. That's what I was expecting. And in some ways, that's what the book was.The writing is really good once I got past the strange and sometimes confusing model of narration--the servant telling the story to a boarder who writes in his diary. This style removes the reader from some of the inner dialogue and thoughts of the main characters. However, if it had been narrated by Heathcliff, like Lolita's Humbert, I might be even more disturbed by his character. And who else could have narrated it? Cathy II, Hareton and Linton have no idea why their lives are being constantly manipulated by Heathcliff.There is a ghost. Her appearance early in the novel is the only moment of intense emotion and romance that I expected from the novel. It is the only reason I was compelled to continue reading. I was eagerly awaiting another such experience.The characters are either reprehensible and completely without merit or sniveling, abused pawns in Heathcliff's demented game of revenge.Needless to say, I was disappointed. Lovers of Wuthering Heights will no doubt claim that I have missed the point. Perhaps. Maybe you have to be younger to read and appreciate the immature and ridiculous passion of Heathcliff. Maybe I missed my chance to appreciate this novel. Still, I don't understand why so many teenagers actually like it. How is this an example of true love? How is abuse and vile retribution against others romantic?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte's only novel, is very different from her famous sisters', and critical opinion in the last few decades has decided it is the best of them, which truly says much. It first got mixed reviews but has continually risen to the point where it topped a recent poll of the greatest love stories, showing that it is one of the few classics with true mass appeal. Wuthering is indeed a masterpiece with a thrilling story, superb characterization, stunning prose, and more than a little sociopolitical relevance. Its power has enthralled readers for over a century and a half and shows no sign of lessening.The story itself is one of the most immediately engrossing elements. Tightly plotted and deftly executed, it draws us in irresistibly and never lets go; those afraid of classic literature because they think it boring, pretentious, or portentous should know this is a striking exception. It is the kind of tale that does not come off well in summary, as the blank faces staring at me when I gave a college presentation on it prove. Though short for a Victorian novel at about three hundred pages, the complex multi-generational plot is told via flashbacks, nested narration, etc. Suffice is to say that the action is intensely dramatic and highly emotional; it is drenched in pathos and runs us through a gamut of other emotions. It reaches a fever pitch quite soon and hardy lets up - a story of true immediacy and intensity. With its time jumping and non-linearity, the complicated delivery creates significant suspense, and we become supremely interested.The key to the book's success, though, is surely its characters. Many are vividly and memorably drawn with stunning realism and often with great sympathy; we truly feel with and for them. Catherine, the initial female lead, is one of Victorian literature's more striking heroines; an essentially unconventional woman stuck in a time and place where convention reigned unchecked, she has great passions that find no vent. She loves Heathcliff but cannot bring herself to defy society enough to marry him. Her character thus subtly critiques Victorian society, showing how oppressive mores were detrimental to many, especially women, crushing their spirit and denying them happiness.Heathcliff himself is of course the most famous character and the one most attractive to many. As a heterosexual man, I have never been able to see his appeal; he seems overwhelmingly selfish and cruel with almost no redeeming qualities. However, I have seen women discuss him as if he were not only real but the Sexiest Man Alive - even ones who have never read Wuthering! He seems to be among many women's favorite characters ever and, I suspect, is a large part of the reason the book topped the poll. What makes him so attractive is a very interesting question; I assume it is a combination of his profound passion - along with its consequent romantic and sexual potential - plus his bad boy status. He is in some ways the prototypical bad boy, living by his own code and not caring what others think - bravely and boldly original. One may well wonder how or why women excuse his sadistic qualities, but he certainly stands well above the drab gentlemen populating most Victorian fiction. They are stuck in a time warp, but he is distinctly alive, as much a part of our day - nay, any day - as his own. Even putting subjective attraction aside, though, he is undeniably fascinating, if far from traditionally likable. This is in one sense because, like Shakespeare's Richard III, he is upfront about his villainy - nay, positively revels in it. He does not try to hide his nature, and there is something perversely admirable in how he carefully meditates and follows his plans. More fundamentally, he is more sinned against than sinning; his detestable qualities surely stem in great part from his brutal upbringing. This not only makes him a sort of sympathetic figure - and certainly one of pathos - but also raises very currently relevant questions about parents and guardians' responsibility for their children's actions later in life. The topic received almost no mainstream, much less legal, attention until the last few decades, showing just how far ahead of her time Bronte was here as in many other ways.Of course no one can discuss the book without mentioning the love story, which in its way is one of the most monumentally engrossing. However, that it was ranked first truly surprises because it has nothing like a happy ending and is indeed a thwarted love tale; Catherine and Heathcliff do not even get as much time together as Romeo and Juliet. The depth of their passion despite this is surely a large part of the attraction, but it may very well be that the lack of consummation - not just in the physical sense - is precisely what moves so many. Love is perhaps the most universal feeling, but the rarity of its being requited - much less reaching full mutual fruition - is truly tragic. The sad truth is that, whatever happy love stories' escapist value, far more people can relate to unhappy ones. Wuthering's is bitterly familiar to the countless people who have loved only from afar, displaying the wretched phenomenon's broken feelings and often fatal consequences with stirring verisimilitude and extreme emotional vitality. The many who have been in similar situations will feel a great personal connection, but even those who have not will have great sympathy for this unfortunately common dark side of human experience.Some of the novel's social criticism clearly comes into play here, and it is to society's credit that things have changed to the point where very few would disdain a Catherine/Heathcliff union. Yet some of the love's story's other fundamental elements remain just as relevant - are indeed as old as humanity and will surely last as long as we do. It shows the dramatically high pitch that passion and other emotions can reach even - or perhaps particularly - when they have no release. Many works show love's greatness, but Wuthering is remarkable for showing its dark side; the heart has terrible truths hiding just beneath ostensible calm that can storm out at any time - often with dire results. The novel does not flinch from displaying how our most primitive emotions can easily have savage effects; if love brings out the best in humanity, it can at least as easily bring out the worst. Perhaps no classic love story is less sentimental or otherwise traditional; this made it stand out distinctly amid many superficially similar Victorian tales, but it would be unusual in any era. Critics did not like to see the unadorned display of mental and physical cruelty, but less prudish later eras have seen its terrible truth. Bronte seemed to have a profound understanding of elemental feelings and stark knowledge of the beastly facts about men and women in love, which seems near-preternatural considering her sheltered life. It is almost enough to make one believe her muse was truly inspired in the external sense so often described by artists but so hard for others to even conceive. No one can read this without a sense of the incalculable loss to literature when such a genius was cut off so early; that she did not live to write more novels is truly regrettable. However she did it, she clearly drew inspiration from a well at human nature's very heart, which is why the book continues to strike such deep chords so powerfully.The younger generation's love story is of course far more traditionally placid. It is nearly as compelling in its way and introduces important poetic justice and irony issues but takes a definite backseat. Those not as responsive to - or who repress - stormy passions may find it more relatable, but it serves primarily as a useful contrast for most readers. If nothing else, it proves Wuthering is more nuanced and subtle than one might think given its melodramatic reputation.All this implies a strong realist perspective, which the book certainly has, but it also belongs to the gothic school so common in the nineteenth century with all its associated supernatural overtones. Requisite ghost aside, we get among other such elements an immense storm that is not only a pathetic fallacy but seems to have some kind of paranormal, perhaps divinely-controlled, significance. The vivid North England moor setting contributes substantially to all this; the novel imbues the strongly, if unconventionally, picturesque setting with a near-magical air, describing it with great believability and stunning originality. Wuthering is one of the main reasons that the area has long had great, near-occult sway in the popular imagination. As all this suggests, the book also has more than a dash of Romanticism. Like most great works, it is hard to classify, the mix of genres and styles forming a magic all its own.A final noteworthy aspect is the deceptively simple prose. Despite the relative conciseness and lack of the florid description that turns so many off to Victorian fiction, Bronte manages to describe her setting at least as clearly and memorably as authors with far thicker works. The landscapes and manors are drawn with stark beauty; no one who reads Wuthering will soon forget them. The narrative, especially in the direct first-person segments, impresses with a spare yet lush style. Bronte knows exactly what words are needed to make her points not only clear but memorable - and, in the case of the immaculately worded and brilliantly portrayed last paragraph, simply unforgettable. Hard as the book is to summarize, it is easy to read in the best sense; those who have had trouble getting into other classic works may be at ease, as this is one of the few books as great as it is accessible - which removes the final excuse for the small number who have not already read and loved it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This is a well-red audiobook- the pacing is good, the enunciation is clear and the reader varies the vocal color enough to make individuals identifiable during dialogues.

When I recieved one such email asking me to review Wuthering Heights my first thought was that I would not dare to even try to say anything about such a classic book. But I have just finished reading it again after many years and I had forgotten how wonderful and musical it is. The words flow on the pages like music to your ears. The characters are so engaging, even those you love to hate, and the settings are so real. I feel like I have spent the last few days in an eighteenth century manor house, in the kitchen, near the fire, listening to an amazing story being told by a humble house keeper. I think that sometimes today we forget how inspired beautiful prose, can really make us feel, for hours at a time I forgot all my modern day worries and my hectic work load and just enjoyed a truly wonderful reading experience. Do yourself a favour and reread this book, and if you have never read it then do so you wont be sorry."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I didn't care for this book, I found it quite boring, although I had wanted to read it for years and never had the opportunity, it just wasn't my kind of book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is a beautiful tale of love and hate. It's a powerful novel, full of emotion and thought. It is a true insight to the human mind and soul. The story begins with Mr. Lockwood, a tenant for Heathcliff to live in Thrushcross Grange. Mr. Lockwood sees Heathcliff and goes home, only to ask one of the servants, Nelly, about Heathcliff's past. The story then is told from her narrative until she decides to end the story to allow Mr. Lockwood to sleep. The story continues in this manner, with Mr. Lockwood going back to Wuthering Heights to see Heathcliff, getting stuck there, etc, etc."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Emily Bronte brings forward the true masterpiece of her era in this novel. While many consider this novel to be one of hate, it is really the story of a love that cannot die, even in the grave.Catherine's slight of Heathcliff is one of the great moments in all of literature. He then goes about making himself worthy of her love. In so doing, he makes many enemies, but anything worth achieving is going to come at some cost. He hates Edgar Linton; he avenges himself through him. His entire purpose in the novel is to prove that he is indeed the true soul-mate of Catherine. All the destruction of earthly morals and customs is indeed okay if only he can be with Catherine for eternity.The ending of the novel also comes to bear. Showing young Catherine, who has the best traits of both her parents being married to Hareton Earnshaw. The story ends in light rather than the bleak atmosphere at the beginning. This point is in keeping with the importance of setting in the Gothic novel.The narration is well handled. For all the people who ascribe nefarious motives to Nelly, I say pshaw! She tells the story from the only point of view possible to a maid in her situation. Lockwood handles the beginning and the end with verve. What makes Emily Bronte so good is that she actually changes the characters in the narration. Nelly is not confused with Lockwood at any point in the story.I highly recommend this novel. I think it is the Masterpiece of English fiction of its era. I think you will like its many layers and its timelessness."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This is a novel you will not be able to put down once you started reading. It's very engaging! You feel the love, the hatred and all the emotions conveyed by the storyteller."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"That's how I would describe this novel. I first read it when I was 15 and hated it. I couldn't understand what the appeal was about these savage, ruthless, selfish characters. I was obsessed with Jane Eyre, but Wuthering Heights seemed a distant, incomphrehensible world. But now, nearly 20 years later, I have a better appreciation of it. It really is worth reading - just persevere through the first 50 pages or so, and you'll be sucked in.I haven't seen the Laurence Olivier film, but am curious now to see how this bleak and twisted world is portrayed on screen."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is not the creepiest classic in existance, but it is delightfully morbid, what with insane make-out sessions with corpses, and still has a beautiful ending and a bit of happiness in the last chapter. However, I have heard so many people call it boring or difficult to read that I have become apalled and have lost hope for the future of the human race.The characters of Wuthering Heights are the element of the book most frequently attacked. But Heathcliff is NOT evil!! How would anyone feel, never wanted by anyone in their entire life but one woman, and then to be cast off by that same woman? How would anyone feel in his shoes? He is a git and he is a dreadful person, but he is a complex and layered character, deeply troubled and very well written. As for everybody else, not a one is really likeable, but not a one is evil. They are only what they world has made them, Cathy the younger spoiled and Hindley abused. And if you still don't like them? Well, take comfort that most of them die.My second point is that this book is NOT hard to read. The gamekeeper's dialogue is, granted, impossible. But he hardly talks anyway. Also, the family tree is equally difficult, but it helps to draw your own as you go along. However, other than that the text is simple and the plot-line straightforward. The beauty is in the descriptions.This is a love story of epic proportions. It doesn't illustrate the beauty of love until the end, but also incorporated is platonic love of family and friends. Yet nevertheless, love triumphs upon the finale, and it does truly tell of true love. True love isn't perfect, but it is, in essence, everlasting. And this book tells of nothing if not everlasting love: \\"Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.\\" - Catherine Linton (once Catherine Earnshaw), relating to Heathcliff."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"What a Morose book this is! This is the first book that I have read by the Bronte sisters. I was really looking forward to it. It begins with the story of Mr. Lockwood entering the house of Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights) and the reader finding out that the people inhabiting the house are just nasty. This includes Heathcliff, Hareton and Catherine (the younger).Some have indicated that this is a love story. I am not so sure of that. It is clear in the story that Heathcliff was in love with Catherine (the elder) and was deeply hurt when she married Edgar. He goes off for three years and returns with money. However, where and how he got his money is never explained in the story.Now that he has returned, it is Heathcliff's intention to get revenge on those that he believed have wronged him. This includes Hindley, Catherine's brother, Edgar, Hareton, Linton (his own son) and Isabella. If he cannot get his revenge on those that wronged him, he will get it on the children of those that wronged him such as Hareton and Catherine (the younger).Shortly after he returns, Catherine (the elder) dies but not before giving birth to her and Edgar's dauther Catherine. By this time though, Heathcliff has married Isabella, Edgar's sister. Heathcliff wants to get his hands on Thrushcross Grange since this is the home of Edgar and Catherine. On the day after he is married to Isabella, he basically tells her that he married her to get possession of Thrushcross Grange.It is at this point that I realized that Heathcliff was an evil person. It is also at this point that I no longer considered the novel to be a love story. Heathcliff's love has now been turned into hatred. He has one thing on this mind and that is to make those around him miserable.When he returns to Wuthering Heights, Hindley is a drunk and an gambler. Hindley's son Hareton will inherit Wuthering Heights but Heathcliff gives money to Hindley and now becomes the mortgagor of the property so that when Hindley dies Heathcliff becomes the owner of Wuthering Heights.If Edgar dies without Catherine being married she will inherit Thrushcross Grange. When Edgar gets a letter from his sister, Isabella (remember that is Heathcliff's wife) that she is dying and wants him to take care of her son, Linton (Heathcliff's son too), he goes and gets him from near London. On the night of their return, Heathcliff sends Joseph to get him. The next day Linton leaves to live a Wuthering Heights. Given his condition, he gets Linton to correspond with Catherine but since Nelly and Edgar are standing in the way of their marriage, he forces Catherine to marry Linton. Therefore, when Edgar dies Thrushcross Grange becomes the property of Linton. Linton, being sickly through the whole bood, soon dies and wills the Thrushcross Grange to Heathcliff. At this time, Catherine, Hareton, and Heathcliff are all living at Wuthering Heights and he rents Thrushcross Grange to Mr. Lockwood.At the time Catherine (the elder) dies, Heathcliff asks that her ghost haunt him. In the last couple of chapters, it appears that Heathcliff continually sees Catherine's ghost. Heathcliff fails to eat and eventually dies. At that time, Hareton and Catherine are falling in love, which is the only happy part in the book (other than Heathcliff dying).All in all, this is a very dark story. This is a story of love (at first) and then hatred. This is a story of how hatred can destroy a person as well as those around him. It is a good story but I don't consider this a love story. Heathcliff is an evil person that never changes his ways of making other miserable. He enjoys making other miserable. I liked the book but it is just a little too dark for me to give it a five star rating."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I was recommended this book under the theme of Love and Romance but its so not Love....hate or greed would better describe it.This book is beautifully written however,among the best I've read.

When informed of my assignment, I was neither enthused or diappointed. I am always interested in reading something new, however I was unfamiliar with Wuthering Heights and did not know what to expect. I started reading it and by the third chapter, I was hooked. This book it probably the most painfully romantic novel ever. Unfortunately, the emotions this book arouses are unable to be put into words. Like a previous reviewer said, this book \\"has a certain something.\\" That it does."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This is the sad tale of thwarted love between two soulmates destined to be apart. Cathy and Heathcliff were one in being, but two in person and this was a torture neither got over.It's bitter sweet and painful to read at some points, but the love of Hareton and Catherine in the end makes one wonder if THEY were the ones destined for happiness, not Cathy and Heathcliff."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"There is a thin line between love and hate, and once Heathcliff crosses it, we see a grand, passionate and absorbingly interesting man turn into a fearsome thug. Thwarted in his love for his childhood soulmate, Catherine Earnshaw, Heathcliff turns his devastation outward, becoming a hateful -- and hated -- person all across the bleak moors that surround his Yorkshire village.Heathcliff courts and marries the sister of the man whom Catherine chose over Heathcliff, only to torture her emotionally as a way of getting even with her brother. Meanwhile, Catherine slowly wastes away pining for Heathcliff, for although she once rejected him, she eventually realizes that she has made an irredeemable error and can never be happy. Heathcliff sums up the tragedy of their lives in a single question near the end of the novel when he asks, \\"Why did you betray your heart, Cathy?\\"Sound depressing? It's not. Wuthering Heights is a grand and glorious novel that dramatically illustrates the power of love, for good and ill. But more importantly, it teaches us that the only path to happiness is to be true to one's heart, rather than one's head. Had Catherine honored her bond with Heathcliff and refused to bow to the social mores of her day, not only would the two of them been much happier, but all of the many people whose lives they stumbled into would have been much better off.Another reviewer said that those of us who love this novel probably have a strong identification with one of the characters, and for me that is quite true. That's the reason for reading a classic like Wuthering Heights, because when it speaks to you in the clear and true way that Bronte does, you know that you are not alone, and that some things transcend time and place.Think about it -- a prim, Victorian preacher's daughter living on the moors of England before there was electricity can reach across 150 years of time and speak to the heart of a wired American in the 21st century. Pretty amazing, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"WUTHERING HEIGHTS was the most amazing book I have ever read. It's characters are so unique and unlike any displayed in any other novels. The characters are so realistic; so flawed, so horrible, yet able to be sympatized with by the reader. They leave us wondering why they take the actions they take while still making us feel emotion for even Heathcliff, the cruel revenge-seeker who spends many years divising a plan to ruin the lives of the people whom he hates. Emily Bronte is a genius and her book should not be insulted just because certain readers can not appreciate the beauty of this intense story of love and revenge."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"If you've always wanted to read one of the great works of literature, but was intimidated by the lengthy volumes, long-winded sentences and complicated language, then you may want to direct your attention toward \\"Wuthering Heights\\". Perhaps the most famous novel penned by one of the three Bronte sisters (though Charlotte Bronte comes a very close second with \\"Jane Eyre\\"), \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is reasonably easy to read, with straightforward narrative, fluid pace and of slim length. Though the content will definitely not appeal to everyone, it is an approachable novel in terms of readability.The story is predominately a love story, though a love story that is haunted by revenge, jealously, hate, greed and death; all the juicy stuff that people are magnetically drawn to. Heathcliff is a young foundling boy, brought to Wuthering Heights by his foster-father Mr Earnslaw. Mr Earnslaw indulges the small boy, but his wife and his eldest son Hindley are repulsed by the half-wild creature and treat him no better than an animal, though they are held back by Mr Earnslaw's influence. But it is in Cathy that Heathcliff finds his soul mate, and the children spend hours together, roaming the wilderness like gypsies, utterly inseparable. But the two are not angels: masters at manipulation and conniving, Cathy and Heathcliff are experts at shaping their household to suit their own tastes with total disregard to anyone beyond themselves; Cathy in particular delights in tormenting her father by doing \\"just what he hated most, showing how her pretended insolence, which he thought real, had more power over Heathcliff than his kindness: how the boy would do her bidding in anything, and his only when it suited his inclination.\\"But when Mr Earnslaw dies, the disgruntled Hindley returns to Wuthering Heights and immediately relegates Heathcliff to the servants-quarters. From here stems the rivalry and hatred that marks the central tragedy of the book, as Heathcliff and the two predominant families of the area: the Earnslaws and the Lintons, fight amongst each other in a bitter feud for power, love, the land and the estate, in a struggle that continues down into the next generation. Each individual seems to achieve a sense of power and control over others briefly, only to loose it again via a marriage or death, and the plot twists and turns though many intrigues and mysteries.It is Heathcliff in the centre of this storm, determined to avenge himself against those who have wronged him: \\"I don\`t care how long I wait, if I can only do it at last\\", and though he is the main character of the book, he is certainly best described as an \\"anti-hero\\", and many new readers are somewhat taken back with the idea that he is the central figure. In one shocking moment, he saves the life of his enemy's son - almost accidentally - and immediately regrets taking such action. He's an enigma that's for certain, as he has no last name and nothing is known of his past before he's brought to Wuthering Heights; his personality is unintentionally captured in the name his foster family bestow on him, reflecting the wild atmosphere of the setting: \`heath' and \`cliff'. Heathcliff and Catherine are a \\"heathen pair\\" as the narrative would say, and the reader is not expected to like or admire them; but as characters they are utterly fascinating and one can't help but envy the extraordinary bond between them.In terms of the narration, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is indeed unique. Not told by an omnipotent third-person voice, the tale is told to a new tenant at Thrushcross Grange - Mr Lockwood - by the former housekeeper at Wuthering Heights, Mrs Dean. This makes the levels of storytelling quite complex, for at some points (for example) we are hearing Catherine's testimony, as told to Mrs Dean, as she narrates to Mr Lockwood, who then records it for the audience. Anyone's whose played Chinese Whispers will know that stories change in the passing on from one person to each other, and the reader is challenged to untangle the gossip of Mrs Dean and the blandness of Mr Lockwood's records to uncover the true passion of the lives involved. It is a challenge you should relish.In terms of genre, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" can almost be considered the \\"poster-child\\" of Gothic literature, as almost every component of it caters to the \\"dark and stormy night\\" mentality of the Gothic style and narration; from vivid nightmares to the rugged landscape to the almost insane desires and fears of its characters, this novel is the very definition of \\"Gothic\\". Whenever you're in the mood for a dose of the twisted and heavy tones of the Gothic, then you should definitely have \\"Wuthering Heights\\" at hand. The critic Richard Chase says it best when he says Bronte was inspired by: \\"the sheer romantic exhilaration of escape from culture itself, into a world where nature is dire, terrible and beautiful, where human values are personal, alien and renunciatory, and where contradictions are to be resolved only by death...\\" No other critical quote I've read better describes the sheer melodrama of \\"Wuthering Heights\\" than this.Ultimately, the book is about opposites and extremes, and the very fine line that exists between them; between light and dark, man and woman, humanity and animalism, the wild and civilisation, and love which exists to both heal and destroy people. In gentle comparison to Heathcliff's soul-consuming love that prays Catherine's ghost will return to haunt him, is Catherine's quiet but absolute declaration that: \\"whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same\\".Wow. I love this book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is one of the best novels I have evr read. The passions of which were intwined within the characters' was described so deeply that I could feel the pain so strongly as if I were the character myself.When Catherine and Heathcliff were blaming each other for breaking each other's hearts, I cried hysterrically. The love and friendship between the couple was so intimately written that you could feel the different melodies of their ongoing reasonings. Cathy accused Heathlcliff of murdering her, for having wanted her to choose between himself and Edgar. Cathy told Heathcliff that she did not care how he wold suffer without her for he broke her heart in such a way, that he did not even care for her sufferings. Heathcliff fired back exclaming that instead Cathy had killed herself for vowing to be with Edgar. He also said that forgetting Cathy would be forgetting his very existence. \\" I love my murderer, but yours, how can I?\\" This would have to be one of my fvorite quotes from the novel. Even thought that line is so short, it means so much. This line revealed the intensity of his feelings torwards Cathy; that it hurt him so much to see her in such a state of illness and emotional sufferings, felt for him.I hate to say it, but what made this story so interesting was the evil doings accomplished by Heathcliff. The vigorating acts such as the enforcing of the marriage of Cathy and Linton was thought out by Heathcliff so cleverly, that it amused me, in it's own devilish way.This novel touched emotions of passion, love and hate that it made me think deeper about the \\"inside\\" of a relationship between a man and a woman."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wonderful read!

Emily Bront&#1105; masterfully illustrates how love can dictate human emotion, devotion, and action in everyday life. Through Bront&#1105;'s use of juxtaposition between life and death or heaven and hell, we are introduced to the how love is one of the strongest metaphysical emotions humans acquaint with. This metaphysical passion transcends Mr. Heithcliff's daily routine and drives him to rash decisions of revenge, as well as producing an idea of active and passive forces throughout the novel. This includes the ideals of nature and society being such a force in the development of Catherine as she is unfairly controlled by the forces of Mr. Heathcliff. Bront&#1105;'s use of diction throughout the novel only reinforces the theme through an elegant Yorkshire style. Hefty English accents are thoroughly used, even to the point of confusion. This can most pertinently be noticed with Bront&#1105;'s character Joseph, who carries a heavy accent. All of these devices accumulate to form the imagery of underlying passion that is threaded page by page. Personally, her ability to use such complex and yet detailed imagery to advance the plot astounds me. I would wholly recommend this novel to any individual seeking an understanding to humans' mysterious and controversial collision with love."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Recommended by several friends & was well worth the effort!

The Grand Tour had been progressively downclassed towards people with more limited means than wealthy aristocrats. Also domestic touring came in vogue. Within that development a distinctive subculture of \`pedestrianism' appears with middle class professionals eschewing safer choices for a mode of transport that was more risky and traditionally held in low esteem. The reasons for the rise of pedestrian travel are manifold: political anti-conformism, the opening up of the country to the spirit of rational enquiry, the ethos of pilgrimage, and the pursuit of aesthetic satisfactions in nature.Early Romantic walkers were likely under the spell of all of these impulses which is reflected in the montage-like nature of a lot of the travel writing from those years. Jarvis dwells only briefly on the prose as his focus is on the poetry. I may be doing injustice to a complex and sprawling argument but it seems to me there are two key ways in which the pedestrian experience was embodied in the work of Wordsworth, Coleridge and others. First, there is the adoption of blank verse (the unrhymed pentameter) as the preferred metrical structure \\"because it was here that the muscular rhythms indigenous both to walking and poetry were brought into intuitive correspondence.\\"Second is a particular aesthetic sensibility which connects to the rise of picturesqueness at the end of the 18th century. Jarvis stresses the playful nature of a picturesque gaze that is constantly engaged in experimentation and re-envisioning (as a counterweight to its tendency to judge natural scenes against certain inflexible ideals derived from Italian landscape artists). This playfulness, argues Jarvis, performatively contaminates a lot of the poetry of those days, as is evident from a certain aesthetic roughness, a resisting of argumentative or visionary closure, a tendency to indulge in the freely mixing of \\"the materials of observation with the materials of learning and memory and the materials of invention.\\" Just as the rhythmic qualities of blank verse suggest a powerful association with the regular alternation of right foot and left foot, so the improvisatory nature of the poetic narrative correlates with the sequential, disjointed texture of walking. Jarvis substantiates this by a detailed discussion of Wordsworth poems such as \`An Evening Walk', \`The Ruined Cottage', \`Salisbury Plain' and parts of \`The Prelude'. These observations also apply to Coleridge. As regards the use of blank verse, \\"there is, in fact, a remarkable caesura in Coleridge's poetic career that corresponds with the chronology of his life as an active walker: in the ten years of his wanderings he produced around twenty-five significant compositions in blank verse; after his return from Malta (...) I count only three finished poems in blank verse (...) the coincidence is striking.\\" Also Coleridge's ability to tailor the composition according to the physical pattern provided by a place is revealed.The focus is not exclusively on these two authors. There is a separate chapter on Dorothy Wordsworth and John Clare. And a final discussion on \`late Romantic voices', including Hazlitt, Keats and Hunt.All in all I found it a rich and worthwhile read. Jarvis' prose is supple and engaging. However, it seems to me the book originated as a collection of loosely connected papers which the author subsequently integrated into a more encompassing argument. This explains why at times the argument comes across as rather uneven, with concepts or references suddenly popping into focus and disappearing as quickly, never to be mentioned again. A pity it is also that Jarvis restricts his focus to Britain only. It would have been fascinating to validate his insights with important contemporaneous German pedestrian poets such as H&ouml;lderlin and Kleist.It is a pity that this book is so difficult to get hold of as the topic of pedestrianism is generating a broader interest. Rebecca Solnit put it on the map for a wider audience with her \`Wanderlust'. In addition there is an emergent, sustainability-oriented intersection of different research areas - anthropology (see Tim Ingold's work), landscape theory and landscape urbanism, and critical theory - in which the practice of walking plays a pivotal role."},{"Title":"The Little Web Cam Book","review":"Calling this book &quot;The Little Web Cam Book&quot; is a bit of a misnomer. The book is huge, totaling 356 pages including the index. It is crammed full of useful information, lists of webcam sites, and places where one can download everything you need except a camera.This is a great book! Ms Parker's writing style makes it seem like she is right there with you, explaining each portion. More advanced users will know which parts to skip over, and most chapters stand on their own, so you don't have to read every word to make sense of later chapters.This was good for me, since I was not the least bit interested in reading about the screen savers or how to make a photo my background. This part seemed to drag out, but that is from the viewpoint of an expert; if you have never done those things, you might need to spend the time reading about them. For that reason, the book spends quite a bit on the basics of these ideas. So if you still have the same background picture on your desktop that came with it, check out this portion of the book.Other chapters cover tips for setting up the cam and choosing the best spots for broadcasting. If you want to start another &quot;cat-cam&quot; or other pet-related site, it is worth reading her tips on how to make it exciting for your viewers even when the animals don't feel like being photographed. There are also some other considerations you might want to read about before you invite anyone and everyone into your home or office through a live webcam.Another section tells about how to use the still pictures you can capture with a cam to make GIF animations. This could be for fun, e-mail, or for your web page. The author also goes into creating and editing movies and how to insert GIF animations and movies into web pages. This could save you from tons of angry e-mail when your dog refuses to go near the webcam once it's live.There is a chapter on troubleshooting problems and it seems to be rather complete. Just about every problem I can imagine occuring is listed here with possible solutions and resources.I expected a list of other people who have webcam, but a nice feature I didn't expect was interviews with some of the pioneers and leaders in webcamming. This turned out to be quite a treat.Supplementary information in the book about videoconferencing was great. I didn't expect to find it here either; the author could have written that separately and she and the publisher could have made a lot more money selling it as another book. They didn't, so I think a &quot;hats off&quot; is in order. Thanks!"},{"Title":"The Little Web Cam Book","review":"One of the most popular Internet activities to make a splash on our screens recently has been that of &quot;webcamming.&quot; Just about anyone can now set up a suitable camera, including a video camera, and publish nearly real-time audio and video clips online for a variety of purposes for profit, fun, and pleasure. Elisabeth Parker has written The Little Web Cam Book to give members of the online community some real insight into how they can make creative use of this latest Web craze.Webcamming has really taken off during the last two years. Schools, businesses, companies, corporations, and news reporting services have gone online to provide a number of essential services such as news and weather reporting, online education, building security, Webcasting, Webconferencing, and the monitoring of children at home and in daycare facilities. Imagine if you will, being able to log on the Internet and check up on your kids at home or as they are being cared for by others from the comfort of your office! Other family members will be able to keep in touch hundreds or thousands of miles away! Hobbyists have also provided some thoughtful uses as well, such as wiring homes, offices, and other sites with cameras to provide all sorts of intriguing, but sometimes highly suspect video coverage!Webcamming has certainly made an impact on our society and Elisabeth Parker will walk her readers through the steps necessary to give them the opportunity experience this exciting technology firsthand. She makes a number of solid recommendations for buying cameras, software, and services, helping her readers to make the better choices and help them save time and money in the process. Many of the programs she reviews in the book are available online for immediate trial use. Buying, installation, and detailed operating instructions are provided to get readers up and running in the shortest amount of time. I can hardly wait to join in the fun myself!Parker's instruction, laced with humor, her own personal interest, and the illustrations of John Grimes makes this book fun, enjoyful, and easy to read. Plenty of creative ideas and resource information is provided - be sure to checkout the list of Webcam sites located at the back of the book! This book serves as an excellent introduction to webcamming and is must reading for anyone interested in learning about this innovative technology and how it can be put to exciting and productive use!"},{"Title":"The Little Web Cam Book","review":"If you want to get going with videoconferencing over Internet, and millions of people will in the next couple of years, this is the book to start with."},{"Title":"La Verdadera Historia de los Tres Cerditos!

My daughter enjoys this book because it is a humorous Wolf's versions of the &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot; her favorite children's classic. I like it because it presented a great sarcastic though honest parady of contemparary Media and American culture. You see according to the wolf, He really didn't mean to blow down the little pig's houses it was all an honest mistake, and the part about him being a big bad wolf? Just a media creation to jazz up his trial and sell more newspapers. Its rare to find a childrens book now a days that are even a little bit creative but this one is pure genius both in it's simplicity but also in the way it portrays the world around us. An outstanding childrens book for the whole family."},{"Title":"La Verdadera Historia de los Tres Cerditos! [With Cassette] = The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs!

The back cover includes an endorsement by Tom Hopkins, Master Sales Trainer, author of How to Master the Art of Selling. The title of the book suggested to me that it would be dealing with many areas of the security alarm business. But from front cover to back, it very heavily emphasizes professional salemanship. How to effectively find pro sales people, train them, help motivate them to increase sales. Most of this information about salesmanship is general - not particularly confined to the security alarm business. The words, &quot;salesperson&quot; or &quot;salepeople&quot; can be found on almost every page of this book. The author does have another book, &quot;The Formula for Selling Alarm Systems&quot; which he states will teach you how to sell alarm systems. He goes on to say it is the best alarm sales training book available today. So if alarm salesmanship is what you are interested in, that is the book you should probably get considering the author's credentials. &quot;Surviving in the Security Alarm Business&quot; is just another salesmanship book. This one, however, just doesn't come as highly recommended by the author. In fact, he uses &quot;Surviving in the Security Alarm Business&quot; to promote the other book including training videos and provides address &amp; phone number for ordering."},{"Title":"Bellowing in the common","review":"Petersen's raw, rare and spare style gets you right down to earth and into the elements after only two or three pages.

I had read everything else in the library remotely interesting by this point. I still remember I picked this title to start and was captivated by the realistic action and tantalizing hints of truth based on hard science. I devoured all the series within a few weeks and was disappointed to see several had been lost. Many of the books left me hungry to explore deeper into physics and the natural progression was \\"hard\\" science fiction. I later became an electrical engineer. Much SF requires I suspend my science understanding. I don't care to do that. I don't remember that the Rick Brant series takes any easy short cuts and seems carefully crafted. The situations are vivid and I still remember many of them after 35 years. I always wondered why the Rick Brant name doesn't get the recognition of Nancy Drew or the Hardy boys? It is certainly head and shoulders above anything else I discovered in the genre."},{"Title":"The Opium War through Chinese eyes","review":"This book deserves five stars. Not because it is an exhaustive account of the first war but because it restores the balance. We have many English language texts on this subject but Arthur Waley, the distinguished sinologist, has become, with this slim volume, an extremely good historian. Using Chinese sources, occasionally adding clarifications from elsewhere, he has achieved a delightful, wistful, plaintive, penetrative and endlessly readable slim volume that finally enables the non-Chinese language reader to enter into what really motivated officials and simple, if middle class, Chinese people in the opium war - the seemingly unbridgable gulf that to this day divides East and West is washed away in this collection of notes from Commissioner Lin's diary and elsewhere, recording what it was like to be there at the time, the perplexity of the citizen and revealing the Chinese, through their thoughtful comments and opinions, their hopes and fears, as precisely like you and I.

With that caveat in mind, Jesse James and the Civil War in Missouri is an interesting glance at the influence of the Civil War and Quantrill's Raiders on the infamous Frank and Jesse James.Given its goal of being a easy-to-read book, Dyer decent a good job of describing the divisions between Unionists and Confederate sympathizers in Missouri and the rather limited role the James Brothers played in the Civil War.

I have seen recent movies with vampires as their subject matter, and was not impressed. This book, however, took me by surprise.Mr. Cowan has captured the sadness that must exist for the mythical vampire. The loneliness of eternal life, and a life without permanent love. The sadness of taking a life to feed their blood thirst, and the sexual satisfaction of creating a lover.He also brings to light some brilliant images of fairies and sprites. Those mythical creatures that we would all like to believe in, but few do.The plot seems predictable at first, but there are several twists that get your attention, and make this book worth reading and re-reading. He also leaves this book open for a sequel. I would be first in line to buy a sequel when and if he writes it.I would recommend this book for anyone above the age of 12. I have a nine year old son, and I read some passages of the book to him, and he seemed entertained by it. I even recommend this to people who are afraid of, or have nightmares about vampires, because this book does much to show the inner workings of a vampires mind.

Releasing the Cycle of Escape.","review":"I became hooked on Story Waters books, \\"The Messiah Seed\\" and \\"You Are God, Get Over It!\\" within the past couple of months. I then purchased his phenomenal CD, \\"No Rules: A Rebellion of Love\\", which I listened to everyday for a week. The message within that recording, as well as Story's calming voice, freed me to relax and go within myself. It helped me to understand that I have a choice between not being myself by following all of the restrictive rules of society or being myself and choosing to enter into a brand new world of consciously creating my reality by choosing to allow myself to just \\"be\\".When I saw the title to Story's latest CD, \\"The Lie of Ascension\\", I felt both intrigued and a bit fearful. What was this about? The idea of ascension has intrigued me over the years. I desired a deeper understanding of what ascension is all about and was not disappointed when I heard Story speak about it.\\"The Lie of Ascension\\" is divided into three parts: 1. The Energy of Escape, 2. The Key to All Cages and 3. No Escape - As Above, So Below. Each part builds upon the previous one, creating a spiral of flowing ideas which are liberating and creative. I understand that Story's educational background is in Clinical Psychology, therefore I recognized the psychological process behind each part.What really excites me about this double CD-set is that I no longer feel the need to ascend. Ascension always occured to me whenever I was not happy with life and wanted to escape. Ascension equalled escape to me instead of being a natural spiritual process. Story puts everything about ascension into a balanced perspective which focuses on the idea that the spiritual and physical are one and the same. There is no separation. Because I understand that I hold the key that unlocks my self-limiting cage and allows me to joyfully walk away instead of fearfully escaping, I feel happier about my life and the need to struggle is not part of my reality anymore. I am understanding more about living in the NOW and embracing all of my wonderful emotions and the freedom of releasing the past and not worrying about the future. Ascension, as an escape, is a lie when I fail to understand that I am responsible for everything in my life. How liberating it is to know that I create everything in my reality - As Above, So Below. As Story says in this remarkable recording, \\"Ascension is no escape; there is nothing to escape from. Here is spiritual. Here is now. Here is physical. Here is where everything happens. Wake up and enjoy it!\\""},{"Title":"The Lie of Ascension. Be Now!

This book brilliantly presents superlative examples of why Stuart Davis is seen by artists &amp; art historians alike as one of the greatest American painters of the 20th Century. A thousand imitators have followed after Davis, trying to match his genius for both capturing and yet leading the American cultural zeitgeist. No one can match him: Davis is the master. Buy this book and see why. Better yet, buy multiples of this book: you will want THAT much to give your favorite people a treasure of a book from one of the few true diamonds amongst 20th century American artists, Stuart Davis. And have fun reveling."},{"Title":"Stuart Davis","review":"This little book originally sold at a cover price of $1.50 - I'd say that's about what it's worth today (2013).

I made a mistake buying it - probably not paying enough attention to details about the book."},{"Title":"Pay dirt;: Farming & gardening with composts,","review":"Well written and very readable. This was the beginning of the organic gardening movement in the United States. J.I. Rodale founded his magazine 'Organic Gardening' on these principles, and the rest is history. Very informative."},{"Title":"Pay dirt;: Farming & gardening with composts,","review":"This vivid classic by Robert Rodale should be on everyone's bookshelf who is concerned about the food they eat, the land it is grown on, and especially organic gardening or farming.It was one of the first and most definitive books, not only about organics, but the vast importance of feeding the soil to produce nutritionally sound food.Organic farming/gardening is more than not using chemicals. It is about working with and within the cycle of nature to produce optimum results. Composting, conserving and feeding the soil are primary principles in this partnership between man and nature. Pay Dirt expresses this eloquently, and provides the proof and know how behind the organic approach. Good dirt pays dividends in many ways, as Rodale makes clear. Unforgettable."},{"Title":"Pay dirt;: Farming & gardening with composts,","review":"I bought this book on a whim when I took a Master Composter class, and it's a fascinating read. Rodale is largely credited with bringing organic practises to the United States, and he wrote this book apparently shortly after returning from Europe, where he'd been doing his research. His observations always are tied into his reasoning, and at the time there was very little science to back up what he saw regarding health (human, animal & plant) and organic food. Now the science is starting to prove his thoughts were right.The jist of this is that using compost transfers nutrients into plants, and that these nutrients are not simple. We are only just beginning to understand this, maybe we are only beginning to understand that we understand very little. Mr. Rodale grasps this concept, examines the science of his time, as well as organic practises from all over the planet, and comes up with some remarkable suggestions for the home gardner and the farmer alike. His writing is a lot of fun, too."},{"Title":"Keepers of the Ark: An Elephants' View of Captivity","review":"This books reveals what most people -- who have ever cared to ask -- know what is involved in keeping and maintaining elephants in captivity.This author's behind the scenes look at the inherent cruelty involved in most elephant related training practices is especially applicable when elephants are trained for rides and circus type acts (even if it is not called a circus).I believe that anyone who frequents zoos or circuses needs to read this book to make a more informed decision on the PR campaigns and practices they are supporting by buying tickets for admission.We are told about the education and conservation that they purport to support, but is this true for the mass majority of them?Read it and really find out \\"When Elephants Weep\\""},{"Title":"Keepers of the Ark: An Elephants' View of Captivity","review":"I found this book to be nothing short of a gripping and devestating account of the dilemma facing captive elephants and their keepers. Ryan writes out of highly personal convinction and candor. The result is an intimate and revealing memoir I found difficult to put down. This is not a comprehensive guide to elephant captivity or training methods and should not be purchased as such. Instead, it should be read as one man's experience and eventual confrontation with a sad and pervasive mentality surrounding treatment of captive animals. Ryan succeeds in making us (those of us with compassion for our fellow animals) frustrated, horrified and desperate to believe in an alternative to violent methods of keeping elephants.My hearty congratulations to the author for his courage.

I worked in one of the shows and have seen animals hit, worked to exhaustion and withheld food in order to get them to perform.

But I was also taken aback at how lousy the editing was! There were spelling errors, grammar errors, run on sentences, just like as if it was taken directly from someone's notebook with no editing what so ever. Considering that the author really lays into the management people above him while he worked in the WAP for not having any college degrees (while he did), it rings as being pretty hypocritical that the published work looks so bad from the grammar standpoint.And the book really is too expensive for a 180+ page paperback.The author gets B, and the publisher a D-.I would suggest checking it out from the library instead of buying it."},{"Title":"Keepers of the Ark: An Elephants' View of Captivity","review":"This is a great book! it describes the daily happenings in the African Elephant Barn at the San Diego Wild Animal Park."},{"Title":"Keepers of the Ark: An Elephants' View of Captivity","review":"I must admit that reading the review I wrote before is quite funny.

Containing several separate stories, this book has something to arouse both males and females. Realistic watercolor and graphite b&amp;w images depict a variety of sexual scenarios definately on the kinky side. As an artist myself, I can appreciate the skill and time that must have gone into this book. As a sexual being, I responded to the eroticism. (v.2 has been published as well)"},{"Title":"Shadow and Light: Volume Two (Shadow & Light)","review":"The two stories in this slim book continue Quinn's remarkable exercise in adult visual storytelling. In fact, the first one continues a piece from volume 1 of the series, promising a longer development of the same characters and plot. The second story in this volume differs from others so far: it adds a second woman to center stage, but takes away some of the consensual tone of earlier stories.The memorable realism of Quinn's first volume is still here. That includes realistic plots, without exotic costumes, locales, or paraphenalia. It also includes the elegant, naturalistic style of his pencil drawing. Because his figures and scenes are generally so credible, they seduce the viewer into suspension of disbelief when emphasis requires minor exaggerations of anatomy. One improvement in this book over the first is that it contains only two stories, down from three, while keeping the same page count. That gives more room for each story to develop and avoids the rushed pace I found in the first volume.If you're an adult and wish to be entertained accordingly, this has my highest recommendation. It's juicy and literate. And, although there are some harsh moments, there's none of the violence or aggression that puts off so many readers.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Shadow and Light: Volume Two (Shadow & Light)","review":"I simply love all of the volumes in this series.

They get you into music making right away. No wasted time. The examples and lessons are easy to grasp, and the CD's let you hear what you're tying to accomplish. Academic music theory is taught secondarily. This book takes you right into that great blues sound. By the time I got 3/4 through the book, I couldn't believe what I could play. I love to listen to the CD just for musical enjoyment."},{"Title":"Blues Acoustic Guitar Method (Progressive)","review":"I have read some criticism of this book that it is too basic. I think that's wrong on two counts. First, if you go all the way through the book, you'll learn a lot of chops. Maybe not terribly advanced chops, but you'll be able to play some really cool-sounding stuff, and you'll have enough knowledge to be able to improvise and start expanding on what you've learned. Second, I can't tell you how many &quot;Beginner Blues&quot; books I've bought that were way, way beyond what the beginning student could play. Even this book would be a serious challenge for someone who is just learning to play guitar; but it would be a challenge, not a frustrating, tantalizing impossibility. I've been playing for over four years now, and I've learned quite a bit of acoustic blues, including stuff that is a lot more difficult than anything you'll see here. Nevertheless, I picked up several nifty tricks from this book. In fact, I pulled it out just this weekend and tried out some things I hadn't gotten to yet (I've now gone through the entire book at least once). I've already built one 12-bar example into a fairly cool little song. The book was easily worth the price I paid. I have three books from this Progressive series; they have all been good. If I have a complaint, it's that only one thing in the book, a fingerpicking solo, goes beyond a single 12-bar. Sure, it's good to learn 12-bar chops, and then start improvising on them. But a few examples of complete songs, with some simple solos and fills and runs, would have been nice. I'm experienced enough to be able to create this stuff myself; less advanced players will probably feel like they've been left a little short. But look at the price! Is it worth such a small amount to be able to learn some cool sounding blues? I say yes."},{"Title":"Blues Acoustic Guitar Method (Progressive)","review":"I am very disapointed by this book, I sent it back to Amazon for refund 10 minutes after having opened the book. The content is poor, it mainly deals with techniques like hammer-on, slide, shuffle,I-IV-V etc. All this information can be freely accessed from the Net. There is nothing about what the blues really is and how it works (the first chapter dealing with the blues scale is...the appendix, can you believe that?). All examples are with open string chords, you want go farther than the 5th fret, which is IMHO a very bad approach. All in all the book may be worth the money only if you never ever played guitar and want to start with the blues."},{"Title":"Blues Acoustic Guitar Method (Progressive)","review":"This book was excellent. I am an advanced player and was playing blues in no time at all. It will take a beginner a little more work but it will be well worth it. I have also purchased other books by Koala publications and found them to be excellent. Having the cd to listen to is what makes this book so good."},{"Title":"Blues Acoustic Guitar Method (Progressive)","review":"I have had this for a few weeks and was hoping to use it in addition to my regular lessons. Have been learning for about 2 months now so this is from the point of view of a beginner. Here are my thoughts:- not sure I like the structure. I think the shuffle stuff is the easiest but it starts at lesson 3. The first lessons are open chord strummers but it's very hard to hear what it should sound like since these tracks are a full band (which admittedly sounds good) making it hard for a beginner to pick out what they need to hear. And why start the second of these exercises (8) with the dreaded F chord?- these early lessons don't include tab just A6, D6 etc but the tab comes in later. Would be nice if it was all the way through given there is an empty staff doing nothing in lessons 1-3. Basically i just want to llok in 1 place and see what i need to play.- some of the chord boxes are weird eg A on page 7 shows the 6th string is played, is this normal or something they have added? Same with Am on p.12.- the Lead lesson (4) starts off well and uses the basic e-scale and has some easy exercises to begin. Here it is actually easier to hear what you need to play since it is just 1 guitar. It was easy to master and sounds quite bluesy. The first combined shuffle/lead exercise (34) includes a closed (B-B6) bar which involves a massive piny stretch to the 6th fret which is currently impossible....wtf! A later exercise (42) has a more simple shuffle although I appreciate this is in A and not E.- the CD is giving my mac grief. I am tying to burn it but only managed to get halfway through the track before it started grinding and not doing much requiring a force quit. Also the CD is not registered on the net (unlike some Dummies ones) so you get no album information (hint in itunes right click on the cd and click get info)Anyway that is about as far as I have got. Hopefully this will get easier with time but thus far I am not a huge fan."},{"Title":"The American Racing Manual 2005: The Official Encyclopedia of Thoroughbred Racing","review":"My husband was thrilled to get this for his birthday.

On one hand anyone would feel sorry for Roxon, who died alone in a crumby New York apartment surrounded by giant cockroaches, and so young, only 41, and she died of asthma which thank God very few people die of. One has the feeling that if only she felt able to share her life with someone she might have lived; as Milliken hints there are some unanswered questions about her death.However on the whole the book is a colonnade of sustained joy, for Roxon's life was an extraordinary one and she seems on every turn to have found the most fun available. Plus she lived during a great period in Australian history, finding herself at a very young age (as a schoolgirl) part of Brisbane's chic, avant-garde \\"Pink Elephant\\" crowd, a young girl in a wild scene of poetry, homosexuality and small, intensive galleries and late night cafes and bars. She never looked back, becoming a top journalist in Sydney where she worked for the city's top paper, the Morning Herald, where eventually the corporation sent her to New York City. In 1960, just in time for Camelot and the Kennedys and the beginning of the Twist and Nureyev and Fonteyn and, finally, the scene where she found her niche, the rock/art back room at Max's Kansas City. Nearly everyone loved her, for she was not only beautiful and brainy but she had a shrewd, native generosity, and helped out her fellow writers wherever she could. She befriended Linda Eastman, who broke her heart by ignoring her after her marriage to Paul McCartney was brokeraged. And she encountered another Australian wild woman, the provovateuse Germaine Greer, who wrote THE FEMALE EUNUCH in 1971, dedicating it to Lillian as most of us have forgotten by now. All these tangled stories and scenes Milliken lays out like the pro he is, and yet never losing sight of his main thread, the way Roxon took to innovation and the experimental like a dog to water.As a bonus, Milliken included a shrewd selection of some of the highlights of Roxon's famous ENCYCLOPEDIA, now apparently sadly out of print, as well as some pertient and previously uncollected articles that were published before her death. This small anthology of Roxon's work makes us long for an edition of her critical slash gossip writing in toto."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"I read this book some months ago but didn't write a review because I had nothing to say at the time. However, a few friends of mine have asked what I thought of it, so here goes. I thought this comic novel about two friends starting an original concept for a magazine was mediocre at best. The development of the plot is too slow and the secondary characters aren't well developed. The mishaps and disasters that occur at Tom's party are the highlight of the novel -- everything else revolves around the circumstances that lead to the development of Bite magazine and the misadventures that transpire when they work on the same. I think the novel is somewhat autobiographical, for the two main characters of the novel had thought of writing a novel together, not unlike the two authors of this novel (C.J. Tosh is a pseudonym). All I can say to my friends and other potential readers is that Bite has its fun moments, and said moments reminded me a lot of the show Will and Grace, but the overall book is nothing original or special."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"I was hooked after reading the first few pages. The engaging dialogue has the humor and juiciness of Sex and The City, but the characters in Bite have more depth and authenticity.

I didn't want the book to end!"},{"Title":"Bite","review":"Many of us think that working at a glossy magazine is glamorous. It's not.

The characters are people we want to know and whose circle we want to join. Their world is hip and a bit incestuous. They do what us married folk miss (or missed altogether) like drinking martinis on a Tuesday night (not evening) and having sex with repairmen on housecalls. The writing, too, is smart, funny and sexy as the authors describe why true love isn't easy to find in NYC. Whether we yearn for the shmuck or forge a platonic marriage with our housemate, the romance and relationship is doomed before the first kiss. Don't think for a second that the book is weepy. While the writers show the characters' soft spots, they are still witty and at times cunning, if not ruthless.If you're looking to nosh on a good book, read \\"Bite\\"."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"I started reading this book during my vacation and once I started, I couldn't stop.

But they aren't happy, and luckily one of them gets fired for a reason I can't imagine anyone in the hepcat magazine world getting fired for: an untrue rumor that she got to have sex with a movie star. It's a lucky firing, because it forces Sam and Tom to reexamine their happymaking first principles. What would really make them happy, they decide, is to start their own magazine. And that's the book. They start their magazine, kinda with breaks for bedhopping by all of the characters, each christened with generic names that I couldn't keep straight.Still, I ripped through this soapy roman a clef (even though it could have been shorter), which seemed so clefy that if I ever met the authors I'd think: I know what time you get to work, where, when, and how much you drink, and how you aspire to have sex. But it didn't really have much of a point (by which I mean a novelistic purpose or groovy commentary on a social class - here, the fabulous one involved with New York glossies). Instead, it seemed like pure wish fulfillment by \\"C.J. Tosh,\\" one half of whom is a writer for a magazine I scrutinize like the Talmud: Entertainment Weekly. But good on them for getting a book contract to write up their dreams, and hey, I shelled out hardcover bucks for it.Best scene: as they're developing the magazine, Tom gets everyone together for what turns out to be the worst party ever, in which everybody involved with the start-up realizes that they inappropriately love or hate at least one other person involved with the start-up.

Her best friend Tom Sanders edits the lifestyle column for Profit magazine. Sam is assigned to learn whether Gibson had hair plugs, but instead gets in trouble because rumors fly that she lost her reporting impartiality by becoming too close with Russell Crowe.Tom feels bad for his pal so he takes her out on a martini lunch to drown her sorrows. A few drinks later, Tom proposes that they combine their expertise and begin their own magazine. Thus Bite is created as an entertainment magazine that emphasizes Hollywood sex and fun in that order. Bringing other artistic but ennui pals into the fold, Bite begins to take shape in spite of the eccentricity and sexual inclinations of the staff until treachery threatens to destroy the project before the first issue is published.This is a biting satirical look at the glamour magazine world. The story line is amusing as the lead duo struggles with leading the publication rather than segments. The support cast is stereotypical, but mostly as a means of adding humor to the lighthearted romp. Fans of chick lit tales will appreciate this insider back room look at the goings on of a magazine trying to release its first edition in a competitive back biting world.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Meet Martin Luther King, Jr. (Step-Up Paperback Books)","review":"I have mixed opinions this book. I think the writing style is for children ages 5-8. It tells the story of MLK in a very compelling and interesting way for children. The problem I have with it is that it is written to children who lived in a completely different world than children live in today (at least in my region). Everything is written about blacks and whites. The concept of breaking the world into two races really does not exist in my children's world. I almost felt that it made them start seeing differences in their friends that they did not notice before. I don't know that it's a good thing. Also, the book uses the \\"n\\" word which caught me by surprise - I'm not sure I wanted to have that conversation with a 4 yo.

De Kay104 pages, BiographyMeet Martin Luther King, was a very interesting book. I know that this book has been used by the Princeton Review to help teach nonreaders to read. While the topic is great and the effort is even better, I feel that this may not be the best book for such an important activity. The book is clearly stated as being for a fourth grade audience; however the sentence structure is more along the line of a pre-school level. The use of punctuation is horrible and just flat out wrong. I don't know if a comma was used in the entire book. I just know that if I had a fourth grade son or daughter, or a high school senior for that matter, I would prefer they learn sentence structure and language a bit better than this book portrays.As previously mentioned the ideas portrayed in this book are wonderful. The struggles that were going on at the time are exemplified through the great efforts of Martin Luther's life long battles to help eliminate discrimination. The portrayal of the life of Dr. King, while shown through a fine lined pen, is very useful in illustrating the major points of his life. I feel the purpose of the book is met, and the story is told. Also, the fact that the book is readable to a fourth grader is helpful in teaching the nonreaders of our country.Depending on your purpose as a reader this may or may not be the book for you. It is a one sided illustration of the life and a poor level of writing at the same time.

While the Roman Catholic Church holds a rather defined view of the sacramental presence (compared to the Orthodox) it is well worth noting that the west approaches many topics with its own concepts, which is not something to be looked down upon or rejected as &quot;a tradition of men&quot;. Shea's book is another of those which Catholic apologists will want to have to give away. It's cheap and accurate, as well as persuasive.

It is hardly exhaustive of the topic, as that is not what the author was attempting. A good companion would be Scott Hahn's tape &quot;The Fourth Cup&quot;. For a good understanding of the belief in the Eucharistic Presence, start with Catholic authors. Otherwise, such writers as William Webster and Jame R. White (who is anti-Catholic) as another has recommended without revealing these authors slant against the Church, might confuse searchers by presenting some very misunderstood ideas by outsiders incapable (&amp; often not desirous) of understanding &amp; then allege that they are expounding upon the Catholic teaching. Tim Staples is another excellent author for follow-up to this one who was once evangelical but became Catholic for the True Presence of Jesus in the Eucharist."},{"Title":"This Is My Body: An Evangelical Discovers The Real Presence","review":"All of the magnificent cathedrals of Europe were based upon one fact- that Christ God became present to humanity on the altar and was eaten by the faithful every divine liturgy. The architects and builders sought to pay homage to Christ's humility to come to them in the simple forms of bread and wine. Heaven and earth meet in this act. When you realize this basic fact, that the real presence is the heart of two thousand years of worship, then you begin to understand the perspective of Christian theology and worship. You also realize why the modern notions of worship, which are usually not more than emotionalism and bubblegum self-help, fall far short of the rich heritage of Christianity East and West.Shea's work is a great place to start if you're interested in the traditional, biblical view of the Eucharist and matter in general. Shea's book is another of those that Catholic and Orthodox (and maybe Lutheran) apologists will want to have to give away. It's cheap and accurate, as well as persuasive. While the Roman Catholic Church holds a rather defined view of the sacramental presence (compared to the Orthodox) it is well worth noting that the west approaches many topics with its own concepts, which is not something to be looked down upon or rejected as \\"a tradition of men\\". For a more detailed study, see \\"Eucharist\\" by Louis Bouyer. For general critiques of Protestant anti-Catholic arguments, see Shea's other book, \\"By What Authority?\\" or for an Orthodox approach to Protestantism, see Jordan Bajis' \\"Common Ground\\". \\"The Lamb's Supper\\" by Hahn was a nice introduction to liturgical and eucharistic theology.If you want to dig even deeper to realize what weight the Eucharist bears upon ecclesiology, McPartlan's booksSacrament of Salvation: An Introduction to Eucharistic Ecclesiology, andThe Eucharist Makes the Churchare fundamental, as is the newly reissued Eucharist and Church Fellowship in the First Four Centuries by Werner Elert. You might want to check out these as well:Heavenly Participation: The Weaving of a Sacramental Tapestry,The Hidden Manna: A Theology of the Eucharist,Jesus and the Jewish Roots of the Eucharist: Unlocking the Secrets of the Last Supper,The Lamb's Supper: The Mass as Heaven on EarthandThis Is My Body: Luther's Contention for the Real Presence in the Sacrament of the Altar. You see, it all ties together- Eucharist, Incarnation, Forgiveness, Church, Worship, Passover and Eschatology.The main thing is to pray, receive the Eucharist, and study for yourself understanding that what we believe is not a product of our own genius, but rather the result of those who have gon before us, for good or ill. There are no missing links in the history of Eucharistic theology. Take some time to review the data first hand; pick up the Fathers and the New Testament, pray the ancient liturgies. But don't forget that this book is a fine place to start."},{"Title":"This Is My Body: An Evangelical Discovers The Real Presence","review":"There are many differences between the Christian faith of history and the Christian faith of contemporary Evangelicalism. Perhaps nowhere is the contrast made clearer than in the doctrine of the Real Presence. An affront to many Evangelicals, the belief that the body and blood of Jesus Christ was made present in the celebration of the Holy Eucharist was at the center of early Christian worship. Many Evangelicals, frustrated by the immature state of their own worship, have begun to explore the historic liturgies of the Church and are soon confronted by the question of Christ's presence and the rejection of the modernist assumptions underlying their own tradition.For those on this path, Mark P. Shea's This Is My Body provides a wonderful introduction to the theology behind the Real Presence in general and the Catholic understanding of this doctrine in particular. Shea, himself a former Evangelical, is well versed in that tradition's objections to the doctrine and concentrates on five commonly raised issues: the ban on human sacrifice, the Mass adding to Christ's sacrifice, the ban on the drinking of blood, the Eucharist as idolatry and salvation by works, and the Eucharist as a merely symbolic gesture. In an impressive treatment of these issues, Shea covers much ground in a limited space and demonstrates the Evangelical position makes no sense either biblically or historically.One point of disagreement for some Protestants might be that Shea has constructed a \\"straw man\\" by not considering the varying positions on the issue within Protestantism. However, Shea quite explicitly states he is countering the Evangelical position only and not all possible positions held within Protestantism. He points out the major figures of the Reformation all held some doctrine of the Real Presence (albeit different from the Catholic position) and even quotes John Calvin approvingly as evidence.While certainly not exhaustive, This Is My Body provides a great starting point for inquirers without any hint of polemic. Given Shea's carefully constructed presentation, many Evangelicals upon reading it may move towards the Church of history and reply to the \\"The Body of Christ\\" with a hearty \\"Amen!\\""},{"Title":"This Is My Body: An Evangelical Discovers The Real Presence","review":"This is a nice, short readable book that could be quite helpful for Evangelicals and others who wish to understand the Catholic teaching regarding the Eucharist. Mark Shea demonstrates the holes in may of the objections to that teaching that he discovered when examining it as an evangelical himself. Far from being a scary polemic as many apologetic works can be, this is good-natured discussion of the subject.It's a short book, but a good introduction."},{"Title":"This Is My Body: An Evangelical Discovers The Real Presence","review":"Mark Shea is one of the most talented writers of Christian apologetics on the scene today. While this is more of a personal journey than a scholarly study, Mark is forceful and honest in his assessment of the evidence and compellingly clear in his presentation and arguments. After reading his work you either have to agree or disagree -- there is no room for \\"Gee, that's nice\\".A great read for anyone who is either considering the Catholic Church's claims or is convinced of the truth but struggling to explain it to others.Also recommended are Mark's \\"Making Senses out of Scripture\\" and \\"By What Authority\\". He can be found as a regular contributor on EWTN or on Catholic Exchange's website (where he does a regular PodCast)."},{"Title":"This Is My Body: An Evangelical Discovers The Real Presence","review":"The author does an excellent job of explaining the scriptural and logical reasons why the Bible alone does not contain the fullness of the faith.

Our lord who is present in the Eucharist. This is what Catholics believe Real Presence,This means Jesus is there. Body, Blood ,Soul and Divinity. There is no longer one crumb that is bread,there is not one drop that is wine. If you are Catholic read this, if you are not read this , it just might open your eyes. This thing we call the Real Presence is penetrating, uplifting And will challenge your faith and mind. READ THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"This Is My Body: An Evangelical Discovers The Real Presence","review":"This little pamphlet takes us on a flyover view of the critical difference between Protestant and Apostolic (Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Coptic, etc) churches. Mr. Shea writes the story as his personal journey to understanding and, not so much conversion as fulfillment. Like Thomas Howard inEvangelical Is Not Enough: Worship of God in Liturgy and Sacrament, Mr. Shea sees his evangelical beginnings as just that, a beginning. The final destination for both, when taking their evangelical understanding to it's logical conclusion, was not a new form of evangelicalism but instead the Roman Catholic church.Beginning with an itemized list of objections that he held against the Roman Catholic teaching on the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, Mr. Shea walks us through the evangelical path he followed to see the false assumptions underpinning those objections. Using scripture and the earliest writings of the Apostolic fathers, he shows that the real presence is not something invented in the Roman Catholic church of the dark ages but a core doctrine of the church from its beginning. He continues the historical journey all the way to the \\"reformers,\\" Calvin and Luther, to support the real presence view (likely a shock to most Protestants in general). Following that thought through to its implications about apostolic authority and then to implications of apostolic authority to the papacy, we are given insight into how his house of cards fell around their foundation of questionable assumptions.Mr. Shea admits this brief little work is not intended as a full blown apologetic. The intent is that we might \\"taste and see that the Lord is good\\" and then explore what more we might be missing in the rejection of this most important of doctrines. Jesus said, \\"unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life within you.\\" It is imperative that we, as Christians claiming to love and follow Him, should answer this question in our own hearts. The stakes are high if we neglect so great a salvation. Mr. Shea's little treatise is a good place to start and the suggested reading he provides at the end will give you further direction in study.This question alone is paramount to understand in the dialog between Catholics and Protestants. No matter where you end your search, this little book will give you a deeper understanding of Christians in the other camp. If you understand no other distinguishing doctrine, you will want to understand this one. Mark Shea has given a concise and immensely readable little guidebook. Well worth the few minutes and few dollars it will take to read it."},{"Title":"This Is My Body: An Evangelical Discovers The Real Presence","review":"Once again I HIGHLY recommend a book written by Mark Shea. I am a devout Roman Catholic of 20 years and have never heard an exposition on the Blessed Sacrament like this. Now when I attend Mass I am able to truly participate in all that happens. Too bad we don't hear these clear teachings on most important facets of our faith from the pulpit but, God does provide and has given us Mr. Shea to do so in our day. Thank you and praise Jesus Christ!"},{"Title":"This Is My Body: An Evangelical Discovers The Real Presence","review":"I had a Protestant Christian upbringing that vilified the Catholic Church, but in my adult life I've met people and read books that made me re-think that perception. So this book was quite appealing to me, as I was hoping to have some of my own concerns about Catholicism answered. Please note (as the title implies, but doesn't shout) the book addresses only the Eucharist and not Catholicism as a whole.Overall, I appreciated the author's approach. He shared his personal journey rather than taking a \\"case for Catholicism\\" approach. While many people would try to tear apart an argument, they will not challenge a person sharing their own experience.The content of this book was disappointing, though. His reflection on the Eucharist doctrine was good in some parts but not all. He addresses 5 Protestant complaints against the Eucharist doctrine that the bread and wine \\"become\\" the body and blood of Christ:1 - God forbids human sacrifice2 - Christ's sacrifice was only once, not to be repeated3 - Drinking blood is forbidden4 - It is salvation by works5 - Its meaning is only symbolicI felt that he addressed each protest except #4 well, which was disappointing for me, because my own protest went unanswered. When he arrived at that section, he went off on a rabbit trail instead, and I can only conclude that there must be a better answer still out there."},{"Title":"This Is My Body: An Evangelical Discovers The Real Presence","review":"This is a wonderful little book. Mike Aquilina says of it: \\"once you've made it to the end, pass the book along to a friend, and buy at least five more, for all the family members and co-workers and neighbors who need it.\\" I think this is great advice."},{"Title":"This Is My Body: An Evangelical Discovers The Real Presence","review":"This short little book looks more like a long pamphlet, but don't be deceived by its size. Shea's book presents a thorough defense of the doctrine of the Real Presence of the Eucharist, a teaching that is often difficult for Protestant Christians (and first-century Jews).But Shea, coming from an Evangelical background himself, gets that. He is well-versed in the most common Protestant objections and in this book uses the form of Thomas Aquinas to respond to each with deftness and logic, charity and understanding.This is the perfect book to pass on to someone curious or skeptical about the Eucharist. It's small, accessible, enjoyable, and cheap ($6!)."},{"Title":"This Is My Body: An Evangelical Discovers The Real Presence","review":"This book is absolutely worth the time and effort of study.Before rushing to judgement or deciding on whose position is that of a strawman's, let us honestly face the fact that there have always been more than one \\"Jesus\\". Although there have always been one \\"Historical Jesus\\". And which one of them do you believe? A Good Moral Teacher? A Prophet Who was Saved From Crucifiction by God? A God? An Angel?1)We Catholics and Eastern Orthodox brothers believe that He is the One Who really meant what He had said, and Who always said what He had meant. Therefore He really meant it while He was saying THIS IS MY BODY and THIS MY BLOOD..2)Yet there are those new breed believers who attempt to call themselves as evangelicals, and who have been around for only last two hundred years. And they believe a jesus who hardly mean what he says, and who is very unlikely to say what he really means.. And definitely he never means while he was saying; \\"this is my body, this is my blood\\"..That's why this book is a great help for Christians(Catholics and Eastern Orthodoxes) and Evangelicals to understand who they are and why they don't believe in the same Jesus...It would be great help for Evangelical bretheren (in Noah only! and definitely not in Christ!!) to come to understand WHY and HOW they apostated from original doctrines of Reformation (such as Baptismal regeneration, Infant Baptism, Perpetual Virginity of Mary, Immaculate Conception of Mary, Sinlessness of Mary, That Mary is The Mother of God etc.). Then they would understand that they are not true even to the roots of Reformation, never mind the early christianity..Granted, their jesus christ is very close and pretty much look like Real Jesus Christ. Nevertheless these two are not the same. But you might mistake this anti-christ for the real one. And if possible this evangelical christ might even deceive the very chosen one.Dear Greek and Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic bretheren don't be deceived by the anti-christ!!!!!Serve the Eucharistic Lord!!!!"},{"Title":"This Is My Body: An Evangelical Discovers The Real Presence","review":"this short book (63 pages), is hardly worth the time and effort of study. It builds a strawman position that supposedly is held by objectors of transubstantiation and then attempts to tear down those positions. No where do we get into the theological interpretations held either by modern Biblical expostiors or diverse views held by the early church fathers. For those that wish to examine the Eucharist, I would suggest either books by William Webster or James R.White."},{"Title":"Apartment in Athens","review":"His 1945 APARTMENT IN ATHENS may lack the dazzling structurations of his recently rediscovered and greatly celebrated novella THE PILGRIM HAWK, but it is told with the same crystalline prose and is perhaps a deeper study of character. Mr. and Mrs. Helianos are a couple living in Nazi-occupied Athens forced to share their apartment with a melancholy German officer; vaguely mistreated by him, they learn to bear up under their hardships for a good year. Then he leaves for a vacation in Germany and returns behaving suddenly much more gently and kindly towards them, a change of heart that signals disaster for the lives of all of them. The story, inspired by an anecdote told by a Greek freedom fighter to Wescott, is perhaps not as dense as you'd like on first reading (there are none of the sort of Jamesian twists we might expect), but the difficult ethical positions of the Helianoses become clearer the more you think about the work later. This short novel is a very sophisticated study of the problems and evils inherent in human sympathy during a time of war."},{"Title":"Apartment in Athens","review":"What makes this small masterpiece trouble your sleep is the brilliant way in which Glenway Westcott portrayed marriage, intimacy, and the essential decency of the Helianos couple...each of which would prove their downfall. Mr. and Mrs. Helianos' profound misjudgement of their brutal guest originates in their belief in a certain threshhold of humanity below which real people do not fall. But people do, and the portrayal of the Nazi officer billeted in their house is chilling, to say the least. What keeps the reader up at night is the realization that he would have acted as the Helianos' did...and been just as wrong as they were.Ah, if this had been merely a war story, tragically told, it would be nothing--there are thousands. But Wescott's prose is a marvel. The Helianos marriage emerges as a series of compromises made first in resentment, later out of laziness, and lastly, with love. Their (and their children's) descent into semi-starvation is so subtly, so relentlessly portrayed. And Mrs. Helianos is the most complete female character to emerge from American literature during those war years--she's marvelously mediocre and whiney at the beginning of this nightmare, and a miracle when she emerges. We see her on that kitchen floor, the linoleum flooded with heat and light, as she pieces together her husband's smuggled toilet paper letter. When she rises with the little pieces in her hand, we are seeing a new creature, a truly Athenian goddess, descending from Olympus to avenge us all. Wescott was a genius."},{"Title":"Apartment in Athens","review":"Interpersonal and inner conflicts during wartime are so abundant that a reader might think the easiest way for a novelist to find material is to pick a war. But what turns a war novel into something timeless depends on the artistry of the writer; with Apartment in Athens we get World War II in Wescott's way. The genius of this novel is that only two shots are fired--one \\"off scene.\\" In other words, Wescott does not use violence to move the plot forward; the brutality of war takes place all in the dialogue, that is, in the sensitive emotions and nuanced moods which transfer between people during conversation. On the surface, a Greek couple, Mr. and Mrs. Helianos, become domestic slaves in their own small apartment which they are forced to share with Captain Ernst Kalter, a Nazi. The conversations among them offer the finest details of human interaction under pressure.Numerous times while reading Apartment in Athens, I paused to marvel at Wescott's craft: his ability to ratchet up the tension between Kalter and the Helianoses and their young children, Alex and Leda. Wescott's novel is a \\"classic realist\\" text in that the moral choice is very clear: His readership will not side with people who have clearly chosen cruelty and domination, the Nazis. But no one in the novel is a stereotype. Kalter has a human side which leaves the reader breathless; in fact, the climax of the plot might very well be that the German officer could have saved himself if he had recognized his own humanity. Through Kalter's betrayal of Nikolas Helianos, Wescott shows us that the tragedy of war is best illustrated in the failure of individual personal relationships, a failure characterized by Kalter's blindness to the opportunity to exercise compassion for himself and others.Regarding the techniques a writer uses to raise the tension, Wescott made the Helianoses of above average intelligence and thus excruciatingly aware of what they face; Mr. and Mrs. Helianos have distinctly individual interior monologues which reveal their thought processes in realistic psychological flow. To craft Ernst Kalter, Wescott used the limited consciousness of the unreliable narrator in order to show the reader the full extent of Kalter's lack of insight into his own moral choices. To move the plot forward, and to blend the thoughts of characters with descriptive passages, Wescott only lightly employed the omniscient narrator's explanatory power."},{"Title":"Apartment in Athens","review":"This novel was published in 1945 and tells the harrowing tale of the Helianos family in Athens during the German occupation of Greece. Nikolas Helianos is a middle-aged part-owner and editor of a publishing house. He and his wife have a ten-year-old daughter Leda and a twelve-year-old son Alex. Their twenty-year-old son Cimon died in a battle at Mount Olympus in 1941. Mrs Helianos has reached the point of desperation of war when nothing else matters except the survival of her loved ones.Nikolas Helianos, a sedentary and philosophical man, does not participate in the underground or any sort of organised resistance to the occupiers of Greece. His relatives let him know that they consider him a coward and he is therefore particularly despondent when his family have to take a German officer, Ernst Robert Kalter, to live in their apartment. Nikolas sees that this is bound to bring disgrace as things stand between him and his kinsmen and he knows that it is the weak who are timid and conciliatory. Now in the actual physical presence of Kalter he is less than ever able to correct his character although he knows how deeply his wife hates the invaders of Greece since they took her first and best child's life.But little does Nikolas know how this forced confinement with the enemy is to turn out in fact and how the heroic Helianos' are later to speak of him, if not a true hero, at least a martyr.The serenity, moderateness and lack of sensation of the plot are worthy of a true Greek tragedy. The protagonists are conducting a psychological war against the enemy, building interior defences behind the mask of obedience and submission like walls to protect their lives."},{"Title":"Apartment in Athens","review":"in the claustrophobic, despair-tinged encounter of gentle greek wisdom with nazi ideology, i was gripped by the immediacy of the events. the two tone cover of the modern book recaptures its initial urgent printing post-war on cheap paper. the war is still on between ideology and civilisation: a war between ideology - the sense that one's own particular partial truth can be made to apply everywhere (at whatever cost), and civilisation - taking one's knowing place in the flow of time and peoples.I'd love to see this novel become play. the ink is still wet."},{"Title":"Apartment in Athens","review":"I liked the story being a Greek family accustoms their lives around one Nazi Officer Lieutenant named Kalter who takes over their quarters by order of the Nazi regime.They have burdens placed on them, and are afraid to act even when Kalter abuses their son.

Before Kalter died, he left a suicide note blaming Mr. Helianos for his death, and considering the fact that Helianos was in prison for questioning the Nazi ideals he is executed and Mrs. helianos is left to take care of the children.NOW READ:The reason I gave this book 2 stars is because I was detracted from the story every time I had to read about Mrs. Helianos's weak character because she is a woman, or her emotionally fragile nature, or being an obedient wife to her husband, and other undermining descriptions of the female gender.If anything the ending of the story shows how stunted she was by always having to be co-dependant on her husband, always being told she would be useless without him due to her 'womanly' nature and how that jeopardized her view of herself."},{"Title":"Asimov's Mutants (The Dragon Books)","review":"Or that is the premises of this anthology edited by Waugh, Greenberg, and Asimov.

I bought my first copy in 1972 for my father who passed away a year later. I have re-read this book many times with increased pleasure each time. It not only has Charles Russell's drawings and paintings, it has some of the best short stories I have ever read. I've lived in the West pretty much all my life and the characters he portrays ring so true that you know he knew them. He not only knew them, he was able to capture their essence in a few words. I usually don't laugh out loud at what I'm reading, but many of these stories are just plain &quot;laugh out loud&quot; funny. Anyone who enjoys Cowboy Poetry needs to have this in their library. It's not poetry per se, but gives you the same Western flavor in its writing. Most of the stories can be read in 5 minutes or less. I give it a solid 10 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"This is a classic work of Western nonfiction by a Montana artist whose drawings and paintings helped create the iconography of the early cowboy of the open range. Also a storyteller, Russell wrote this collection of yarns and memories before his death, commemorating frontier life in the closing decades of the nineteenth century. It was published in 1927, with an introduction by Will Rogers in the form of a cowboy eulogy. The original edition featured more than 50 of Russell's illustrations, some of them in color.Unlike the fairly rollicking account of Teddy Blue Abbott, his cowboy contemporary, Russell's book is a more melancholy view of what he remembers as the good old days. His stories are told in an ironic vernacular by an old-timer cowboy named Rawhide Rawlins. Many concern the adventures of cowboys; many also feature Native Americans, in the early years of the agencies (reservations), portrayed with some complexity of feelings, ranging from fear and distrust to respect. Some are outrageously tall tales. Some are spirited character sketches, capturing something of life on the rough, raw land before settlement and homesteading, the motorcar, and civilization - before the plow broke the prairie sod where buffalo and then cattle and cowboys ranged freely.One of the finest pieces of Western writing occurs in the last chapter, &quot;Longrope's Last Guard,&quot; which describes in vivid detail the experience of riding herd on a pitch dark night as the stillness is shattered by an electrical storm that stampedes the cattle and takes the life of one of the men. The burial of the dead cowboy on the open prairie and the subsequent disappearance of his grave is symbolic of the passing of the brief frontier era Russell's words and pictures embrace.I recommend this book for its capturing of the historical cowboy as remembered by a man who was there and lived among them. As a companion volume, I also recommend Teddy Blue Abbott's &quot;We Pointed Them North,&quot; a well-detailed and more light-hearted recollection of the same time and place."},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"Will Rogers said Charlie Russell wasn't &quot;just another&quot; cowboy artist, he wasn't &quot;just another&quot; anything.

The stories will leave you nostalgic for a time you never knew."},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"Nothing compares to the facts, and no one who has not lived this could write it as C.M.

Another way of thinking and presenting a story about the actual facts is handed down in Trails Plowed Uder (1927) from former times . . . by this gifted sentimentalist."},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"You would generously call this Amazon editon an oversight, otherwise it's a shameless fleecing because for the same price The University of Nebraska press edition, current, for the same price has the many sketches from the original.The Doubleday hardcover editions had five, double-paged color iillustrations, five half-tone illustrations and forty three sketches, This Amazon edition has none, which for a Charles M. Russell book is inexcusable."},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"Most people realize Charles Russell was a wonderfully gifted, world renowned artist who chronicled Western life with a myriad of sketches and paintings that grace the finest art museums in the world today. His work is meticulous with an attention to detail second to none. What few of us realized is that as good an artist as he was, he was an equally gifted author.Published a few months before his death, Trails Plowed Under is a compendium of 43 short stories. He often complained of being \\"deaf and dum\\" with a pen but these writings, or yarns as he called them, certainly prove otherwise. In them he covers various aspects of everyday cowboy life from animals and stampedes to the colorful characters that peopled the American West as he knew it. Having cowboyed all his life he knew his subject well and he leaves behind a prism through which we today can catch a glimpse of the past as it was.This book will tug on your emotions. You will laugh, reflect, think and admire Russell's skill with words. Some of these stories are undoubtedly true while others are designed to definitely pull your leg.There is not a rotten apple in the barrel."},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"Charles Russell left us a wonderful gift in these stories. He managed to capture a first-person account of the Old West. I read this book many years ago, and recently re-read portions. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys good American western writing.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"Charles Russell's stories are second to none and fun for all ages. His art is also a big part of the experience. Tragically the ebook version does not contain any of Russell's great images. Poorly done, Kindle folks. However the literature is great."},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"If you know who Charlie Russell is, you probably don't need to read this to know that this book is one of the most fascinating sources of first-hand information about America's Old Wild West. It's not a history book, and it's not about people you would have heard of. This is a collection of stories Charlie has either told or heard from others and retold. Accompanied by about 5 color plates and several drawings, it is worth the price for the artwork alone. Try to get one with the dustcover intact. Top it off with a foreword by Will Rogers, and you have one of the best books ever published on the subject. The language is in the vernacular of old Montana, and the stories are told as if he was standing in front of a campfire talking to friends -- something Russell did a lot of, and something for which his friends, like Rogers, missed him greatly when he passed.Russell was one of the great painters of the old West, and many of his works fetched record-breaking prices during his lifetime. Now they hang in museums all over the world, especially the Russell Museum in Great Falls and the Amon Carter in Fort Worth. Published in 1927 and originally sold for $5.95, it's a shame this book hasn't been reprinted for modern audiences. But the original old books, if they were cared for, look like they just popped out of the printer's press. The paper has aged well, and the binding is perfect. You can read this book easily without wrestling with the pages.Though the stories are usually short, you find them wedged into cowboy movies -- almost every cowboy movie ever made contains at least something from these pages. Here you sense the animosity between the white Americans who pushed the frontier ever-westward, and the Indians who resisted being forced out of their native hunting grounds, villages, and homes. But Russell never stoops to criticism of either race. He tells it like it was, and lets you put together the pieces. He admired Native Americans as the amazing people they were and still are, and portrayed them honestly and sympathetically. At the same time, they could be scary in battle, and in some of his tales the Indians (and the Cowboys, too) will raise the hair on the back of your neck.If you are a fan of the old West, this book is absolutely essential reading. One thing to watch out for: be sure to ask the seller to check and make sure the plates are intact. People used to buy this book, cut out the color plates, frame them, and hang them on the wall. It was a very cheap way to acquire 5 Charlie Russell paintings. Specify to the seller that you want the color plates intact, and that you will return the book if they are missing or damaged.Shooshie"},{"Title":"Trails plowed under","review":"Wonderful, expressive book of tales and happenings in the life of Western artist Charles M. Russell of Montana. Great read!!!!"},{"Title":"Cool Cars, High Art: The Rise of Kustom Kulture","review":"I really like this book, although I would like to see a lot more photos of cars in a book that focuses on the aesthetic qualities of custom cars. The author successfully argues that kustoms are an art form and then proceeds to analyze various styles of custom cars in relationship to various styles of high art. Good stuff! As for the photos, the most refreshing thing about them is that they are not the same dozen famous kustoms that you've already seen in every other book about custom cars."},{"Title":"Cool Cars, High Art: The Rise of Kustom Kulture","review":"An exhaustive (and exhausting) cross between a fan-rave and a dissertation examining the history and pop-ological intricacies of the brief but very influential rod-and-custom period in America.Although it is chock full of details and insights into the subject one wonders who exactly it was written for. It often seems much too highbrow and academic for the average kid or gear-head, and I'm sure most academes wouldn't be seen reading anything with so many \\"purdy pichures\\". You're left with the impression that it in fact began as a scholarly defense (always check who the publisher is) which, once it appeared to have legs, was tricked out with some chrome and kandy kolors to help find it's way onto American coffee tables.Still it is well worth having to glean ( for practiced speed readers ) ever more minutia about an era that always spawns endless nostalgia for fans, and eventually, a true sociological and anthropological exegesis for 22 century rustmites."},{"Title":"Cool Cars, High Art: The Rise of Kustom Kulture","review":"This handsome book is an unusual treatment of its subject for sure. There is a bevy of color photographs to satisfy the aficionado--and to make it an ideal gift for any car-crazy friend. But what I find most striking is the authors truly unique take on the car as an art object. Obviously comfortable with the demands of current theoretical discourse, he seems purposefully to prove that the obscurantism that bedevils so much academic prose today is merely self-indulgent. He has helped me grasp much more than just the beauty of the customized car. Readers (and especially teachers in a number of disciplines) will appreciate Prof. DeWitts cunning explications of a Williams poem, a Picasso collage, a Futurist sculpture, and a surprising number of movies and TV shows to support his insights into our car culture."},{"Title":"Cool Cars, High Art: The Rise of Kustom Kulture","review":"Just want to let everybody know that Jerry Weesner of Streetrodder (June 2002) picked Cool Cars, High Art as a Hall of Fame selection with only three other books on the art of customizing."},{"Title":"3D Studio MAX Manual del Usuario con CD-ROM: Manuales Users, en Espanol / Spanish (Manuales Users; Tu Puerta de Acceso Al Mundo Digital)","review":"I already knew enough about 3D Studio as to make my own models.

Then, before doing business with a shop, he recommended I &quot;ask one of the mechanics (not the person working the register) if they sell Sloane.

In one book, sloan covers everything you need to know to buy a bike, fix a bike, tour on a bike, and race on a bike. Sloan's original book had the audacity to discuss brands and parts and who makes the best stuff any WHY. No other author at the time was willing to delve into these issues. He does it with so much ENTHUSIASM and INSIGHT that his love of the subject is INFECTIOUS. You should think of Eugene Sloane in the same terms as your favorite high school teachers. Sloan is from a suburb of Chicago, Illinois which is a BIKE MECCA because everywhere it's FLAT. One of the things that makes this a cyclist's cycling book is that in the illustrations he always depicts professional parts and also many of the most unusual parts of the 1970's and 1980's. The earlier editions had a racing bicycle on the front, and on the binding, switched to a touring bicycle on the back, if you happen to see it used.

I have a collection of Gene's books and they are easily superior to Rob VanDerPlas's series (RVP tends to miss a few things in his books and can be too general in his coverage).

However, it is quite out of date and the many photos and illustrations are poorly reproduced. For all practical purposes, this book is completely useless. What annoyed me most about it, however, is the author's pompous and extraordinarily ignorant opinions about bicycle helmets and mandatory bicycle helmet laws. Sloane tells us that he is \\"as an expert witness on bicycle accidents\\" and that \\"had the bicyclist been wearing a helmet, many of the fatalities and serious head injuries in these accidents would not have occurred\\". How can this be, when study after study have shown that bicycle helmets have a statistically insignificant impact on injuries and are actually correlated with a slight increase in fatalities? [...]. In fact, in the US, an increase in bicycle helmet use is actually strongly correlated with an increase in head injuries [...]. Sloane sinks lowest, however, when he suggest that the Bicycle Federation of Oregon opposes mandatory helmet laws simply because it means they will sell fewer bikes. (It should be noted that the only statistically proven effect of mandatory helmet laws is that they discourage bicycling, a fact which Sloane tells us doesn't bother him in the slightest: \\"if it's a choice between having to wear a helmet and riding a bicycle, my vote goes to the helmet law\\"). In reality, it is Sloane who makes money promoting MHL's by working as an expert witness, likely against injured bicyclists (the idea being that injured bicyclists who were not wearing a helmet don't deserve to be compensated since it \\"was their fault\\" they were injured). Frederick Robertson commented that \\"there are three things in the world that deserve no mercy: hypocrisy, fraud, and tyranny.\\" Eugene A. Sloane exhibits all 3 of these traits in his support for MHL's. He informs us that \\"that's what laws are for, to protect people despite themselves\\". Mr. Sloane, how about I worry about my personal safety, and you worry about yours; particularly when the data suggests that I know what I'm talking about and you don't? In particular, how about you keep your laws off my body? To the reader looking for books on bicycling, if you're looking for a great book of bicycling advice, try \\"The Art of Urban Cycling\\" by Robert Hurst. If you want to understand more about the science, try \\"Bicycling Science\\" by David Wilson, and if you're interested in the technicalities, there are a number of good books on bicycle repair. Sloane's book is a waste of a tree, and he's a despicable scoundrel for taking money to appear in court to argue against bicyclist's seeking compensation when they have been injured."},{"Title":"Beowulf","review":"This is NOT the Burton Raffel translation.

We will make our first college campus visits in a few weeks. The Princeton Review issues a number of books on the topic, and this book caught my eye recently.\\"America's Best Value Colleges 2007\\" (531 pages) aims to provide an overview of the 150 colleges in America that provide \\"best value\\", as defined by The Princeton Review, i.e. a combination of academic rating, finacial aid rating and \\"tuition GPA\\". I will tell you that from my own perspective I found the choices to be somewhat bewildering, albeit informative. Being in Ohio, which has a wealth of both public and private schools, I hard a hard time accepting that only 2 Ohio schools (Denison, OSU) made the cut, the same number as, say, the state of Hawaii (with all due respect to my friends there). But the information provided in the book is quite insightful.I was about to give this book a lower rating but then I must tell you that the ultimate customer of this book, i.e. my daughter, has spent a lot of time reading through this book, which I can assure you she does not do unless she feels compelled to/is interested in doing so (and some other college books have not captured her imagination). That said, I still feel that The Princeton Review's \\"Best 361 Colleges\\" is a better book to get information about the college searching process."},{"Title":"America's Best Value Colleges (College Admissions Guides)","review":"This book suggest that it provides a comprehensive review of the best values in colleges. But it is a complete charade. I have two sons. One is in college, the other a junior in high school looking at colleges. Financial aid is one of the most import criteria for us in looking at schools, hence my interest in this book for my younger son. My older son was accepted at a number of schools: George Washington, Cornell, Claremont-McKenna among others. Two of these are touted in the book as giving superior financial aid, and their offers were okay but not great. He was also admitted to an extremely prestigious college in Pennsylvania, and when my wife and I received their financial aid offer we almost (this is literally true) collapsed on the floor. Why? It was practically a free ride for a very expensive university. Is this college noted in this book? No. In fact there are no colleges in Pennsylvania listed in this book.

The major universitys like UW-Madison are in there, or they take away from the major campus like insted of U of Minnesota-Twin Cities they use Dalmpth campus. So it is a mixed bag of colleges really.

With earlier volumes parts of the text were already familiar to readers through their having been previously published. In volume six the writing is totally new to the reader though a large part of its content, Merton's 1966 affair with a student nurse, has been in the common domain since the publication of the official biography.Monica Furlong in her 1980 biography described 1966 as \\"a rather quiet time in Merton's life.\\" Subsequent biographies revealed that 1966 had not been quiet but contained one of the most critical and formative events of Merton's monastic life, events recounted in intense detail in Learning to Love. This volume although it covers the shortest time span of any of the journals published so far contains as much material as any that has preceded it and this suggests the nature and the intensity of that material.This volume is made up of three separate sources - Merton's daily journal; an additional account Merton wrote during the summer of 1966 about his relationship with the student nurse called \\"A Midsummer Diary for M.\\"; and finally a number of entries from \\"Notebook 17\\" which cover the beginning of 1966. In her introduction to this volume Christine Bochen notes that \\"A Midsummer Diary for M.\\" was one of two additional accounts Merton kept of his relationship with M. and the other account, entitled \\"Retrospect\\", was not made available for publication.In editing this volume Christine Bochen has divided her material up into four parts: \\"Being in one place\\" a short section covering January to March 1966; \\"Daring to Love\\" which covers the period of Merton's relationship with M. and his attempt to reconcile himself with his solitary life; \\"Living love in solitude\\" which covers September to December 1966 as Merton worked at recommitting himself to his monastic life; and \\"A life free from care\\" the last section of this journal covers January to October 1967 and presents a picture of Merton living fully his life as a hermit and writer.It is good at last to be able to read Merton's own account of this period. What would have been really fascinating would be to know what Merton himself would have included if he was editing this journal for publication. As it stands this volume is dominated by Merton's affair with M. The first section, \\"Being in one place\\" is very short and then the reader is rocketed into Merton's affair and his journal for a time scarcely contains anything else except his speculations and reflections on their relationship. These reflections continue, though in a much lesser form through the last months of 1966 and into 1967 and at times overshadow some of the excellent journal writing contained in these passages. With his \\"Midsummer Diary for M.\\" included as an appendix at the end of this volume the reader is once again thrown into Merton's intense self-examination and is in danger of this relationship obscuring the blossoming of a far more mature Merton, partly as a result of this relationship, in the entries from September 1966 through to October 1967. If Merton were to have prepared this material for publication I think it is this material he would have concentrated on, though by no means to the exclusion of his relationship with M.In the first section of Learning to Love many of the themes readers will have encountered in earlier journals are still present. Prominent in this section is Merton's interest in the poet Rilke. Merton had begun a serious study of Rilke the previous autumn and found in him a like voice. Both men had struggled over their relationships with women and a sense of their inability to love and to be loved. Merton had also been struggling with the difference between solitude and loneliness since his move to the hermitage and with thoughts of death as he felt his own physical body deteriorating and as some of his friends from his time at Columbia died. Over the course of this journal themes develop in Merton's life and through his relationship with M. he found that he could \\"love with an awful completeness\\" and that his loneliness was transformed into solitude and that he could face death and the destructive forces in himself as \\"I no longer fear them, [the destructive forces] as I no longer fear the ardent and loving forces in myself.\\" After this period Merton never again spoke of his \\"inability to love, or to be loved.\\"This experience filters through into some of Merton's conferences to the monastic community, especially his lectures on Rilke where he speaks of \\"learning to love\\" as the hardest of all the tasks in the monastery, and of solitude as central to love. The effect of this relationship and the discoveries Merton made through it are reflected in the journal entries for 1966 and into 1967. After the intense journal entries of March to September 1966 Merton's journal takes on a very different open and world-embracing tone as his new sense of love and compassion is extended to the wider world. The authors he was reading in this period - Camus, Eliot, Zukofsky, Muir, Sartre, Faulkner, Jones, Bachelard - and their thought effected his own thought and writing in his final, most creative, years including his books Cables to the Ace, The Geography of Lograire, Ishi Means Man, as well as essays on Zen, Camus, Cargo Cults, Faulkner and the monastic life.Readers will find this sixth volume of Merton's journals a veritable contrast to earlier journal, some, I am sure, will love it whilst other will not like the Merton who comes across from its pages. Whatever our reaction it is a part of the whole Merton and a part of the paradoxical figure readers have grown to expect from Merton."},{"Title":"Learning to Love: Exploring Solitude and Freedom- The Journal of Thomas Merton, Vol. 6","review":"This book, by a much loved and respected spiritual director for many mature persons, albeit only through his books, allows one to see first hand the struggles of a committed monk to remain faithful to his promise. Merton honestly relates his feelings and his battles to make sense of a love that, on one hand, could destroy all he had worked to achieve and yet, on the other hand, made him more human and therefore more real. The triumph of this struggle brings hope to all of us."},{"Title":"Learning to Love: Exploring Solitude and Freedom- The Journal of Thomas Merton, Vol. 6","review":"This was actually the first I ever read or heard of Merton. I read this book at a time when I was going through a bit of a struggle myself in regards to who I was and what I believed. I was raised Catholic, but no longer felt that I had any place in the Church and then I felt guilty for having those feelings. What Merton does so beautifully and bravely is to show his own struggles and his own humanity to the world. He struggles with the idea of being a hermit vs his desire to change the world; with his love and devotion to the Church vs his love of a woman; with his need for solitude vs. his need to be surrounded by other intelligent, compassionate minds. It's a fascinating read. I think one of the things that struck me most about it was how unselfconsciously he writes about what he's going through. It's not a book overflowing with self-judgment or condemnation. On the contrary, it's a book filled with the idea that he is as human as the rest of us and has the same flaws and desires, yet what he does with those flaws and desires is really up to him. That's no small discovery. It's one we could all stand to make about ourselves."},{"Title":"Learning to Love: Exploring Solitude and Freedom- The Journal of Thomas Merton, Vol. 6","review":"here is the volume that was much anticipated, the volume of Thomas Merton's diaries that dealt with his &quot;love affair&quot; with a young nurse, Margie Smith. By this point in the diaries, Merton has become a full time hermit{as someone once remarked, the busiest,most voluminous hermit in history. Or,as Merton wrly titled one of his diaries, A VOW OF CONVERSATION}. Moving further away from the obdient young novice of volume 2,Merton as always in full tonged battles with his Abbot,James Fox,,has been exploring eastern religions,trying to find the center which unites all. Then, he goes to a louisville hospital to have back surgery,and falls deeply in love with a young nurse. Always honest with himself,Merton knows where this is heading, and knows, even in his early entries, that this will not end well for her. There is a sweet episode when Joan Baez arrives,and after Merton tells her about his new love, insists that they drive straight away to Loiuisville to go to her{they do not.}There is nothing salacious here,and Merton comes to grips with his poor treatment of woman in his early life{he had fathered a child in London, and mother and son had died during the blitz in WWII},and finds another side in himself. Interspersed within this is the usual Merton gold, the ability to see through modern problems for what they are{fleeting}, and come up with crystalline insights{his commenst on his prayer life while he is essentialy leading ,for him, a compromised life, are very interestin.] This is top flight Merton, now on the top step, cleansed and looking east,where on the horizon, is the next and last volume, and the Asian journey. Essential,non-sensational,always edifying."},{"Title":"Learning to Love: Exploring Solitude and Freedom- The Journal of Thomas Merton, Vol. 6","review":"\\"Learning to Love\\" captures the ache of forbidden love better than any work I have ever read. Merton's honesty, as mentioned in the other reviews, sets the gold standard for how we should converse with ourselves and with God. Ultimately, through meditation and prayer, Merton decides that his affair has opened his heart so that it holds a greater love for God, and the experience of going against his vows humbles him.Anyone who is a true believer, who struggles to live that belief in daily life and who tries to reconcile the faith and the heart will enjoy this book. I can also recommend this book to people who are interested in journaling, as a example of \\"getting to the heart of matter\\" (Graham Greene) and to people who want a good introduction to Thomas Merton. I have gone on to read a number of his journals and his other books. He is most well-known for Seven Story Mountain. The Merton in that book is far younger and more nave than the erudite and humble Merton displayed in these pages. Had I read Seven Story Mountain first, I never would have picked up another Merton book. Luckily for me, I picked this Merton book up first."},{"Title":"Learning to Love: Exploring Solitude and Freedom- The Journal of Thomas Merton, Vol. 6","review":"This review is for the Kindle edition, I really wish Amazon would not mix reviews for different versions of the book... The book itself is great, I'd give five stars for the actual journal. However, the Kindle edition is a travesty, and HarperCollins ought to be ashamed of putting their name on such a poor quality ebook. The following is the content of a refund request I just sent to Amazon customer service, which I think will serve as a fine review of the Kindle edition:\\"I recently purchased Learning To Love: Exploring Solitude and Freedom by Thomas Merton for my Kindle. I have to say that this book was full of copious typos, more so than many of the free Kindle ebooks. I am rather appalled to have paid $10.99 for a book so riddled with errors. Every time a word appeared that had \\"tl\\" in it, it showed up as a \\"d\\". For example, \\"little\\" appeared as \\"litde,\\" \\"subtle\\" was \\"subde,\\" etc. This is only one type of example, several other letters were repeatedly distorted in very strange ways as well. This book is a journal with dated entries that are supposed to be in chronological order. At one point the entry dates read \\"June 28\\" followed by \\"June 20\\" and then \\"June 50\\"! Seriously?! This was very distracting and sometimes it was quite hard to decipher words in the book. I don't feel like I should have to pay $10.99 for a book I had to decode on nearly every page. This was ultimately too frustrating and I am going to try to buy a used copy of the printed version. I really cannot believe that this was put out by a major publisher (HarperCollins) with so many errors. There is no way that somebody actually proofread the Kindle version of this book. I am going to leave a copy of this email as a review on the product page because I do not think major publishers should get away with selling ebooks that have obviously not been proofed and edited, and I don't think readers will appreciate all these distracting errors. Amazon.com is a great company and I have always appreciated the excellent customer service. I do hope that you will let this publisher know about the bad quality of this ebook. I also hope that it is possible to get a refund for this item.\\"I wanted everyone considering buying the Kindle version to be aware of these errors. You can read this book, but only if you are prepared to overlook errors, sometimes several, on practically every page. If you are trying to have a mental sense of Merton's timeline, it is especially distracting that the journal entry dates are wrong in several places. By all means, get a hard copy, you will not regret it! Merton's journals are amazing, especially this sixth volume with its chronicle of Merton's love affair and the ensuing tension between romance and his vocation. I have not finished it yet, but look forward to reading the rest in a printed version."},{"Title":"Learning to Love: Exploring Solitude and Freedom- The Journal of Thomas Merton, Vol. 6","review":"Thomas Merton falls in love with his nurse (and she with him). This completely disorients him from his vocation, and throws him into an emotional spiral. He loves \\"M\\", but knows that he really can't do anything about it, he has vowed celibacy and stability, but he's so torn by the emotional turmoil that he really can't see straight. Merton's usual sangfroid and dedicated direction toward the wholly spiritual life, even to the extent of moving to the Hermitage, is in the balance here, and one sees how strongly the emotions can overtake even one who has lived so many years adhering to his vows.One wonders, after it's all over, what \\"M\\" must have gone through, with Merton going this way and that, loving and then withdrawing to his safe place. This book is an important one to read to understand the vagaries of human nature and how easily we can be tossed about and thrown from our self-created pedestals."},{"Title":"Learning to Love: Exploring Solitude and Freedom- The Journal of Thomas Merton, Vol. 6","review":"This must ,by far, be the best writing of Merton.It is intense, it is heart-rending and it is REAL!His illict love affair carried on whilst suppossed to be under vows of celibacy and obedience show that Merton was after all like us.Had the same struggles as us and got himself into the same shameful muddles, as we do.If you want a book you can't put down- buy this journal.If you already have problems of your own this book could help you to logically find your way through those tangled feelings"},{"Title":"Learning to Love: Exploring Solitude and Freedom- The Journal of Thomas Merton, Vol. 6","review":"If there is anything this book has taught me, it is that there is no escape from the human condition. No matter if you are living as a monk in the woods or living in the midst of 9-5 city life, there is no real sanctuary from the struggles of humanity. Merton's writings on his challenges to reconcile his desires and remain true to his vows are enlightening. These are the difficulties that all of us face, in one form or another. You can't help but love and appreciate Merton, the man, found in this journal."},{"Title":"Learning to Love: Exploring Solitude and Freedom- The Journal of Thomas Merton, Vol. 6","review":"This journal, volume 6 of 7, is unusually candid and expressive about Thomas Merton's personal and vocational dilemmas in 1966-1967, when he was in his early fifties. He writes about his close observations of nature at his hermitage at Gethsemani Abbey in Kentucky and about his fellow monks, literary and publishing friends, his spiritual and artistic visitors, and about a young woman who had been his nurse after a back operation and with whom he fell in love. The journal records a period of unusual personal drama and growth that ultimately reinforces his commitment to solitude and the monastic life that enables it. For its depth and intensity, \\"Learning to Love\\" belongs in the company of St. Augustine's \\"Confessions\\" and Thoreau's \\"Walden.\\" In its spontaneity, however, it stands alone."},{"Title":"Learning to Love: Exploring Solitude and Freedom- The Journal of Thomas Merton, Vol. 6","review":"As usual, his journal style leads me into deep contemplation, but his honesty in dealing with all issues reminds the reader that he is a man before a monk or priest. I reccommend this book to all Seminary Students and those seeking quiet prayer and contemplation."},{"Title":"Learning to Love: Exploring Solitude and Freedom- The Journal of Thomas Merton, Vol. 6","review":"As a primary document written by a complicated, restless, emotional, and gifted man who was a born writer, and who was visited by or had contact with many prominent people of the 20th century, this journal is fascinating. But I think the editor is remiss in not providing explanatory notes, such as those provided by Brother Patrick Hart in \\"The Asian Journal of Thomas Merton.\\" I think the reader deserves some background information, such as the fact that Merton had vows of chastity and stability. As a Trappist, he vowed to live and die in the Abbey of Gethsemani. I also think the title is ill advised. Merton was a monk in a time of turmoil, who had made permanent vows. To describe his irresponsible and self-indulgent actions as \\"Exploring Solitude and Freedom\\" is ironic, A better, less fawning title might be \\"Fr. Louis Leaps Over the Wall and Back Again!\\" Although I disagree with Mark Shaw, who views Merton as a hypocrite, I think an objective examination of Merton is needed and has not yet been done. When I read the editor's introduction to \\"Learning to Love,\\" I felt as if she were describing a teenager at camp who is having a new \\"adventure,\\" not an adult monk who is having an illicit affair. God can bring good out of anything, but that is no reason to deviate from one's vows to Him.Some biographies of Merton relate the more comical aspects of his affair with a 25-year-old student nurse who was engaged to a man deployed to Vietnam. Neither Merton nor his girlfriend had a car, so they had to rely on others for transportation and places to meet. She told Merton she was going to marry her fiance, and then (when it didn't move Merton to decide to marry her?) told him she wasn't going to marry her fiance after all. Such a \\"deep\\" young woman, she dated a priest and vowed celibate and encouraged him to marry her and be who he \\"really\\" was. Merton shows real self-knowledge in stating after the affair's end that had he married Marge Smith, he would have become an \\"alcoholic ex-priest.\\" (Merton burned her letters to him, but she, years later, had his letters to her published and offered them for sale!)With the exception of the sensationalistic Shaw--and the reputable academic Alice von Hildebrand--those who write about Merton seem to have blinders on when it comes to Merton's defects, especially the editor of \\"Learning to Love.\\" I think objectivity, rather than adoration, is needed. Merton chose to overlook the evidence that his actions were causing scandal--as Fr. Flavian Burns told him, the young monks were talking about Merton's situation and they conjectured the abbot was being hard on him. Merton's translation of the sayings of the Desert Fathers included such wisdom as \\"Stay in your cell, and your cell will teach you everything.\\" The monks of the desert also had their encounters with women and gave good advice about temptation and falls, which Merton would have done well to heed.I think Merton was in the midst of an emotional crisis when he indulged in such unmonastic hanky-panky. He writes that if someone in a similar relationship had asked his counsel, he would have warned the person of the moral danger, \\"but I loved her.\\" Merton disregarded the wise counsel of the desert fathers. He lived in a hermitage, and sometimes he lived as a hermit. At other times, he made \\"illegal\\" visits outside; the term is his and I presume he means these jaunts were made without the abbot's permission or consent. (There was a hole in a fence through which he could leave the monastery grounds--another comical aspect of this \\"grand\\" affair.)Also extremely evident in a lot of his writing, including this journal, is Merton's querulous and critical tone. When Gretchen Craft, author of \\"The Happiness Project,\\" finished reading his \\"Seven Storey Mountain\\" she calls him \\"cranky, monkish Merton.\\" In \\"Learning to Love,\\" his complaints begin even before he has to deal with Abbot James Fox. Then Merton complains that a female friend drank with him and then reported him to the abbot for getting drunk. (Merton did a lot of drinking during his affair, and because of his vow of poverty, others had to pay the tab--another comical aspect?) Merton also expresses his pique that a psychiatrist friend let him meet Marge privately in his office and then told Merton he disapproved of the affair and refused to let him use the office again. Merton sourly notes that a local resident who used to welcome his \\"illegal\\" visits is now unwelcoming, presumably because of a Trappist brother's comments on the impropriety of Merton's visits.Henri Nouwen, when an unknown priest, visited Merton and was greatly impressed. Merton describes the visit in this journal. He notes who accompanied Nouwen, Nouwen's occupation and nationality, and that's it. He gives more space to the visits of more prominent people, such as Joan Baez. (Although \\"cloistered,\\" Merton had numerous and frequent visitors.) Nor is he impressed by 2 brothers of Taize, the Christian ecumenical group in France. He tells them that their movement is hampered by their docility to the Catholic hierarchy, although they themselves are not Catholic. (Is this \\"freedom\\" from Catholic authority the \\"freedom\\" meant in the subtitle?)The brothers reply that such cooperation is essential to their ecumenical work. Their comment shows good will and spiritual maturity in contrast to Merton's implying that they are missing an opportunity to \\"correct\\" the \\"errors\\" in his own church.This account, although fascinating, reveals many defects of a \\"spiritual writer\\" so many lionize."},{"Title":"Essentials of Immunohematology, 1e","review":"This book really helped me in understanding the essentials of blood banking, where as I only had 3 weeks to learn everything about it.

It is indeed a complete guide to overcoming many sexual problems. In my opinion we call them problems, but once you educate yourself with books like this, you realize that the problems are not the problems, the real problem with us women is ignorance and lack of education in sexual matters. As soon as you put in practice the principles of this book you start overcoming your problems.One thing that is very interesting is the fact that by overcoming the sexual problems you empower yourself in all the other areas of your life. Because all the areas of our lives are connected, we make a disconnection, but the sexual life is intimately connected with our whole being, and as soon as you own your sexual life you will automatically improve your whole life.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Sexual Healing: A Self-Help Program to Enhance Your Sensuality and Overcome Common Sexual Problems","review":"This book is a real gem if you have any sexual dysfunction that is keeping you and your partner from experiencing relaxed, joyful sex.

The beginning is a basic sex ed class, which is great for the people who have little or no knowledge of the parts and functions. As the book progresses into explaining the disorders and her exercises I got increasingly aggitated and angry that I had been forced to read it for my Masters level Sex Therapy class. The descriptions of the actual disorders were easy to read and fairly self-explanatory, but by the time I got to the exercises she suggested I was beginning to be irritated. All \\"exercises\\" are the same repeated over and over throughout the entire book, whether it is meant to be done alone or with your heterosexual partner. Just when I thought she had finally quit repeating the same things by chapter 28 and 29 I learn that she is even less helpful then I had previously thought. In one section she stated that women who have low sexual desire should wait until they have a partner to try to use products or techniques to increase their libido, but men were left out of this suggestion completely. During the exercises women were repeatedly told to pleasure the man for their own enjoyment. I felt that the notion that a women should take such great pleasure in touching her male partner was a bit misguided. Which is great unless this does not necessarily turn you on enough to no longer be labled as having a \\"disorder.\\" Yes, she does tell the male partner to perform sensate exercises on his partner for his own satisfaction, but I felt that she didn't quite push the notion like she did with women needing to please their men. Men were first, period. In order for a woman with a sexual arousal disorder to work to change it she should have her male partner lay down with his eyes closed and she would then explore his body, and if she were lucky he might want to engage in some touching of his own. Seriously!? She was a sex surrogate with anxiety issues about \\"everything but sex\\" and was able to help other people with anxiety overcome it while she was having the same unattached sexual encounters \\"to help them\\" that she advised other women not to have. This book was a pathetic joke and I HATE that I had to read it. I quit at chapter 30 because I was so frustrated by overly stated, and sadly misguided advice. SAVE YOUR MONEY LADIES... unless you live to please him or he is the one with the sexual disorder, not you!!!"},{"Title":"Sexual Healing: A Self-Help Program to Enhance Your Sensuality and Overcome Common Sexual Problems","review":"I purchased this book to help me with a sexual problem that most likely stemmed from a former relationship.

Well, if your problem stems from getting a partner in the first place, then this book is really only somewhat useful. It can achieve relaxation techniques and proper breathing exercises but that really doesn't go far in treating the problem for which I originally purchased the book.

This could have been a big seller, if not a best-seller, and is the kind of book that should be taught in our schools."},{"Title":"Bonaparte's Warriors (Alain Lausard Adventure)","review":"Bonaparte's Warriors is the fourth book in the \\"Bonaparte\\" series, the previous volumes being Bonaparte's Sons, set in the Italian Campaign, Bonaparte's Invaders, taking place during the Egyptian Campaign, and Bonaparte's Conquerors, in the Marengo campaign. Each of these chronicles the adventures of Alain Lausard, a sergeant in the French dragoons. In a conscious reversal of the formula followed in Bernard Cornwell's \\"Sharpe\\" series, Lausard is a former aristocrat who had turned thief in order to survive the ravages of the Revolution. \\"Dragooned\\" out of prison with a rag-tag group of fellow inmates -thieves, murderers and rapists-Lausard and company are trained as cavalrymen and sent to reinforce Napoleon's army in Italy. Lausard's squadron includes a motley gang of former prisoners and outcasts: Bonet, the former schoolteacher; Giresse, the horse thief and ladies man; Delacor, the rapist; Roussard, the forger; Rostov, the Russian; Karim, the former Mameluke slave; the religious fanatic, Moreau; and others. This cast of characters has remained fairly constant throughout the series.Bonaparte's Warriors opens with the dragoons enjoying an uneasy peace and Lausard chafing from inactivity in the camp at Boulogne. He and his hard-bitten band of former prisoners are given, by Napoleon himself, a special assignment: penetrate neutral territory and kidnap the ci-devant Bourbon prince, the duc d'Enghien. Completing their task our merry band of what Wellington would have called the \\"scum of the earth\\" kick their heels in Paris until war inevitably breaks out. Lausard and the French army march against Austria and Russia and the book culminates with the battle of Austerlitz.Richard Howard manages to work many military details into his stories, from the number of paces per minute the infantry marches to a detailed description of a cavalryman's tack. The artillery doesn't just fire canister shot, it fires \\"four-and-a-half-ounce balls.\\" This exposition of military detail is, however, not always accomplished seamlessly. The author emphasizes the hardships and brutality of war, but perhaps to too great a degree. No one just dies in one of Howard's novels, they are ground under horses' hooves, smashed in the mouth with teeth flying by heavy cavalry swords, or turned into pulp by grape and canister. By over-emphasizing the violence and brutality, yet having the brutality occur to the novel's anonymous cannon fodder, Howard dehumanizes the suffering more than he shines a spotlight on it. One of Howard's weaknesses is that he seems so enamored of his cast of characters that he is loath to kill any of them off. This immortality amid the horrors of war lessens the impact of the battle scenes. We know Lausard will survive to fight another battle, but by making all the characters seemingly invulnerable there is little tension as to who will survive by the novel's end.In fact the lack of fully delineated secondary characters such as those with which Cornwell peopled his \\"Sharpe\\" series is a definite weakness. There is no Harper. Lausard has no love interests. There is no villain running through the series or even for each individual volume. The only other fully developed character in these books is Napoleon himself. Howard does a creditable job reflecting the ambiguities of Napoleon's soldiers toward their emperor. Grumbling on campaign and at peace, yet awed in his presence. Even the cynical Lausard can't help crying \\"Vive l'Empereur!\\" when Napoleon rallies his troops. Howard's Napoleon is a flesh and blood creature, not a \\"marble man.\\" Yet I can't help thinking that the many episodes in the book with Napoleon would be better spent developing Lausard. The frequent scenes with Napoleon explaining his actions to his staff may be a short-handed way of filling in historical background, but ultimately Howard would be better of having this background revealed through the thoughts and actions of his protagonist.Lausard has none of the motivations to rise through the ranks as Sharpe had and I wouldn't be surprised if Lausard remains a sergeant to the bitter end. Cornwell always managed to set a goal for Sharpe in each of his stories; Howard is content to just let his hero be pulled along on Napoleon's coattails, going from historic event to historic event like a tourist. Lausard's sole motivation is to expiate his supposed sin of letting his family die on the guillotine, not having taken action to save them or dying himself. But Howard doesn't dwell much on the psychology of his hero; he seems content telling a fast-paced tale of adventure.These criticisms aside, Howard has produced a series which affords the reader a quick, night or two read, but with little substance. These books are perfect to take to the beach or to read on a plane trip. Even the knowledgeable reader can more than likely enjoy the rousing action if he can refrain from nit-picking the military details. While the Alain Lausard books are not up to the level of Fraser's \\"Flashman\\" series (the ne plus ultra of these types of novels) or even of the \\"Sharpe\\" series, they do make for a quick, entertaining read."},{"Title":"Bonaparte's Warriors (Alain Lausard Adventure)","review":"This page is quite confused.

Alas, while interesting, the novels just are not as good as Cornwell's. The main character, a nobleman disguised as a commoner (the opposite of Cornwell's Richard Sharpe)is difficult to identify with. Of the four novels there is less action in this one than the others. The Battle of Austerlitz forms the background of the story with most of the combat taking place in the last 3rd of the story. All of his companions from the 1st novel are amazingly still with him.

He was pick up by Americans on May 9 and turned over to Czechs, who quickly executed him.&quot; In my opinion : 1. To kill 30,000 in the few days is not possible. 2. Where would be the graves so many people? 3. Who were the witnesses? 4. As a little boy I grew up 10 Km from Elbe river ( District Melnik ), never heard about thousands dead bodies in the Elbe river. 5. The response from the Military History Museum Prague, Czech Republic is stating: There is no record such mass killing. 6. Karl Hermann Frank was executed after standing his public trial, and if I remember right it was broadcasted over radio."},{"Title":"Bonaparte's Warriors (Alain Lausard Adventure)","review":"Having just finished reading my second Richard Howard novel(Bonaparte's Sons), I was once again struck by the authors sheer audacity in transposing whole scenes from Willi Heinrich's Cross of Iron. I can also identify shades of Sven Hassel, in so much as the narrative largely focuses on a cavalry unit made up of convicted criminals. All in all, a poor attempt to cash in on this ever popular genre."},{"Title":"Bonaparte's Warriors (Alain Lausard Adventure)","review":"This is the fourth in the series of six Lausard novels. The book contains seasoned characters, and tells parts of the Austerlitz story not detailed elsewhere. The book is worthwhile and recommended as a competent work of historical fiction, dealing with events of interest to the reader of the Napoleonic Era.The plot develops from the camps at Boulogne through the Battle of Austerlitz. The major events are the encampment and training at Boulogne, the capture and execution of the Duke of Engheim, the march through the Rhine Valley, the crossing of the Black Forest, the maneuver sur derriere at Ulm, the battle of Elchingen, and the battle of Austerlitz.Any author of fiction who undertakes the story of Grand Armee and the Battle of Austerlitz must operate in the shadow of Leo Tolstoy. The first half of War and Peace provides a detailed recounting of the events leading up to and including the battle of Austerlitz. Tolstoy focuses most on the events starting with the capitulation of Mack at Ulm, and continues in detail about the Russian operations under Kutuzov along the Danube, and ultimately to the showdown on the Pratzen Heights.In terms of plot and storyline, this book is additive to the literature of historical fiction because Howard minimizes the overlap with the telling of Tolstoy, and focuses on the other events leading up to the battle of Austerlitz. The first one-third of the story focuses on the camp life at Boulogne, and considers the decision not to invade Great Britain. Before the march through the Rhine Valley and across the Black Forest, Lausard is part of the troop accompanying Orderer to capture and execute the Duke of Engheim.The balance of the story tells about the rapid march through the Rhine, and the taking of the Austrians at Ulm. Lausard is part of the force fighting across the Bridge at Elchigen and the assault on the hilltop fortress at the Benedictine Monastery above the Danube River valley. Only the last twenty percent of the book retells the events of Austeriltz. Much of this part of the story focuses on the personal and warm relationship between Napoleon and the common soldiers.The Lausard character begins as the dedicated and competent man of war that emerged from the battle of Marengo in the first book, Bonaparte's Conquerors. By the end of the story Lausard has wrestled with the question of loyalty to France and the Emperor. On the eve of Austerlitz, Lausard is overcome with emotion and becomes a part of the devoted soldiers who are absorbed in the fortunes of the Empire and the personal charisma of the Emperor."},{"Title":"Culture Shock: Dealing With the Stress in Cross-Cultural Living","review":"Books about missions abound, but there are few that deal with this difficult and very real subject with as much understanding as this book does. This is largely a sociological book, helping us to understand where culture shock comes from and why it's a real problem for basically every missionary serving around the world. The chapters on love and self-esteem seem off topic at first, but it's true that the attack of change on our self-esteem is a real aspect of culture shock and stress. One of the most noteworthy ideas covered is also the idea of \\"Missionary Role Stress\\" where he argues that the very role itself is a stress factor. This is something I encountered in my mission, my expectations for myself crumbled as I got on the field and was faced with reality. Also people around me (including my native superiors) began to say things like, \\"Well, you just weren't what I was expecting a missionary to be.\\" Add this to the culture shock that one is already feeling and it's no wonder that many missionaries suffer depression and meltdowns. This book is very encouraging, however, offering many practical solutions for stressed out missionaries. I plan to pass it along to my missionary friends, as well as to the native pastors here in the field to help them to know how to receive and support missionaries. This is definitely a valuable resource for anyone in, going into, or working with foreign missions."},{"Title":"Hopkins' healthy home cooking","review":"I've really liked the recipes in this cookbook. It has recipes for cooking with whole wheat flour, brown rice, and lots of vegetables among other ideas. The whole wheat bread recipe is tasty and a little faster to make than some other recipes. Other recipes I've tried and liked are for pizza, whole wheat pancakes, potato soup, quick refried beans, salsa, cream of mushroom soup substitute, and a chicken broccoli brown rice casserole. There is also a section on healthy desserts.

I would say that the general public should not try 90 percent of these experiments, unless of course you are used to handling chemicals.

It's not advisable to put ethanol in your mouth to spit out in front of students... This only demonstrates bad lab techniques.

However, you shouldn't allow this to dissuade you from getting this book - the experiments you &lt;u&gt;can&lt;/u&gt; perform will provide you quite a lot of enjoyment.Caution, however, is in order: Some of the reagents used are corrosive, poisonous, or even explosive. I'd advise ensuring that an adult is present to supervise if you care to attempt those particular experiments!"},{"Title":"Chemical magic, (A Fawcett premier book)","review":"This book describes chemical experiments that give visible andsurprising results suitable for stage demonstrations. Presented asrecipes with short descriptions of of underlying mechanisms (usually).What caught my eye was the number of classic demonstrations common inolder books but now largely dropped from children's texts as toodangerous in ingredients required, or fumes and energy relesed.Many of the recipes are about buring or blowing up things (Yeah! ;-)* sugar cube treasted with conc H2SO4 black thing* zinc based powder that emits green smoke when spat on(thanks for teaching me this one Max ;-)* colored fire powders* flour cannon (did not mention that old quaker oats tin useful here.)I am in favor of teaching children how to safely perform dangerousscience experiments, as this is the only way to learn to do suchthings properly, (since many will do them regardless) and anyway thekids would be up to more hazardous pursuits if the modest risks of thelaboaratory are denied. If today's young people do not learn how toplay with fire safely, where will we get tommorws homeland defensetechnologists to fight our nations Fovever War against religousfanatics?However I would not encourage experimemnts involving the burning ofmercury compounds (see the blue fire formula) and the use ofcarcinogenic, flamable or persistently toxic substances like CCl4 orfluid mercury anywhere but in a proper fireproof ventilation hood.The book does mark experiments involving toxic (like CCl4)sponateously combustible (white phosphorous!) and powwerful oxidizingagents (my fav: Potassium Clorate). Unfortunately the short length ofthe text did not permit a more detailed discussion of precausions onesould take with such materials, like eye protection, long fuses andelectrical igniter/detonators, and saftely practices like using verysmall quantities of reagents the first time, not permitting murcury tospill in places it could release fumes over time or form amalgams withother metals and never premixing oxidizers with combustables unlessone knows the combination is relatively stable in the environment inwhich the mixture will be stored.I reccomend this book as an antidote the boring...libability concious [material] present in most high school texts, butwould also require students doing these experimentr to read somedetailed laboratory procedures text, and practice these techinuqwes ina laboratory under experinced supervision.

I did every experiment in this book as a kid, some dozens of times, but recommend adult supervision for some of the experiments. In today's dummied down, Lawyer stiffled society it's nice to know that there are actually still books around that have experiments that are as fun as they are politically incorrect. All kids should be exposed to the fun of making fireworks, playing with mineral acids and white phosphorus, oxidizers, and burning metals if they can find the materials and if they have appropriate supervision. It's the real way to become introduced to non watered-down chemistry; this book has the really FUN experiments that will, unlike almost all of the prevailing experimemts in the prevailing contemporary books, keep kids from thinking that science is a complete bore. (Tri ess Sciences in Glendale, CA sells a lot of these reagents to adults). This is a book from an exciting past era, long gone now, where there was a lot of real freedom to really experiment and learn in an environment free of hyper-legal and trumped up anti chemical sentiment.

As noted by some of the other reviews, the bandwidth of maturity required for the experiments varies greatly. Many of the projects or experiments in the book are a bit more than the average person can handle. But even then, reading about them does teach you something.I remember reading the first edition of this book when I was young. I had SO much fun with it and I just kept signing it out of the library. When I got older, I did look for it, but it was out of print.Then the second edition came out. Woo hoo!! I got myself a copy and one for a nephew who is showing great promise in the sciences (even though he's only 11). You just can't go wrong with this book.

Despite a recent revision the text appears unaware of the great danger posed by materials such as carbon tetrachloride (a chemical which has since the 60's been all but banned), mercury, benzene, phosphorous, thermite, etc. To say \\"be careful\\" is not enough when talking to a lay audience. Please be cautious, the experiments may sound thrilling but the harm can be nasty and permanent."},{"Title":"Chemical magic, (A Fawcett premier book)","review":"Each experiment first explains the \\"action\\" or the effect intended to produce. Secondly, necessary elements are listed along with their appropriate quantities. Thirdly, a very fortunate addendum to each experiment explains why the reaction occurred and how it did. Finally, most experiements are augmented by a primitive diagram, whose descriptive efforts vary according the action(s) of the chemist, but nevertheless aid the reader with some significance to visualize where certain items should be oriented.Anyone interested in this book will understand it is not for anarchy or extremely plexiform experiments to uncover the human genome. Mad scientists, this book is unfortunately not for you, but anyone intrigued by paradoxical chemical experiments, such as fire submerged in water, a burning bush that is not consumed by its flames, and other such fascinating elements, will be pleased with its contents.These experiments usually do not require manifold ingredients so they are ideal for high-school chemistry classes, introductory college chemistry, or entertainment during a meal. A waiter who can perform such legerdemain at events will not remain a waiter long, and those of you who are addicted to gambling and teasing friends certain things are impossible will immediately recognize the value of this book.I have rated this book 4-star primarily because the majority of the experiments are prosaic or have no genuine purpose to belong the the publishment.

For instance, a glass beaker submerged in a liquid that has the same refractive index as glass, rendering the beaker completely invisible. Or, another, volumes of smoke made as if by magic.It turns out they're all in here! Don't let the physical size fool you, because this book is chalked full of some of the most amazing and impressive chemistry experiments you've ever seen.The problem, however, is that the typical home reader won't be able to get their hands on these chemicals anymore.

It is not for the beginner, but experienced cookie bakers will find hundreds of interesting cookies, mostly Italian. Despite the Reader's Digest moniker, it is not a collection of All-American cookies, so take the sub-title of this book seriously.If you are learning how to bake cookies, you should probably avoid this book. There is absolutely no information on ingredients, equipment, or techniques, nor are there hints or suggestions in the individual recipes. The instructions can generously be described as terse and unhelpful. There is no informational or educational information on making cookies.If you know your way around a cookie sheet, there are more cookie recipes that you will want to try in this book than all the rest of your cookie books combined. I found literally hundreds of cookies that I wanted to try. The lion's share of recipes are rare, hard to find Italian ones; they are significantly different from american, british, french, german, austrian, etc. cookies (the editorial page lists Florence, Italy as the progenitor). On the down side, many of the recipes require adjustment; I found problems like: doughs that were crumbly and never really came together, too much spreading, seemingly under-baked cookies, dry and crumbly cookies, etc. The recipe titles were also a problem; I am reasonably sure that many of these cookies have popular or traditional names, but an awful lot of them have been given generic names, e.g. \\"date cookies\\" or \\"lime and sunflower seed cookies\\". I suspect that most problems relate to variable methods of flour measurement; Europeans, like Italians, measure flour by weight, but all recipes in this book list flour by volume in cups.

Usually, I devour her stories and find them difficult to put them down. This one was okay, but more wordy than she usually is; especially, within the first half of the book. Also, the story was a little less believable than her others. I agree with the previous reviewer in that the reader is to decide what was really happening and even after finishing, the reader determines what they want to believe. But I do not agree that this is Ms. Michaels best."},{"Title":"The dark on the other side","review":"This book is not the best by Barbara Michaels, but it's still better than 95% percent of the books in print. Though it lacks the wry humor of some of her books, it nevertheless has a nice storyline and some truly spinechilling moments.A young writer named Michael Collins (I wonder, did Ms. Michaels deliberately give this guy the same name as the Irish rebel? Or a coincidence?) arrives as the home or wealthy intelligent philanthropist millionaire Randolph. Collins is immediately attracted to Randolph's beautiful younger wife Linda, but can't help noticing that Linda is dulling her pain with alcohol, seems to be both hateful toward her husband and terrified of something she can't name. The sight of large dogs, for example, throws her into fainting fits.Collins also senses something strange and sinister about Randolph, despite the latter's charming and hearty manner. He checks into the backgrounds of people who knew Randolph before he married his wife, and finds disturbing but nebulous results. Then Linda, whom her husband claims is insane, runs away and keeps running, with a bizarre old witch as her only solid ally. But Linda has a counter-claim about Randolph, that implies something far darker and more horrifying than mere insanity.This book has amazing atmosphere, especially in the first chapter where Linda is clearly terrified and emotionally threadbare, but there is no sign as to why. The creepiness pervades virtually every scene with and about Randolph. Collins himself is a nice, sympathetic character with a great balance of sensitivity and &quot;macho&quot;; as for Linda, it's a little difficult to determine whether she's correct, insane, or a bit of both. As for Randolph--he WILL give you goosebumps.The book is hardly flawless - Ms. Michaels's brilliant humor is often missing (though I loved Collins' buddy coming in and finding Linda tied down to the bed); there is a large &quot;dead&quot; section in the middle of the book where the characters do little but talk; also, the ending seems to be a bit rushed and hastily written. I also found the smallness of the cast disconcerting, and the character of the witch rather badly drawn.However, if you're in the mood for a good ol' fashioned thriller with appropriate chills, and no sex or vulgarity, then this is for you!"},{"Title":"The dark on the other side","review":"The Dark on the Other Side is probably my favorite Barbara Michaels. It isn't just about being 'spooky'. It's about basic issues of trust, whether in other people or in your own perceptions. It is about how people use one another to achieve gain or safety. It is about the power of love, both to heal and destroy. There are no chain-saw killers jumping out of the closet, no menacing ghosts. Most of the action takes place in the minds of the characters and you must decide whether their POV is valid. A superficial read won't give you much; but if you really think about Linda Randolph's predicament and the risks both she and Michael Collins take to save her, you will have chills that will keep you up late. (I do wish Barbara Michaels had made Galen a series character. I just love his sang froid.)"},{"Title":"The dark on the other side","review":"This book is expertly crafted and paced so as to keep the reader wondering&lt;B&gt; Is Linda Randolph's husband a werewolf or is she going insane&lt;B&gt; Even when the reader is finished, Michaels does not neatly offer a yes or no&lt;B&gt; Instead she leaves it up to the reader to decide whether or not the villan was truly man or beast&lt;B&gt; The Dark on the Other Side is as good as any new contempory romance with a twist of the supernatural and is defintely one of Barbara Michaels' best"},{"Title":"The dark on the other side","review":"I am a huge Barbara Michaels fan, yet when I read this book I was higly disappointed.The characters are tranparent and the story line was completely tiresome.

It was slow and I struggled to continue reading it hoping it would get better. It didn't get better."},{"Title":"The dark on the other side","review":"Fans of Barbara Michaels, also known as Elizabeth Peters of 'Amelia Peabody' fame, might be a bit surprised by this novel. It has none of the wry humor of the ;Amelia Peabody' or 'Vicky Bliss' novels nor even the moody gothic romances typical of other novels written as Barbara Michaels. The characters are not as well rounded as is usually found in her stories and the plot proceeds by fits and starts as opposed to the usual more even pace of her stories. The reason for this clumsy workmanship can be found in the original publication date - 1970 making this one of her early works.The story centers around a young wife who could just be going insane. She sees and hears things that those around her do not and has even attacked her husband. Her husband is a very wealthy man who can afford to hire a large staff to keep her protected - and isolated. When a struggling author is approached to write a biography of the husband he is intrigued by the project. Not only is the money an inducement but the subject had been a student of his father's. Entering the isolated estate house the writer soon finds himself drawn into the domestic drama that soon reveals itself to be much more than just sad and tawdry.This is an interesting novel, not at all up to Michaels/Peters standard but still an acceptable way to spend a few hours. Fans of this author might be curious to see if they can spot any foreshadowing of later works."},{"Title":"The dark on the other side","review":"Not one of her very best; but Barbara Michaels never, ever fails to deliver-and we are talking alot of books under several names.

Author Tom Hathaway seems to think so.He and his mother set out in 1968 to become \\"the Che Guevaras of sex.\\" As he reports in TABOO: A MEMOIR, it began in the psychedelic aftermath of a Rolling Stones concert when he was 18 and she was 36. Back home after the concert, stoned on mescaline, they started dancing to the Stones' records, and one thing led to another.The next day they both felt guilty, but guilt was unhip. Stopping the guilt was easier than stopping the sex. When the world didn't fall in on them as they had expected, they kept doing it.Perhaps to justify their incest, they saw themselves as sexual subversives working to overthrow patriarchy. Rather than a crime against nature, their affair was cultural anarchism in action.The mother was a radical from the Beat Generation days, so a rebellious lifestyle was appealing to her. She had raised the son alone and was now a career woman, a left-wing lawyer.The father was a deadbeat beatnik poet who had become a drug dealer and gone to prison. But when dad was paroled, their troubles began. He wanted back in the family, and when they rebuffed him, he suspected what they were up to, then caught them at it and tried to blackmail them.They managed to outsmart him, though, and send him back to prison.Tom and Diana eventually got married in a private ceremony and stayed together until her recent death from cancer. \\"I still miss her terribly,\\" he writes. \\"My life feels incomplete. I seek her in my dreams.\\"Years ago we had wondered if we'd be punished, if something terrible would happen to us. Now I realize that my punishment is that no one can take Diana's place. Her loss has devastated me. She was both wife and mother, and that seems to not just double but square the grief I feel.\\"Despite the pain, I'm so glad to have known and loved her in the way I did. We were so close for so long. Although it had its stresses and traumas, this love was right for us, the most rewarding and joyful part of our lives.\\"However, that doesn't mean it would be right for everyone. Our story shouldn't be seen as a blanket endorsement of incest. I find the way it is often practiced to be deplorable, degrading, and usually destructive for all parties concerned. A father or mother aggressing their young children is harmful and wrong. Children shouldn't be having sex with any adult, especially a parent; it interferes with their emotional development. Children are still dependent and often haven't started building their bridge from parental protection and care to a place of self-love, self-esteem, and self-sufficiency. They haven't yet become persons in their own right. Thus, having sex with a parent can overwhelm them and interfere with this maturation process.\\"He claims, though, that, \\"Incest between consenting adults is a different issue, one of personal freedom, really no one else's business, especially now that birth control has removed the genetic risk. Once we get over the superstitious dread, it becomes another private preference, an activity that will appeal to some people and not to others. As with many matters, we can live and let live, love and let love.\\"Although his writing sometimes gets a bit flowery, it's usually very good. In places, the book is even humorous. Hathaway manages to make incest, well, human. He also captures the spirit of the 1960s quite well. There's a sample under the Love section.

No way!###Jim Travis reads and writes and sometimes works in Massachusetts.Originally published in OpEdNews"},{"Title":"Taboo","review":"A highly erotic tale broaching the subject of adult consensual incest, Taboo :A Memoir- Confessions of Forbidden Love, shines a spotlight on a sexually explicit journey spanning thirty-five years.The physical sensual attraction between mother and son rips through cultural boundaries, poses ethical and emotional chaos while sorting itself, and presents legal ramifications in today's world. Within the pages of this author's journal shines a love story - one of choice, desire, personal awareness, monogamy, and commitment. This connection of intimacy strengthens in the decision of hidden union. Unauthorized marriage vows bind the couple in a path few openly embrace.One may be shocked by the course of action made by Tom Hathaway and his mother, but one effect stands firmly under scrutiny. Love existed beyond the framework of mere animal attraction. For whatever reasons, this lifetime offered an alternate and unique experience for expressing the deep dedication to love between man and woman. Taboo: A Memoir remains a love story where the pendulum swings as two adults strove diligently to pursue personal goals while maintaining a fulfilling pledge of undertaking considered aberrant."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"I first read George Saunders in a 2005 issue of Harper's Magazine, and found that story, \\"Brad Carrigan, American\\" to be a refreshing, albeit somewhat cavalier absurdist satire of modern American life, underscored by a real moral imperative. Saunders is clearly much attuned to and deeply concerned by the ways in which our superficial consumer culture shadows its own inherent violence and spiritual impoverishment. Or something like that. These same concerns are also reflected in his earliest stories.Published in 1996, Civilwarland is Saunders' first collection, featuring six stories and a novella. The stories are, for the most part, a disappointing series rehashing a similar theme. Each of the pieces in this collection is written in the first person and narrated in the same basic voice: male, passive, disempowered, usually impotent. In one story the narrator is apparently female, but the sense is the same. With one exception, all of the pieces involve a themed amusement park of some sort where the narrator is an employee, and in every instance the narrative is punctuated by several arbitrary acts of brutal violence. I found the repetitive hyperbolic satire of these stories to be obnoxious and over-blown, angry and frustrated without offering any real insight.Through the working out of his one-trick thematic structure, Saunders seems to trying to get at something, and he finally achieves a measure of real craft in the collection's novella, \\"Bounty,\\" which comprises half the book. This dystopian, tragicomic work of speculative fiction, set in a near future suffering the consequences of our moral and environmental destructiveness, echoes Margaret Atwood's masterful bookOryx and Crake. The novella, unlike the other pieces in Civilwarland, is actually engaging, a fairly well-developed and redeeming tale where Saunders' hilariously mangled corporate-correctness-speak shines. Still, with half the book a loss, it's difficult to recommend."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"What makes these stories work is the voice. There is a clear authorial voice here, one which remains familiar without becoming grating. Occasionally the stories miss the mark (&quot;The Wavemaker Falters&quot;) but mostly they're dead on. Saunders manages to convey a sense of melancholy and decay that's just perfect.If you came to buy this collection after hearing &quot;Offloading for Mrs Schwartz&quot; on This American Life, hesitate no longer. Buy the book."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"Since reading Blackburn by Bradley Denton, I've been looking for a book that matches its thrilling dark humor. This isn't quite it, but it's close enough that I certainly wasn't disappointed. The way he strings words together can be genius! My favorite example is the title of one of the short stories: Downtrodden Mary and Her Failed Campaign of Terror. In each story I found passages that I simply *had* to read aloud. It's definitely worth it."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"Some people will not like this book. Some people will be turned off by the title, the first sentence, the typeset. And that's okay.William Butler Yeats predicts in his poem, \\"The Second Coming,\\" that \\"things fall apart; the center cannot hold\\" when the apocalypse occurs. As a writer, George Saunders proves that these now post-apocalyptic and dystopic fragments of what life once was are closer than our society likes to imagine. His gluing together of the chaotic remains of America into his stories is both hysterical and chilling. Saunders pays particular attention to the casual nuances of everyday life, yet manages to bring universal flaws of mankind to the table. In Civilwarland in Bad Decline, he explores the defecating depths of human travesty by highlighting society's biggest travesties as well as man's most trivial imperfections.Saunders is obviously fascinated by American society, and portrays its dystopic cousin in such a way that he embellishes our culture's flaws while transporting the reader to a near-future or alternate present. Though not completely cohesive throughout all of the stories in Civilwarland in Bad Decline, Saunders' version of America is grossly distorted. In the novella \\"Bounty,\\" he fashions a country ripped apart its seams by mutant slavery, overtaken by corporate America, and devoid of any compassion. Yet, amidst this abnormal alternative universe, Saunders incorporates pop culture references such as Dr. Pepper, Playboy, and even a McDonald's, though it has since been occupied by a religious cult.Saunders seems to enjoy writing characters with heavily flawed personalities, but he especially excels at describing their physical defects, allowing the reader to pick up on the satire without the aid of blunt accusations. In the story \\"Bounty,\\" he creates a mutant race of imperfect people known as the Flaweds. Each Flawed has his or her own special defect, such as \\"Mollie, a hag whose Flaw is a colossal turkeyneck,\\" or \\"Buddy who was born with no teeth and Mike who has twice as many as he needs.\\" Saunders expresses the irony man's cyclical discrimination, this time focusing on physical differences, rather than religious, sexual or intellectual differences. This can be attributed to a society obsessed with outer beauty, striving to obtain beauty over brains.Saunders is not the type of writer who wants to detail every shred of nightfall over the course of two pages. In fact, in \\"The 400-Pound CEO,\\" he does it in two sentences: \\"Big clouds roll in. Birds light on the Dumpster and feed on substances caked on the lid.\\" His images are often vulgar, jarring and imaginative. Saunders uses the English language like one would use a sports car around a mountain, working with the bumps and sharp turns along the way.Saunders' dystopias are usually tarnished and overtaken completely by corporations and businesses that are meant to sustain themselves, not their employees. After a crazed worker shoots a boy in \\"Civilwarland\\", the narrator rationalizes why he \\"decided to leave the police out of it because of the possible bad PR . . . and that's that.\\" Even sex is commercialized, and due to its institutionalization, \\"a safeOrgy fills you with longing and repulses you at the same time.\\"Saunders is a master of the failed, pathetic Everyman, as one narrates each story in Civilwarland in Bad Decline. Saunders' characters are difficult to like, but easier to relate to than most would feel comfortable admitting. Uncovering the honesty and universal wishes in these miserable characters make them particularly moving. It is unsettling to realize that one shares the same ultimate desires as the heavily flawed characters in alternate universe of such disarray.\\"Is this the life I envisioned for myself? My God no,\\" one character admits. Obviously, dystopias are not meant for everyone. While Saunders' writing is fresh and quirky, his stories should not be taken lightly: They are the post-apocalyptic fragments of today's society, just waiting to cave in when the center finally gives."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"I had high expectations, and Saunders never let me down. Basically, he manages to pull off something I wouldn't believe without hearing about it: the combination of the quirky postmodern feel and the straightforward emotional tug of the &quot;normal&quot; short story. &quot;Offloading for Mrs. Schwartz&quot; has an absurdist sci-fi premise and ends up as one of the more moving things I've read in recent memory, or even at all. I love my Pynchon and Wallace - I really do - but they rarely give me goosebumps, truth be known. CivilWarLand is hilarious and meaningful, and I highly recommend it. (Sentimentalists beware: this may be the gateway drug to your hardcore Gravity's Rainbow kind of thing. Use with caution.)"},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"I really enjoyed this book, which is very much in the absurdist/satirical tradition of Donald Barthelme. Saunders's fiction, however, is easier to decode than Don B.'s, probably because Saunders performs his stories in the voices of very sympathetic, underdog first-person narrators. He shares Don B.'s gift for exposing the most ridiculous patterns in our cultural discourse, but he does so in the process of shaping deeply symbolic stories, as opposed to Barthelme's brilliant, jarring fragments. I am really looking forward to his next collection."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"This collection of short stories presents a strong and unique voice, wonderful composition, and a genuine sweetness missing in other \\"modern\\" works. There is a painful beauty expressed in the empty places explored here. The reader is reminded of his own humanity in an absence of emotion, a dose of existential angst, and the cold, barbaric nature of the world into which Saunder's characters are placed. This book is sad, funny and powerful, all at once. I read it regularly."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"Sure, there are precursors to George Saunders-Kurt Vonnegut, Mark Twain, Nathaniel West, to name a few. However, I find his voice to be one of the most unique in American literature today. The stories are, for the most part, extremely funny. Yet there is a sense of darkness and despair to be found lurking in each of them, and then the ending of each story seems to cleanse the darkness and leave the reader refreshed. I'd hate to call a work of literature cathartic, but somehow I feel like the stories in &quot;Civilwarland in Bad Decline&quot; almost are cathartic in a way. The stories have deeper resonances, but never come across as difficult or pretentious. In the case of George Saunders, it appears, we have a natural story-teller."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"Saunders is a storyteller. And his stories are rollicking rides through landscapes that are hometown familiar and otherworldly at the same time. The stories are dark, funny, deeply humane and wickedly critical of the artiface and avarice of societies real and contrived. His is an original American voice."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"The hype for his most recent Tenth of December release prompted me to visit CivilWarLand. While some stories are poignant and revealing others just sit there. This volume is far less developed and mature and far less satisfying than Tenth of December. It does provide a guide to later development and the surreal environment that Saunders often likes to play in. Reviewing this work provides a clearer picture of the author's place in the firmament."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"I think the reason I gave this book 5 stars instead of 4 was for the story \\"Isabelle\\" otherwise the book is a 4 star book. The story \\"Isabelle\\" has the unique distinction of being one of the few stories to literally make me cry. It was hauntingly beautifully, devastating with a strange edge of hope, and well written. I would recommend this book on this story alone but the other stories were also good if not standard George Saunders. This collection is definitely on the darker side of what he writes and \\"Civilwarland in Bad Decline\\" had one of the most haunting endings I have ever experienced from a short story. So, if you are looking for a collection of stories that are intelligent, well written, and thought provoking and do not mind a darker edge then you will get what you are looking for in this book. If you are looking for something light and fun to read you may want to try something else, or a different collection of stories by Saunders."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"This was the first collection of Saunders stories I read and is still the most memorable."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"I just finished re-reading this book, after having found it 8 or 9 years ago.It's a fun, provocative read.This time what struck me was how Saunders suffuses his stories of surreal exaggerations of modern life with bureaucratic structures that make the bizarre things that happen and the bizarre situations in the stories seem familiar and reasonable to the characters in them.So long as we have somebody monitoring our actions, neat categories to organize our jobs and lives, and metrics to measure how well we're doing, we're right at home. The substance doesn't really matter. We can turn anything into an acceptable commodity with a little bit of producty clothing or rational skin (\\"Chill'n'Pray\\", \\"New Employee Observation\\", \\"Mobile Embalmer\\", . . .).If you like Delillo's White Noise, you'll like this, and v.v."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"I'm coming very late to the game, having just begun reading CivilWarLand in Bad Decline. I loved \\"The Wavemaker Falters.\\" And the first half of \\"The 400-Pound CEO.\\" Saunders has staked out his own very particular patch of Americana. Theme parks are rife for ridicule (in the way that circuses also seem to be). Sometimes he reminds me of Don de Lillo, but new and improved. Sometimes he reminds me of the woman who wrote GEEK LOVE. But I absolutely adored every sentence of \\"The Wavemaker Falters.\\" I've never read a story so beautiful."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"Ignore the haters. This is a fine book of short stories by a verytalented author. Some stories are laugh out loud funny, some willtouch your heart, all of them are worth your time. Don't miss outon reading them. As I write this, I realize that this probably ismy favorite collection of short stories that I've read as of late."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"Saunders kindly presents us with another collection of stories written with such incredible skill as to seem effortless. He further explores passivity and consumerism, and features more failing theme parks marketing specific American historical periods to gullible tourists. The novella, \\"Bounty\\", about a mutant's journey cross-country to save his sister, is brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.These stories are not as overtly humorous as most of his others, but still just as enveloping and sharp. If you're not a bad person, you should be reading George Saunders' output. And loving it."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"Fifteen pages in, I was fairly certain this would be one of the best short story collections I had ever read. That probably holds, although I was surprised to see, in Bounty and the title story especially, that Saunders often dropped the ball just before the wrap-up in each story. He lost control of the narrative, and it either got too dark, or too sentimental. 90% of the book is outstanding, though, and The 400lb CEO was worth the risk of walking nonchalantly out of the store with this slim volume invisibly tucked into the sleeve of my coat. Am I jesting? (Is he jesting?)"},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"This short fiction is the best published in years. Readers of David Foster Wallace and Rick Moody will find much to enjoy here, but Saunders' fresh voice is all his own. His views on the near future are apocalyptic (of course, they would be), archly amusing, and (most surprising) humane. I especially enjoyed the title story, &quot;The 400-Pound CEO,&quot; &quot;Downtrodden Mary's Failed Campaign of Terror,&quot; and the novella &quot;Bounty&quot; (satire worthy of Voltaire). I can't wait to read more by this writer. This book is a genuine treat."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"These stories are simply amazing. They are filled with dark scenes and grim thoughts. One minute they will make you laugh and the next, your conscience will reprimand you for your laughter. They teach, they amuse, they sadden, they delight. Wow.I recommend them to anyone who likes to think."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"If I could recommend one book published in the last five years, I think this would be the one. I bought this book because I loved David Foster Wallace and he praised it in an interview, but this book shattered all expectations I had.This is a book that cuts through everything and reimagines the state of humanity. His overexposed lens of a nightmarish future allow Saunders to show us the necessity of humanity in a consummeristic world fraught with unutterable loneliness. The shocking similarities to our own lives is devestating and Saunders is one of the few contemporary writers with a true understanding of the role and necessity of a refigured morality for our lives.Anyone who wants to write should read these story. This book is what is necessary for literature to find a place in contemporary America."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this collection of short stories. Saunders prose is similar to Vonnegut, but uniquely his own. I don't care if Saunders ever writes a novel (which seems to be most people's biggest complaint of Saunders' work).His stories' are dark and very humorous. I would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"Bought this for my Kindle solely on the NY Times book review as well as recommendations on the Morning Joe show on MSNBC. Wish I'd previewed it before clicking 'buy', Yes, the writing is good but the unrelenting negative tone of the stories made me stop reading them. Won't finish this book."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"Decided to read George Saunders first book after reading the recent bio of him in the NY Times. Some interesting stuff here, but certainly not as earth shattering as people make his work out to be."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"How rare it is to discover an author who uses both humor and drama so well and at the same time.This collection of short stories, CivilWarLand in Bad Decline is as hilarious is it is disturbing and unsettling. This author is a genius in all senses of the word.In the story, CivilWarLand in Bad Decline along with the subsequent story in the collection are about the tyrannical oppression of a Disneyland-type Resort, if it were run by...people. These stories are harrowing and hilarious, and of course crazy.My favorite story in the collection is called the 400 Pound CEO, about a heavy man who lives a sad life. Just when things start going good for him, everything spins out of control and becomes, like CivilWarLand, run by absolute anarchy.This collection is a delight to read in many aspects, and a quick read at that. It is one of the best collections in recent memory, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"I am somewhat familiar with the concept of \\"living history museums.\\" That being said, I read CivilWarLand in Bad Decline with my mouth hanging open in shock. I mean.... how did he know? The exaggeration that makes it hilarious is not so far from the reality of struggling museums doing anything and everything they can think of to boost ticket sales!Well, just imagine it this way. A few hundred years from today, they might turn your home town into a museum. Of course, museums are dedicated to authenticity... So, they build a stages all over town, hire actors to loudly scream out highly improbable scenes from your life on every street corner, and everyone has a bad foreign accent that might be British, might be Irish, or might just be a speech impediment.As a director of one museum actually stated, \\"I won't let history get in the way of a good story.\\"In that same spirit, I will promise you that CivilWarLand in Bad Decline is one terrific story that will entertain with humor and the amazing skill of the author. It is not to be missed."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"If you're feeling that life is getting to be too muchDisney, shopping malls, and TV infomercials, this IS the book for you. You'd hope corporate moguls would read it; but then -- they just wouldn't get it, would they?"},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"I can't help but feel like a jackass for coming to the game so late. It has been over ten years since Civilwarland in Bad Decline was first published and introduced George Saunders to the literary world. As a guy who is constantly pounding the table about the value of short stories, I look a bit o' the fool for having not read and known the value of Saunders' debut collection. What a way to kick in the doors and make an entrance into the literary world.Saunders is amazingly comfortable in his own skin -- he's running with a great stride in these stories, carrying the reader along with him effortlessly. Nothing ever seems forced. Both Flannery O'Connor and Mavis Gallant had that same ability, and in many ways Saunders is as adept at writing stories that seemed to have been set down on earth and exist (you never feel as if you're reading, you are a witness).It is an American vision, albeit a twisted, dark, and tragicomic one. The world of Saunders' stories is our America, but turned inside out, revealing our ugly insides. And that alone makes them a pleasure to read.On the surface most of the tales in Civilwarland in Bad Decline focus around theme parks or attractions that at first seem absurd, but as you read into the story, don't seem that implausible. The Civilwarland theme park of the title story is savaged by teenage gangs, has authentic civil-war era tormented souls, and a reconstructed Eerie Canal complete with a historically inaccurate smell of Chinese food. There is the water park sporting a \\"Leaping Trout Subroutine\\" for authenticity and a very deadly wave pool. Oh and the not-so-perfect holographic projection franchise and the not-so-on-the-level raccoon disposal business and a science museum that includes pickled babies and cows with plexiglass stomachs. I almost forgot to mention the medieval times theme park staffed by mutants. But nothing works, or at least not the way it should. The bird count in Civilwarland is off so they have to kill several hundred orioles. The plexiglass cows keep dying. The wave pool sucks small children into the turbines. The holograph devices can actually siphon a customer's memories. It is a strange America that Saunders presents to us, but not so far-fetched. It is just our foibles and desires and sins amplified to comic effect. This is usually why most people cannot go three lines without mentioning Vonnegut when talking about Saunders' stories.But the superstructures that hold up all these stories are simple morality tales. Most, with the exception of \\"Downtrodden Mary's Failed Campaign of Terror,\\" center around emasculated or down-trodden men having to face up to the consequences of their actions. It gives the stories their sadness and their hook. One moment you're laughing at Saunders wit only to be sucker punched by the reality of a character's situation. The narrator of the title story, discovering that his de facto security guard has taken his role a little too seriously upon capturing a teenage candy thief, is forced to bury a severed hand behind the theme park. As he digs, he's confronted by the ghosts of the park -- a civil-war era family who really haven't gotten over the whole death thing -- launching the otherworldly collective into a Macbeth like hand wringing scene. It breaks your heart.And that is what makes these stories works so perfectly. They break you down, even as they have you laughing out loud. The best story in the collection, \\"Isabelle,\\" is almost an odd-duck as it is a straight tale of small town life. But it destroys you. It lays you out flat on a slab. The prose is simple, precise, razor-sharp. In all good short story collections, there is always one piece that justifies the cost of the others. \\"Isabelle\\" is worth the price of the book alone.The collection is not perfect. The final novella, \\"Bounty,\\" while entertaining in parts feels like an unneeded, over-extended exclamation point to the stories in front of it. If I had to guess, the publisher included it so as not to make the collection seem too short. And in some ways, the recurring themes can start to feel heavy-handed as you get four or five stories into the book. But Saunders always saves the day. His writing is so perfectly witty, sharp, and poignant, that you're willing to drop the petty criticisms and follow the tale. That is a sign of great writing."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"I think the reviewer (The NY Times, was it?) who described Saunders as the illegitimate offspring of Nathaniel West and Kurt Vonnegut, as much as I usually hate such analogies, hit the proverbial nail right on the head. Saunders' endearing sense of humor seems to me to be a cross of those two literary giants'. However, there is nothing derivative or hackneyed about this collection at all. In fact, I think he is the most original and interesting of literature's new voices. Though many of the stories share much in common, the collection is, as a whole, diverse and extremely enjoyable. Maybe even cathartic? I found &quot;Civilwarland in Bad Decline&quot; to be one of the most enjoyable collections I've read in years and I'd recommend it to anyone searching for something new from the world of literature."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"Saunders is a writer that is working on a single theme, with singular energy. This is not a problem for a writer if he brings something fresh to the theme each time he tackles it. Saunders will sometimes do this, but more often than not, he fails. That is why some of the stories in this collection are brilliant, while others seem like derivatives of those moments of brilliance. Rather than bring us a fresh insight on the problems of fiction, Saunders seems content to simply reiterate. Saunders is the archetypical writer of magazine fiction: in between the slick covers of The New Yorker his work is a bold standout, but when you set his stories alongside each other in a volume, the record skips."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"Saunders is a master of the idomatic chatter of everyday characters and their tortured inner monologues. Unfortunately, Civilwarland suffers in comparison to his much better and more recent collection Pastoralia.The problem is that the settings for the stories in Civilwarland are all very similar, often set in marginal businesses and in jokey theme parks. Although Saunders gets the management-speak perfectly, it becomes wearing as each story is virtually the same in setting and tone.As much as I love his style, I found this collection hard going. One reviewer here at Amazon has said that you should read one Saunders short story every month and that seems about right to me."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"This is a fantastic look at a future America that is not quite a nightmare yet; however it is a fevered night-sweat full of tossing and turning on sticky polyester blankets.George Saunders has created a world solely his own, where everything is a scam and the hucksters are everywhere; from the wave-pool to the museums to the theme parks. Everything is for sale and the price is reasonable. Just don't look too closely or you'll notice that the merry facades hide some sinister secrets.This is one of my favorite books of the last several years and is at the top of my recommended reading list; but beware, this is the type of book that people tend to forget to return. I'd suggest purchasing several copies and, with the holidays approaching, give them as gifts. Trust me, it'll be appreciated.

All the ills of our society become magnified in his visions, particularly in his novella, set in a United States where disease, pollution, prejudice and greed have done the work we thought the H-bomb would do. In most of these stories, the heros find some kind of redemption, even if it's the redemption to be found in death and the afterlife. A strangely Calvinistic look a the world.

The reviewers have it wrong; it isn't Saunders' vision that is &quot;skewed&quot; or &quot;demented.&quot; It's our own perception that's skewed; this is satire of the caliber of &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, only this time around it's not the absurdity surrounding the bomb that's the target, but our own crazed desire to create artificial worlds in which to entertain or distract ourselves. In &quot;CivilWarLand&quot;, Americans behave in treacherous and self-absorbed ways, only to confront the horror or absurdity afterwards, if at all.

In stories and a novella, Saunders paints anightmare world that, on minimal examination, turns out tobe nothing more than trends in America today taken to theirlogical conclusions. All of the stories are set in anindeterminate future dominated by antimoral entrepreneurswho gleefully exploit and discard their socio-economic andgenetic inferiors. With relentless, dead-on humorSaunders measures humanity's degradation threshold. Onlycharacters like &quot;Mr Guilt,&quot; the 400-pound CEO, and the&quot;flawed&quot; guerilla Cole relieve the bleakness with theirrallying cry to the underclass: &quot;enough already, enough, this is as low as I go.&quot"},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"This collection of short stories (along with the more recent &quot;Pastoralia&quot; collection) will define the course of short fiction in America for years to come. The voice, thematic relevance in all these stories hit home without mercy. No one has written fiction like this, in such a way. Only comparable writers that come to mind are Mark Leyner (who's as funny as Saunders but doesn't bring his stories together as him) David Foster Wallace (too self-engrossed) and Dave Eggers. Odd situations and hallucinatory scenes abound. But they all serve to comment on the modern-day human condition, and they serve that purpose devastatingly. All the characters in these stories are the 'losers' of this world. No one has written about them with more sympathy and candor than Saunders. He doesn't reduce these poor people as caricatured vehicles for his humor, but uses their humanity to point his finger at the laughable veneer of vanity/egotism that envelops the modern American society. A chilling, sad, human collection of stories."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"There are six short stories and a novella in this compilation. I only found Civicwarland and The 300 Pound CEO memorable and interesting. The other stories seemed to follow the formula too closely and with less success than my favorites: (1) an odd, sometimes funny business meant to be a parody of American consumerism (2) a lowly worker at this company who is miserable in life (3) A slow decline into meaninglessness (4) our narrator either tries to kill himself or simply thinks about killing himself.Does this make for good literature? Yes and no. Yes, because the morbid comedy and hopelessness of his world does provoke some wonderful questions. No, because the questions are mostly disconnected from his characters, who I never related to.Maybe Saunders stories suffer from a similar problem to Flannery O'Connors classic tales, I never found myself rooting for the main characters. Everyone in Saunder's world is a whiney loser who blames the world (or God) for their problems. The world they live in is so surreal that I never can sympathize with them.In his next compilation \\"Pastoralia,\\" Saunders does a much better job creating characters you can relate to, but they mostly follow the above formula. (I recommend the short story \\"Sea Oak.\\" This is his best short to date.) Can I blame him for following a formula? No. The formula is great and original. Can I keep reading story after story of the same formula? No.Just get Pastoralia and read \\"Sea Oaks.\\""},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"the kind of book that makes reading a PLEASURE. mr saunders has an incredible immagination and writes clean direct prose, and (best of all) is not afraid (or is capable of) writing ENJOYABLE stories. so many authors (especially short stories writers) simply crap out pretentious writer workship type material without any story to tell at all.

Henry Awards_ books.I just can't wait for something lengthy (yes, yes! a novel! please) by this satirist par excellence. Buy it!"},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"I got CIVILWARLAND in Bad Decline from a friend, and having never heard of Saunders before that I put off reading it for a few months. When I finally did on a week-long road trip, I was blown away. I sat in a campsite in Arizona and laughed out loud as I zoomed through all the stories in the book in most of an afternoon and evening.Not much to say that hasn't been said here already, but if you like the work of Kurt Vonnegut, Tom Robbins and/or Douglas Adams, you MUST read Saunders work. Hilarious!"},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"If I could communicate, as clearly as possible, the embodiment of a 'glowing review,' I would do it here. These days it seems almost anyone can write a decent sentence. There are so many MFA programs out there now, that it seems like more people write short stories than read them. Yet, to come across a talent as huge as George Saunders (by education an Engineer, by pure gift of God, a writer) is still something to behold. With so many good writers writing good stories made of good sentences, its kind of tough to stand out and write with true excellence and originality. But George Saunders does this. Oh, does he do this. You don't know the meaning of the word pathetic until you step into the heads of some of these characters. Granted, you will get the sneaking feeling that the same protagonist is being transported from place to place and story to story, with few changes, but Saunder's heroes (if we can call them that) are so pathetic, so pitiable, so 'downtrodden,' that you can read of their ridiculous plights repeatedly and still be surprised at how good it makes you feel to do so. The main reason for this is Saunder's killer prose; it's almost an invented dialect of the post-modern mind. The very phrasing makes you feel like you're being tickled. And there's the voyeuristic aspect concomitant with today's TV culture. It's just great fun to watch bad things happen to normal people. And even if the main characters are very similar, the supporting cast is always a riot, complete with beautifully idiotic dialogue and deadpan narration. But perhaps the most remarkable aspect of these ironic, self-mocking tales, is their undercurrent of sympathy and sensitivity. At the end of nearly every story, Saunders manages to change the tone faster than Jeff Gordon can go through the gearbox, and suddenly you find yourself disarmed by the recognition of your own cynicism and what it might prevent you from knowing."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"After hearing George Saunders' name mentioned alonside those of Denis Johnson, Tim O'Brien and Donald Barthelme, modern masters of the short story, I was suprised to find that he only had one small collection in print. After reading that one collection I was shocked to discover that George Saunders has more inborn talent than perhaps any other writer in America today. That he chooses to use that talent in the way he does, crafting edgy, disturbing tales of cultural corruption and alienation, bodes very well for the future of American letters.The collection draws its title from the first story in the book, probably the best story written by any American author in the last half of the 20th century. Describing the story with any brevity is an almost impossible task. Suffice it to say that it concerns a civil war style theme park director haunted by civil war era ghosts who hires a psychotic Vietnam veteran to rid the park of the gangs who keep invading the place and terrorizing the workers and visitors. This ludicrous story line is sharpened by Suanders' remarkable wit and spirals to a shocking and disturbing conclusion.Unfortunately, none of the remaining stories in the book equal the brilliance of the first, but none of them really disappoint the reader either. &quot;Isabelle&quot; is strangely moving and &quot;The 400 Pound CEO&quot; is a tragicomedy whose ending is so innevitable that it is almost painful to read. George Saunders from whom there is much to expect and he has the undeniable talent to back up those expectations."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"George Saunders is an excellent new writer in the vein of Denis Johnson ... he is funnier than Johnson, and not quite as wordy in my opinion. That being said, if you like Johnson, you'll like Saunders.The title story is probably the best in this collection, though I think the &quot;400 Pound CEO&quot; is a close second. Both of these stories have a cruel sense of irony, likeable characters who can't seem to get much right, and a wicked ending. There is a pattern to Saunders' work, but I've never found it monotonous because of the variety of events and turns of plot.If you're interested in very different fiction, then pick up this slim volume. Be prepared to laugh and be prepared to be more than a little disturbed."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"'Civilwarland in Bad Decline' is a collection of half a dozen stories and a novella, some set in the near-future, the rest indefinitely contemporary - but all of them written from such an absorbingly odd perspective that they seem to originate in a parallel dimension a half step out of sync with our own. Exactly what it is that twists Mr. Saunders' prose out of joint is hard to define - sometimes it is small details and concepts thrown at the reader without definition (deciphered through context), and other times it is the singularly strange mindset and motivations of his secondary characters. This is also intensified by the author's tendency to give his protagonists unusual occupations, such as a water park wavemaker operator (The Wavemaker Falters), a raccoon exterminator (The 400-Pound CEO), and a Verisimilitude Inspector at a Civil War reenactment facility (Civilwarland in Bad Decline).This last story is the first presented, and arguably the best. A yes-man to the director of a Civil War themed living museum conspires with his boss on the best way to rid the park of periodic intrusions by violent gangs who terrorize the paying customers. Eventually they find that one of the men on their current payroll had been involved in some questionable activities during his tour in Vietnam, and they approach him to solve their gang problems - to meet violence with violence - a tactic that involves some shady moral rationalizations. Combining quirky dry humor, magical realism, Tarentino-esque violence, an emasculated and morally paralyzed main character, and a satirical critique of modern America, 'Civilwarland' is part commentary on society and part comedic bleak nihilism. Good fun!Unfortunately, Mr. Saunders repeats the relative merits of the opening tale in each of his successive stories. Although the setting changes drastically, each main character is too alike - suffering from unmanageable guilt, neutered and generally abandoned by their wives and love interests, forced to submit in humiliating ways to their male counterparts - and though the quality of Mr. Saunder's technique is consistently superior throughout, like most single author collections, this is not one that is enhanced by reading straight through. In fact, it would probably be best to separate each story by several months.Another issue with the collection is that by the time I reached the last story, (the novella 'Bounty'), I started to suspect that Mr. Saunder's fascination with humiliating his main characters - mentally, physically and sexually - might be the author's way of venting his masochistic interests. The stories began to read like vehicles primarily designed to frolic within this specific arena, and while every aspect of human behavior is certainly open to literary examination, I began to have the uncomfortable feeling that this was masochism for masochism's sake, written under the disguise of social commentary.All of this adds up to an uneven collection whose parts are vastly greater than the whole. Five stars for the story 'Civilwarland in Bad Decline', three overall."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"Saunders is an exciting writer, one of the bona fide bright spots in contemporary fiction. I love his take on consumer society; it is the perfect antidote to the Wal-Mart-Land we McLive in. And apparently, given the subject matter of his latest collection, he has the critique-of-consumerism-via-unlikely-theme-park domain all to himself. Like Pynchon and Barthelme, Saunders is not a realist, but rather an absurdist with a biting sense of humor. There is, as one reviwer notes, a certain sameness to these stories, but the same could be said about Melville's novels, Stevens's poems, or Bruckner's symphonies. I can't recommend Saunders more enthusiastically, but those who prefer realism should beware."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"George Saunders seems able to write only about near-future corporate hell and decaying theme parks. And, he writes the same types of characters into each story. The main characters cannot act out their desires, because their desires place them outside the system. This makes them somewhat pitiful. The ones who can act out their desires within the system are objectionable because they are tailoring their desire to the system itself. Saunders has staked out for himself this part of the torture of modern life.In the hands of a less talented writer, this narrow focus of setting and character would be a drawback. The decayed settings and amoral characters of Donald Antrim's writings are similar, for example, but after a few Antrim stories, you see that there is no more depth than the surface chaos.Saunders seems able to find new depth in the souls of his characters every time he looks into them. In his work, each main character finds his own way out of the rat race. Oh, it also doesn't hurt that Saunders' writing is hilarious and highly readable."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"I initially discovered G. Saunders in the New Yorker via a short story entitled &quot;The End of FIRPO in the World&quot; -- taken from Pastoralia -- and became and instant fan. This is the first book of his short stories I bought, and shortly there after I also purchased Pastoralia, his second collection. Both are wonderfully written, dark and very funny without seeming repetitive or forced. His stories are some of the most original and fresh I've read by a contemporary author in a long while, and I've passed his books on to many friends."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"I think a dosage label should come with all of Saunder's books. It should read\\"Read one story per month.\\"What was your first Saunders? \\"Offloading for Mrs. Schwartz\\" was mine. It was in the first issue of The New Yorker with Tina Brown at the helm. I remember this well, because I wrote a review of the \\"new\\" New Yorker for my college paper at the time and was super-impressed with Offloading, especially juxtaposed against the boring John Updike short that was also featured in the issue.In the last 4-5 months, I've read a number of Saunders stories in the New Yorker: \\"Sea Oak,\\" \\"The Barber's Unhappiness,\\" and \\"Pastoralia,\\" all of which are probably featured in his second collection of shorts. I read these stories 2-3 months apart, and I must say, that's the right pace for Saunders.That brings me to CivilWarLand. Excellent stories, no doubt about it, but when I end up reading one story after next, a rather boring pattern forms:Royally Screwed Protagonist does Something Stupid and ends up Getting Even More Screwed.The whole corporate-speak thing gets old fast. It's Orwellian, sure, but when you dip into the well that often, well, you might as well just jump in. (Maybe Murakami will save you, who knows.)The best stories are the ones with a heart. There's only one of those, and that's Offloading. What a sweet, spectacular ending! It's probably worth the book just for that story alone.The worst story is the novella, \\"Bounty.\\" It just doesn't work. Boring.Still though, Saunders makes me laugh. Writing humor is a tough thing to do, so I have to tip my beenie to Saunders. I don't think there's a funnier writer out there right now.4 stars"},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"As with any collection of short stories, some are better than others. Its a very dark collection, with crushing failure and abandonment of hope being the typical ending. With the exception of \\"Bounty\\" which is almost Sisyphean in its narrative, the stories are tight and enmesh the reader. Overall, the collection starts off strong with the first two stories an tapers off. To me its seems the later stories overly stress the theme of grinding down the main character and skimp on the little details that make the earlier stories more tangible.Because of the unrelenting negativity thats present throughout this book, I agree with reviewer who advises it would be better to read only a story at a time and put the book down for a later date."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"After completing all of the stories in CivilWarLand in Bad Decline, it has never been clearer what an original, thrilling voice George Saunders is. In story after story, the humor is bitter and incisive, finding the cruelest and cleverest method to deliver a punchline, which would be remarkable even without the staggering, sometimes debilitating pathos the humor comes from - take this section-concluding line from the first story I read in the collection, \\"The 400 lb. CEO\\" - \\"The sun sinks, the moon rises, round and pale as my stupid face.\\" It's a line of scabrous humor, of fluid rhythm, and of profound sadness. Yet as each story rang with the same degree of acid-laced angusih, I began to get a little wary of Saunders one-note style. He excels at it, but each story is a present-tense first-person tragicomedy of occasionally liberating, occasionally deadening trauma. It makes a remarkable read, but one that doesn't demand a straight read - any guess about the type of story you're about to begin would probably be correct, so, it'd only be tiresome to read the book cover to cover. The novella in this collection, \\"Bounty,\\" is the most apocalyptic of all of Saunders' creations, but even as it becomes a savage, even visionary work, it begins to fall into a tautological loop - one quixotic character after another shows up only to have his/her impish belief systems ridiculed for a few pages, becoming a fairly redundant cycle of humanity reaffirmed and rejected. You'll read through it in no time, but it'll make you wish Saunders had a few more tricks up his sleeve."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"Emotional, funny, disturbing, reaffirming. This is his first collection but Saunders is already a full-blown writer. And the afterword describing his life up to the point of publishing was an unexpected bonus. Just buy it."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"Wow - never read anything like this before. Absolutley loved every page. Many stories still linger with me. Saunders communicates so much in so few words - its awe inspiring. Not exactly a beach read. So if you like lighter fare, this might be too dark for you. If you are an afficiado of writing you must, must, must read this book!"},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"Couldn't put it down. Great storytelling, fascinating stories, and so unique. I want to read more of his work. As soon as possible."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"George Saunders has written the most amazing fiction I have read in a long time.

Very rewarding reading."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"Gives a voice to the world you might assume is on the fringe of society until you realize it is society. Every sentence worth reading, some will burrow in your head for a long time to come."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"Ok I have never written a review on amazon in the 5 years of ordering books. But I feel I must for the sake of the american short story reader. Not since Thom Jones, no not the singer spelled differently, has there been such a compellingly dark short story writer. These stories define the cliche of the composed short story, begging to know more of these latent people. but in this case I feel like a desperate strung out junky needing a fix of opiated character knowledge. Luckily there is more stories to fix my addiction and now a new collection. Read these stories! They will transform the way you laugh and the way you cry, yes another cliche."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"Somehow I missed out on George Saunders before coming across this book. I won't forget him again. The stories themselves are brilliantly original, funny and sad at the same time. But the sentences...for a writer, those are sentences to die for."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"It is perhaps the best short story book I have ever read. Looking forward to his new book, which I have right behind this one"},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"It's often hard to have deep empathy for literary characters who are living in a different space and time. But Saunders somehow makes you feel more strongly about his characters - maybe because he's placed them in these just-off-center circumstances. I can see why so many writers admire him as much as they do. He's taken tragedy to a new place."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"Very entertaining, somewhat thought provoking read.

Humans at their rawest struggle through the worst possible life in now time in a different reality. Or maybe it I'd reality and our lives based the illusion."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"This book is funny and prophetic. Americans should really consider what the future may be like if they continue their rampant pollution of our constitutional system and our ecological systems. One of the reviews inside the cover says it best, 'the characters doggedly stick to their morals despite extreme obstacles.' In virtually every story, a character is faced with a serious choice, one where weaker minds would give in to the pressures of the world, but they choose to remain true to their identity, for the sake of their sanity and encounter whatever the world dishes out. And you can see how they are able to cope, not because things went well, but because they know who they are. They second guess themselves, but they don't beat themselves up. This book made me feel better about decisions I'd made in my own life and made me a stronger person. It also made me a better writer and storyteller.On top of it all, each story sticks to the theme, which, although carny, is meant as a warning. America could easily become like this if we don't return to our highest ideals.No wonder he won the MacArthur grant shortly after this.If you like short stories, this is a must read."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"The title story is the gem here, about a &quot;passive flake&quot; who works at an historical theme park. Saunders isn't a complex writer, but he has a wonderfully ironic, almost deadpan, style. These aren't exactly uplifitng stories, and clearly go against the grain of our current American optimism.If I have a criticism, it's that a few of the stories seem redundant. I would like to see more by Saunders, but only if he has something more to say. It's hard to imagine he could express his world-view any better than he's done already."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"An interesting debut collection. Most striking is Saunders's style - concise, terse, with wry humour and cleverly weighted comic dialogue. Some of these stories, especially the Novella, Bounty, tend to sag a little and come across as a little cliche hysterical realism, but there are also sections of fine comedy. Best of all, I reckon, is 'The 400 pound CEO' about an obese office gimp who ekes out a tragic existence in a nightmarish corporate scenario with a sadistic boss.Saunders has something of a cult reputation. He deserves a larger audience."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"Just had the pleasure of reading Civilwarland a few months ago. I should have read it years ago. A critique of this wonderfully imaginative book seems superfluous, given all the other reviews here that are accurate in their portrayal of this book as a truly unique, even seminal, work. Inspired and funny, anyone awake enough to see through America's specious promises of equality and fairness will appreciate Saunders' offering."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"George Saunders'prose rolls of the page slick and swiftly. Every one of these stories contains a fantastic and highly original Idea and mixes near future sci fi with elements of magic realism as each main protaganist confronts an existential problem in an insane world. So why not five stars? Nabokov said that a great storyteller should be an 'enchanter'and who could disagree? Saunders' plots work, I found myself able to suspend disbelief and the humour made me laugh often, these pieces are very inventive and insightful into the American Condition. Unfortunately for me, they were not very involving. The problem lies with his style of narration, I found that his lack of description and slow moments had me turning the pages fast, but upon finishing these stories I was left amused yet uncaring and feeling as though I had not been engrossed or 'taken in' - not enchanted. The reason for this is as I have mentioned, that these stroies are all action akin to the novels of Chuck Palahniuk, they keep you turning the pages so fast but overall, the resrained and unelaborate senences lack mood and atmosphere, I found it hard to fully put myself in the shoes and minds of the characters and imagine what the characters were going through. The world they inhabited was only ever partly convincing. Another gripe is that when stripped to the core, they are all essentially the same character facing the same problem. I'm English and the problem may be that this clipped, terse and minimalist style of prose has not, thankfully, caught on over here. Less is not allways more - try some of the shorter works by writers such as Will Self, Gogol, Dostoevsky, Poe, Maupassant, Peter Carey, Ballard - to name but a few - and see what I mean."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"The stories were boring and terse. I think he was hitting the ... and making the ... up as he went along. The 400lb CEO was supposed to be the best story in the bunch and it was weak. I did not finish this book."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"The cover copy blurbs tried to sell the book as a cross between Nathanael West and Kurt Vonnegut. This blurb lies. Like I said, the book show promise. The scenarios the author dreams up to place his characters in are interesting. What doesn't work is how the characters act and interact. Also, while interesting, some of the scenarios are also unrealistic. In both \\"The 400 pound CEO\\" and \\"Bounty,\\" we are expected to think that the actions could be happening now. However, the characters actions and inner thoughts belie a naivety of how humans think and interact.Saunders comes across as an intelligent but tin-eared writer who, I hope has developed from his tendencies. Another drawback is that he relies on dialogue for a good amount of exposition. This is tiring for the reader. I am frankly surprised at all the accolades he has gathered. If he has earned them, I am worried about the state of the short story in this country. These works come across as the output of a high level student writer, like my friend Andy Bolt.If Saunders wants to get away from naturalistic writing, I understand. I also understand the urge to compare him to Vonnegut. In many of Vonnegut's works we see the same approach to writing as in this work by Saunders. Take reality and alter it a bit. This allows the writer to throw a light on something that he wants to expose or explore. Vonnegut does not get enough credit for the elegance and beauty of his prose because it is so simple and easy to digest. In my opinion, Saunders in this analogy is roughage that passes through."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"Remember the classic Brando line from On The Waterfront? ~~~~~I coulda been a contender~~~~~~~ George Saunders' CivilWarLand in Bad Decline brought those words to mind partially, but from a dramatically different source. Saunders' characters are all low-level functionaries with brilliant descriptive powers. Nearly a century ago, there was a low-level German official named Franz Kafka and if he were to read this book, he would say ~~~~~If I had had a sense of humor, I coulda been George Saunders~~~~~ CivilWarLand is a hilarious and lush tapestry of absurdist misery. The 21st century, where no one is enslaved by chains but all are wired together by the internet is in good hands with the likes of George Saunders. If you can't get this book tomorrow then buy it today!!"},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"That's a little reductive, I know, but that's what I kept thinking while reading this great collection. Sometimes it's something akin to sci-fi, sometimes it's more like magic realism, but the stuff that goes on in these stories is always a refreshing departure from the norm of contemporary fiction. Lovers of Pynchon and David Foster Wallace should eat this up, but in some ways I felt, especially in this collection, that Saunders has more in common with Samuel Beckett. But here Sauders comments on the endurance of the human condition with civil war-era ghosts, morbidly obese office drones, post-apocalyptic mutants. I used to think this kind of subject matter would always be relegated to &quot;guilty pleasures&quot; status, but Saunders treats it with an intelligence absent in pulpier fare."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"Very few writers can succeed in being compassionate without being sentimental, hilarious without losing any emotional impact. Although Saunders overuses certain comic effects and can occasionally settle for simple cleverness, the best of these stories (The 400-Pound CEO, especially) are up there with the best tragicomedy ever written, with Beckett and Elkin. And they can actually succeed - outmoded as the idea of moral fiction is -in making you a little more humane."},{"Title":"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline","review":"Important writer, this guy Saunders.

This book is a treasure for those of us who have already been instructed in tummo practice by a genuine living teacher.It seems important for us to note that these talks from a practice seminar given by Lama Thubten Yeshe were made available to the general public only by his students and only after his death. I don't believe that Lama Thubten Yeshe would have encouraged anyone to dive into these practices after just reading a book, without preparation, transmission, and direct practice instructions from an authentic teacher.My living Tibetan teacher of these practices, and all of the other excellent Tibetan teachers I have known, would never make written tummo instructions available to the public. We students of these living teachers are required to finish several extensive courses of vajrayana practice and receive formal transmission in a personal teaching situation before we are considered ready to make proper use of these profound instructions that help us to realize the inseparability of bliss and emptiness. We are told that it is essential to always approach the practice with the motives of awakening and benefit for other sentient beings. We are warned that mistakes in applying tummo practice instructions can cause mental and physical harm. I do know of people who have hurt themselves.So, please connect with a genuine teacher, fulfill prerequisites, get personal guidance and follow-up help in tummo practice, and then use this book as a precious resource to deepen your practice."},{"Title":"The Bliss of Inner Fire: Heart Practice of the Six Yogas of Naropa","review":"Covers the same material as another wonderful book - The Clear Light Of Bliss. That book is more text-like. This book is more chatty and less organized, it seems to me. But there a lot of hidden jewels in the chattiness.

But unlike some other religions that just ask that you believe fairy-tales, it also has a rich kernel of profound truth and practice that makes books like this absolutely priceless."},{"Title":"The Bliss of Inner Fire: Heart Practice of the Six Yogas of Naropa","review":"I have completed two retreats practicing Tummo. Lama Yeshe's book is excellent and of first rate quality. What he describes is true and can be experienced by those who wish to work. I do not practice with Lama Yeshe's tradition, but for those who want to understand the depths of Tummo...I totally recommend it. For those who do not wish to do the work of the practice, I'd suggest they not read it. It is a topic that cannot be accomplished by intellect alone. But for those of you who will do the work, then when the Fire blazes and the Kundalini flows...you will know and I know that this man has correctly described the events that unfold."},{"Title":"The Bliss of Inner Fire: Heart Practice of the Six Yogas of Naropa","review":"This is a fine tantric manual with detailed information on the tummopractice.

Glen Mullin's translation of Tsonghapa's major treatise on this subject is one of the few other sources in English for this material, but is far less accessible to novice readers than Lama Yeshe's account. Given the reticence of most native Tibetan sources about presenting this material, I'm very grateful for this book, which has been both inspiring to me, as well as technically informative, and presents a unique entree into this very important material."},{"Title":"The Bliss of Inner Fire: Heart Practice of the Six Yogas of Naropa","review":"I do not like it when the book you are reading tells you \\"I will not go into this because I have explained it elsewhere.\\" It seems impossible to get a good understanding of tummo (the inner fire) without reading Lama Yeshe's other books. The reader is redirected to other places to learn about the most essential information like specific mantras to complete the practices mentioned. We have lots of philosophical \\"good stuff\\" in this book, but when it comes to practice, oops! you need a flesh and blood guru, or better, another book by the same publications."},{"Title":"The Bliss of Inner Fire: Heart Practice of the Six Yogas of Naropa","review":"This book is thought-provoking; yet, it's very aim is to move beyond thought.I'm trying the techniques gently with mixed success. It appears they work best for me after yoga when the body and mind are naturally more in tune.It is not well-written - but it is very well intended. The translation is not perfect - but the book is quite understandable in terms of the suggested practices.If you prefer chakra energy exercises, this might provide useful insight for you. Don't expect miracles, it takes practice!The fruits of the practice arrive when you least expect them. I think it opens you up to awareness of bliss and you more readily accept it into your life.

Author goes over each piece of equipment so by the end of the dvd, you've been introduced to a very large selection of grip stuff and know how it's used.The book then goes more in depth and more about how to act and how to get along with the others around you. Very Very valuable stuff here even if you're just dabbling in the business.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Grip Book, Third Edition","review":"It is what the title says.

In addition to expertly covering the grip business, Mr. Uva strongly advocates working hard, working safe, and being honest. His own personal success indicates that he practices what he preaches. The grip book covers not just what the equipment is and how it works, but how the grip should work and interact with other professionals on the set, (even the ones with which the grip might rather not interact). Much of the advice given in this book could be just as easily applied to any area of life where a person wants to be successful and respected when working with others. I haven't read a better book on this subject. It's required reading for anyone who grips for us unless they went to one of the better film schools, in which case it's not required, just recommended."},{"Title":"The Grip Book, Third Edition","review":"A wealth of information.

I don't understand why this book has high ratings. It doesn't actually show you or teach you how to use the equipment! It just list the name, has a drawing of it (why not a picture), and a very brief description of what it does. It will not teach how to use anything on set. I can't believe it doesn't even discuss color temperature in detail, it doesn't even tell what it means. It's just too brief and doesn't explain how anything works, how it works, or why it works. The \\"TOT\\" sections spread throughout aren't enough to do much good at this. If you buy this you will find that the last half of the book is just specifications on dolly parts and some camera mounts. It's just a filler that is 95% useless. If you turn a C-stand upside down and open it on set like Michael Uva does you will look like a total amateur and the key grip will notice. This book is worth no more than $10. It could have been so much better by showing and teaching how to use the equipment on set like it is really used and explaining in detail how and why it is done that way. Bottom line: If you are new to the grip world aka. \\"the dark side\\" you will get next to nothing out of this.

What the great thing about this book, that its being told by a man Mike Uva who tells you ever step of the way who to become a film grip. He also was a film grip as well. About the most important thing about is safety is always first when on a film set. I should know I'm kinda close to a film grip, Im a Stagehand who works at Play Theather in Southern Califorina. But over all, theres a lot learn from this book, and the coolest thing about it. It even comes with a dvd, to show you how grip equipment works and how it is used on a film set.

I'm convinced it has helped save me hundreds of dollars on each car I've bought.The Consumer Digest guide includes important information that you won't find in the Consumer Reports or Edmunds guides. First, it includes the REAL dealer invoice price, as well as the MSRP, for the car and for each individual option. (The \\"real\\" invoice is lower than the so-called invoice price that the dealer will show you, since the dealer's invoice does not subtract the hold-backs). That information is a key tool that I've repeatedly used successfully in negotiations. Also, Consumer Digest more systematically and comprehensively lists the specs and features included in all of the various trim lines of each make and model (e.g., in the 'DX', 'LX', and 'EX' lines of the Accord model), and the options that can be added to each, facilitating the buyer's comparison of the various makes and models before having to visit a lot of showrooms. This saves much time and gives the buyer a better-informed and stronger negotiating position.Unfortunately, I cannot find the Consumer Digest new car guide for 2006 (or 2007). If Consumer Digest has stopped publishing this valuable book, that is really sad. I wonder if manufacturers are no longer cooperating in providing car specs and invoice data because too many dealers have complained about buyers using this book during negotiations.It should be noted that Consumer Guide published up to three variations of this guide for new cars each year. All three contain the key information on new car specs and true dealer invoice prices, but the buyer should be alert to which variation is being advertised. The best variation, in my view, is \\"Consumer Guide: 2004 Cars\\" (560 pages), which includes text for each make and model describing changes in that model from the prior year, plus-and-minus points for each car, etc. This is NOT the variation presented in this listing; it's listed separately in another Amazon posting. The second variation is \\"Consumer Guide: 2004 New Car Price Guide\\" (352 pages), which deletes that text; that IS the version presented in this posting. The third variation is \\"Consumer Guide: 200X Automobile Book\\" (about 225 pages), an 8- by 11-inch book on higher-quality paper, which adds an evaluation of each car and additional front matter (but is more expensive); this variation was not published in 2004. Each variation has a different cover design."},{"Title":"The Greatest Hunting Stories Ever Told: Twenty-Nine Unforgettable Tales","review":"The book was not what I expected.

The only downside to them is that Mrs. Lee (her late husband, Irven Lee, was a faithful gospel preacher for many years) did not produce stories about other Old Testament or New Testament characters and events. The Stories About God's First People cover only the book of Genesis, and the Stories About Jesus are limited to the life of Christ, with 52 stories in each book (one for each week of the year). There are questions to go with each story and plain but good illustrations by Mrs. Bennie Lee (Sybil) Fudge and Celia Swafford.

Secondary characters with depth are hard to do without stealing the show at times,but Sherri has always had an amazing talent for that,and this time was just outstanding.I especially loved the way she blended Atlantis with the Dream-Hunters,Persephone and Hades,etc.She makes it flow just beautifully,and you will be laughing along the way.Sherrilyn Kenyon is an amazing storyteller,and this latest installment just proves it all over again.Long live The Kenyon!!!!THANK YOU SHERRI!!!"},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"Zeus cursed the Oneroi to drift through the dreams of humans for eternity. Arik is one of these Dream Gods, a demon who coldly preys on those who are sleeping as this is the only time he can feel emotions. Millenniums have past, but for Arik diverging through humanity's nocturnal fantasies have become tedious with no end in sight until now. He has found a fascinating target, Dr. Megeara Kafieri.She dreams of proving to her disgraced late father is right that Atlantis was real as she made him a deathbed promise to restore what his quest wrought the family name. Thus she is in Greece with plans to prove Plato's island is right where her dad said it is, but her quest seems doomed to failure as every possible misfortune occurs as if the Gods want to prevent her success. Megeara is shocked when she fishes out of the sea the man who has haunted her dreams seemingly forever as she assumed he was a figment of her imagination. Unbeknownst to Megeara, as she falls in love with Arik, he has cut a deal with Hades to allow him two weeks as a human in exchange for her soul. As she realizes he is a legendary Oneroi, he knows he must kill her since humans are prohibited from knowing about his \\"species\\", but his problem is that two weeks as a human is enough time to fall in love with the mortal, an even bigger taboo.A sidebar series to the Dark-Hunter tales, the first Oneroi romantic fantasy is a fabulous tale that showcases the complex Kenyon universe. The story line is action-packed, but owned by the forbidden relationship between the Dream God and his victim. THE DREAM HUNTER can stand alone as a superb thriller, but also provides tantalizing clues to the larger pantheon so this delightful saga of forbidden love is must reading for fans of the Dark Hunter tales.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"There are so many bad reveiws.

There are so many characters and errant storylines that it's hard to figure out who is who. I appreciate the author's knowledge and use of Greek mythology, but I would have liked this book a good deal more with a brief synoposis of what has gone before and who all these gods are, what powers they hold, and what their alliances are.That said, some of the writing is good, and I suspect those completely familiar with the previous books will enjoy it a good deal more than I did.

This book doesn't have meat to it. The story begins when the hero is in love already but he's selfish, weak and pretty dumb. Kenyon then starts to tell you about how they got to where they are, so you have to back track through all of the past before you get anywhere.Also what is it about all of these characters and everyone having so much freaking power???I really hope for a good DH book again, please, let's just get back to what made us love you Kenyon!"},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"Well I must say I agree with most folks here.

Still, I almost wish that Miss Kenyon had the time to develop his emotional growth in greater depth. I found the transition from what he did at the beginning to his nobility at the end a little too pat and hard to believe. There were a few obligatory scenes where he 'experienced' things for the first time but they seemed to me contrived.I have to admit I almost put it down a few chapters before the end, but I plodded on. There are a few moments in the book that made me laugh. And the action scene where the Dolophoni appeared was exciting. I also loved the depiction of Persephone and Hades; theirs has always been one of my favorite stories in the Greek mythology.I have to say that I actually liked Solin better than I did Arikos. I hope his story will be developed later, if not as a main character then maybe as a side story."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"Once again disappointed but I sorta knew that I would be. While reading this, I felt that Sherrilyn was too hung up on getting herself and the fans ready for Ash's book that she took a potential good story away from this story as well as the last one. She spent too much time on other characters as well as adding scenes that really has nothing to do with this particular story. It wasn't well written and if you actually remember the storyline of the other books, there's alot of stuff that does not add up. The transition was not smooth at all.

The sex encounters were fairly well done and one wonders where she gathered the material for those. The plot development was poor at best.I'm happy to have this behind me. It was a struggle to slog through it."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I so adore the ever-expanding Dark-Hunter world!The Dream-Hunter features a god, cursed to only experience feeling through other people's dreams. When he meets Megeara Kafieri, he needs more than her dreams. Literally striking a bargain with the devil, Hades, he becomes human. Only when he has feelings of his own, does he discover what a horrible deal he made.Geary and Arik's story was a gripping tale that kept me flipping the pages!"},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"Ok, this book isn't rocket science or a classical Greek textbook, but it is not nearly as bad as some of the reviews indicate. Dream Hunter is a quick read and has an adorable hero and a pretty decent heroine. It's just a fun fantasy read that introduces more characters into the mythology kingdom that SK has created. I agree that there may be too many new species and that part does get confusing. I'm sure that this story has revealed more background for Ash's book next year. This is not one of the best in the series, but look at it as a bridge to better things and I still found it enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I had to skim this book after reading the prologue, which just sucked all the pleasure I had with my life out of my soul. The heroine is a typical nerd/hot girl with daddy issues who meets the unbelievably sexy but SUPER \\"bad\\" hero who isn't so bad after all. They go through exchanges of we can't be together but let's shag anyway, insane bouts of misunderstandings, and endless amounts of self torture and self pity.That's the whole book, I swear. I got this from just looking at a couple of pages and now I wonder where that hour went. And the only thing you have to do since the book doesn't let you think for yourself is to figure out which girl our homeboy Acheron, leader of the Dark-Hunters from Ms. Kenyon's other series, is going to end up with. Will it be the nerdy yet innocent Tory, or the beautiful yet childish Thia?Seriously, borrow this one from the library. The money you save can buy a better book."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I read the Dark Hunter series voraciously for years, until I got caught up in other author series. I decided to catch back up to the new releases and, sadly, this is where I had to start. Frankly, if this were the first book I had read in this series I wouldn't continue. I struggled to finish it because I kept putting it down; it is lacking the magic of Kenyon's other books in the series. I just did not care about these characters, and they were too far removed from other familiar faces in the Dark Hunter universe. The Dark Hunters and Were Hunters are dynamic, complex and interesting creations. Oneroi who exist without emotion, and try to siphon it through humans like a drug when they go bad as Skoti, just didn't click for me. Arikos was one-dimensional, and boring. His heroine Geary was interesting, but needed more fleshing out. And, outside of dreams (dream sex isn't as good), I just didn't see their relationship evolve into being a couple.Despite these issues, I gave the book 3 stars for a couple reasons. First, Kenyon's mythology is rich and detailed. I love getting more information about her world-building - especially the gods and their relationships. It was really cool to find out Hades is totally hot and Persephone loves him. Also, the horror and unjust punishment of the Oneroi is interesting, just not as a basis for romance. Plus, Acheron made a cameo, which is always good. Second, the ending was actually exciting when Geary has to go to the Underworld to win Arikos back. Overall, it was okay but just not up to the high standards of the novels that came before it. If it hadn't been so hyped that we meet Ash's heroine in this book, I probably would've skipped it."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"All of the Dark Hunter books are so good that you will want to read them again this is one of the more recent and it gives you and idea of how she is going to keep the series going it is top notch.

I have never cared overly much for M'doc and the rest. I understand there purpose in the DH world, but the fact that they lack emotion was always a pretty big turn off for me.Arikos was great--I loved the way Sherri developed him and the way he interacted with Megeara. I loved the whole on a ship looking for the Lost world of Atlantis theme...and the introduction of new charaters such as ZT made it very interesting.And I don't care what anybody says--Apollomi is just as nasty as Artie is--maybe even more so because she knows love--poor Artie has never know it...But draw on this novel was that Ash's HEA is suppose to be in it somewhere...but I unfortunately didn't find any of the females with the exception of Katra and Megeara challenging or fun. His HEA is Katra--and it sure can't be Megeara.....I have a feeling it will be Thia or Tory--but Thia needs to get over her whiny self--and Tory needs to get her nose out of a book and live a little...."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"After putting \\"Sins of the Night\\" into my recycle bin after reading the first two pages, I swore off Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter books as being terribly written and horribly convoluted in plot. I did okay, really, until I fell for a pretty face- that wonderful guy with the magic eyes on the cover of The Dream Hunter-- and I thought, 'a new character, a new plot line... maybe Ms. Kenyon will have a rennaissance.\\" So, fool that I am, I bought the book. 10 days later, I am still slogging through it- could it be that I have to read back constantly to figure out the numerous gods and demi-gods-from different pantheons, mind you- running around the story? Or could it be the card-board main characters- I keep lifting them up to see if there is anything more than two dimensions! Sorry, this one cured me for sure. I won't be back unless Ms. Kenyon has a guardian goddess who can 'plunk her magic twanger' and make Ms. Kenyon's writing improve a great deal."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I must confess some surprise to the hostility generated by this book. While not the very best of the darkhunter books it was still good. And I got to say I was not real excited starting this one. A book about a dreamhunter did not really appeal to me and I was a little disapointed that we were wasting time away from Ash and the rest. But even with a bad attitude at the start I was still satisfied when I finished this one.And on another note. People keep complaining that these book are becoming to complicated with two many character to keep straight. Personaly I love it. I have had no problem with the reapearance of many beloved characters (I'd do anything to have a good Zarek reappearance) and you can feel a certain tension building with Ash as more and more it becomes harder to hide what he really is. It feels like things are just a little closer to blowing open with every new book.I think people are starting to become dissatisfied with this series because they are true blue romance readers. They want it light uncomplicated and full of passion. Myself I don't like romance. I like good novels written by authors that drag you into not just the characters lives but into their world. Ms. Kenyon has the rare gift to be able to just that."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"Great Book kept me interested thru the whole book!I love this series, I get nothing done at home causeall I want to do is read and find out what happens!"},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I loved it.

I can't get enough. She's a great writer. Dream-Hunter is a great series."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"(This story takes place before Night Pleasures. Nick is still a teenager; one of dream-hunters has been dispatched to Zarek in Alaska.)I've read all the dark-hunter books, and I've noticed that they've become progressively more frantic/less romantic. This story jogged along at a hectic pace. The heroine/hero only had 2 weeks. Fine. There were a couple of scenes of frantic sex with no romantic build-up. At that point, I asked myself, why should I care about these people having one-night stand-style sex. I didn't feel the love.\\"Geary\\" had a really interesting family, but their heritage was steeped in so much innuendo that never played out, it became very frustrating whenever another coincidental connection to ancient Atlantis/Greece came up. They never went anywhere with it! That was so frustrating!On the bright side, charming secondary characters. Lots of interesting back story. On the dark side, there was so much back story and piecing together of who's who and what's what that it felt like I was reading a dissertation instead of a romance novel. This book should have stayed at the editor's for a bit longer.The series has drifted too far from the original premise and needs to wade back."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"Generally speaking, I like the Dark-Hunter series and all of the recent variations with the Were-Hunters. I also like the fact that Ms. Kenyon makes efforts to broaden the Dark-Hunter universe.Unfortunately, I think The Dream-Hunter isn't nearly as successful as her previous efforts. It just seems like she's stretching a little too hard; the whole story just seems a little forced.Regardless, The Dream-Hunter isn't a waste of time and I'm glad that I have it in my collection. I just hope that the next book returns to the level of the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I am a huge Dark-Hunter fan so I looked forward to this book starting a Dream-Hunter series. I was very disappointed. The story was dry, and boring. It seemed the bacground on Geary (the love interest) went on for chapters; while the background on Arik (the first Dream Hunter to have a book!), got very little. I had a hard time reading the first few chapters because it seemed like it we were never going to get past Geary and her issues with losing all her family (ad nauseum)! There was no spark or attraction between the main characters Arik and Geary. And only a cursory love-making scene (if you could call it that). No spark at all! Quite frankly as I was reading the story I really couldn't see or feel any passion, longing and love for each other. I actually did not like Geary and could not figure out what Arikos saw in her! I liked the secondary characters better. The palpable hate between Solin, and Arikos and finally the introduction of Arikos other half-brothers M'Adoc, and M'Ordant. I was actually relieved when Acheron made an appearance! There needs to be some emotion between the main characters and frankly I found this was sadly lacking. I automatically buy S.Kenyon's D-H books because I absolutely love them! I am not sure if these Dream Hunter books will measure up. I also couldn't figure out the reference to Zarek in Alaska and Kyrian in New Orleans. Weren't these stories wrapped up?! For the first time EVER in reading S.Kenyon's books - I skimmed to the last chapter! :("},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I really don't agree with most reviews. I really loved this book, it's another masterpiece from Kenyon! I new road has been entered and I really don't want to go back. Maybe a lot of the readers missed Ash or the Dark hunters. But how many books, does she has to write about them? It would only be boring. Now she keeps it fresh and exciting!I really loved the storyline of this book. Strange as it sounds, this book is not carried by the main characters. You could say that all the other characters in this book, really made the story and made me craving for more....!!!! Because of all the characters and all the storylines within this story, Kenyon didn't really gave the two main characters depth, which by the way, I didn't miss. The erotic scenes in this book, were very steamy, although the romance was less present. Ofcourse I have missed Ash, but ZT made it all worth while! Maybe some readers missed the romance and weren't ready for so many changes and so much new information, but I was! I loved it!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"Wow, what a disappointment. I was not really thrilled with the last Dark Hunter book, and was hoping this one would get back in the swing of things. So far I've had the book a week, and still have not been able to get through the whole thing. I'm almost done though, so maybe the last few pages will get better.I think SK has fallen into the pattern that a lot of series seem to fall into. After a few books, a major, tragic hero emerges from the secondary characters, and everyone wants to read his story. But once that book is done, the series is over, so the author stretches things out to keep us buying, dropping little hints of his story to tantalize the readers. Unfortunately, in the quest for Acheron's story, SK seems to have run out of good material in the meantime."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I wrote a review for the last Dark Hunter book that Sherrilyn Kenyon published, and unfortunately it wasn't good. I've loved this series from the beginning. It is the only series romance that I am an avid fan of. I understand that it's a money making machine and therefore who can blame ANYONE for having spinoffs that would continue a story and make more money? I think it's pretty smart myself.However...spinoffs to make money, only to kill the magic that has been built already is stupidity.Sherrilyn Kenyon has a lot of followers. Just check out her website to see how many people would worship her just for writing \\"The dog ran up the hill.\\" That's fine. That's great for her. I just hope that those who worship will be honest enough to admit that this series has DEFINITELY dried up and is heading nowhere fast.What was the point of this book? I mean honestly? You have a man who can feel no feelings, yet he yearns for a woman he can't have. Aren't those feelings? I shook my head from chapter ONE about how he can feel nothing, but he wishes that he could so he could have her or touch her or feel her. Wishing for that, yearning for that, needing that, aren't those feelings? Confusion number one of many. This book was mainly a 200+ page vessel used to make even more money for her publisher and herself. So Ash's heroine is introduced. Blah blah. Do you know who she is? No more than I did before I picked up the book. I'm getting to the point where I just don't care anymore.I want the magic back that was there for the first 5 books of the series. I want the intrigue, the hot men, the tormented men, and the storylines that made me wish the book would never end. What I'm getting instead are \\"teaser trailers\\" (At 7 bucks a pop) for the never coming Ash book. Sherrilyn, do us all a favor, wrap it up and get the story out already. We aren't Dark Hunters. We don't live forever. Most of us will be dead of old age before this \\"story\\" gets finished. You keep saying that there's so much to it and that it will take a lot of books to get every aspect out. I think a lot of your readers are ready for the Cliff Notes version. We've been dragged along too long.I will give this next Dark Hunter book a try. After that, if it's not better, I'm done. I was a reader from the beginning, a reader who hoped to be there at the end, but I do believe I'm about to write my own ending. It's the one where no more money or time are being spent on mediocre money making machines for the author and publisher.Oh well!"},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"Let me start out by saying if you're not a big fan of mythology then Sherrilyn Kenyon is not the author for you. That being said, I love mythology and Greek mythology in particular and am a big fan of all her books. Kenyon is not afraid to embrace the wonderful intricacies of Greek mythology and yet still leave her own unique stamp on the world she has created. Her gods seem more like real people than remote beings. This book is the first to flesh out the Dream Hunters who have been mentioned in passing in other books (see the Dark Hunter novels). This book gives them their own spotlight. The action focuses on Arikos, a former Oneroi (good guy Dream Hunter) who has turned Skoti (could be bad Dream Hunter some are, but Arik is more selfish than bad) and now feeds off the emotions of humans in their dreams. He has become obsessed with a mortal woman and makes a deal with Hades to become mortal and experience life as a human male. Did I mention that none of the Dream Hunters have emotions? This book does a good job of portraying Arik's confusion with emotions and also gives a lot of background on the Dream Hunters in particular, especially those characters that have cropped up in the Dark Hunter books in the past D'Alerian, M'Adoc, and M'Ordant. (Actually as is the case in a lot of Kenyon's books these characters are so fascinating that you want a book on them to get to the bottom of their unique histories!) The romance is this book definitely took a back seat to developing the plot. The love scenes and the romance is very well written, and I personally like my romances to have an engaging plot and storyline. If you're looking for non-stop steamy sex though, the entire series probably isn't going to be your cup of tea. This book is great in that it sets up and clarifies some mysteries from the Dark Hunter series. I don't recommend it as a stand alone book, to really appreciate it and to know what is going on at several points you really need to have read the Dark Hunter sereis. In the timeline of the universe this book takes place before any of the Dark Hunter books. I would say roughly a few years before the events in Night Pleasures. As usual, I love Sherrilyn Kenyon and would recommend any of her books without hesitation."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I've come late to this game, having just discovered Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter series in 2011, BUT I have become a rabid fan. I think I've read a dozen of her books in the last couple months, and I have yet to be let down.Perhaps I enjoyed Dream Hunter more than others because I love plot and character development as well as romance, and SK gave us a ton of new stuff to chew on in this book. We get a great look at the Oneroi and Skoti, learn why Atlantis cannot be found by those in modern society, and get an introduction to more residents of Olympus (and the Underworld). Plus there's still lots of action and her trademark wit. I laughed out loud more than once while reading conversations between all the characters in this book. And I was so excited to meet 15-year-old Tory whom I know years later becomes Acheron's love interest (no secret there, really). Her charmingly nerdy personality had me immediately looking forward to reading her interactions with Ash when I get to that sizable book in this series.Sure you can read Dream Hunter as a stand alone novel, but I think at this point in the series, it's best to have read all the prior books to fully enjoy the story. But what a series to sink your fangs into! (Pun intended.) Happy reading. :-)"},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I hated this book.

Sherrilyn is often funny and clever, but the humor in this book was not funny and not clever, but just plain ol' juvenile.The interactions between several of the characters are too contrived to be interesting.

I absolutely loved it!"},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I was really worried about starting this book. I was terribly disappointed by Kenyon's last full length Dark-Hunter novel and I've been worried about the series for a while. While The Dream-Hunter isn't one of my favorites it is an alright book.Arik's character is pretty unique. It's not every book where the reader can call the male lead \\"adorable\\" but this was one of those times. Arik could be really cute sometimes. It was his lack of emotions in the beginning that left readers a little uncertain of him but once he gained those feelings and started to express them you couldn't help but to love him.Megeara is just a little too much like other female leads for my taste but her character is likable nonetheless. There was one moment when I had to roll my eyes when she saved a certain someone from drowning and the author felt compelled to mention that Megeara \\"just happened\\" to be a certified lifeguard. And even though she has a Ph.D. she was kinda clueless on some things. But do I like how Kenyon tries to help the reader relate to the characters. Megeara and Arik were a cute couple.Readers also learn so much more about the Dream-Hunter world. I was surprised at how M'Adoc's character developed and I hope to read more about Solin. His character definitely perked my interest and his story sounds like it's going to be so sad.I was somewhat disappointed with the anticlimactic ending but this book wasn't really all that bad. It had action, drama, some angst. I wouldn't suggest this one if it's your first Dark-Hunter book but it's worth the read to kill some time."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"Arikos is a Skotos, an immortal, emotionless traveler of human dreams. Despite strict laws, he has become addicted to one human in particular. Desperate to meet her in person, Arikos has made a deal with Hades: a soul for a temporary body. As he is assailed by emotions in the human realm, he begins to realize the heinous nature of his agreement.Megeara Kafieri is searching for a legend. Her father died obsessed with locating Atlantis. Geary has picked up the hunt, and she faces down one obstacle after another, all the while trying to keep funded. When her mysterious dream lover is pulled from the sea to appear in the flesh, she's sure she's finally lost it. But her adventure is just beginning.With each new Dark-Hunter book, Sherrilyn Kenyon draws readers deeper into a fascinating paranormal world. In THE DREAM-HUNTER, the search for Atlantis sparks increased tensions among the gods even as passion flares between Arikos and Geary. While these two are not among her best characters, they are interesting, wonderfully flawed, and not afraid to go after what they want.The plot is decent, with readers learning more about the DH world. On its own, however, this book falls a bit short of Kenyon's usual standard. Some of the choices the characters make will stretch the believability factor, and a series of events toward the end make the conclusion too convenient. That said, however, it was still difficult to put this one down.As an admitted Dark-Hunter fan, I recommend this to Kenyon's readers for its fresh perspective of a never-stale series.Reviewed by Christina Wantz Fixemer01/11/2007"},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"omg.

Even though this was a direct purchase through Amazon, the same $.50 difference applies."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"The Dream Hunter was a book that I got completely sucked into by page one. It takes the Dark Hunter series in a different direction, and shines the spotlight on yet another group of gods in the pantheon of Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter universe. I loved how SK integrated the dream world into this book. Dreams are so complex and so fantastical, how could they not be an excellent backdrop for an epic war between good and evil? SK gets that the Greek myths have characters that are not always completely good or evil, that the gods' motivations are often selfish and petty. We see that Arikos is not a bad guy. He's merely a person who has tired of being abused as used as a pawn by the higher gods. He wants happiness and joy just like all us humans want. The closest he has come is through the dreams of the human Megeara. When he is denied the closeness he craves with her through the dreams, he desperately makes a deal with Hades to be human for two weeks to spend time with this human he has become so captivated with. Unfortunately the deal involves giving her up to Hades after the two weeks ends. However, those of us who have studied the myths know that the gods don't make fair deals. Arik says yes before he realizes what the caveat is.The Dream Hunter introduces new intriguing characters and allows us to reconnect with some old favorites. The time line is about 10 years in the past, which is interesting, as we get to see the time before some pretty big events unfold.I love this world, and even if there's not much going on, I'd read SK's books just to experience her incredible imagination, and her fantastic writing ability. However, this book does have a lot going on, passion, pathos, vengeance, adventure, fun, and excitement. Also for those of you like me who has a thing for Atlantis, there is a quest to find the lost city that many don't want found, as well. You don't want to put it down because you want to know what happens next. I loved the direction that SK went with this book because it gives me some in depth on some of the Greek myths that always intrigued me. She brings these gods and heroes of the myths to life for me, but also adds her own unique spin that makes me laugh at some times, and cry at others.This is not a Dark Hunter book in the traditional sense, but it is definitely a great addition to the mythos, and if you are a fan of SK's books, I have trouble believing you won't love this book as well.

Like an abusive relationship, she keeps disappointing me, but I can't help but remember the good times and so I think that maybe, just maybe, this might be the time that things change. This might be the book that proves that she really does know how to right great romance and that it doesn't all have to be lost in subplots and mythology. Well, the Dream Hunter proves that she doesn't care about me and she probably never did. If she had, she might not take all my money for these lukewarm spinoff series featuring heroes with no gumption and heroines who whine like it's their job. Sherrilyn Kenyon has lost her edge with her recent novels, and I for one am done with this abusive relationship. From now on, I'm moving on to writers who at least make an effort not to continually disappoint me."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I enjoyed reading this off-shoot of the Dark Hunter series.

It tells the story of Arik, a Dream-Hunter who becomes enchanted with Geary, a woman whose dreams he has inhabited for a few months. Dream-Hunters have no emotions of their own, so Arik makes a deal with the god Hades to become human for two weeks to enjoy a human relationship with Geary. Of course he is overwhelmed by all the emotions he feels as a human and falls in love with Geary.No spoilers here, because a lot happens on their road to happiness. But I will say I had heard this series isn't as good as the \\"Dark-Hunter\\" series. However, I enjoyed this first one immensely. It started out rather strange, but soon I was laughing like crazy over the dialogue between Arik and Solin (another Dream-Hunter). Characters like Ash, Kat, and Artemis appeared, and this became a novel I ended up enjoying just as much as the Dark-Hunter novels. Definitely, a fun read."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I have read MANY of Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter books. The first few really captured my attention. Not so much with the Were Hunters and especially not this first Dream Hunter for me. I just cannot get into it at all.

I'll stick with the Black Dagger Brotherhood instead."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I am just not a Dream-Hunter fan.

After centuries of searching he finally found a woman whose dreams are so vivid he could feel her emotions as his own. He comes to her in her dreams over and over till it becomes an obsession. After being told that he has spent too much type on one human and that he must leave her and move on. He finds he can't and the strangest part for him is the fact he wants more than just what he can have in his Dreams. He wants to be part of her life feel her as a human man would. So In order to become human he must make a deal with a god and no god in Olympus would dare help him so the only one who he could ask to help is Hades. As with any deal with a god there is a steep price to be paid , And the price Hades is asking is the soul of the one person In This world he covets more than anything else.Dr. Megeara kafieri has watch most of her family searched for Atlantis and many died for the search. Her father died a laughing stock the world never believed his findings. On his death bed Mageara promised she would not let his research go to waste and would continue on he's quest to find the lost city. This promise was given half heartedly with no intentions of following though. Till she received a few items that he father left for her. They were irrefutable proof that the city was real and obtainable. Through her own need to proof her father right and the guilt of not believing him herself she set out to uncover his secrete city.Arik fell into the voyage with Geary quite latterly. After his deal with Hades he found himself drowning Geary jumping in to save him. Now he must help Geary on her quest to uncover Atlantis to gain her trust. But the gods have other plans they refuse to allow Atlantis be found and Apollymi inadvertently released causing an apocalypse.Arik is a bit stiff and how nave he is of the real world is hilarious. He has a cute little boy charm and he finds more than what he thought he would in the real world. Geary is very driven a bit of a prude you know she wants Arik but she will not let down those guards wail she is awake. But my favorite is Solin he is soo funny. He sarcastic and he bring out a fun teasing personality in Arik. He tries to pretend that he doesn't care about anyone but himself but you can tell underneath it all he has a heart of gold. I hope to see more of him in the future. This was not my favorite book in the series but I must say even the slower books that are not my top favs they are still some of the better books I've read. There is not one book in this series I did not like."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I have read many of Kenyon's books and I have not yet been disappointed.

Usually I finish one of Sherilynn's books in about two days. It took me three weeks to finish it. Unlike her other books, i found this book easy to put down, not really caring about what happened. The history of Arik was not really that interesting, and the backstory was a little hard to follow. It did redeem itself in the the end with familiar characters, which was a little bittersweet.I would reccomend this book if you are a hardcore SK fan, but if you're just getting into the series, skip it for now."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"As a Huge SK fan, I was hoping that this book would regain my enthusiasm for her books but I was disappointed again. I don't know what is going on with SK. The last three books have just fell flat for me. It seems as though someone else has started writing for her and just can't seem to get it right. The characters in Dream Hunter were boring and lacked the depth that we as SK fans have come to expect. This book was just OK for me, nothing more. It took me five days to finish it when I usually read one of her books in a day, two at the most.I so desperatly miss characters like Zarek, Vane and Kyrian and if Kat is going to be Ash's heroine in a future book, she is going to need some serious character development because I just don't like her. She doesn't seem worthy of Ash.For anyone looking for some HOT, SEXY vampires, try J. R. Ward's Black Dagger Brotherhood series. (And I do mean HOTTTT!!!)

I got through almost half of it, and that took forever. I was beginning to think they used chloroform for ink. Only one character was mildly interesting, (the teenage girl, Tori??). The hero and heroine were totally forgettable, the plot was phoned in and oh yeah, it all takes place a few years ago. Can you say SUSPENSE KILLER?IMHO, ever since Sins of the Night, there hasn't been much of anything fresh in the DH world. Even when she killed off a beloved character, he turned into such a jerk, I could care less what happens to him, and kind of wish he would have stayed dead. SK just keeps rehashing the same old stuff. I wanted to stick with this series until Ash's books come out.

I couldn't connect with the heroes and I felt no love between them. I really didn't like the time limit, and the way he went about winning her. She was so reluctant at first, but once she found out he only had two weeks as a human she suddenly decided she liked and wanted him. I had problems with the hero's initial bargain. OK, I know he wasn't supposed to feel, but to trade the heroine's life for two weeks as a human? I don't know... Then, the love just didn't develop. First it wasn't there, then it was there.

But I'm still looking forward to reading more of her work."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I enjoy Sherrilyn Kenyon but sometimes her story line zigs when it should zag. The Dream Warrior series I like because when they are referred to in the Dark Hunter series, I was curious to know what there stories were. They are entertainment. No one has to write a dissertation on why they don't like them because that could be the very reason someone else DOES like them and won't recommend them out of fear of sounding stupid. The only complaint I have is the same as one other reader. There is so much going on in her latest books that I start getting really tired and have to put the book down. She needs to keep her characters memorable."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"This book didn't do it for me. I love Kenyon's Dark Hunter series as a whole, but this, the first book in the Dream Hunter series was boring. I didn't care for the hero and the heroine was annoying. The premise was truly intersting, but the execution just didn't work for me. Pity, really."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I had a couple of problems with this novel, a spinoff from Kenyon's popular Dark Hunter series.First, it is set before the first Dark Hunter novel. On one hand, I can see why she did this - basically there is one character where it would be problematic for them to be in this storyline later in the continuum. On the other hand, it's very disconcerting. Kenyon gives the loyal DH reader several snippets of inside-joke type insights that refer to the earlier works (which occur later) but it doesn't give the novel any better grounding in time.Aside from the continuity issue, the novel isn't one of her best. It's hard to have an emotionless hero fall in believable love. The transformation smacks of pulling a rabbit out of a hat. In other respects, Arik isn't really a compelling hero. He struck me as a magazine model - very 2-dimensional and shallow.Mageara doesn't really develop as well as I thought she should, but she's a much better character than her hero and I found myself wishing she'd run off with Solin who was a much more compelling figure in the novel, in my opinion.The secondary characters (including Solin) and the backstory we get that fills in minute holes in the DH universe are far more entertaining than the central plot.I feel like this novel was probably written not to tell Arik and Mageara's story, but to set up Ash's. Which does a disservice to Kenyon's fans.Which is not to say that I entirely hated the book. I finished it in one sitting and was entertained. Kenyon's humor is getting refined and you'll find yourself chuckling over the sibling squabbles. Her writing style is also getting more and more polished with every book. She is no longer the choppy \\"get it done\\" prose writer I remember from her earliest novels."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I LOVE Sherrilyn Kenyon's work. However, this story was too hollow for me. I had a hard time connecting to the characters. Most of her other books keep me reading throughout the night so I can find out what happens. I usually have a hard time putting her books down. This one would sit for days without being touched. I had a hard time getting through the story without getting extremely bored with it. When I would start reading again I felt an overwhelming urge to put it down once again but pushed myself to finish it so I would at least know how it ended. I would love to see her write more books about the Dark Hunters and not so much about the guys coming out of dreams. She has written a couple of books where the couple comes together within a dream yet the only one that worked for me was the one that the man had been stuck in the pages and was finally freed. He had much more pizzazz and character than Arik did. If you like dream fling books, I would recommend the other one."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"When I initially saw the title I thought maybe SK was starting up a new series.

This was put immediately in the \\"Get it to the used book store quick before they get so many they won't take it\\" pile. It was RUBBISH. I'm so disappointed in the last few SK books that I won't be buying anymore."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"As a Skotos, Arikos is the most hated of Dream-Hunters. Cursed by Zeus never to feel emotions, Dream-Hunters have been doomed for centuries. During his youth, Arikos arrogantly assumed that he could go after a Skotos who had been wanted by the Dream-Hunters for centuries. His error ended up turning him into a Skotos himself. As a Skotos, he feeds off the emotions of the humans whose dreams he enters. Now he is monitored, as a Dream-Hunter can never do harm to a human. When he enters the dreams of Meageara Kaiferi, Arik knows he has found someone special. Even in his \\"non-emotional\\" state, Arik knows that he'd do almost anything to have a chance to be with Meageara in the flesh. He makes a deal with the devil (literally) to do just that.Dr. Geary Kaiferi took up her father's life-long quest to find Atlantis after making him a promise on his deathbed. What looks like a hopeless cause quickly changes after rescuing a stranger named Arik from Greek waters. Soon Geary finds her permits to excavate the site that she believes is Atlantis. Though she sees a startling resemblance between her dream-Arikos and the stranger she rescued, she knows that she crazy enough to think her dream has come to life.Sherrilyn Kenyon weaves a tale that will hook the reader from page one. The reader always knows that there is more going on than meets the eye. While this book was supposed to get us closer to the answer to the question of Ash's heroine, it did just the opposite. There are now more questions that anything else. This is the exact reason that Kenyon has so many fans. She leaves the reader satisfied with the story at hand, in this case Arik and Geary, yet she leaves us wanting more at the same time. Fans of the Dark-Hunters won't be disappointed with the newest installment in the series."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"This book was so dumb it made my brain hurt. Frumpy archaeologist meets walking contradiction god-thing and the search for Atlantis kicks into high gear. . . .Blarg!I'm also forced to wonder if this author does any cultural research in her writing besides keeping a copy of Edith Hamilton's Mythology around. As someone who has a degree in Classics, I was trying not to scream while eeking my way through this story.There were so many characters on that boat, it made me wonder if I was supposed to be reading about some kind of demented singles cruise.This is yet another author I've heard was hot bananas who turned out to be hot air."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I generally like the Kenyon books, they are USUALLY entertaining, easy to read and good. But this one just wasn't. I was really disappointed! I started the book several months ago, and put it down. That is so unlike me, and if you check out the reviews that I have made recently, you will see that I read SEVERAL books (LA Banks, Feehan, Nora Roberts, Charlie Huston, JD Robb, and countless others) in the time that I put it away, but I was determined to finish it, and finish it I finally did. The book really had everything that should have worked for a paranormal romance novel, a sexy dream God(Arik), a lonely but beautiful, intelligent PHD, heroine (Megeara \\"Geary\\" Kafieri), several other demigods/GODS who caused trouble (Hades, Kat, and countless others) and a story that many people would find interesting (the search for Atlantis), but what the story lacked was good character development and a plot. There were chunks of story that were boring and frankly stupid....we all knew what the ending would be, it just took too long to get there. There were also several hints that the main character or her teammates were not what they seem, but they never really explain what her dreams or ability to influence dreams really meant. Maybe this would have been better as a SHORT story, I am not sure. I know that I just find it difficult to get excited about reading another Kenyon novel. I have already purchased Dark Side of the Moon, and hope that I have not wasted my money. So although I am a Kenyon fan, I would not suggest reading this one! Trust me, all of the reviewers aren't wrong. And while I love to support, some things you have to well frankly believe others."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I can probably count on one hand the books that I've been too bored by to finish.

It may be its first time in print but that is because the sex is bad, the characters flat and the plot uninteresting. I liked a couple of the secondary charcters much more than the main ones. I think she like the secondary charcters more as well because she went on to publish some really good books.

I kind of agree with the others that reviewed this book, it seems like something has changed about her writing, because i loved her books on Valerius, Julian,Vane and especially Zarek, but these last few books, just havent been as exciting as her earlier ones. I will still continue to buy and read anything she writes, but i just hope she gets her mojo back before she writes Ash's story or i will be really disappointed.My feeling could of course come from the fact that i just finished reading Lover Awakened by J.R.

However, it was very dry, no spark. I only finished it because I enjoy the series. There are a few minor references to Acheron and the DH's (he says something - again - that sets Nick Gautier's death in motion). Hopefully this is an aberration, I enjoy Sherrilyn Kenyon's other work, it is innovative and compelling.FYI, this book is set in the 1990's, that's why there were references to Zarek, etc. that were resolved in previously published books. If you're going to do that in an established series it really should shed some light on the current mysteries. The only interesting thing about this book was the allusion to Kat's parentage (Ash's presumed love interest)."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I had to post this review because I don't think The Dream-Hunter has been done any justice by other reviews. I think the whole problem is that people are expecting something like the Dark-Hunters (or even the Were-Hunters), but the Dream-Hunters are gods and these books deal more with mythology then Ash and his mad, bad, bitterly betrayed, sex-deprived Dark-Hunters. So, if you've never liked the Greek Mythology part of the previous books, or the amoral, selfish and self-serving gods of the Greek Pantheon then don't bother with this book. You'll only be bored and upset with it. That being said, I liked this story. I thought Arik was an endearing character who I both loved and hated, but most of all enjoyed reading as his character grew and developed from a selfish, emotionless, amoral god to a human man trying to cope with emotions he's never known in a world completely different from his own. And I liked the fact that Geary questions everything and doesn't just fall into Arik's arms. I think their story is one that shouldn't be missed (if not for Arik and Geary, then at least for Hades and Persphone ;)."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I never thought I'd give a bad review on one of Ms. Kenyons books but OML what a sleeper this one was.

It took me over a week and a half to read this as opposed to a day or two with the other books. Reading these Dream Hunter series books on their own is confusing to the Dark Hunter series because if you've read the books in order, some of the characters are actually dead by the time I got around to reading these books. The only reason I started it was that Xypher was in Devil May Cry and I wanted to know what happened to him, I'm so sorry I picked this one up though. Think I'll stick with the Dark Hunters instead.

The plot starts to sizzle as the characters develop at just the right speed. It forbidden for Arik to fall in love with a Human, but how does one go against one's heart?

As many others have said, Kenyon really does appear to be extending the series too far and producing characters and scenarios which are... well, not to pull any punches, boring.Her male characters are entirely predictable by now, and equally predictable is the way that - despite millennia of angst, pain and anger - they fall in love in days, if not hours. Suddenly, someone who is introduced as evil through and through - of course they are, if they're being punished, as Arik is - turns out to be misunderstood and really good underneath.Arik is, basically, a stalker. He enters Geary's dreams and has sex with her. You know, a lot of people would call that rape. Geary comes close but then, predictably, forgives him. Geary herself, though, seems to need psychiatric help. She's obsessed - with finding Atlantis, with distancing herself from her family, with whatever the next thing that crosses her vision happens to be. And, sorry, but if she's really a marine archaeologist then I pity the profession.The most interesting parts about this book were the additional knowledge of Apollymi the Destroyer - who, so far, seems to be a nicer character than Artemis and many others within Kenyon's universe - and Zebulon, who interested me far more than Arik.Not worth your money."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":".Dr. Megeara (Geara) Saatsakis (her mother's maiden name), the child of a professor who is obsessed with finding Atlantis, has lost most of her family to her father's search.

His last request is that she continue the challenge and complete his work. She agrees, never planning to actually follow through with the work that made the academic and archeology world ridicule him.Three months after his death she is presented with irrefutable proof: two artifacts dated 9000 BC with symbols that could only be from Atlantis. Determined to prove her father was right and clear his name in the communities, she rebuilds his salvage operation and begins her search.Meanwhile, Geara dreams constantly of a lover. The man in her dreams could not be real, but Arik is a god, who makes a deal with Hades to be human. So she has to rescue him when he is dropped into the sea near her boat.There is a delicious, but stormy, romance. Arik must learn to be human, which is comical. He is a part of the many twists and turns that reveal Greek mythology and the lost continent of Atlantis.This is a wonderful adventure, a delightful page-turner. I've already ordered more of Sherrilyn Kenyon's books. It is a 5 star unique trip."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"Someday SK is going to have to stop growing this universe and finish up the storylines she already started. How many more species can she possibly come up with? Dolophoni and Chthonians now? There must an end somewhere!Arik and Geary were just blah. As stated in other reviews, Geary should have been smarter for how smart she is! Arik was just a waste of hero. He wants emotions so he can feel emotions...wanting is desiring and that's an emotion! Although SK did try explaining how Arik could feel desire for emotions without technically feeling emotions...the Oneroi are secretly getting emotions back and nobody knows!I agree with the other reviewer who mentioned Apollymi's out of character reactions. Geary doesn't do want Apollymi wants her to do and all Apollymi does is say it's ok, here have a necklace!? Get real. That woman is a b*tch. She doesn't forgive that easily or she wouldn't be h*ll bent on destroying the world and the other gods wouldn't care if she got out or not. Her whole entire storyline is based on her being vengeful and unforgiving!This story was terrible. Solin was ok, I liked him. Hades and Persephone were the best two or three pages in this whole book."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"Like other reviewers have stated, this is NOT a Dark Hunter novel. It is a new series, for the DREAM Hunters. Yes, its set in the 90's, and set up to be something of a prequel but honestly, I didn't see it as a prequel, at least not for the Dark Hunters. That was the purpose, at least as I understand it, to Fantasy Lover. The Dream Hunters are supposed to be a series unto themselves.That said, I too had some difficulty getting through it. The first book I read (of Kenyons) in her Dark Hunter series was Night Play, Vane and Bride's story. Vane wasn't a Dark Hunter but the story pulled enough of the Dark Hunter world into it to call it part of the series. This book remains one of my all time favorites, and is the reason I purchased ALL of the Dark Hunters, and began to read them from book 1 through til the most recent (which I agree with a previous reviewer, wasn't quite up to snuff.) I have all of the Dark Hunter books on my keeper shelf. In the case of this book, The Dream Hunter, I had it on eBay before I was halfway through it. I could tell almost immediately it wasn't a keeper. It's not riveting, it didn't have me dropping everything to get back to it. Other books by Kenyon, in her separate Dark Hunter series, for the most part, do.Overall, it is a good read, but not great and for fans of the Dark Hunter series, it doesn't quite have the same level of intensity or romance that you'd be used too. The supporting characters are by far more intriguing than the leads, and I loved seeing Katra again--she is not \\"new\\", she has been a small player in other books in the Dark Hunter series. I did love Solin, even when he was \\"bad\\" and Hades was a hoot. Even Apollymi was an enjoyable character. If you can keep in mind that this is NOT a Dark Hunter novel, merely an extension of the world in which they are part, you will likely enjoy it more."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I thought this book would be more Dark-Hunter related than other spin offs and ontology's, but I was disabused rather quickly. I must admit I never thought an author of SK's caliber would produce such a badly put together novel, in which there were numerous glaringly obvious editorial mishaps, and a very shaky plot. There seemed to be too many characters that have no reason of being in the plot, they added nothing, and eventually after introducing them they faded away. Some reviewers have commented about this book being another build up to the Acheron book, and I must admit, I agree. Yet, it doesn't build any suspense nor does it feed curiosity about Acheron, all it does is make every other book in the series seem like an after thought. I really enjoyed the other Dark Hunter books, and I hope this is not an indicator of what's to come.I recommend trying \\"Moon Called\\" by Patricia Briggs instead!"},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I once really enjoyed anything written by sherrilyn kenyon. she had a fresh new voice, and she blended greek mythology with vampire lore in a way that was fresh and exciting. Lately she seems to have gotten either lazy, sloppy, or in too much of a rush to pump out books to edit or research her material properly. This book is a shining example of what has gone wrong with her writing. She makes her female protagonist an underwater archaeologist determined to find the lost Atlantis, and clear her father's reputation.I'm all for her choice of occupation, heck it's one I'm considering for myself. I was disgusted with the lack of research Ms. Kenyon put into this book. The proof of Atlantis is given in the form of a coin that has been dated to several millenia before metallurgy was even considered. I'm not saying she should have gotten a doctorate in archaeology to write this book, but have enough respect for the intelligence of your audience to check if a date is even remotely feasible. That is just one pet peeve I had with this book. The characters lacked depth, and were hard to relate to. Overall this book was just a waste of time."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"The only people who should still be reading Sherrilyn Kenyon's works are those who have been there from the beginning and just need to ride out the wave. Those people should not pay full price for the books but should instead buy them used or even better get them from the library. Kenyon is so obsessed with furthering her franchise that she has totally forgotten that the purpose of writing a book is to tell a story. The Dream-Hunter is another in a long line of books that have underdeveloped plot, very little emotional connection between characters and way too many superfluous extras.Arik is a Dream-Hunter with no emotions. The problem with no emotions is that it usually creates very boring people. I found myself caring very little for Geary and Arik and became more interested in the secondary characters. Of course, this is what happens with all of Kenyon's books that I read. Unfortunately, I am usually disappointed when the secondary character's books finally come out (i.e. Bride and Vane). I have to give credit to such authors as J.R. Ward (Brotherhood series) and Stephanie Laurens (Cynster series) who develop a series of books but stick to the core group of characters and develop their stories in rapid succession. After that, jumping off of the main group onto supporting stories is fine.The bottom line is that this is a boring book. I could have cared less if these people got together or not. I no longer care about any of the cast of characters in the Dark Hunter series. However, I keep coming back to Kenyon in the hopes that that one good book will come out to rival Fantasy Lover and the early ones. I am continually disappointed. But I have learned to not spend any money on the books. I get them at the library."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"The cover of DREAM HUNTER drew me straight to the book rack - now that's a Dream God!!! The story was a blast to read. I love Sherrilyn Kenyon's wit and creative brilliance. Where does she get all those ideas and characters from? I have all the Dark Hunter series and plan to start a new row in my bookcase for DREAM HUNTERS. Arik and Megeara are in trouble from the minute they meet - a dream god and his victim - but things don't always work out as planned, even for a god. Sherrilyn's special brand of humor is woven through this romantic fantasy and the world of Oneroi she creates explains why her books hit the top of lists on a regular basis. Waiting on the next one...."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"Like many others who have read this book and were disappointed, I also was hoping there would be more mention of Acheron in this book. Let's face it, we all want to read about Acheron! But from the beginning, this book was advertised exactly what it is, a DREAM Hunter story. Therefore, looking at it from that point of view, it was an excellent story with a HUGE look in to the world of the Dream Hunters. We learn more about the Dream Hunters, why they've been cursed, what's happening to the curse, etc.I had assumed Arik would come across as more of a soulless, unfeeling creature. But from the beginning he seemed to be acting from his emotions, which he isn't supposed to be feeling. I had expected to read more about him dealing with the onslaught of emotions, but he didn't have much of an adjustment period.Geary didn't really grab me, I had a hard time thinking she'd suddenly go from disbelieving everything her father ever said about Atlantis (she changed her name and emancipated herself!!) to being so on board with finding it, all because of one object.Aside from what I considered character flaws, the story was incredible!! Overall I loved finding out more information on Atlantis, the Gods, Apollymi, Katra, the Dream-Hunters... oh just everybody! We get to go to Olympus and Hades . I also like seeing how THIS story (set in 1996) coincides with the later stories that WE think of as being the beginning of the story. I guess this makes this book # 1 since it occured before the others.Four stars from me! And I hope the others who read it will keep an open mind and remember that this is not a DARK Hunter story. Although we do get to meet Acheron's heroine finally..."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I'm disappointed. Sherrilyn Kenyon's books used to be great. I love the historical romance ones as well as the Lords of Avalon, but the Dark-Hunter novels have progressively deteriorated and now this Dream-Hunter novel, one that I was looking forward to, was not so great. It took me a LONG time to read it, when it usually takes me little time to read a book. I had to put it down when I grew frustrated that the story line was stagnant. Other parts I had to skip over just to get through it. What's going on with the novels? For the first book in the Dream-Hunter series, it wasn't very good. Didn't feel any love between the characters- one minute they were strangers and the next they were in love. Where was the progression?"},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I don't agree with people who've been trashing this book here. It's not a horrible plotless chunk of unedited dreck. However, it's not her best work, either, and isn't up to the fabulous standard she set in the early DH novels. She's still an auto-buy for me, but if she doesn't get back to the Dark-Hunters soon, I'm going to get really frustrated. I wish she'd finish with the Dark-Hunters before she starts adding new series to this world, that's all.A plea from a fan, Ms. Kenyon--tell us about Acheron again! Give him more to do than just being the deux ex machina he's become. I miss reading about him actually interracting with his Hunters rather than watching them from on high in Artemis's temple. Speaking of, let's see Artemis get kicked to the curb, oh please oh please. Resolve those storylines, and then move to others. Building suspense is one thing, but once it hits its peak, you can't keep building it... you've got to either satisfy it or watch it fade away.I'm afraid the message I get from reading these reviews is that the interest is fading for many of your readers."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"Seriously, Sherrilyn Kenyon needs to cut back on the number of novels she writes in a year. It's still pretty clear that she puts effort in the main novels of the Dark-Hunters series, but these side-story spin-offs are nothing but Kenyon phoning it in to get a paycheck. With only two stories to its name, I can see that the Dream Hunters are going the way of the Were-Hunters in that the series is unabashedly awful.That brings us to the Dream Hunter. I've given Kenyon's Were-Hunter novels low marks before, but as much as I hated the books, I never took more than three days to read them cover to cover. I bought this on release day and it sat on my night stand for three weeks before I finished it.I hate to sound like a broken record, but this book is another one of the ones that is trying to build suspense to Acheron's book. As far as I am concerned, I never care if that much promised book is ever published at this point because it is about two years too late. Sure, at first everyone was in love with that character and wanted to know what his deal was. I don't think many people still care, because after many books of teasing and still never getting any real answers, Acheron has turned into the Dues Ex Machina plot device from Hell and a character that almost rivals Anita Blake as most annoying reoccurring character in a series.Dream Hunter features Arikos, an incubus god of sleep, and Dr. Megeara Kiferi, global trotting PHD in search of Atlantis. Arikos is infatuated with Megeara after giving her naughty, naughty dreams at night. He gets high off sucking emotions out of wet dreams, and decides he wants to experience the real thing. He cuts a deal with the god Hades to make him human for two weeks, but forgot to read the fine print at the end of the contract that stipulates he will have to bring Megeara's soul to Hades in return. Wonderful, a junkie who uses and endangers other people to get his fix is just what every girl should want.Megeara is an ugly duckling with a PHD. Despite supposedly being smart and focused enough to get a doctorate before she turned thirty, she talks and acts like a dumb valley girl. She's supposed to be an expert in ancient Greek culture but she seems to be totally ignorant of basic points of their mythology. Oh, and Ms. Kenyon and all the other romance authors, being an academic or smart doesn't already automatically translate to being unsociable, a loser, unsexy, and frumpy like you guys seem to think. I spent most of the book wanting to give both these characters a giant slice of clue cake.There is a plot in here somewhere about excavating the Lost City of Atlantis and the gods fearing a possible resurrection of Apollymi the Destroyer who is sealed up in the ruins. Honestly, it kind of gets lost in between introducing about five new characters to the Dark/Were/Dream Hunter world that ultimately don't serve any purpose.Kenyon just needs to cut back on books like these. They aren't any good, and they are making the otherwise fine main series seem stale before its time."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"Well, this is the last book I'm reading from Sherrilyn Kenyon. When Ms. Kenyon started her dark-hunter series several years back, the books were the best thing going in the world of romantic/fantasy fiction. Each book was new, exciting and the romance between the featured couple was tremendous. As time has gone by, this series has invented more and more different species, all with different powers, reporting to different gods with different powers, featuring different story lines, all of course, with different agendas. What is left is a hodgepodge of 10 million storylines & characters all trying to pull together at some point in each book. The series is now confusing, watered down, and a real disappointment. And the romance? It has taken a back seat. There is just too much going on in each book to spare the word count for serious romance. With this particular book, there were 3 or 4 chapters when the old Kenyon magic shown through, but overall, it didn't hold my interest, it took me 4 days to get through it (why I bothered I don't know), and I basically just didn't care. As this is the pattern I have seen with the last 3 books of Kenyon's, I think it is safe to say that this series has ran its course and should die a natural death. At today's publishing prices and the number of books I read a month, I can't afford books that confuse and/or bore me. This series does both."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I have really enjoyed Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter series, but Mother of Pearl, what's with these boring spin-offs? I had to yawn my way through pages of repetitive text making me feel as though I was on a circular read to nowhere. I laid it down, I picked it up, and finally finished it two weeks after purchase (I usually finish one of her books in an afternoon). I found the characters unappealing (Arik, the \\"Dream-Hunter,\\" was nothing more than a voyeur) and I fail to understand why SK's mythological deities always use American slang and colloquialisms. It's not as bothersome when her novels are set in the States, but in Greece and Atlantis? The Dream Hunter series was aptly named since it is guaranteed to put you to sleep."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"Is it my wild imagination or this book is an extended version of one of Mrs Kenyon's short stories? (sorry, can't remember in which anthology I read it but it's the same plot nevertheless).Anyway, my main objections lay on another, probably small, subject. The use of the Greek language in general in Mrs. Kenyon's books. Ok, I understand that for 99,9% of the readers \\"it's all Greek to them\\" but I'm Greek and it's not just Greek to me. To me it's my native language and please, PLEASE dear author, don't use it just to add some \\"exotic\\" flavor to the story. Or, since you're doing it, DO IT RIGHT.First of all some of the names are so wrong to the point of becoming laughable. Arikos, what kind of Greek name is that? It's not ancient and it's not modern. It's just ridiculous (if you're Greek at least). And the Greek phrases? Oh God! At one point the author translates the writings on a T-shirt. The English text goes s/thing like this: \\"I'm watching you, be afraid\\". The Greek translations goes: \\"I see you, I'm scared\\". Totally different meaning. HAVE MERCY. Plus childish mistakes in the use of capital letters, misspellings in the greek text in general and so on.An english-greek dictionary is not all an author needs in order to use a language. How many times we read the phrase \\"my gios\\" (my son) in the books? And how many people know that the grammatical term is totally wrong? When you call s/body \\"my son\\" in greek it goes like \\"gie mou\\" (or \\"my gie\\" if we want to follow the authors way of putting it)and any other way of writing it is wrong.So, Mrs. Kennyon, you want to use the Greek language in your books? Fine by me. But find a Greek to help you do it right. I know that your Greek readers are probably ... well ... one (me, myself and I) but Greek is still the language some of the greatest works of literature have been written and, if I may say so, commands a little more respect. As any other language would, come to think of it.P.S.: As I said at the beginning of my review, this book is an extended version of an older short story by Mrs. Kenyon and (yeaaa!) I finally found which one. It's from the anthology \\"Midnight Pleasures\\" and the title of the story is \\"Phantom Lover\\" (the story of V'Aidan, a Skotos). I have to admit that there are some small changes (the heroin in the short story starts from nightmares and progresses to erotic dreams) but the whole concept is a repetition nevertheless."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"Sherrilyn Kenyon's books are a guilty pleasure for me and they are auto-buys, but I was disappointed by this one. The secondary characters and semi-subplots were much more interesting than the main characters were, and it was readable, so that's why I gave it three stars. The whole \\"pantheon\\" of Kenyon's characters were present: Dream Hunters, Dark Hunters, gods, goddesses, demi-gods, Atlanteans, etc. The heroine, Geary, wasn't bad, though her motivations were generic romantic heroine ones (rebelling against the parental unit, deathbed promises, family obligations, ugly-duckling syndrome, etc.). Arik, the hero, just wasn't that interesting because he was too much of a, excuse the pun, dream lover. There was some good repartee between him and his \\"brother\\", but I thought that he was written as adapting to the mortal world just too easily.After finishing this book, I realized that the whole point of it was to set up a foretelling of what may happen in future books and of what has already happened in previously published books, specifically involving Zarek the Dark Hunter up in Alaska, and the current conflict involving Nick Gautier. It merely in-fills bits and pieces that weren't missed by the readers to begin with. My problem with the book was that I felt that the secondary characters in the book would have been better used as the primary characters, and the main love interest relegated to the subplot. I think that would have worked better.I'm not going to say don't buy it, because it's not a bad book. But if you're a Kenyon reader, just know that this one isn't on par with her better ones. My rating was based on the fact that I am a Kenyon reader and I know that she can do better than this."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"While this was not the best book by SK I really did enjoy it. I actually enjoy having all these different characters involved in the series. I love reading about the were-hunters and now the dream-hunters make a appearance. To fully understand this world I think it needs to be more diversified than just the dark-hunters. I am really looking forward to Devil May Cry with Katra as the heroine, and I know the series will be invigorated when Ash's 2 part book comes out by the end of summer 08. I am actually emotionally invested in this series and while there may be some books that are not a wonderful as others it is not a good reason to give up on the series.

Sherrilyn Kenyon writes with her usual humor, and I do like an author who is funny.I LOVED all the Greek Pantheon of Gods characters, and the tie-in with her Atlantean god characters. Fascinating stuff there, if you've read other parts of the extended story. Some of the material here is not to be missed. I found myself loving the humorous contemporary language employed by the ancient beings.However, thought I like Kenyon's heros, this protagonist is the least likeable of them all. He is a seriously selfish little git, though he grows as the story unfolds. The secondary characters are the ones I found most interesting. Also, Kenyon seems to write everything in the same 'voice.' Sometimes you wonder if it is just the names that are different from story to story.Nonetheless, the overall voice is a wise-cracking one. The story has a certain charm. I'm very interested in these characters overall, and this is a nice interlude along the way to the rest of the story. I recommend it. I give it a 'B.'"},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I love the dark hunter books but I also like the other species Kenyon has created to build different story lines.

After the last two anthologies and the last full length novel I decided to stop running to the store and buying her novels and utilize my great library system. So, I was pleasently surprised when I read The Dream-Hunter and realized that I actually liked this book.

I love the dark hunter series and am reading them in order. This one stuck out like a sour thumb! I know that she was attempting to lay the history and foundation for the next series of books...but it took 107 pages before this book got to the story and became a little bit interesting. And then instead of hot, it was a low simmer. It was all too easy in the end and I barely cared that love conquered all. I felt the author was grasping at straws and that was weird for me because I was loving this series until now. I believe she has incorporated the Were-Hunter stories well. But the dream hunters just seems overly complicated.Another issue I had with this book is that it took us back a few books. Example, Katra leaves this assignment at the end and goes to protect Cassandra..who was in Book 9. Huh? Also Nick is still alive. But I am reading it in the order the website (and others) suggested and the publication date. Instead of it being interesting and connecting previous dots, I found it annoying.

In no way is this book my fav among the DH series. And for some reason I keep missing the fact that the time frame was set years b4 the first book. Another thing is that I kind of new right away how the story was going to play out. And for some reason there was just something missing in this book.

It is great."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"Ever since I read my first Dark-Hunter book, I have been hooked on Sherrilyn Kenyon. Her world of fantasies and alternate reality has provided much entertainment and still continues to do so. Now her supernatural world takes us on another journey, this time focusing on the ethereal world of dreams, where the battle exists between the Oneroi who protect the dreamers, and the Skoti Daimons who prey on the dreamers. Together, they are called the Dream-Hunters.Arik was once an Oneroi until Zeus condemned him. For thousands of years he existed void of emotion, only able to feel by siphoning off the dreamers that they visit. Then one night he accidentally found Megeara, a woman who takes pleasure from something as simple as feeling the sun on her face. Lost in her vivid dreams, he started to feel something strange, something that compelled him. He wanted to be with her, feel her as a human and understand the world she lived in. And so out of the sheer need to be with her, he struck a deal with Hades and unwittingly bartered her soul. Too late to back out, he was thrown into the sea where Megeara rescued him. From the first touch of her skin, the warmth of her smile and her burning gaze, he was lost forever. The very idea of returning as a Skotos burnt through him. He would rather die than go back and lose her forever. How can he get out of his bargain with the very devil himself? But more importantly, how can he survive the assassins sent by the Oneroi to kill him?Dr Megeara Kafiera once turned her back on her heritage after watching her father's disgrace in his search to prove to the world that Atlantis existed. Now years later, she is back in Greece to fulfill her deathbed promise to her father. Yet, it seems she is destined for the same destiny as her father after encountering numerous obstacles on her quest to salvage his reputation. Little does she know that the stranger she rescues holds the very key to Atlantis. And as she gets closer to unraveling its location, she will find out the truth about Arik and the pact he made with Hades to be with her.Kenyon's novels are known to feature wry humor, plenty of action and sizzling love scenes; and she certainly delivers these in DREAM HUNTER. While there is nothing spectacular about this entry to the new series, there's plenty of humor and action to keep you entertained. The verbal sparring between Arik and his brother had me chuckling. The revelation about Megeara's ancient heritage is also interesting and the plot thickens on Apollymi's own quest to get out of her exile.While fans of Kenyon may find this rather average in comparison to her other novels, those who have just recently delved into Kenyon's fantasy world would probably have a lot more fun with this novel."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I had never read any Kenyon stuff until this.

Sure, it doesn't have the novelty of her earliest dark-hunter books, but it's still a good story that brings the mythology I learned about in school to life. I really liked that she has managed to answer some of the questions raised in previous books. I think this book is worth a read."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"As an avid reader, I was interested in this book on the back cover synopsis. Reading 50 or so pages into this book, I hoped it would get better, but it crashed and burned. The plot was weak, the editing was horendous and the characters predictable. Don't spend your money, this book is a true waste of time."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"With Sherrilyn, you usually get a hit or a miss. This was a TOTAL miss. I won't go into the plot, but will note that it's flat and the pacing of the story is extremely slow. In other words, this was one of the most \\"boring\\" books that I've read in a while. The timeline was \\"funky,\\" and quite frankly, you didn't learn a whole lot more in this story than you've learned in previous stories.I honestly think that Sherrilyn has way too many series going on. I mean she must have 5 or 6 going on simultaneously. It's just too much. The writing is bound to suffer at some point. This book is a prime example of that.I read on her website that it can take Sherrilyn as little as 2 weeks to write an entire book. After reading Dream Hunter, I can honestly believe it. You may want to get this one from your library. I can only thank the Good Lord that it wasn't sold in hardback."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I would sneak into my parent's library collection and borrow their huge volumes of hardcover Readers Digest books. The ones that held the intrigue of my young mind were all of the stories pertaining to Greek Mythology. Reading this book brought me back to that old childhood obsession.

The relationship between the story's main characters was poorly put together. I felt like I had to push myself to read it.

There will be some overlap, but how much remains to be seen. Both series are based on Greek mythology and the story of Atlantis. This particular book features Arikos, the Dreamhunter, and Dr. Megeara ( Geary) Kafieri, a researcher looking for Atlantis. Many of Geary's family members and family friends have met their ends in the search for Atlantis, but Geary has clues left for her by her father that makes her continue her father's quest. Arikos lives his life without emotion, unless he is sharing a dream with a human. He encounters Geary in his roaming from dream to dream and is attracted to her and the emotion high he finds within her dreams. Arikos is so attracted to Geary, that he bargains with Hades to spend two weeks with her as a human. Bargaining with a God is not advisable. Hades requests Geary's soul in return for the two weeks.The story sticks pretty close to the main characters and supporting characters are either undeveloped or introduced as a bit of a teaser of things to come. We can expect more of the characters of Solin (dreamhunter/human), Kat (handmaiden of Artemis), ZT (Chthonian), D'Alerian (Oneroi), etc..."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I was not expecting great literature. I have fumbled through this womans books before and have been unimpressed. I picked up this one because the story reminded me of other books that I enjoyed by Lisa Cach called Come to me and Dream of Me. Those were very clever books.I expect an author to decide the \\"voice\\" for all the characters and to be consistent. Basically every character spoke with the same voice, both in speech and inner reflections. (ie: A 27000 year old god should not be using retarded preteen impotency jabs, using strictly recent American coloquialisms or be making I love Lucy references and then not know what a pop-tart is) It was very difficult to take any character very seriously when they all sounded 13 years old.We also came into the story at the wrong place. The book starts in the middle of the story and I have a feeling that the heros discovery of the heroine would have been much more enthralling. By the time we join up with the tale all the characters are in play and we don't get any build up of tension except that to know that someone somewhere doesn't what them to achieve a goal."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"What a fun book! I stayed up half the night to finish this, not only for the great characters in Geary and Arik, but for the wonderfully intriguing secondary characters AND the edge-of-your-seat story.

I whooped out loud when a certain *future* heroine came on the scene - fans of Kenyon's Dark-Hunter series will know what I mean - and, wow, is she great.Kenyon has the talent and skill to pull off an outrageous premise and immerse a reader into a world that's so fascinating, as soon as you finish the last page, you want to read the book all over again!"},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"This is a good book for the fans of the Dark-Hunter series...I don't know if you would be able to follow it without having read the previous books.

Once, he was a Oneroi but was tricked by a Skoti and ended up being turned. Now, he's found Mageara (or Geary) who dreams in vivid color and sensation. Arikos is drawn to her dream, to her. He's even willing to make a deal with Hades to experience two weeks with Mageara. Problem is what he must do in return.The concept of the Dream-Hunter's was introduced in an earlier book in the series, which we find out takes place chronologically after this book. The idea of meeting someone in your dreams is very appealing and Mageara even gets a chocolaty version of Arikos for her pleasure.Problems arise when Mageara finds a half naked man floating in the water off of Greece, and it turns out to be her dream lover.Arik, as he calls himself in human form, only wants to experience life and Mageara but her mistrust is keeping her from her. He will risk his human life to make her happy and it isn't until the secret of the Dream-Hunter's comes out that she is willing to share her desires with him.The idea was intriguing and while some of the delivery was predicable, I did like the idea that this man, or Dream-Hunter, was willing to be human just to spend two weeks with a woman he can't stay away from in her dreams. An interesting bit to the story is that Arikos was willing to kill Mageara and give her soul to Hades in exchange for his two weeks, but after getting to know her he can't bring himself to do it. I did like that his intentions didn't start out from anything really romantic though in the end, as always, he comes to realize how much he loves her.The banter between the two characters is actually very fun and while I think the adventures could have been more interesting the relationship between Arik and Mageara is entertaining."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"This is the next book in the dark-hunter series I have been reading.

Condemned by the gods to live eternity without emotions, Arik can only feel when he's in the dreams of others. For thousands of years, he's drifted through the human unconscious, searching for sensation. Now he's finally found a dreamer whose vivid mind can fill his emptiness.Dr. Megeara Kafieri watched her father ruin himself and his reputation as he searched to prove Atlantis was real. Her deathbed promise to him to salvage his reputation has now brought her to Greece where she intends to prove once and for all that the fabled island is right where her father said it was. But frustration and bad luck dog her every step. Especially the day they find a stranger floating in the sea. His is a face she's seen many times.... in her dreams.What she doesn't know is that Arik holds more than the ancient secrets that can help her find the mythical isle of Atlantis. He has made a pact with the god Hades: In exchange for two weeks as a mortal man, he must return to Olympus with a human soul. Megeara's soul.With a secret society out to ruin her expedition, and mysterious accidents that keep threatening her life, Megeara refuses to quit. She knows she's getting closer to Atlantis and as she does, she stumbles onto the truth of what Arik really is.For Arik his quest is no longer simple. No human can know of a Dream-Hunter's existence.

Silly errors that slip by spell-checkers, but are just plain wrong. One example of many, I believe it was the one with Wulf and Cassandra? they used the security cameras to do a PARAMETER? check. I believe that should be a perimeter check. This was one of many. Perhaps they are using an early draft, somebody goofed, but I am buying books I already have in paper format.

Why are silly new errors being introduced?"},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"The Dream-Hunter, Oh where do I begin...I should have known better. After reading \\"Upon A Midnight Clear\\" the 2nd Dream hunter book, I should have followed my good old common sense and stay far away from any Dream Hunter novel. But I told myself that it wasn't possible for all the books in the entire series to be bad. I really wanted to give this book the benefit of the doubt. But sadly, I was disappointed.I am going to be honest with you, trying to read this book was like wading through dark, sticky, bitter molasses . While not impossible, it is frickin' hard and NOT a pleasant experience. The opposite of a page turner. Every page got harder and harder to turn because not only did I not identify with the characters, I did not even care what happened to them. It was like watching a train wreck with dispassionate interest.The story itself was just hard to read and get into. While some other novels have their downfall in poorly written dialogue and bad clich&eacute;s. This book had it's downfall in the author's inability to properly create well developed sympathetic characters and make an otherwise boring adventure fun.Here is the problem with the Dream Hunter novels, the Dream Hunters are boring. They have no emotions and have no concept of how to behave outside of the dream realm. How fun? They are like aliens from outer space playing a game of the SIMS for humans. They can do anything imaginable in the SIMS world but none of it is actually real. They can feel none of it. It is one thing to read a book about fictional characters, it is another thing to read a book based on the dreams of fictional characters. This is where I draw the line, this kind of story is a little too nested for me. Personally, I like my fictional characters to live and fall in love in their version of the real world, not their dream world.So do yourself a favor and just borrow it from the library like I did. And if you get to a point where you simply can't continue reading , just skip to the last chapter and call it a day. No one can say, you didn't read the book from front to back.I love Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark-Hunter series and will continue to read them, but you won't find me picking up another Dream-Hunter book anytime soon.Enough said. I'm off to read something that won't actually give me a headache.___Read other Dark-Hunter reviews on my blog [...]"},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I found this book to be entertaining and interesting. I liked the view into the dream-hunter world and it helped me to better understand what goes on there since there have been so many references to it in the dark-hunter series. I liked the story plot in this one. It's very creative. I found that this is an important book to read even if you are reading the dark-hunter series. You get to learn more about Kat and whats going on with her and her lineage. We are also introduced to Tory in the book. She is only 15 here as the stage is set several years before the dark-hunter series starts. Tory will be Acheron's love interest in his book and it was good to get a preview of her. I can't wait to read that one for myself as I think it will be interesting to see how kenyon develops her character."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"So I've been reading the Dark-Hunter series by Sherrilyn Kenyon and this Dream-Hunter is a setup to one of the Dark-Hunters. It's supposed to be read between a few of the Dark-Hunter books.For me The Dream-Hunter was not that great. It was short, which I was grateful for, but it lacked what the other books had for me.This book was about Arikos and Megeara. Arik is an ex Oenroi, now a Skotos who can only feel emotions when in other people's dreams. He lives in the dream realm and is supposed to help people by taking some of their emotions and dulling them so that they're not that strong. He runs across a vivid dreamer Dr. Megeara Kafieri.Geary is searching for the lost kingdom of Atlantis. She picked up where her father left off. Arik makes a deal with Hades to become human and agrees before he learns that after his two weeks are up he must bring Geary's soul to Hades. And blah blah blah.I had no connection to any of the characters in this series. I was almost rooting for the bad guy to end it and put me out of my misery. Well, I guess it wasn't as bad as that, but I could definitely have done without this side story. I don't really need all this build up to the main Dark-Hunter story."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"Dream Hunter is the first book in the Dream Hunter Novel Series. I am not really sure how many there are but so far looks like at least three.Megeara is a scientist who has just lost her father along with many family members before him while he was looking for Atlantis. She had thought her father was a fool until he died and she was given something he left. Megeara then makes it her quest to find Atlantis to redeem her father's reputation. She keeps having dreams about the same guy....Arikos is a dream god (Skotos) and they were all cursed by Zeus to be deprived of all emotions. They can however feel emotions, they can however feel them in dreams through the dreamer. He finds Megeara's dreams really vivid compared to everyone else. He then bargains with Hades to become human and the deal is to kill Megeara.When I first started reading this book I thought \\"oh boy another mindless romance\\". I mean the typical tall blond who thinks she's not good looking and in comes the Greek god looking man. Tall, built, dark flowing hair etc, etc. That's why I was so surprised that there was more to the story.I'll start with the positives. The story had a pretty good plot line involving the search for Atlantis and Arikos discovering emotions as a human. The struggles he encounters since he knows nothing of human life. It was amusing reading his interactions. I also like the amount of fight scenes that were in the book because they made it seem more realistic and flowing. I thought there was a delicate balance between trying to bring out the romantic aspect and the epic aspect of the two worlds merging. The \\"gods\\" in the book were different from other ones I've read because they spoke current dialect. It was nice to have them evolve with the times and act like the current society. It was also an interesting take on Greek mythology with addition of the writer's own fictitious characters to the world.The things I was not so fond of however were the amount of Greek inserted in the book without translation. I mean it's fine for anyone who knows the language but I do not. At some points I thought there seemed to be too many side stories or hints at things that never got resolved. Also there were plenty of things that didn't add up and contradicted each other with the way the characters behaved. The book could technically be a stand alone but there was an illusion to something towards the end that could mean another book. That would have been great if I knew what book that was. I think there is another series called Dark Hunters (16 books so far?) and I do not have the patience to go find which ones have those characters.All in all it surpassed my expectations and actually kept me entertained. I really think it's more a 3.5 but I don't want to score it as low as a 3."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"Sherrilyn Kenyon is a new author to me, and, as with all new authors, i took a risk in purchasing this book. This book was not a winner. everything seemed so, so, predictable, even the romance. The whole story is based on Arikos, a demi-god cursed by Zeus to feel no emotions, who makes a selfish decision to trade one women's life for two brief weeks of pleasure. early on in his alloted time, he, predictably, falls for the woman whose soul is promised in the bargain, and realizes his mistake. the book seems amateur in that none of the characters seem real. The humans are constantly shifting on their deepest held beliefs/quests/morals, and the gods seem shallow and cant settle on a distinct speech pattern (ancient and powerful god, Whiny 21st century teen) .I couldn't decide if the characters were supposed to be comical, or were just poorly written. The plot seemed as if it was there to provide a background for the unrealistic sex. This book was a waste of a good ten bucks."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I really liked this book. It gave me a really good feel of the dreamhunters world and I've been itching for some details about them since I read the first story. Arik sounded pretty cool - selfish son of a gun in the beginning, but a good guy in the end. I liked how Ms. Kenyon described how Arik was starting to get feeling and when he talked, it was obvious that he didn't understand them. That was cool. Solin surprised me at the end. He reminds me a lot of Valerius. All in all, this was a worthy read. I'm glad I bought it."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"Ive read almost the entire dark-hunter series (still 2 to go) and was really looking forward to learning more about the dream-hunters because they were portrayed as mysterious, intriguing, sexy creatures in some previous books. what a disappointment! I didnt like any of the characters, except Geary's cousin Tory whom didnt have a huge role. The dream-hunters were all mean, moody, selfish, hateful. Arik wasnt even a like-able character. He came off as week, selfish, and even somewhat dumb. Kenyon tried to introduce to many new characters, and re-use too many old ones as well. The scene near the end with Kyrian and Acheron was confusing and i think it was just there to remind us that these 'species' are somewhat intertwined. The scene at the end when they were leaving from talking to Hades was the only one in the whole book that had me really caring what happened next.Geary was a good enough heroine, but i didnt feel a connection with her, or their so-called love. There were no sparks, no chills between these two.I love the dark-hunters, and also the were-hunters but this is really pushing it. Will i read the next dream-hunter book? Probably, just in hopes that she has regained her magic and can make a likeable main character.Im not sure what Ms. Kenyons problem is with her books lately, but they are leaving much to be desired. I have Dark Side of the Moon coming, and i really hope that it is better than this one!"},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I thought this book was pretty good. I have only read a short story of the dark-hunters, so the order this book falls didn't bother me. I am waiting for my shipment of dark-hunter books and after reading the reviews of this book, I am glad I read this one first. There were a lot of characters in this book, however, I think it lent to the story more. Have you ever been reading a book and wonder where everyone was?

This book flowed with what made me turn to Sherrilyn Kenyon in the first place."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"Ms Kenyon is one of my favourite authors and I really enjoy her Dark-Hunter series (although consciously trying to forget the complete distortion of Greek mythology for the sake of entertainment). Unfortunately, her Dream-Hunter series is below her usual standard, with the possible exception of \\"Dream Chaser\\". Fortunately, you don't really need to have read any of the first Dream-hunter stories in order to understand \\"Dream Chaser\\". I suppose she found herself at a period of her author life where books are written in a rather mechanistic, automatic way. The recipe is the same as her other books, but feeling is lacking and the reader can't really sympathise with the characters. In addition, there is a higher than normal instance of poor Greek, with most characteristic example the message on Zebulon's T-shirt. It's supposed to read \\"I'm watching you, be afraid\\", but the quoted Greek phrase means \\"I'm watching you, I AM afraid\\". It could be very funny, except it's actually annoying... I suppose it's evidence of poor editing. I don't know who has responsibility for double-checking the Greek phrases and words used in Ms Kenyon's books, but they are not doing a very good job. By the way, Zebulon must be a Russian name, because for one it's not Greek, and secondly it's the name of a character in Sergei Lukyanenko's \\"Day Watch\\". I also feel very sorry for the heroine, who bears a name that means (literally) \\"shrew\\" or \\"she-devil\\" in Greek. I understand the author chose it in purpose, but honestly, no matter how evil a Greek parent may be, they would never choose such a name for their child...Overall, this is poor quality. I may sound severe in my critique, but Ms Kenyon has accustomed readers to much better stories. It's good to see that her more recent instalments show evidences of her good, old self."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I bought this book unseen in Sept and have had it for about three months every time I picked it up I got tired of it and laid it down finally, I have finished it. The first 2/3 are boring and slow the last 1/3 is pretty good, however it is not up to my standards for a good read. Buy it used or borrow it but I don't think you will want to pay 8 dollars for it.The time frame is behind her other novels and before Kyrian meets Amanda.Megeara Kafieri is looking for Atlantis, her father died searching for it and she wants to redeem his reputation. She has no sexual life outside her dreams but they are filled with a lucious man. Imagine her surprise to fish him out of the ocean.Arikos is a Dream-Hunter, he finds her dreams esspecially full of life. Drawn to her he makes a deal with Hades to become human for two weeks. But naturally he falls in love with her and puts the rest of the Dream-hunters in danger of Zeus. She is also in danger because the Gods will not allow Atlantis to be found.As I said it was slow until about the last third and I did enjoy the last third. So if you are willing to wade through the first part to get to the good part then you will want this book. I encourage you to rent, borrow or buy used."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I don't know how she does it ? Ms. Kenyon writes some right hot books but never crosses the line to crude. Dream Hunter is another fine example and of course, it is threaded with information that will be valuble with her Dark-Hunter series which is how I got hooked. If you are familiar with Zarek's story ever wonder how he dreamed such revealing poetic thoughts. Catch the end of this book and add it to your picture for the Dark-Hunter world. And don't forget the Kat who helped Ash out with that leaf thing. See how you almost have to read all of her books to get the full story. Like I said Ms. Kenyon How do you do it?"},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"Sherrilyn Kenyon is my favorite paranormal romance author. I've read every book ever written, which has left me obessed with the world of the Dark-Hunters.The Dream-Hunter did not disappoint, Arikos and Geary were magical together, and better still, as with each book she writes, I learn more about Atlantis, the Gods of Olympus, and my favorite character in all the Dark-Hunter novels, Acheron.I cannot wait for the next novel!"},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I have loved Kenyon's Dark Hunter books until the last couple which I felt had lacked something of the first few. I didn't know what to expect from this book but was pleasantly surprised. It did get slow in the middle (after a very strong start and somewhat rushed ending) but, overall, I thought it an improvement. It was confusing to me at the beginning until I paid attention to the timeline as it actually predates some of the Dark Hunter stories...Kyrian & Nick. It was interesting how many characters from the Dark Hunter series were prominent in this story but from a totally different point of view. That lends itself to some interesting future stories. I do agree with one reviewer who mentioned Kat and Ash. It was hinted in this story that Kat was very important to Ash and I also felt that, if that is true, she needs a much better personality. There was something about her character that was not very likeable even though she did help the heroine in this story. All in all this was a good read."},{"Title":"The Dream-Hunter, Book Club Edition (dream-hunter, 1)","review":"I was so excited for this to come out but it really missed the mark. It can't be compared to her Dark-Hunter series since, even though they are connected, it's really a separate series. But I thought her writing itself was lacking in this one.The problem appears to be in her characterization. The heroine was supposed to be smart but she acted a bit dense. She just \\"overlooks\\" the fact that she's been seeing this man in her dreams for months. It's mentioned once or twice but she doesn't make the connection until she's told? Also, she just wasn't that engaging.And I didn't find the hero, Arik, to be anything like her usual characters. I usually fall in love with her heros quickly but I just really didn't like him. I thought he was selfish through most of the book although he could be amusing and sometimes endearing.The supporting characters were a bit off too. Kat who we've seen before and will be seeing again wasn't represented well here and Apollymi's actions didn't fit the character. She's called \\"the destroyer\\" but in the end when she doesn't get what she wants she shrugs and essentially says \\"oh well - better luck next time\\"? Nope, it just doesn't work for her.However, this book wasn't a total waste. The scene between Hades and Persephone was WAY GREAT! The best part of the whole book in my opinion.I'll continue to buy her Dark-Hunter books but I'll be wary of any more Dream-hunter books."},{"Title":"Multicultural Citizenship: A Liberal Theory of Minority Rights (Oxford Political Theory)","review":"This is a long-awaited book. Those who believe that the liberal tradition requires a back row, laissez-faire attitude to the problems of minorities are put to flight.Kymlicka shows clearly that there has been a long tradition of leading liberals who have felt that in order for national minorities to be as free as majorities, they need affirmative action to counteract the all-pervading influence of dominant cultures, through the education system, the media, and the general majority discourse.He sees the individual's freedom as the right to belong to his of her ancestral group, and this of course means that unless the group's rights are recognised and implemented, the individual that belongs to the group cannot be a free person. Kymlicka distinguishes neatly between minorities whose aim is to be considered and treated as the same as anyone else (that is, anyone belonging to the dominant group): women, Afroamericans, etc.; and between minorities who wish not to lose their differentiated culture and identity: American Indians, Quebeckers, Catalans, Welsh, etc. He points out to majority members that what they take for granted is neither the only worldview possible, nor the best worldview, and defends minorities' right to hold other views, their own.He is also masterly in drawing the limits to allowing national minorities full control over their own affairs: naturally, no-one should tolerate practices, however ancient, which clash with universal human rights. These include the individual's freedom to leave the group, the rejection of female ablation, etc.The fact that the book has been published in Catalan attests to its international appeal."},{"Title":"Multicultural Citizenship: A Liberal Theory of Minority Rights (Oxford Political Theory)","review":"Along with Tamir's &quot;Liberal Nationalism&quot; and Miller's &quot;On Nationality&quot;, &quot;Multicultural Citizenship&quot; is fast becoming a classic work on liberal nationalism.

A more refined version of some of the arguments presented in &quot;Liberalism, Community, Culture&quot;. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Multicultural Citizenship: A Liberal Theory of Minority Rights (Oxford Political Theory)","review":"This book is a mixed bag- there are interesting and important arguments for a brand of multi-cultural citizenship, and for the idea that national minorities are morally distinct from immigrant groups. However, there are also serious problems. The historical analysis is often at least somewhat off- it's very odd to make a big deal that 19th centruy liberals supported nationalism w/o noting, at all, that this was largely due to their insidious racism and support for colonialism, even by liberals like Mill. That this isn't even mentioned or considered is a shocking omission. That's just one of many examples. Often the book seems to vastly over-generalize from the Canadian experience, w/o making this clear or noting what's being done. Much of the discussion of immigrant groups doesn't really fit that well w/ the facts, and lacks the sympathetic insight that Kymlicka displays towards national minorities. Several of the main thesies are challanged by the experience of the EU, and no mention of that is made at all. (Some of that is surely due to the book being nearly 10 years old, but even at that time some of the claims about what people want, what's possible, etc. were already being challanged by developments in the EU.) SO, the book should be read and considered, but the arguments are too full of gaps to be anywhere close to convincing now."},{"Title":"Multicultural Citizenship: A Liberal Theory of Minority Rights (Oxford Political Theory)","review":"IntroductionMost modern states face multicultural problems. For example, the Catalans in Spain strife for their own state. Belgium consists of two nations, Flanders and Wallonia, which causes trouble for the future of Belgium. The rise of worldwide migration causes large ethnic minorities with ethnic and racial tensions.This diversity is often ignored by a \\"benign neglect\\" on the part of liberal theorists because a liberal government should assign equal rights to its citizens. Distinctions based on creed, gender, colour or culture should not influence one's rights and duties. This contemporary liberal concept is challenged by Will Kymlicka. In his book \\"Multicultural Citizenship\\" (1995), he asserts that a government cannot be culturally neutral, even if it wants to be. Decisions such as state language and education are made by the majority culture, and minority cultures are put in an unequal and unjust disadvantage. This injustice can be cured by giving such minority groups special rights, such as self-governance, special representation and \\"polyethnic rights\\", explained below. Does it follow that not all citizens should enjoy the same rights in a multicultural state? His answer is both yes and no, as will be explained below.Multination states and polyethnicityKymlicka replaces the word \\"multicultural\\" by two more specific terms. Multination states are states that harbour two or more nations. A nation is a \\"historical community, ... occupying a given territory or homeland, sharing a distinct language and culture\\". An example is Canada, in which Quebec is a nation of its own and where Indian tribes have special rights. Polyethnic states, on the other hand, have ethnic minorities as a result of immigration. Such immigrants come on an individual or familial basis and typically do not form a nation of their own in their new homeland. Most modern states are multinational, polyethnic, or both. This distinction between two types of minorities has important consequences.National minorities have a historic claim on self-governance, education in their own language, and protection of their land and institutions. Group-differentiated rights are needed to give them equal opportunities in a state where the majority culture speaks another language.Immigrants who form polyethnic minorities, on the other hand, have chosen to leave their own culture out of free will. It is not unreasonable to require them to adapt to the new culture of their own choosing. Thus, most of the minority rights defended in the book are meant for national minorities.Self-governmentSelf-governance is a collective right that can both restrict its members and protect its members. A group can require its members to behave according to the rules of the community. Some rules restrict individual freedom, such as the exclusion of woman of education. Such internal protections should not be granted to a national minority in a liberal state. But external protections can protect the culture without restricting individual freedom of its members. For example, a national minority can be given more self-governing rights to control migration to its territory and to arrange education in their own language.Collective rights are not conflicting with individual rights as long as only external protections are provided and as long as the collective rights are needed to protect the minority against an unjust advantage of a majority culture. The protection of cultural membership is important because a societal culture does provide its members with a rich menu of individual choice.Special representationMinority cultures must be represented to include them in the political decision making. The line of argument in the book is based on the Anglo-Saxon political system where each district elects one representative. In such a system, minorities will often be underrepresented. Strangely, Kymlicka does not explore the possibility of a proportional electoral system such as in The Netherlands, where even very small political parties will be represented in the parliament. He also makes no mention of Arend Lijphart, who has done extensive research in this field. Instead, he proposes measures to fix the Anglo-Saxon system, while he admits that such an approach can be difficult to implement.Polyethnic rightsSikhs in Canada enjoy exception from motor-cycle helmet laws and police uniform laws because their religion requires them to wear a tulban (p. 31). Kymlicka is enthusiastic about such measures, because in this way ethnic or religious groups can be included in the society. He calls such financial and legal protection polyethnic rights.I am not sure if such exceptions are as great as Kymlicka assumes. Treating people different based on their religion can erode the respect for, in this case, motor-cycle helmet laws. If some person X with religion Y is allowed without a helmet, why am I not allowed? Lady Iustitia carries a sword and scales and is often depicted blindfolded. The blindfold not only ignores religion, it also symbolises that justice should be meted out without regard to identity.ConclusionsIn the view of Kymlicka, some individuals should get additional rights because they are member of a minority culture. At first sight, this means that the state no longer consists of citizens with equal rights. But members of such minorities are put in a disadvantage, and the additional rights are only meant as an external protection against unjust majority decisions. By giving group-differentiated rights, equality can be restored.I am not sure of the practical value of his solutions. Polyethnic rights pose ethical problems, while his chapter on special representation is too much focused on the peculiarities of the Anglo-Saxon electoral system. Self-governance can surely strengthen minority cultures, but this idea is not novel and is already implemented in many states such as Canada.Still, Kymlicka offers an interesting group and culture oriented liberal political theory. He is right that contemporary liberalism is often blind for cultural dilemmas. His book offers a well-balanced theory to think about multicultural problems in a liberal framework. This is a huge improvement over the \\"benign neglect\\" that characterizes many liberals today."},{"Title":"Multicultural Citizenship: A Liberal Theory of Minority Rights (Oxford Political Theory)","review":"Kymlicka's arguement is both forceful and articulate, making Multicultural Citizenship a valuable work for both specialists and those simply currious about political thought and multiculturalism.

There's no doubt that Kymlicka's argument and examples to support his thesis were impressively logical and reasonable.

He provides a really interesting outlook on the ways in which the quest for rights for any group of people can result in conflict. I suppose I like this book so well because it follows my own philosophical view on people claiming rights in general, that at some point if we were to claim all rights we believe we're entitled to, we would eventually come into conflict with someone else's human rights. As such, we must necessarily make sacrifices of some rights in order to live peaceably among all people.

The Bible gives us plenty of guidelines for modesty in the way that we dress. (1) We are all ambassadors for Christ (II Cor. 5:20), (2) that a person should dress in a manner that is different from members of the opposite sex (Deut. 5:22), (I Tim. 2:10), (3) that we should strive to maintain a decent appearance before the world (Col. 4:5), (4) that we should show our worth by not conforming to the styles of those who are without God in this world (Rom. 2:12). Sadly, this has been abandoned in favor of being \\"trendy\\" and \\"fashionable.\\" This book is highly reccomended for anyone concerned with this issue."},{"Title":"Christian modesty and the public undressing of America","review":"I read this book in about an hour. This man has serious issues with women. Do you know how often \\"modest\\" is mentioned in the Bible? ONCE. Lust, on the other hand, is a frequent topic in scripture. But apparently Jeff Pollard doesn't know that because all through this book he puts the blame on women, even comparing women who dress immodestly to Eve leading Adam into sin.Once or twice he mentions the need for men to exercise self control. But the biggest complaint he has about men is that they aren't teaching their wives about the importance of dressing modestly!! Again, shifting the blame back to the women. He says several times that immodestly dressed women are the flame in a roomful of dynamite.An inconsistency I noticed is this: he describes a sleeveless biblical garment that God designed for Adam and Eve. But later in the book he describes the sensuality of shoulders and how baring of the arm and shoulder was the beginning of our culture's slide into immodesty. Another one is that he insists women need to cover their bodies. Then, later in the book, he says that covering the body can be more sensual than nakedness! Specifically that a one piece swimsuit is more sensual than a two piece.On his \\"immodesty timeline\\" he describes baring of the arms, shoulders, and breasts as becoming fashionable in the early 1900s. What about the fashionable low cut gowns women wore prior to the 1900s?Modest means \\"seemly\\" or \\"with propriety.\\" In US culture it is not unseemly to wear a swimsuit to the pool or beach. Culture and society *do* have a bearing on what is appropriate to wear--otherwise we'd all be wearing the gowns and tunics of biblical times. And even Jeff Pollard admits he doesn't want that! So what does he want? Other than outlawing swimsuits, he's not very clear. (And yes, he does make frequent reference to the good old days when you could be arrested for wearing a modern swimsuit!)"},{"Title":"Christian modesty and the public undressing of America","review":"Jeff Pollard has, indeed, taken on the \\"sacred cow\\" of our culture - the swimsuit, essentially, but more importantly, he has shown by the sources he quotes from outside the Christian church, that the agenda of the fashion industry has been to progressively \\"undress\\" the American public. He moves on to show what the Bible teaches concerning modesty, and how the Christian believer has been duped and deceived into believing that this is \\"normal behavior,\\" when in fact it hasn't been.This is a powerful tool in the hands of anyone who wants to shed light on this subject, especially to a youth pastor who goes swimming with his group, and the kinds of swim wear which the young people put on. Or even to the Christian who has held that \\"there is nothing wrong with this,\\" or that \\"everyone is doing it,\\" or that \\"I'm not naked in front of anybody.\\" This is not a \\"put down\\" or a call to condemnation, but an appeal to examine ourselves in light of biblical teaching as to how our behaviors are impacting our culture, and how we are called to be \\"separate\\" and not be conformed to our world and its falleness.Towards the end of this book, Jeff Pollard reveals what the connection between the undressing of America and the current states of affair are in pornography, and how easy it has become to see how the swimsuit and pornography have led to the complete undressing of our culture and what the \\"uncovering of our nakedness\\" has produced and what it means from a biblical point of view. Ultimately, it has been rotten fruit, and we need to capture again the essence of modesty in dress if we are to avoid the judgment of God.Compelling reading, and SOBERING!!! Highly recommended!!!"},{"Title":"Christian modesty and the public undressing of America","review":"by focusing primarily on the history of the swimsuit Pollard's book does not address the larger issue of modesty in public dress as effectively as he might. And while the history of fashion sheds light on fashion, (i.e. swimsuits have observably become skimpier over a century) Pollard can offer no explanation except the caving in of Christian virtue. This is basically saying Christians have lost a culture war without explaining why.While the initial exposition on what the parameters of Christian modesty mean Pollard provides no application for what a suitable example of Christian modesty would be. Furthermore, when push comes to shove he refers to the Westminster Larger Catechism for application rather than sticking to the biblical principles he espoused. Some of his cases are self-defeating. On one hand he notes that garments in biblical periods could be sleeveless and then states that the inexorable decline of swimwear in the west into sluttiness really began when sleeveless swimwear appeared in the mid-19th century. Props for giving the topic serious consideration but as an exegetical study it is still wanting.On the other hand, it's cheap so if you're not persuaded the research has been effective it won't cost you much."},{"Title":"Christian modesty and the public undressing of America","review":"Christian Modesty and the Public Undressing of America, by Jeff Pollard, is a small book (the author often refers to it as an article), and could be a very quick read. However, there is a lot of thought-provoking information contained in just 74 pages! So, I took a little extra time as I read, because I wanted to really think through some of the ideas and challenges to modern thinking presented in this little book.Even within the church, controversy and confusion surrounds the issue of Christian (biblical) modesty. And, as the author acknowledges, some will judge this book to be far too conservative, or legalistic, while others will say that it is too liberal, and does not go far enough. While that may be the case, it is the stated purpose of this book, not to add to the confusion, or to stir up controversy, but to provoke fellow believers (men and women alike) to \\"love and good works\\" (Heb. 10:24) in this area, and if read with a heart that desires to conform to God's Word, it does just that.Pollard begins by carefully defining Christian modesty in this way:\\"Christian modesty is the inner self-government, rooted in a proper understanding of one's self before God, which outwardly displays itself in humility and purity from a genuine love for Jesus Christ, rather than in self-glorification or self-advertisement. Christian modesty then will not publicly expose itself in sinful nakedness.\\" (pg. 22)The first few chapters deal with the history of clothing, and modesty in general. Pointing to God as the \\"Originator and Designer of clothing\\" (pg. 23), he looks to several biblical examples which, he says indicate \\"the purpose and function of clothing and the approximate area of the body that clothes were designed to cover.\\" (pg. 23) He uses these examples (ranging from the good nakedness of man at creation, to the need for covering man's shame after the fall, to priestly garments, to the clothing that Christ himself wore on earth, to the robes of those already in Heaven) to illustrate that while Scripture may not offer a black-and-white command in regards to style of dress, \\"It appears then that the Bible does offer us a standard for covering the body....The Old and New Testaments reveal that God's earthly and heavenly people wore garments that covered them from at least the neck-to-below the knee.\\" (pg. 28)Using this principle (of covering the body from the neck-to-below the knee) as a guide, the rest of the book deals specifically with the evolution of modern swimwear, and how it is connected to our changing perceptions of modesty and immodesty.\\"Exposing the male or female body, which should be covered, is out of harmony with the Biblical model. Moreover, since exposing the privates is shameful, it seems obvious that clothing which emphasizes or purposely draws attention to these areas of the body is likewise shameful and immodest. And modern swimwear is the epitome of these things - by design.\\" (pg. 34)He carefully chronicles, using mainly secular sources, how swimwear fashions have changed throughout recent decades. Through his descriptions, he easily points out how, with each new season, swimsuits have become increasingly more revealing. \\"The metamorphosis of the bathing suit forced our society to reassess its views of modesty.\\" (pg. 42)Throughout the book, Pollard challenges areas that most Christians (pastors, teachers, and lay-people alike) view as \\"Christian liberty\\" or \\"a thing indifferent.\\" (pg. 47) And, he asks his readers to honestly assess and consider the dichotomy we have created in which \\"people who sit in church on Sunday decrying public immorality, while remaining unaware that the garment they will wear to the next retreat would have landed them in jail for nakedness a few decades ago!\\" (pg. 47)First on his list of \\"Christian liberties,\\" beach trips, water parks, and backyard swim parties - all common, and seemingly \\"innocent\\" summertime destinations for church youth groups (and others) around the country. But, he points out that 60 years ago, a woman wearing what is now considered by many (within the church, especially) to be a \\"modest\\" one-piece bathing suit would have been arrested for indecent exposure. (pg. 47) Yet, many pastors, youth workers, and parents promote, and even encourage these activities in the name of evangelism or spiritual encoragement. But, Pollard poses a question that should be given careful thought and consideration:\\"Given that modern swimsuits were designed to promote public nakedness and remain the most revealing form of clothing, why do so many Christians wear them in mixed company and encourage their young people to do so?\\" (pg. 45)He also addresses another area often classified under \\"Christian liberty\\" - the media, specifically television and movies. \\"The media's impact in selling nakedness to the American public is difficult to exaggerate. Although the printed page once exerted considerable power of men's minds, cinema and television dramatically eclipsed it.\\" (pg. 57) Hollywood is certainly not neutral in this battle against immodesty. It wields great influence in the way people think about fashion, style, and has long been a factor in the \\"sex sells\\" mentality.While most lay the burden of responsibility for modesty on the woman, Pollard boldly makes the following statement (forgive the long quote, but I think it makes the point quite clearly),\\"Guilt for this decaying and debauched state must not be laid entirely at the feet of women, as it often is. The problem lies squarely wit the men in the pulpits and homes of this nation. With the near dissolution of Christian manhood in this century, American males have become feminized sex-worshipers who do not lead, but are led. They have followed their silver-screen icons into nudity, and not the purity of Jesus Christ. Had they followed the God of holiness and governed their hearts and eyes as instructed by God's Word, the present lascivious culture simply would not and could not exist.\\" (pg. 59)Men are responsible before God for controlling their eyes, and guarding their hearts, and minds. While the blame may not lay exclusively with the women, they are also responsible before God for their actions. Women need to carefully examine their heart and their motives in their dress. Though a particular mode of dress is not explicitly commanded, Scripture does contain clear principles for the purpose and function of clothing. And, as believers, we need to remember that it is not legalism to call brothers and sisters to obedience to God's Word.\\"Nevertheless, any who dare to speak against public nakedness are quickly decried as legalists, Pharisees, and - worst of all - fundamentalists. How pathetic that so many pulpits and youth groups today are governed by the desires of the women and children of the congregation, and not the Word of God.\\" (pg. 59, emphasis mine)Whether or not you agree with the content of this little book is between you and God. But, it will challenge your perceptions of Christian liberties and modern-day modesty. The tone of the book is an honest and direct look at the state of modesty, not only in our nation, but also our Christian churches and families. But, it is also a humble, passionate plea from the author for believers to return to a biblical way of thinking in the area of dress.I would highly recommend it to anyone (man or woman) seeking to develop biblical convictions on modesty."},{"Title":"Christian modesty and the public undressing of America","review":"I appreciated this book on modesty because it is an often over-looked subject among Christians. The book is really short (only 74 pages), and I wish that Pollard had gone into more exegesis on texts like Genesis 3.I thought the criticisms of the swimsuit industry were valid, but Pollard didn't offer any kind of solution to how a Christian female should dress if she wants to go swimming? Should we just avoid it all together in fear of causing men to stumble?Which brings me to another point. Pollard seems to place a lot of blame on Christian women for wearing clothes that cause men to stumble and on pastors who refuse to teach their congregations about modesty. On the other hand, he doesn't really place much blame on the men who give the women attention for wearing bikinis. What is a girl to do? As far as clothing options, she is already limited by the options availible. Women's jeans are always made to fit tight in the legs, it is hard to find shirts that aren't tight, a modest bathing suit doesn't exist (according to Pollard), the fashionable skirts are the short ones. Women my age don't wear these kind of clothes to stand out (at least at my age), but to fit in. I bring this up because Pollard believes that our clothes should draw unnecessary attention to ourselves.Overall, I am definately for modesty. My mom and sister even say I dress like a grandma most of the time, and I agreed with the major premises of this book. My only complaint is that the book is obviosly directed to men (with greater usage of masculine pronouns and more references to godly men and modesty), but it doesn't criticize the actions of the men as much as it does the women. Rather than go on and on about how a Christain woman shouldn't dress to cause a man to stumble; I think the book would have been more effective if he also stated that Christian men should stop giving attention to scantaly clad women. It really bothered me that he compared the issue as another incidence of Eve bringing Adam into sin. Men should stop expecting women to dress immodestly, and they should also stop objectifying women by referring to the images as \\"hot\\" to other men or in the ear-shot of women. Women do not dress immodestly because they like it, they usually do that because men want them to and its expected of them. Both men and women should work to fix the problem, and I believe Christian men are just as much to blame as Christian women and the fashion industry."},{"Title":"Christian modesty and the public undressing of America","review":"I purchased this book thinking that it would give a comprehensive overview of Biblical standards of modesty, and how Christians today can be faithful to those principals.Instead, I got a comprehensive overview of the history of the bathing suit.

It's interesting to see women on talk shows of any kind, but especally Christian ones, with skirts or dresses just below their knees, trying to set modestly, while looking uncomfortable in their attempts to do so. Dresses and skirts ride up and so should be flared enough and also long enough to be able to sit and even cross your legs comfortably. I think they should be about 2/3rds of the way down your leg.

At this point life itself, despite its glory, is in terrible danger of burning up in this high-noon of the political world. Putting this point less obliquely one might say, with Giorgio Agamben in his Homo Sacer, that a world which is increasingly concerned with ridding itself of any political value except that of serving the exigencies which are thrown up by the brute fact of maintaining biological human life is a world which is dangerously unstable. The danger may lie in either of two directions. The first is that the emergence of a strong political value which co-opts a vision of the importance of biological human life but redefines the borders of 'human' gains an immediate political legitimacy in 'cleansing' the political populace of what become cast as simply vermin. The second danger is that the lack of political value apart from life itself leaves a space wherin 'life itself' increasingly begs definition, and with this definition arrive categories of life regarded as less valuable and, ultimately, as 'life not worth living'. Both of these features can be recognised as elements of the political program of National Socialist Germany. Agamben, untypically, sees Nazi Germany not as a historical abberation, but rather as an extreme case of what characterises all Western political systems and which springs from 'politics' itself, rather than any particular playing out of a political scheme. This is the condition of 'biopolitics', the condition of life as valuable or not within an overall scheme of governance. This condition reaches its paradigm expression in 'the camp', where life is usable or expendable outside the restraints of any legal structure. The argumentation in this book is very complex and opaque. The reader is not helped by the fact that such central concepts as 'sacred' and 'biopolitics' are extensively reworked from the way in which they are generally used in social science literature at this time, without this fact being signposted or even acknowledged. Furthermore, the overall argument relies on a heady admixture of classical philosophy, politics, linguistics and ethology. The ground which is covered is galloped over, rather than taken at walking pace, and the whole trip is not for the faint-hearted. The novelty of the argument, however, which links liberal democracy to totalitarian government merits detailed examination in that it reanimates basic political theoretical discussion in a field which is in danger of stagnation around the notion of the victory of liberal democracy. The only other writer who is engaged in a similar task from a similar perspective of what might be termed 'Grand Political Theory', and with comparable intellectual resources, is Antonio Negri - another Italian left-wing scholar. These two writers mark an attempt to re-invent theoretical politics, and for anyone with a serious interest in this field Homo Sacer is necessary, if not easy, reading."},{"Title":"Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life (Meridian: Crossing Aesthetics)","review":"\\"Homo Sacer\\" proposes a succinct thesis: contemporary political regimes, including both liberal democracies and totalitarian governments, have increasingly relied on a juridical space that isolates and rules over the \\"bare life\\" (zoe) of their subjects. According to the author, the founding gesture of political sovereignty does not simply grant or restrict the rights of citizens, but wields an absolute power over the life and death of men. As the argument goes, today's biopolitical machinery betrays a hidden complicity with the most detestable forms of domination, exemplified by the Nazis during the Holocaust. Whilst many forms of contemporary sovereignty might seem benign compared to this singularly horrible event, these forms share with Nazism a tendency to expunge mediating political categories such as rights and contracts, and subject biological bodies to the immediate control of a sovereign.Reviving a forgotten subject of ancient Roman law, Agamben defines the homo sacer (sacred man) as a political unit that can be killed but not sacrificed. Anybody can terminate the life of the sacred man with impunity, and no worth can be conferred upon his being through a ritualistic sacrifice. Although the sacred man is not actually deceased, he inhabits an indeterminate ground between life and death because homicide laws do not apply to him. He lives a virtual death. His \\"being-toward-death\\" is not only ontologically implicit but juridically authorized.The figure that completes this grim picture is the sovereign, who may at any time call for a \\"state of exception.\\" That is, he may suspend the laws of the land and thus produce a collective of sacred men who occupy a threshold between nature and civilization. Paradoxically, the sacred men are included in a new juridical sphere to the very degree that they are abandoned by the law. With this insight, Agamben subverts the conventional understanding of Hobbes' state of nature. The state of nature does not designate the status of men prior to the advent of political rule. Politics, rather, incorporates the state of nature into its very essence; the setting of Hobbes' \\"war of all against all\\" becomes the very terrain on which biopolitical authority is exercised. In Agamben's scheme, there is no chaotic life outside the scope of political sovereignty. On the contrary, sovereignty is sustained by this \\"zone of indistinction\\" between law and order on the one hand, and violence and chaos on the other.Like his intellectual precursors Benjamin, Heidegger and Arendt, Agamben seeks to demonstrate the relevance of seemingly outmoded texts to contemporary political and cultural phenomena. Agamben persuasively illustrates the contemporary manifestation of one attribute of the sovereign/sacred man pair: the sovereign's capacity to kill without being punished and, correlatively, the sacred man's potential exposure to this injustice. I believe Agamben fails, however, to unfold the implications of the other aspect of homo sacer's being, that is, his inability to be sacrificed.From a contemporary vantage, homo sacer's \\"unsacrificeable\\" character seems not simply irrelevant, but downright erroneous. The stringency of Agamben's ancient paradigm precludes an analysis of the insidious logic of sacrifice operative today. Because Agamben detects sacrifice exclusively within the boundaries of religious ceremony, he is unable to discern the manner in which secular political ideology both reinforces the sacrificeablity of the subject and renders him utterly disposable. Agamben tells us \\"that the Jews were exterminated not in a mad and giant holocaust but exactly as Hitler had announced, \`as lice,' which is to say, as bare life. The dimension in which the extermination took place is neither religion nor law, but biopolitics.\\" But this dichotomy--between the event of the collective sacrifice on the one hand and the banalized process of extermination on the other--is less stable than Agamben implies. \\"Sacrifice\\" functions as a convenient catchword by which the sovereign may, paradoxically, reduce the subject to bare life while recuperating a sense of purpose and meaning in the midst of mass slaughter. (Thus, Truman was able to write, \\"I think the sacrifice of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was urgent and necessary for the prospective welfare of both Japan and the Allies.\\") Within the scope of a dubious utilitarian calculus, sacrifice is deemed an investment for a \\"better future.\\" In this sense, sacrificeability does not mitigate or contradict the sacred man's \\"capacity to be killed,\\" but makes this capacity seem both palatable and redemptive. While we are beyond an epoch in which religious sacrifice is pervasively practiced, sacrifice is nonetheless transposed into a secular key and thereby used to justify a wide range of biopolitical crimes.Although this may seem like a minor flaw in this text, it gestures toward Agamben's larger shortcoming, that is, his inability to buttress his most provocative claim: that we, today, collectively embody the ancient figure of homo sacer. His enumeration of contemporary states of exception toward the end of the book does little to remedy this problem. For instance, he squeezes \\"military interventions on humanitarian grounds\\" into his conceptual model of the state of exception not by demonstrating a structural coincidence between homo sacer and the subjects involved in contemporary warfare, but by making an unconvincing appeal to \\"an undecidability between politics and biology.\\" Agamben is at his weakest when adducing such platitudes of deconstruction and passing them off as argument. While the reader cheers for his attempts to graft the structure of ancient Roman law onto the contemporary political landscape, these lines of thought run up against the same impasse, at which Agamben invariably resorts to specious analogical thinking.Since I haven't read Agamben's entire oeuvre, I'm in no position to comment on the extent to which he has corrected this defect in subsequent publications. But in this book, at least, it is conspicuous. So, while \\"Homo Sacer\\" advances a strikingly original thesis, it leaves the reader wishing this critical point had been proven and not merely proclaimed."},{"Title":"Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life (Meridian: Crossing Aesthetics)","review":"The obscurity embedded in the Roman Law that declared one who was condemned to death &quot;sacred&quot; is never really clarified here. It is better and more succinctly described in _Means Without Ends_.In this is book, Agamben soberly traces the origin of the single most deracinating event in human history: the Holocaust. Soberly, because Agamben sees the Holocaust not as an anomaly, but as an unavoidable consequence given the political origin of the West. But this book is not so much about the Holocaust per se, but about the various historical interventions concerning the notion of the Sovereign that wove the matrix of Western politics into what it became capable of in the 20th century.The locus of Agamben's view of modernity is the (concentration) camp. Agamben stresses the fact that the camp is not only a place where the unspeakable takes place but more importantly and fundamentally where a human being is stripped &quot;Naked&quot;, stripped of 'bios' and exposed as mere 'zoe', such that anything--including the unspeakable--CAN be done to him since nothing could be considered a criminal act. The camp, according to Agamben, is &quot;the space that opens up when the state of exception starts to become the rule.&quot;Agamben argues that the camp is the new biopolitical NOMOS of the planet by connecting the dots that Carl Schmitt first drew but left unconnected. Closer to the homefront, Agamben's meditation ultimately takes us to see the totalitarian implications behind those &quot;gated communities&quot; in the US today, and the impossibility of dying without the State's approval. If a good life is hinged on the hope of a good death, should the State define and decide who shall get &quot;good death&quot; (euthanasia)?"},{"Title":"Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life (Meridian: Crossing Aesthetics)","review":"I'm responding to the reader from Korea below who requested a more concise explanation of why the homo sacer can be killed but not sacrificed. I haven't read this book, but I have read two articles (&quot;Form-of-Life&quot; and &quot;Beyond Human Rights&quot;) by Agamben in the collection edited by Paolo Virno and Michael Hardt called Radical Thought in Italy: A Potential Politics (University of Minnesota Press, 1996). These are excellent, concise articles which I recommend without reservation, and may be a good introduction to the &quot;homo sacer.&quot;Agamben writes: &quot;Inasmuch as the refugee, an apparently marginal figure, unhinges the old trinity of State-nation-territory, it deserves instead to be regarded as the central figure of our political history. We should not forget that the first camps were built in Europe as spaces for controlling refugees, and that the succession of internment camps - concentration camps - extermination camps represents a perfectly real filiation. One of the few rules the Nazis constantly obeyed throughout the course of the 'final solution' was that Jews and Gypsies could be sent to extermination camps only after having been fully denationalized (that is, after they had been stripped of even that second-class citizenship to which they had been relegated after the Nuremberg laws). When their rights are no longer the rights of the citizen, that is when humans are tuly sacred, in the sense that this term used to have in ancient Roman law: doomed to death.&quot;"},{"Title":"Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life (Meridian: Crossing Aesthetics)","review":"Agamben's sets up his work in the left-open space of Foucault's work, the void in which \\"subjectivization\\" (the internalization of the order into the individual psyche)and police/political strategies might intersect. It is this void that Agamben desires to write, a (non)place in which \\"life\\" is incorporated into the political order. Agamben goes about this by beginning with a reading of Greek and Roman philosophical and poetic texts and weaving a continuity from these early works through the works of Thomas Hobbes, Carl Schmitt, and Jacques Derrida. The continuity he describes is that of sovereignty founded upon the \\"suspension\\" of \\"bare life.\\" \\"Life,\\" here, is \\"natural life,\\" natural being that element (like the referent in language) that is the always already included absence (or as Agamben calls it the \\"exclusive inclusion\\"). This relation of suspension also creates the possibility of the \\"state of exception,\\" a space in which the force of law is exerted outside of law.This state in which the law is outside of itself allows for a renewal of the force of law, it transforms the law through its absence. Such a process involves the creation of sacred life, the life that can be killed without sacrifice and without guilt. It is from here that Agamben takes a look at the concentration camp and comes to the conclusion that this exceptional state of political life is in fact the norm of our contemporary reality: the exception has become the rule. \\"Life\\" in modern times is the life in the camp, whether it be in a totalitarian regime or one of mass democracy.The strengths and faults of Agamben's lie in this continuity of sovereingty. On the one hand, it provides a discourse (indeed, a kind of meta-discourse) for placing philosophy and politics in relation to each other. It makes a poignant argument for the politicization of life as not merely a modern affair (as Foucault largely situates it) but, in fact, the founding moment of Western civilization, of the civis and the polis. However, this poignancy is also the achilles heel of Agamben's argument. Agamben's argument accounts for modernity as a \\"coming into light\\" of life's incorporation in politics. This subordination of modernity to a realization of what was already there is reductive to the point of excluding some of Foucault's most interesting insights into the diagramming (or beuraucratization) of life. In other words, much of Agamben's argument seems to derive its powers from excluding particularities. (This exclusion of particularities extends to a reductive reading of Derrida's \\"The Force of Law.\\")Don't get me wrong, Agamben's work is important, especially his considerations of Walter Benjamin and Aristotle. Like Benjamin, he raises the stakes. Revolution becomes not merely the transition of one state to another but an eradication of the state that must also involve a revolution of language. Like, Benjamin in his \\"Critique of Violence,\\" this transformation is ambiguous. Agamben locates it in the sphere of ontology's limits: the revolution will deconstruct the difference of world and person and of pure being and being. It will heal the fissure of life and politics that captures life in politics. Though this is a noble cause, it could certainly use elaboration, an elaboration that may not be possible within the reductive limits of Agamben's historicizing."},{"Title":"Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life (Meridian: Crossing Aesthetics)","review":"Agamben begins his inquiry into sovereignty in the light of the problematic left to contemporary political ontology via Hobbes, Schmitt, and up to Heidegger (Dasein being that being who's very being is always at stake for that being, and ontological difference), post Heideggerian political thought (Nancy, Lacoue-Labarthe, and Derrida) and finally Foucault's bio-politics. While Agamben's criticisms of these thinkers is brief (and somewhat reductive) it does serve the importance of situating his own conception of bio-politics, sovereignty and life as a radicalized \\"state of exception\\".The Logic of Sovereignty is not one of a mere inclusion of beings into a political sphere or form of life specific to it (bios) which emerges or is transformed from an originary bare life (zoe). Rather Sovereignty establishes itself as \\"sacred\\" or \\"set apart\\" from the polis. There is nothing legal about law, in that the very founding moment of political ontology is apolitical and extra-juridical (because there is no normative law that has been set up yet). Benjamin distinguishes between two forms of violence (constituting and constituted). However, while the Sovereign constituting power of law must claim to be wholly outside the law in order to have created it, it must also regulate and constitute its power through law itself, thus including itself within the law. The Paradox of Sovereignty then is that its life is an \\"inclusion through exclusion\\". The signifier of law is absent (or non-signifying form) but is signified through this very non-signification of absence.Homo Sacer then is the non-criminal criminal , the \\"extra-juridical\\" exception that is designated by the sovereign. The homo sacer can be legally killed by any person but is not a juridical killing. That is to say, killing the sacred human is not homicide nor is it sacrifice. The norm of political subjects are set against the exception of the homo sacer, but also included in the norm in its very opposition and ability to exile homo sacer. Agamben sees homo sacer and the sovereign to have this very inclusion by exception in common. Both the Sovereign and homo sacer can be killed but not sacrificed. (It is not a legal issue to kill a King but rather a heretical or anti-juridical one in this account). The Werewolf (half man and wolf inside the city and outside of it, man and animal, political and non-political) and the Sovereign, the inside and outside become an \\"indistinction\\" which no longer holds up for modern politics.The Camp is the modern political space or \\"coming to light\\" of this \\"indistinction\\" between nature and law in the form of bio-politics. Modern politics as bio-politics takes life as what is at stake for its own life. Bare life as the state of exception, or the sacred, now becomes the rule. As for homo sacer everyone was sovereign, for the sovereign everyone is homo sacer. \\"The Enemy\\" as constitutive outside to the norm of civil society now becomes the inside in a society as war carried out by other means (politics). Society as life itself is the \`enemy outside which is inside'. In fact, it was the rule from the inception of western politics. The camp then refers to the Nazi bio-political movement where law and fact are indistigusihable. The \\"suspension of law\\" and \\"states of emergency\\" are not purely juridical, and the holocaust cannot be understood in terms of law alone, but can only be understood as the indefinite suspension necessary for sovereign power to kill without crime, and without sacrifice.One of the strengths of Homo Sacer is that it is able to weave the problems of political ontology together with the historico-political configurations and aporias of Nazism/mythology/capitalism/ and statism. In a subtle way Agamben is challenging the whole of contemporary political ontology to begin to rethink politics in terms of (actual)potentiality: (Life). Bio-politics as the state of exception (as rule) is no longer oriented toward the impossibility of the law (as form of the law without signification) but is rather concerned with the form-of-life (as indistinction/exception). A political ontology that is not concerned with the impossibility of laying claim to bare life as such, or the fascist mobilization of its totality and implementation, but rather with the practical creation and proliferation of non-statist, non-hierarchical experimentations in political practices that would create new ways of living and maximize the diversity of lives that would decide these ways. Life as potentiality (never reducible to any given definition or determination (totalitarianism) always calls for the emergence of a new politics of the actual, pointing always to the inexustablity/infinity of Life itself.Critique of Agamben's somewhat reductive (although appropriate) critique of Heidigger, Battaille, Nancy, Derrida etc. aside for a moment, what remains a gapping hole in this work is the complete lack of eco-critical perspective on life. Almost every time Agamben speaks of life it is always in terms of a human life (a human political refugee, a proletariat, the life of a human political body, or a human sovereign king or people). It is his call for the creation of a people (resonances with Deleuze here) that he seems to close up his work on life. His very inquiry into the \`open' of Bare Life (potentiality) as always political (indistinction) is closed up through the work in his neglect of animal, plant, and non-organic life, and hierarchical (statist?) (almost humanist) privileging of the bios politicos of the human."},{"Title":"Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life (Meridian: Crossing Aesthetics)","review":"Agamben's best known work lives up to the hype.

Agamben here displays his mastery of the Greek, Roman, Judaic and modern traditions through his insight into the very heart of our modern understanding of the term \\"life.\\"Using a genealogical method, he traces our understanding of \\"life\\" back to a break between \\"bios\\" and \\"zoe\\" itself, a break that is to lead step-by-step, through a series of historical accidents and judicial decisions, eventually to genocide, concentration camps and the Jewish Holocaust in WWII. Believe it or not the roots of this human tragedy can be traced back to as early as Roman antiquity - a point that would have definitely made Heidegger raise his eyebrows.This has special significance in relation to the thoughts of Heidegger and Arendt and should provide a shock to those who still, despite our current political and economic crisis, believe that we live in an age of progress and Enlightenment."},{"Title":"Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life (Meridian: Crossing Aesthetics)","review":"The sacredness of life, which is invoked today as an absolute fundamental right in opposition to sovereign power, in fact entertains an intimate relation with sovereignty. The origins of the dogma of sacred life are shroud in mystery. Classical Greece, to which we owe most of our ethico-political concepts, not only ignored this principle but did not even possess a term to express the complex semantic sphere that we indicate with the single term \\"life\\". To the Romans, \\"the sacred man is the one whom the people have judged on account of a crime. It is not permitted to sacrifice this man, yet he who kills him will not be condemned for homicide.\\" Ancient Germanic Law was founded on the concept of peace (Fried) and the corresponding exclusion from the community of the wrongdoer, who therefore became friedlos, without peace, and whom anyone was permitted to kill without committing homicide. In Romance languages, the ban signifies both the sacred insignia of sovereignty and expulsion from the community.Life that cannot be sacrificed and yet may be killed is sacred life. By extension, the sovereign sphere is the sphere in which it is permitted to kill without committing homicide and without celebrating a sacrifice, and sacred life--life that may be killed but not sacrificed--is the life that has been captured in this sphere. Politics inevitably involves a sovereign decision that bans some individuals from the political and human communities. Not the act of tracing boundaries, but their cancellation by the sovereign ban, is the constitutive act of the city. The relation between the sacred man and the sovereign, the exile and the citizen, bare life and political existence, is more fundamental than the Schmittian opposition between friend and enemy, fellow citizen and foreigner.At the threshold of the modern era, bare life--the simple fact of living--begins to be included in the mechanisms and calculations of State power. This is what Michel Foucault designates by the term of biopolitics: the species and the individual as a simple living body become what is at stake in a society's political strategies, so that it becomes at once possible both to protect life and to authorize a holocaust. The politicization of bare life constitutes the decisive event of modernity and signals a radical transformation of the political categories of classical thought. Carl Schmitt's definition of sovereignty (\\"Sovereign is he who decides on the state of exception\\") is combined to Foucault's concept of biopolitics to open the possibility of a situation of unlimited power where the state of exception has become permanent and human beings are reduced to a condition of ultimate abjection. Here is how Agamben sums up his argument in one key passage:\\"Only because politics in our age had been entirely transformed into biopolitics was it possible for politics to be constituted as totalitarian politics to a degree hitherto unknown\\". Moreover, \\"only because biological life and its needs had become the politically decisive fact, is it possible to understand the otherwise incomprehensible rapidity with which twentieth-century parliamentary democracies were able to turn into totalitarian states and with which this century's totalitarian states were able to be converted, almost without interruption, into parliamentary democracies...Once their fundamental referent becomes bare life, traditional political distinctions (such as those between Right and Left, liberalism and totalitarianism, private and public) lose their clarity and intelligibility and enter into a zone of indistinction...From this perspective, the camp--as the pure, absolute, and impassable biopolitical space (insofar as it is founded solely on the state of exception)--will appear as the hidden paradigm of the political space of modernity, whose metamorphoses and disguises we will have to learn to recognize.\\"Without denying the brilliance and fecundity of Agamben's insights, I am left with several issues that underscore either important shortcomings in the author's reasoning, or limitations in my own reading that I will be all too ready to confess. First, Agamben's reliance on etymology tends to substitute for both historical analysis and philosophical argument. This is a feature Agamben shares with Heidegger, the philosopher who has probably had the most formative role in his thought. He rejects the theory of the ambivalence of the sacred (meaning both august and accursed, pure and impure) that runs from Durkheim to Benveniste, from Freud to Bataille, as based on failed interpretations by now discredited scholars. But it is not clear why his own understanding of homo sacer--he who may be killed but not sacrificed--, based on a single occurrence in Pompeius Festus, trumps the other interpretation he dismisses as a scientific mythologeme.Second, Agamben shares with Foucault, his other main source of inspiration, a certain hyperbole, punctuating sober descriptions with lyrical flights into sublimity. He notes that Foucault kept clear of addressing the politics of the great totalitarian states of the twentieth century, and that \\"the inquiry that began with a reconstruction of the grand enfermement in hospitals and prisons did not end with an analysis of the concentration camp.\\" But as Dominick LaCapra rightly argues, there may be good reasons to eschew messianic tones and histrionic hyperbole when addressing the unnameable sufferings of the victims of Nazi extermination.Third, the hyperbolic rhetoric leads to a postapocalyptic perspective of ethical meltdown, a grey zone of indistinction where all preexisting normative and legal orders are suspended. Agamben sees the Schmittian state of exception as generalized or rampant in the post-Auschwitz world, and this perspective allows him to assert that the camp is the hidden matrix and nomos of the political space in which we are still living. According to this extreme contention, Auschwitz is now everywhere, including in \\"the zones d'attente in French international airports in which foreigners asking for refugee status are detained.\\" There is something profoundly disturbing in the blurring of all legal and ethical categories that can lead to such absurd statements."},{"Title":"Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life (Meridian: Crossing Aesthetics)","review":"A brilliant, probing, though methodologically suspect work of political ontology that seeks to interrogate the origins and causes of biopolitics in the modern world. Agamben traverses enormous swaths of history with the acumen of a true Renaissance man--his handling of the emergence of the concept of \\"sacred\\" life in Rome is particularly skillful and well researched. However, Agamben begins his search with an investigation of the Ancient Greeks--he identifies an originary split and privileging within the concepts of \\"life.\\" That is, there is an historical disjunction between bios and zoe--the latter of which will turn out to be affixed to the notion of \\"bare life\\" which will turn out to reemerge in a new form in the era of biopolitics, with the concentration camps as its undeniable nadir. Classical scholars still dispute the usage of \\"bios\\" and \\"zoe\\" respectively, and it is not so clear from the historical record that there ever was such a privileging of one over the other with respect to political life. Even if the distinction were true without qualification there is a kind of conceptual determinism that vitiates the plausibility of Agamben's historical methodology. Nevertheless, this book is a fascinating work of speculative political thought--it takes the advances regarding power Foucault had developed and pushes them into more significant regions."},{"Title":"Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life (Meridian: Crossing Aesthetics)","review":"Although this is one of the more important books on sovereignty & biopolitics to come out in the last 30 years, Agamben's writing is needlessly incomprehensible. It's not fun and he doesn't seem to care if the reader will be understand or not. D&G;, so much fun to read. Foucault, dry, but so concerned that readers will get it. Agamben, dry, boring--except for his occasional apocalyptic hysterics--and unclear.Be prepared to look up random Latin phrases. Be prepared to go back and read Hiedegger, Schmitt, Benjamin, Deleuze, Foucault, Freud, Nancy, Kant, Derrida. He gives short mentions (one might say reductive, judging from the ones I'm a little more familiar with) to works by those kids, draws out complex concepts from them without explaining them thoroughly.I don't know if he is actually a hack or if his writing just needs more patience than I have given it. Either way, if you try to trudge through it, it'll make you work your brain, which is never a bad thing."},{"Title":"Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life (Meridian: Crossing Aesthetics)","review":"This book is a key text in the work of Giorgio Agamben and holds a special place in the growing cult surrounding him today, but like Remnants of Auschwitz that follows it, is deeply flawed and must be read with caution. Certainly worth reading, but not to be approached uncritically (as on display in the review below). D. LaCapra has recently written a cogent critique of Agamben's appropriation of the standpoint of the victims, essentially robbing them of their own voices and conflating their position with that of the perpetrators's in what Primo Levi termed the \\"grey zone\\", simply to further his own discourse (albeit an original one) on the Sublime (what LaCapra calls the \\"Traumatic Sublime\\"). Look for LaCapra (and a growing number of critics focusing upon Agamben's work, which is one of the latest fads in Academia) to balance this text. By all means read it; but maintain a critical distance (again, unlike the slavish \\"review\\" below, which is an attack on William Haver in the guise of an engagement with Agamben).To the author of that mean-spirited review (obviously a former, disgruntled student of Haver's--and since I have encountered so few in my long acquaintance with him, I have a feeling I know who it is), I simply respond: Haver is anything but a \\"career academic writing for tenure\\" (he already has it) and his thinking, teaching and writing are an inspiration. I agree with the earlier review lauding his work and placing him, rightfully, alongside Hardt and Negri, et al. At any rate, beware Agamben's reading of the Muselmann in Remnants in Auschwitz, which is the logical outcome of his original, but flawed, thesis in Homo Sacer."},{"Title":"Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life (Meridian: Crossing Aesthetics)","review":"I was first introduced to this text in one of my college courses. I'm not quite familiar with all of Agamben's theory on power, but I have read portions of, \\"The Camp as Biopolitical Paradigm of the Modern.\\" This text I found to be weighty and at times difficult to read, but it sparked an interest in me to read more. I would like to contribute to the reviews with a simple interpretation of a few things that I read.I'm intrigued with Agamben's idea of how society creates the category of the devalued through the category of the valued. An example of this categorical sorting is how the Nazis created this category of the devalued with the Jewish people, thus raising their own status of the valued. The Nazis were able to gain control/domination through the use of their concentration camps. By labeling others in society as lower than oneself, one can easily determine whether one's life is worth keeping around.Another interesting point is how one's body/identity doesn't belong to that person, but rather the government and society owns that body. An example is of the creation of our American society, which came about through the killing of the Native Americans and bringing in of Slaves to further gain land and power. By controlling and taking over the body, the new America was created. It's fascinating to think of one's identity and body as one with the nation/government through citizenship, yet there are many examples within our own American society. America has taken citizenship away and than contradicted itself to ask the non-citizen to contribute to our causes (i.e. \\"war\\" or \\"economy\\"). An example of this control over citizenship is related to the Japanese-American internment camps during WWII. Once in these camps, Japanese-Americans' rights as a citizen were taken, than the government asked if they would fight for America. Thus the Japanese-Americans would have to prove themselves worthy of being a citizen/body of the United States of America."},{"Title":"Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life (Meridian: Crossing Aesthetics)","review":"Easily described as an extension, or 'elastication', of Foucault's critique of biopower, the life-giving, sustaining power of the contemporary state, and how it has grown up, from its very roots, as the primary term of sovereignty (the power of \\"auctoritas,\\" to command authority and originate the law) in the West, finally to take on its present project of attempting to stretch itself over all of life and cement the control society. The book stands well alongside comtemporary criticism of global capitalism, including the work of Slavoj Zizek and Negri & Hardt. But on another level, this is much more than a gloss on Foucault's analysis of power. Agamben's perspective is different from Foucault's, he's uninterested in lengthy, sweeping archaeologies, although he does delve into the history of language and the law in some detail. Subsequent parts in the Homo Sacer series and the book \\"State of Exception\\" give even more depth to the work, and connect it to the enormous tightening up of government and legal controls since 9/11."},{"Title":"Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life (Meridian: Crossing Aesthetics)","review":"Agaben has had quite some impact in the English speaking world, since publication of this book (along withRemnants of Auschwitzand the collection of essaysPotentialities). Is the impact he has had warranted by his writings?Well, one can see why his work appeals to some. The problem is that in this book and its companion, Remnants of Auschwitz, which is supposed to offer phenomenological support for the theoretical claims of Homo Sacer, Agamben fails to deliver.As Phil Hutchinson points out in hisShame and PhilosophyAgamben's theory rests upon on a flawed theory of meaning, whereby he gives an etymologically biased rendering of Derrida's notion of Deconstruction. Now, one can stay agnostic as to the merits or otherwise of Derrida (See Chapter Two of Hutchinson for a critique of Derrida) but Agamben's rendition of Deconstruction comes close to committing the genetic fallacy, by appealing to the genesis of concepts (\\"guilt\\" as originating in Roman jurisprudence is one example) so as to determine their meaning. Surely, even in Derrida's terms, this is problematic, simply replacing one philosophy of presence with another.This book is difficult, and that gives it an air of profundity. Don't be misled. It is, I submit, not profound.There is a live debate in analytic philosophy as to whether or not Derrida had anything of genuine originality and importance to say about meaning (see Section Five of Chapter Two ofHutchinson); however, even if one is inclined to argue that he did one would still have something of a task claiming that Agamben has anything of value to contribute to such debates. For, despite claiming to build upon Derrida's insights, Agamben seems to miss the point Derrida is trying to make. So, whether one is a Derridean or not, whether one is sympathetic to the project of Deconstruction or not, I think one will find this book ultimately deeply flawed. If you've read it and you don't find it so, please read Hutchinson'sShame and Philosophyand let us all now your thoughts then."},{"Title":"Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life (Meridian: Crossing Aesthetics)","review":"I bought this book for my class.

His writings are difficult, with many references to Lacan. But in reality, his arguments -- his interventions -- can often stand without the support of Lacanian analyses. I know this because I was a student of his at Binghamton University (SUNY).As his student, I read Negri a full 10 years before the publication of 'Empire', and I've recently noticed that his teaching has generated at least one successful American academic specialist on Negri, as well as specialists in other very original areas of study.The name of this exceptional teacher, thinker and scholar is William Haver. He publishes in Japan as well as the U.S. Most of his publications consist of articles and essays in journals and anthologies. But he does have a book available here at Amazon and other major stores -- 'The Body of This Death: Historicity and Sociality in the Time of AIDS' Stanford University Press. December 1996.

That's on his conclusion that the world has become a death camp. When it comes to the political sacred, this is mostly right on.

Rudolph Tanzi and Ann Parson have put together an interesting and entertaining book on a very serious subject, Alzheimer's Disease. The book takes you from Tanzi's graduation from University of Rochester to his graduation with a PHD in neurogenetics from Harvard University, to the early days of his research to the present. Decoding Darkness is a must read for anyone's family who has been afflicted with this horrible disease to anyone who is interested in the fascinating world of research and the &quot;heroes&quot; such as Rudolph Tanzi who dedicate their lives to cure these deadly diseases."},{"Title":"Decoding Darkness: The Search For The Genetic Causes Of Alzheimer's Disease","review":"This is an excellent book on Alzheimer's research. It covers almost all aspects of interest in the field including genetics, molecular biology, drug discovery and clinical characteristics. The history of the various different discoveries is compellingly narrated and full of little anecdotes and sidelines, which makes the subject so much more fascinating and brings you very close to the people actively (and passionately) involved in all major advancements. In addition, the authors took great care to explain the complex biological processes and interactions of Alzheimer's disease using everyday English, avoiding scientific terminology whenever possible. This makes the book a highly enjoyable read not only for scientists and clinicians, but also - and especially - for the interested lay audience. It's a prime example that science writing does not have to be dry, dull and incomprehensible, but can be as exciting as reading a detective story: once you've started you just want to learn more and more and cannot stop until you have reached the last page. I can highly recommend 'Decoding Darkness' for everyone who is interested in how scientists from all over the world have been engaged in solving the many mysteries and riddles that lie behind this devastating disease."},{"Title":"Decoding Darkness: The Search For The Genetic Causes Of Alzheimer's Disease","review":"&quot;Decoding Darkness&quot; by Rudolph E. Tanzi, Ph.D. and science writer,. Ann B. Parson, is a very thought-provoking book. Tanzi is the Director of the Genetics and Aging Research Unit of the Harvard University Medical School. This book reads like a detective story of the author's view of the neurogenetic research leading up to a possibly effective vaccine that we hope will prevent and even may cure Alzheimer's Disease [AD].To set the stage for the timeliness of the book, I report that the World Alzheimer Congress 2000, of July 9-18 was held in Washington, DC. In a plenary session Dr. Dale Schenk presented a pivotal paper on Elan Pharmaceuticals' new vaccine. He stated that the vaccine is &quot; a disease-modifying therapy that appears in reach. Indeed A-beta modulation may enable physicians, patients, and caregivers to look to the future with optimism and hope&quot;.In the preface we learn that Tanzi is a founder of Prana Biotechnology, Genoplex and Neurogenetics. He has equity in Elan Pharmaceuticals and Bristol-Myers-Squibb.It is hoped that the Elan vaccine will decrease beta-amyloid production in the brain by blocking gamma secretase, an enzyme that separates beta-amyloid from a larger protein and releases it into the brain. So far Elan has completed the FDA Phase I drug trial for safety. There is no way to predict how the Phase II trial for efficacy will work clinically on humans. It had been tested on transgenic mice.Dr.Tanzi's style of writing presupposes that the reader has been schooled in the field of neurogenetics.To help the layperson, it is imperative to develop a glossary of at least 100 or more terms. Phrases such as cholinesterase inhibitor, beta-amyloid and gamma secretase, etc. must be understood to better appreciate this book. Therefore I am providing a minimal glossary, at least of those terms found in this book review for laypersons . Please see below.Throughout the book, credit is given to George Glenner, a scientist who spent many years at the National Institute of Health [NIH] and since 1980 has been at UCSD [La Jolla,Ca.]. On May 16, 1984, Drs. Glenner and Cai'ne Wong published a paper on their breakthrough in isolating brain amyloid beta peptide. I believe that since their first meeting in 1988, Glenner had a profound influence in Tanzi's career.Dr.Tanzi gives us an insight into the seminal work of Dr.Dmitry Goldgaber, formerly of N.I.H. Dr.Goldgaber had been on the staff of Nobel Laureate Charlton Gajdusek. He now is a Professor of Psychiatry at SUNY-Stony Brook Medical School and is Chair of the LIAF Scientific Advisory Board. Tanzi writes of Goldgaber that &quot;His team had isolated a portion of Alzheimer's amyloid, it was on chromosome 21, and here was the DNA sequence as proof.&quot; He reported this at the 16th annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in November 1986. He described the APP gene. &quot;APP&quot; stands for Amyloid Precursor Protein. It is the precursor of the amyloid protein that is deposited in the AD brain. Tanzi attended this meeting. In the February, 1987 issue of SCIENCE, Tanzi and Harvard colleagues wrote a paper describing the isolation of the amyloid gene. This was a very exciting time!The author credits Dr. Peter Davies of the Albert Einstein School of Medicine as having &quot;clinched the cholinergic evidence&quot;. Davies also provided the lasting value of revealing that tangles were only &quot;the tip of the iceberg of a very widespread tau-related abnormality&quot; that begins far earlier in the disease process. He still believes in this theory. I had wished that the book had made a detailed comparison of the tau versus the amyloid theory.The book in several chapters refers to the work of Dr. Peter St.George-Hyslop, now at the University of Toronto and his research on a major early onset AD mutant gene in chromosome 14. In 1995Aricept [Pfizer] an FDA appoved cholinesterase inhibitor, is only briefly mentioned in the book. There are about three years of studies by Pfizer showing the efficacy of this drug in delaying the symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease [AD]. The author does not mention most of the new medicines in the AD research &quot;pipeline&quot;, such as Reminyl [ Phase III], Memantine [ Phase III at NYU Medical Center] and Cerebrolysin [Phase III in Canada] Also not referred to is Neotrofin [Neotherapeutics], a neotrophic growth factor medicine [ Phase II b]. Many of these show promise for AD help and may receive FDA approval in the next year or two, or sooner.The anti-amyloid-beta drugs discussed in the author's last chapter claim to hold much promise for AD patients, but they may be many years away from FDA approval.&quot;Decoding Darkness&quot; is a highly technical book that imparts much information on an aspect of Alzheimer's Disease, and with some serious study of terminology is an engrossing publication. Dr.Tanzi's book has an excellent index, which among other items provides the names of over 165 notable researchers in the field of AD. One can obtain MEDLINE abstracts of many of these scholars' works by accessing PubMed at URL&lt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.gov/PubMed. This book requires intense concentration to comprehend. However, the information gleaned from it is well worth the effort. REVIEWER'S GLOSSARY[1] Beta- amyloid is a protein derived from a larger precursor protein and is a component of brain tangles and plaques characteristic of AD. [2] Cholinesterase is an enzyme that breaks down a neurotransmitter vital to proper brain functioning. [3] Chromosome is one of the usual elongated bodies in a cell nucleus that contains most or all of the DNA comprising the genes. [4] Beta-secretase and gamma-secretase are two proteases [enzymes which hydrolyze proteins] that cleave amyloid protein, producing amyloid peptide. [5] Modulation means to regulate or modify a natural process in the body. [6] Neurogenetics is a branch of genetics dealing with the nervous system and its development. [7] Neurotrophic factors: [A] Nerve Growth Factor [NGF] is essential to the development and maintenance of peripheral as well as central neurons. [B] Neutrophin-3 stimulates nerve growth in different populations of neurons than NGF. [C] Fibroblast Growth Factor, basic [bFGF] is important for the initiation of nerve repair after injury and promotes proliferation of immature neurons. bFGF is the neotrophic factor that causes multiplication of neurons. [8] tau protein may have been found by staining brain tangles with antibodies. Researchers have doggedly stuck with this lesion and are realizing that the tangle sub-unit resembled a modified form of a protein called tau . [9] Transgenic mice are mice whose genomes are manipulated in such a way that they either have an extra copy of a gene or one of theirs is removed. These mice are widely used now in biomedical research, including that in Alzheimer's Disease."},{"Title":"Decoding Darkness: The Search For The Genetic Causes Of Alzheimer's Disease","review":"Decoding Darkness provides not only the scientific facts about what is known about Alzheimer's disease, but also the historical aspects behind it. This book is a very interesting book to read. I thought it would be another textbook-like format explaining about Alzheimer's disease, but it was more like a detective novel developing into the current state of Alzheimer's disease research in reality.

Tanzi's adult life has clearly been dedicated to the search for the causes of Alzheimer's disease, and his single-minded drive comes through in every page. It is fascinating to learn how passion rules not just art and performance professions, but also (perhaps even to a greater degree) scientific research. The fun, excitement and committment of Tanzi and his colleagues in their pursuit of this disease is related with candor and vividness, and is truly accessible to the lay audience. Tanzi and Parsons have successfully spanned both art (music), philosophy (taoism) and science (genetics) with admirable elan. The book has its biases, but the authors do not hide the autobiographical nature of the narrative. Science might also be written by the victors, and Tanzi and his brilliant team of scientists deserve to record their history, since their contributions have changed the world we live in. The book ends with a vision that this previously hopeless disease will be conquered within our lifetimes. This is a fascinating, and exhilirating perpective. I recommend this book to all science readers with great enthusiasm."},{"Title":"Decoding Darkness: The Search For The Genetic Causes Of Alzheimer's Disease","review":"Tanzi and Parson tell a fascinating story of medical discovery with great excitement and clarity. The science was not sugar coated, but was very clearly explained and written in a very literary and often amusing manner. The descriptions of the human genome project in this book were in many ways superior to those that have appeared in books prepared specifically on the topic. My interest in this book was prompted not so much from an interest in Alzheimers disease but originally came from a recommendation from a friend who actively reads books about the human genome revolution and gene research. After reading the book, I would definitely agree with her opinion that no other book in the genre explains the goals behind the human genome project (and especially how they relate to disease based research) as well as &quot;Decoding Darkness&quot;. Also, the story of the family with inherited Alzheimers that runs parallel with the main story about the research was quite touching and provided a very nice break the excitement and hustle and bustle of the research discoveries described. Overall, I would have to say this is one of the best science genre books I have ever read...maybe the best after &quot;The Double Helix&quot;. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"},{"Title":"Decoding Darkness: The Search For The Genetic Causes Of Alzheimer's Disease","review":"This book provides a rare opportunity.

The authors have a tough time finding the right level of detail for the scientific information they present - for the scientist I assume this book would be of little interest or use as it is pretty &quot;toned-down,&quot; but the various nuances of the different technical research approaches can be a little dense for the non-scientist. However, for anyone who has a family member with the disease, this book may be inspiring as to how far the current state of research has come. It also may be disheartening as much about the disease is still unknown.The authors do a reasonably good job of being impartial and describing the various players and competing theories surrounding AD. However, they can't seem to completely avoid pointing out their various awards, honors and victories, which seemed a bit self-serving at times.Although the writing is sometimes choppy, there are some priceless vignettes that stick in the reader's mind. One example is the story of a researcher who flew all the way from the U.S. to a scientific conference in a remote town in Italy with his research results stuffed away into a pocket in order to avoid being scooped.

A good reference if you're traveling to Hawaii and want some fundamental information."},{"Title":"Surfing Hawaii","review":"This is one for the coffee table. Cheap, and well worth a minor investment.

The shipping was fast, the description of the books condition was spot on."},{"Title":"Surfing Hawaii","review":"Bank Wright's guide to Hawaiian surf spots touches upon some nice areas, and has a few pleasant PC poems, but ultimately falls short of telling it how it really is. How many times do we need to be warned about dangerous reefs and riptides? Maybe he should have just given this warning once at the beginning and left it at that. But his south shore Oahu map is pretty thorough, and in a few other zones he does find (like a bumbler) some good spots. Overall though, he misses more than he finds, and thus 'Surfing Hawaii' is ultimately blind. If comments such as these upset you- let me ask you, where are the islands of Molokai and Lanai? Overlooking surf spots is excusable- as there are many in the Hawaiian Islands, but calling a book 'Surfing Hawaii' and then excluding two out of five ISLANDS? That seems gravely incomplete, does it not? And I know what you are thinking- &quot;Yea well Molokai and Lanai don't have a lot of good spots.&quot; Yeah well from my experiencing scoring on those two islands, there are enough good spots to include in his guide, backwater locals or not. I mean, if Bank is going to hype up places like Tonggs and the east side of Oahu, the least he could do is mention Manele point on Lanai. So I found his poems touching; as for his guide to the waves- not too deep. His 'Surfing California', however, is worth five stars."},{"Title":"Holden's Performance","review":"Rampant postmodernism, yet highly unusual, inspiring and deeply intelligent. Murray Bail is weird! He must be! He has taken Australian cultural theory and run away with it. His irreverence towards the whole herd of Australian sacred cows is hilarious and yet written from a well informed historical standpoint. Through humour, he deconstructs the Menzies era and indeed the whole Americanisation of the country from the second World War into the sixtees. Bail also sees the effect that town planning has on its citizens. His description of Canberra is highly informative, downright cynical and yet a real scream. He sees through the sterility of the concentric circles and dead ends of Canberra and associates this strongly with the political mentality of our leaders, who of course, lead us around in circles and up blind alleys! I would recommend this novel to anyone interested in cultural theory, or indeed, anyone interested in an unusually honest and very funny deconstruction of the Menzies era. My only reservation is that the novel is perhaps a little lengthy, given the subject material. Nevertheless, it is well worth a read.

There are a plethora of nice, costly Tang Soo Do/Soo Bahk Do/Moo Duk Kwan manuals available today. Virtually all of these fancy hardcover tomes range from 50.00 to upwards of 100.00, and don't contain much more than general information on the basics as originally presented in Grandmaster Hwang Kee's 1978 English translation of the \\"Soo Bak Do Dae Gam\\" (Korean), \\"Tang Soo Do: Moo Duk Kwan\\" (More recent reprints use the title \\"Soo Bahk Do: Moo Duk Kwan\\", and are available from the U.S. Soo Bahk Do Moo Duk Kwan Federation for around 90.00).For those of the Moo Duk Kwan lineage (founded by Hwang, Kee), there is also the question of whose book to buy! After all, Jae Chul-shin, C.S. Kim, Ho Sin Pak, Richard Byrne, and several others all have put out costly hardcover volumes. Rest assured, they all have the same basic Tang Soo Do information...the only MAJOR difference you will find between all of these expensive volumes is who is pictured doing the techniques, and the name of the organization they now head. While it is nice to have GM Hwang's books if only for their historical value (especially since GM Hwang's untimely passing in July of 2002), the volume \\"Tang Soo Do: The Ultimate Guide to the Korean Martial Art\\" tops them all by offering the same information for a much lower price (16.95). Author Kang Uk-lee was dan #70 (1952) under Grandmaster Hwang, and like all of the other authors named above, broke away from Hwang to form his own association. Well...I suppose everyone leaves home sometime. Kang's book includes crisp photos, and helpful descriptions as well as foot diagrams. There isn't a lot of space devoted to the basic techniques themselves (such as variations on hand techniques, kicking, etc), which I assume is due to the fact that most readers already will have some instruction in basic techniques. The main focus of this volume then, is HYUNG (forms). ALL of the basic forms of Tang Soo Do are covered here, to about 4th dan. Included are 19 Hyung: Ki Cho Hyung 1-3, Pyung Ahn Hyung 1-5, Chil Sung Hyung 1-3 (these are three of the new forms introduced by GM Hwang), Bassai Hyung, Naihanchin 1-3, Ship Soo Hyung, Jin Do Hyung, Kong San Kong, and Rohai. All include complete photo sequences showing ALL of the movements, as well as descriptions and foot/stance diagrams.This volume is up-to-date enough to include GM Hwang's 3 Chil Sung Hyung, but does not include other highly advanced elements like the older Japanese/Chung Do Kwan lineage forms Sei Shan Hyung, Wang Shu Hyung, Ji On Hyung, and Oh Sip Sa Bo Hyung, and also those created by Hwang, like the 3 Yuk Ro Hyung (very linear), and the master form inspired by the Mu Ye Do Bo Tong Ji, Hwa Sun Hyung. Most readers simply wouldn't need these other forms yet (unless of course you are 4th dan +). All of this advanced information is available in Hwang's second volume, \\"Tang Soo Do Soo Bahk Do Moo Duk Kwan Volume 2\\" (available from the US Soo Bahk Do Moo Duk Kwan Federation for about 60.00). Kang's book however is simply the best deal out there. All of the necessary Hyung information to take you from 10th gup to 4th dan is for the first time available to virtually anybody for less than twenty clams. Page 14-15 also includes the most complete TSD/MSK genealogy yet published, and there are some good photos showing historical items, GM Kang, GM Hwang, and other TSD folks. If you are studying Tang Soo Do or any Moo Duk Kwan derivative which utilizes the old style forms, and are looking for a guide to assist you with your technical studies, there is no better value than this particular volume. There is simply no comparison."},{"Title":"Tang Soo Do: The Ultimate Guide to the Korean Martial Art","review":"This book consists mostly of photographs of hand and foot techniques and of the forms. As a beginning student I find these very helpful, as when it comes time to practice at home I sometimes have forgotten the new things learned in the previous class. The verbal descriptions that go with the photos are clear. In addition, newer students will find the Korean/English, English/Korean glossary of terms helpful. The author has also included a brief (too brief) history of Tang Soo Do and a lineage chart, but for me these are not the strong points of the book. Also, I would have liked to see a little more about the philosophy behind this martial art; however, the photographic explanations of the moves make the book well worth the price."},{"Title":"Tang Soo Do: The Ultimate Guide to the Korean Martial Art","review":"Before I begin, let me say that am a Moo Duk Kwan practitioner for over 30 years and that Master Lee, Kang Uk was on the testing board for my Cho (1st)Dan test (Choong Ahng Do Jang -Seoul 1971). Although the title touts that it is the Ultimate Guide to the Korean Martial Art, it is not for several reasons. First is that the history section falls way short (1 page? w/o photos) of giving insight and history to Korea's version of martial arts. Second is that all of the technical material has already been published and comes from Grandmaster Kee Hwang's original Korean text &quot;Soo Bahk Do Dae Gahm&quot; (1970) and from the English translations (1975 &amp; 1992) which covers History, detailed Scientific analysis of techniques and Hyung (form) through 6th Dan level. Third, is that the technical expertise of those persons photographed leave something to be desired. The Chil Sung Hyungs were preliminarily introduced in 1952 (verified by Choi Wui Suk who actually saw them) not the latter half of 1980's. Now for the interesting parts. The Tang Soo Do historical photos are always great (specifically pages 16-17). The Moo Duk Kwan's family tree helps in understanding heritage. The overview of Hyungs is useful in getting a sense as to the pattern's overall shape (at a glance) and also come from &quot;Soo Bahk Do Dae Gahm&quot; except for the Chil Sung Hyungs. For the price, the book is a nice information source but for more detailed information the serious martial artist should get Grandmaster Kee Hwang's English texts."},{"Title":"Tang Soo Do: The Ultimate Guide to the Korean Martial Art","review":"The books starts out well enough, and has a comprehensive list of techniques, but there is very little discussion on where power comes from, common mistakes, etc.The hyungs section leaves a lot to be desired, often leaving out transitional moves, or showing non-helpful pictures (shot from the rear)An OK reference book if you can't remember a certain move, but you're better off saving your money and gettting either TSD Volume II by JC Shin, or Soo Bahk Do by Hwang Kee.

The photos were excellent, the text was clear and understandable. While many publications of this type seem to leave gaps, this one covered the most common hyungs of Tang Soo Do. As complete as it was, it should be understood, it would take a complete library of books to cover every aspect of this noble art. The reader should understand that this is a reference book and not intended to take the place of compentent instruction from a credible Do Jang."},{"Title":"Tang Soo Do: The Ultimate Guide to the Korean Martial Art","review":"This book is an adequate reference for the Tang Soo Do hyungs, but little more.

It is an excellent reference for numberous Tang Soo Do forms including the first three Chil Sung forms.

Practicing wrong is worse than not practicing at all. So if you're putting out the effort, this book will assist you in getting it right during those teacher-less times.

For the student, not the casual browser."},{"Title":"Tang Soo Do: The Ultimate Guide to the Korean Martial Art","review":"This is a pretty good book if you are a beginner and are looking mostly for a guide to help with Forms only.

It is prose only in that it is not written in literal verse. But most of all, most important of all, this book is poetry. None of this book was meant to be literal in any sense of the word, it is symbolic from beginning to end, and the writing is better than any descriptive narrative since Dickens.

Without repeating the praise of other reviewers, I would like to respond to one who complained that the book is &quot;too confusing&quot; because &quot;each chapter has new characters.&quot; Each &quot;chapter&quot; is actually a separate short story, published at different times in different outlets; when they were put into book form, Mr. Bradbury wrote new material to string them together and give them a common thread (string, thread . . get it?).

These are all different stories about man living on Mars but it has smooth continunity in all the stories. From the doomed first expedition to Mars to the last chapter where a human family prepares to start their new life in one of the Martian cities, each story keeps the reader interested in what happens next. I also like the fact that Ray maintains the large mystery surrounding the Martians. They who survived the onslaught of earthly diseases, remain in the background but never far from the minds of the colonists. Will they befriend the human colonists to their planet? I'm not sure, but from the few appearances they make with the colonists in the stories, I think the answer is Yes."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Every time my opinion of humanity is raised I read these reviews to lower it back down. Martian Cronicals are a series of short stories tied together only in their location, Mars. There is no other plot point. This however adds strength to the book, the examples of humanity andd its ironys are more clearly shone and in great veriety. For the poeple who complane for some reasone or another about being predictable or long winded, I would suggest reading something more your speed, Goosebumps or The Hardy Boys for example and leave serious books to those who earn more then minimum wage."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I like the way that the book is set up with its suspense level. It keeps you wondering what is going to happen to the earth travlers next. The story is strange, but a good strange. The description in the book is really good. It is so good that you sometimes feel like you are actually there.It also helps you create really good pictures in your head. I dislike the fact that the book takes so long. It takes too long to describe such small things. the book also doesn't flow. Things don't fall together. Some of the things in the book just jump in and then they jump out.It wasn't put together very well. I would recomend this book to people who like strange and out of the ordinary books. However, I wouldn't recomend this book to people that don't like reading about space travel to Mars and life on Mars."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The Martian Chronicles remains one of the great classics of imaginative fiction. Its strong poetic undertones and imagery tramscend the genre. I find it unfortunate that reviews from some schoolchildren in Ohio have reduced this excellent work's overall rating."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Martian Chronicles is a very well written book as a whole. As with any Chronicle some parts are better than others. My personal favorite is The martian which starts on page 119 and ends on page 131. If you don't like stories that are completely weird then don't bother even picking it up. However if you do enjoy weird stories then you will fall in love with this book. Ray Bradbury stretches your imagination to its farthest reaches as he takes you to different places on mars and then back on earth. Some of his characters can be a little controversal but it is all meant for your entertainment. So if you need a laugh or you just want to escape the realities of earth then this is deffinatly the book for you. However if you like books that go together then you might not enjoy this one. Towards the end things start to fit together a little bit but it isn't like a regular story it's not supposed to all go together. To be completely honest not everyone has the imagination to enjoy what his book the Martian Chronicles."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The Martian Chronicles is perhaps the most episodic book I have ever read. Like a reviewer below has noted, Bradbury presents us with no central character, no centralized plot, no guidelines, generally nothing that will give the reader a hold on the situation. There are only two recurring things, Man and Mars. This is where the book's strength lies - it presents how different people deal with the endless mystery of Mars: some see it as an enemy; others try to protect its sanctity, even at the expense of their mates' lives; yet others see it as a great opportunity. Throughout the entire book the reader has two goals - observing the characters' reaction to this ancient world, and figuring out for themselves what exactly is Mars's mystery. The latter is never directly explained. Perhaps the only disagreeable thing in the book are the radically diferent presentations of Martians: one is the people of a radically different world, mystic, romantic, unseen; they are present in most of the book. But the Chronicles' beginning illustrates a different kind of Martians - human-like, petty, squabbling, paranoid. In any case, The Martian Chronicles is a monumental work of incredible thought and untouched values. I would eagerly advise it to anyone searching for deeper meaning of things. This book may have all of the answers."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"After reading Fahrenheit 451 in my high school English class, I was quick to ask my teacher what other books by Bradbury that he would reccomend. He told me to check out the Martian Chronicles...and so I did. When I started reading the book, I thought nothing could touch the breath taking sci-fi epic that I had just read by Bradbury...but I was wrong. The Martian Chronicles starts out with a bang and ends with an unusually happy ending. In between, you are taken on a roller coaster ride of climactic events; and although the book is broken up into several separate mini-stories, all of them intertwine with each other brilliantly.What puts Bradbury's work above other science fiction writers is that although his books are fictional, they have a great deal of real life meaning. Several parts of this book depict how the ignorant humans are so quick to ravage a vast world's ancient history and land. &quot;The rockets set the bony meadows afire, turned rock to lava, turned wood to charcoal, transmitted water to steam, made sand and silica into green glass which lay like shattered mirrors reflecting the invasion, all about. The rockets came like drums, beating in the night. The rockets came like locusts, swarming and settling in blooms of rosy smoke. And from the rockets ran men with hammers in their hands to beat the strange world into a shape that was familiar to the eye, to bludgeon away all the strangeness.&quot; (Page 78-'The Locusts')Bradbury uses his excellent way with words to artistically describe the futuristic destruction of a world, which all relate to one common principle, the same principle many of his books relate to: We are afraid of what we don't understand. Bradbury paints an eerily familiar picture in this book and reminds us how eager humans are to destroy anything that is strange to us. The way that he explains the human condition is way ahead of his time.In summary, The Martian Chronicles is nothing short of incredible. There are no dull parts in it; you will want to keep reading it until you're done...then you will want to read it again and again. Bradbury uses language extremely well to convey to us the flaws in human thinking. This book is a must read for anyone in high school or older, whether you're a fan of science fiction or not. It's my all time favorite book, and if you spend a measly 6 bucks, you will see why."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Of all the authors I have read, three have had an indelible impact on me and my writing-H.P. Lovecraft, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Ray Bradbury. I will never forget the first time I read The Martian Chronicles. If in my entire career I write one thing even approaching the beauty of \\"Night Meeting\\" or the heart-rending tragedy of \\"There Will Come Soft Rains,\\" I will consider my life a success."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles is a Fantastic collection of short stories that explore a possible future for humans on Mars. Bradbury's novel is effective on portraying its mosaic of human experiences by utilizing heavy structural divisions and juxtaposing various characters and groups.The Structure of The Martian Chronicles relies on a series of short stories that are closely or loosely woven together by a common setting and timeframe to show a wide variety of human problems and relationships. Bradbury uses this structure to add in stories like Usher II and There Will Come Soft Rains that carry important messages about society as well as complement other stories but are not necessary for the overall plot. It also allows Bradbury to focus on small groups of people in extremely varied situations without needing to fully explain the run up of events or the consequences of their actions. This allows Bradbury to show more situations thatdemonstrate the human experience.The core of The Martian Chronicles is that it shows what people can become and both the good and bad of what they do through character juxtaposition. One such example of this is the Briggs-Spender relationship which is designed to compare those who want to make a new earth and those who want to conserve the old Martian landscape. The most important juxtaposition in the novel is between the Humans and Martians. Bradbury is able to expose flaws in human thought and action by pairing them with non-human life. The comparisons stretch from the start of the book at Ylla and go to The Off Season. The novel explores peoples' greed, paranoia and bigotry as well as our ability to build and destroy through our relationship with the Martians.The final component of what makes The Martian Chronicles an effective novel and a great read is that it shows how the problems that exist today could carry on in the future in a way that people can still identify with them. Issues ranging from racism, religion, and colonialism are depicted along with their consequences. The most clear-cut example is the issue of colonialism, which is heavily addressed throughout the human settlement of Mars.It is important that those who have previously read the Martian Chronicles to know that different editions contain slightly different stories and dates. More modern editions omit the Way In The Middle Of The Air and older editions may omit Usher II and or The Fire Balloons.-Alicia, Dante, Kevin, Lucas, Sara"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I still remember the first time I read this book. It was in English 11th grade and none of us wanted to read it. But it turned out to be one of my favorites. I recently bought this new edition, new dates and all (not a big deal to me), and fell in love with it all over again. Sure, it is dated in some ways but the imagination, the storytelling, the poetic writing are masterful. Only Bradbury could momentarily briefly bring summer to the winter lands using the exhaust from rocket engines.My favorites are And the Moon Be Still as Bright, which still makes me sad about Spender and I was startled at how violent the one scene at breakfast, and the final story The Million Year Picnic, which is sad and wonderful. But there are no weak stories in this book, not to me. It reminds me why I love to read. But it helps to have Bradbury's words. They are a joy to read."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Once more Jerry Robbins and the Colonial Radio Theater do another fabulous production of one of Ray Bradbury's works. The Martian Chronicles is quite possibly Ray Bradbury's finest fantasy writing and perhaps an allegorical tale of what happened to the Native Americans as this country was settled. Anyway this is the fourth production of CRT's in regards to Mr. Bradbury's works. The first three are Dandelion Wine, Something Wicked This Way Comes, and the wonderful Halloween Tree. If it really needs saying out loud I own and HIGHLY recommend these as well!I had yet to read the Martian Chronicles so I bought a copy and read a few stories and then listened as this recording makes the words, characters and sounds of Mars literally leap off the page and into your ears! This is another triumph of CRT's and they only seem to get better! The beautiful part about them is when they adapt something they stick closely to the source material instead of trying to re-write it entirely. Jerry Robbins did the adapting and directing and it shows. You even get to hear his voice in several of the productions which is always a treat.OK! That's enough reading reviews! Hit the add to cart button and I'll see you on Mars!"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The Martian Chronicles is a collection of loosely related short stories. The stories are often grim depicting racism, greed and other issues like mans imperialistic nature.You have to go into this book willing to suspend your belief. Mars is not depicted as the red, barren planet that we know of today. Also, a lot of the plot elements are quite far-fetched, such as a group of average people being able to secretly build a rocket that travels to Mars, or a character that is able to build robots that are copies of humans in just about every way (speech, movement, etc) in a very short period of time. There are many far-fetched ideas strung throughout.I have to admit when I first started this book I thought it was ridiculous and way too far-fetched. However, as I kept digging in and just accepted this book for what it is I started reading for the underlying message rather than trying to pick the book apart. Once I took a more open-minded approach the book really started to shine. By the time I reached the middle of the book I was finding it increasingly harder to put down.The Martian Chronicles is currently my favorite Bradbury book which I highly recommend; you just have to be willing to open your mind a bit. If you are stuck on hard sci-fi then this book is probably not for you."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"There's not a lot more to add to all the positive reviews already here. I too found this book thought provoking, provocative, profound. It's an inspiring piece of work. I've been reading the (sadly) negative reviews too, and apparently this is not everybody's cup of tea. Know, however, that there is a reason why this is a classic. If you don't 'get' it, well you're just losing out on something special. Some people criticize the science. Mr Bradbury himself admitted that this was more a work of Fantasy than Sci-Fi. Who am I to argue? The book concerns the colonization of Mars and the implications on both humans and, yes, Martians. At this stage in time it reads more like an alternate history book, considering some of the dates involved. The prose is very good. Lyrical, and haunting at times. The book, whilst essentially a series of short stories strung together, actually flows pretty good, and everybody should enjoy peeling away the layers of meaning. It's more than just an adventure, it's a chronicle, of what makes us tick. Am I reading too much into it? Perhaps. Read it. Own it. You should."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I'm not a huge science fiction fan and I've definitely moved away from fantasy to a large degree. Yet, all those disclaimers go out the door (or airlock?) when it comes to Bradbury. His stories always go well beyond the typical sci-fi/fantasy. They're darkly humorous and sometimes, just outright hilarious, while being brilliant at all times. This is no exception."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"It is really interesting hearing a book read in the author's own voice. At first I thought his voice wasn't quite suited to the story. I'm used to hearing audiobooks read by people who do it for a living. They know how to make things sound and probably work hard getting the voices right. But as it went on, I began to realize what a privilege it is to listen to the book read by the author himself. You can hear exactly the way he wanted you to read certain lines. I have a deeper understanding of the book because of this and all the insights he gives at the beginning and end of each chapter. It's absolutely fantastic. Highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The stories compiled in this collection chronicle the imaginary history of a series of rocket flights to Mars. Encounters with the Martians range in nature from the mystical to the fearful, and sometimes include a tincture of both elements. As a few other reviewers have pointed out, there are constant echoes of the story of white, European settlers of America and their encounters with the Native Americans. You should try to remember that, and watch for examples of it, while reading these stories. Be aware that college students in many other countries are given these stories to read by professors, in classes on American literature, as examples of the way American writers turn the Native American experience into fiction.Most of these stories, as I said, are drawn from the Native American experience. Here, I will mention a couple of exceptions, which are also great reading. &quot;The Million Year Picnic&quot; is one of my favorite stories, not only because it has such a neat title, but because it has a number of incredibly beautiful images, and prompts the reader to really think hard about man's chances for survival. Another one of my favorites is... I cannot recall the title, but it concerns a lost, telepathic Martian who stumbles into a town of humans. He instantly, physically transforms into a look-alike facsimile of whomever the people he is near are thinking of -- a lost child, a dead son, etc. You really feel for him as he morphs through various identities. He is like a puppet on a million strings, with ten thousand warring puppeteers pulling him hither and yon, until his very mind undergoes a horrifyingly apocalyptic meltdown. Cool to read about, but it doesn't sound like a very fun thing to actually experience, to put it mildly.This slim book is one of the most beloved additions to... not only to the genre of science fiction, but to American literature as a whole. Ray Bradbury personally, in interviews, constantly questions whether he should be considered a &quot;science fiction writer.&quot; If you stop and think about it, this book will make you see what he means. He includes rockets, Mars, etc. in these stories, but they often feel more like Edgar Allen Poe or Wallace Stegner than Isaac Asimov or Arthur C. Clarke. The latter two writers I just mentioned, along with many others, have often called Bradbury a &quot;prose poet&quot; -- without rhyming his words, he makes you feel like you are reading poetry. This, I hasten to mention, is a pretty darned cool trick, if you can do it.I can't say enough good things about this book. Very worth it. Please scope it out."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"&quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; is full of stories about what humanity does when it is let alone and thinks that no one is watching. As they are science fiction stories, the characters all have science on their side, helping them shape the world--nay, the solar system--to their ideal. It's not always a nice process. Over and over again, in each short story, the human qualities of the first ones on Mars, and even the qualities of those who remained on Earth, are exposed. Humanity certainly does not look pretty in this book. The men who landed on Mars were more ready to kill strange creatures than try to befriend them--more ready to destroy remnants of Martian civilization than preserve it. Even those with ideals were bent on wiping out those who thought differently from them. Those who remained on Earth were just as inclined to destruction. For them, the issue was nuclear war. Yes, the Martians did their horrible share of killing out of fear of the unfamiliar, but who are Earthlings to cry foul over that?However, there are some stories about nice people (such as &quot;The Green Morning&quot; and &quot;The Million-Year Picnic&quot;). Other stories are more optimistic (&quot;Way in the Middle of the Air&quot;) and even whimsical (&quot;Night Meeting&quot;). One is even poignant without being too dark (&quot;The Long Years&quot;).Though I found a lot of the parts about robots and telepathy really hard to believe (even for my gullible, credulous, Madeleine L'Engle reading self), I have to admit that the situations that involved these fictional conceptions made a lot of sense.What I disliked most about this book was the lack of good female characters. The women who were in the stories just slumped and sighed around a lot, except the woman in &quot;The Silent Towns&quot;, who was purely disgusting.What I liked most about &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; were the last two stories, &quot;There Will Come Soft Rains&quot; and &quot;The Million-Year Picnic&quot;. They gave the message that, despite all the destruction humans can bring about in five years--and on two planets--there is no reason to give up on humanity or for humans to give up on themselves."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury is a great book. It is about Earthmen exploring Mars and making settlements to live there before the Great War. The book is full of little mysteries that edge you on to read the next page. I loved it! The part I liked best was when one person made all the fantasy books in the world come true in one house. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to relax and read a good science fiction book."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"When I was told that I had to read this book for school, I was overly upset. I have never enjoyed anything science fiction in my life; not movies, not books, nothing. First, we read Farenheit 451: one of the best books ever written. Then the Martian Chronicles. At first, I couldn't stand the book, but then I got into it. It really isn't about martians and it really isn't science fiction. It is one man's satrical view of our future world. And the picture he paints is not a positive one. I think that both of these Bradbury books should be required reading for all. Not because they are science fiction classics but because of the fabulous lesson that is portrayed in both. I wouldn't consider it a self help book, but it did put many things in perspective. It will make you want to be a better person and it will make you want to live in a better world. It was an eye-opener."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Ray Bradbury's stories are like being shot. It hits you in the heart.

It explores the depths of the human soul."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Whenever I hear the word &quot;Mars&quot;, Ray Bradbury's description of the red planet comes to my mind. The desolate plains of an alien world, abandoned not so long ago by an alien culture, is extremely beatiful and will haunt your dreams. The sadness with which Bradbury describes the twilight of the martian race, the colonization and desecration of Mars by the earthlings, and the subsequent death of humankind by its own hand remain with the reader forever. You can almost feel the cool martian breeze blowing through your hair as it sweeps the sand from the dead martian seas, and you feel for the martians as you watch their beautiful cities abandoned, their glory gone.Even if you don't like science fiction, read this book, it's more than worth it"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"\\"The Martian Chronicles\\" (1950) was Bradbury's second book to be published and a consecrative one. The author received immediate attention from sci-fi lovers, publishers and general public.This book is not really a novel, but a collection of short stories describing Mars' colonization, from 1999 till 2026 where Bradbury's future is already our past! Nevertheless it is a mesmerizing piece of literature.Bradbury writes in poetical prose style. Most of these tales transmits a deep sense of melancholy, as if the author has already passed judgment over Human Kind and found it guilty; guilty of greed, selfishness, short-sightedness and ruthlessness. In other words the same sins showed whenever different human cultures get abruptly in touch.The initial stories describe the ill-fated first Human expeditions and their weird relationship with the Martians. \\"The Third Expedition\\" is really touching and chilling at the same time.From then on, Humans are left alone with all Mars at their disposition for better or worse.Colonization start in earnest as described from \\"The Settlers\\" to \\"The Off Season\\" while in Earth atomic war menace evolve into actual devastating war.Bradbury proposes the reader different approaches to the subject: phantasmagoric as in \\"The Martian\\" or performing homage to Edgar Allan Poe and criticizing censorship as in \\"Usher II\\".The last tales describe Mars almost depleted of Human life with poignant sadness.This is not hard sci-fi, it is almost oneiric fantasy, so do not expect strict logic. Relax and let emotions flow free!Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"In my 32 yrs alive on the planet there have only been 3 books that I have read more than once: The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis, Alices Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass and what Alice Found There by Lewis Carroll, and The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury.Each time I have sat down to read The Martian Chronicles I could smell the martian soil, feel the awe and fear of the 'Second Expedition' and experience ancient Martian culture by reaching out and touching their ancient artifacts. I did not know such writing existed until I read Mr Bradbury's work. One can easily be spiritually transported to the ancient Martian colonies, bask in the Martian sun and stare down at the newly named ancient Martian lakes to see their reflections peering back at them. Because that person reading the book -- you and me -- are the \\"New Martians.\\"The bland or overly done writing of today doesn't even compare to the sublte but direct characterization of Mars that Ray Bradbury brings to life. This should be one of your all time favorites -- it is for me!"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I was originally inspired to read Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles mainly because of the critical acclaim and praise it has received; it isn't very often a science fiction novel is accepted and enjoyed so widely. The most unsettling thing about this novel (or, this collection of short stories) is the fact that there are not any characters or events which Bradbury centers upon. The first chapter, \\"Ylla,\\" grabs the readers attention very well, though I found myself a bit disappointed when the dynamique characters of that chapter did not return. As a whole, however, the overall message and talent bound within the pages of The Martian Chronicles is too important to miss due to something as insignificant as characters. The vast majority of novels out there contain central characters, and many of those very same novels are character-driven. That said, The Martian Chronicles is completely plot-driven. This makes the book not only extremely refreshing, but one need not go through the utter pain of seeing one's favorite character die, because it is very unlikely you would have a favorite character!A word to the optimistic: this novel paints a pretty unhappy portrait of the future of mankind. A pessimist myself, this was not at all disturbing to me, but quite realistic. Bradbury predicts for Earth's future recurring atom wars, the rising of censorship, and the complete meltdown of society. These themes are prevalent in his most popular novel, Fahrenheit 451. These reasons are the motivations behind the humans' migrations to Mars. Bradbury uses his novel as a conduit to warn us against \\"political correctness\\" and asks whether or not we have a control on weapons technology.My personal favorite idiosyncracies of The Martian Chronicles were the chapters \\"Usher II,\\" \\"There Will Come Soft Rains,\\" and \\"The Green Morning.\\" As is with most Bradbury works, the author tips his hat to his favorite authors with excerpts from poems, songs, and even the fabulous parallel to Edgar Allen Poe's The Cask of Amontillado in \\"Usher II.\\" Bradbury's use of language and description of fantastic settings and creatures was impressive, to say the least. The descriptions of the Martian race were so intricate and unique each time that one could certainly picture the fictitious peoples, as well as their \\"chemical baths\\" and \\"sand ships,\\" the levitating pirate ships with sails of blue mist. The wonderful aspect of science fiction is the new and refreshing imagery introduced, and Bradbury used this to his advantage.In a nutshell, The Martian Chronicles is not only though-provoking, but a real fun book to read. The reading level is adequate for any student, and is neither slow or complicated in the beginning or abrupt at the end. Any science fiction fan who enjoyed the messages behind the film The Matrix will thoroughly enjoy Bradbury's Chronicles."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The Martian Chronicles is an intriguing collection of stories about the years when Earth men came, settled, and destroyed Mars. Giving a twist to this story is a humanoid race already settled on the red planet that has large golden eyes and dark skin, as well as cities with transportation and a peaceful modern society. But to the average person, the Martian looks like a long lost family member of friend, appearing as the person about whom you are presently thinking. Not only does Mars seem distant, but the Earth as we know it in the year 2000 is not similar to Bradbury's interpretation of how our planet will end up in the 20th century. He displays an atmosphere on Earth where everything must be 'pure' and 'normal,' doing away with imaginative thinking and books with authors such as Edgar Allen Poe. This is why the first settlers th Mars went; they wanted to get away from 'perfection.' But once the land was clear of Martians and the dirty work was done, Earth's tax collectors and purifiers came, and with them minorities. The Martian Chronicles truly displays man's greed and bias, showing that history does repeat itself. I recommend this book to all philosophers and science fiction fans. If you have ever asked yourself 'Why?' or 'What is the point of life?' this book would be good for you, giving an answer from yet an other individual's viewpoint who loves philosophy. I also recommend this book to thinkers because after each short story, I sat for a minute considering what just happened and why it did. One of the best science fiction/philosophical masterpieces of all, The Martian Chronicles is a genuinely fascinating and interesting book."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"In the half century after most of it was written, as Bob Dylan would say, things have changed. Racial relations are different, we know there are not water filled canals on Mars, no Martian dead cities, electronics are digital, rock has become the most popular music, and so on.This novel is more of a love poem, and finally a eulogy for the human race. I suppose it is science fiction. Doing what the best science fiction does: illuminating our lives in the present with the metaphor of a future time. It contains one of my favorite Bradbury short stories I read a long time ago in junior high - &quot;There Will Come Soft Rains&quot;. A story of an automated house trying to futilely provide for its deceased human inhabitants.A moving and beautiful work. I only hope we have learned from its teachings."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Ray Bradbury's Martian Chronicles is a story the holds many things true today even if the story itself is not a reality, and probably never will be. Bradbury once again takes a cynic's position to writing as he has in other works (Fahrenheit 451) and includes many of the problems that man faced during his day and that man faces in ours. Bradbury's style of writing is very unique in this book as well, in that rather then focusing on one specific set of characters, he jumps around with different characters all the time. The Book could be considered more a interconnected collection of short stories as opposed to a novel.The short stories in the book are all well written each including their own set of characters. Some chapters do include some of the same characters, giving it the feeling that one part of the novel was connected to another.I especially enjoyed the chapter titled \\"Usher II\\". In this chapter a man is fighting the system that he will no longer be a part of. In this chapter Bradbury does a few interesting things. First, it seems that he connects this book to his one of his other books, Fahrenheit 451 from the quote, \\" \`Of course.' Stendahl snorted delicately, a combination of dismay and contempt. \`How could I expect you to know blessed Mr. Poe? He died long ago, before Lincoln. All of his books were burned in the Great Fire. That's thirty years ago-1975.'\\" (Page 134). I have read Fahrenheit 451 and immediately picked up the connection, whether intentional or not by Bradbury I do not know, but it interested me that he connected his books together. If you have not read Fahrenheit 451 I suggest you do as it is another of Bradbury's great contributions to literature. Bradbury also pokes a little bit of fun a fellow author, Ernest Hemingway, in this chapter. In another quote by Stendahl, \\"Just as you put a stake through the heart of Halloween and told your film producers that if they made anything at all they would have to make and remake Ernest Hemingway. My God, how many times have I seen For Whom the Bell Tolls done! Thirty different versions. All realistic. Oh, Realism! Oh, here, oh, now. Oh Hell!\\" (Page 137). In this chapter Bradbury also depicts the stupidity humans. It yet another quote by Stendahl (can you tell he's my favorite character yet?) \\"Garrett?\\" called Stendahl softly. Garrett silenced himself. \\"Garrett,\\" said Stendahl, \\"do you know why I've done this to you? Because you burned Mr. Poe's books without really reading them. You took other people's advice that they needed burning. Otherwise you'd have realized what I was going to do to you when we came down here a moment ago. Ignorance is fatal, Mr. Garrett.\\" (Page 147).Of course, this is just a small hint at what the entire book has to offer. The entire book is full of points and questions that make you wonder about this world. There was nothing I did not like about this book, I sped through it faster then any book I had ever read before, I recommend everyone read it."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Regardless of Bradbury's genre, the essence of his prose is very human. In The Martian Chronicles he manages to deliver that ever bitter/sweet feeling of nostalgia. From Springfield, Illinois in his coming of age novel, Dandelion Wine, to a front porch on Mars, Bradbury always touches the human heart. This is why this novel is great; whether on a distant planet or not, you will be moved."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I was originally inspired to read Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles mainly because of the critical acclaim and praise my father said it has received; it isn't very often a science fiction novel is accepted and enjoyed so widely.

I agree with others that this is a Sci-Fi masterpiece. The book is separate, loosely connected stories written in the hitchcock tradition of misdirection.The movie made based on this book was a huge disappointment for me."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This was a very light and insightful read in my opinion. It prods at the five mark, but can not quite pull me there completly. Here's why:Ray Bradbury successfully weaves together a series of short stories all revolving around Mars and the progression of time from man's first landing on it's surface, to his last. Adjusting to the Mars that Bradbury colorfully conjures up was slightly tedious for me as a reader. I found this to be the case because when Bradbury first had the book published it was true Science Fiction and although far-fetched, had a firm base in scientific knowledge of the Red Planet at the time. In the year 2003, that knowledge is anachronistic. There are no little men on Mars building canal systems and furthering their race on the science of the martian mind. If you are a reader that can actually overlook fact and lose yourself in the fantasy (since it truthfully can not be called a science fiction), you will finish it knowing that you have chanced upon some very profound truths illustrated in a very unusual manner. Bradbury (coined a poet by his compatriot Aldous Huxley) does a brilliant job of illumining the inherent self-destructiveness of mankind and how this can not only destroy the lives of others, but make less meaningful individual lives as well. Read it, you'll be a more self-aware human being because of it, and you will be entertained and awed by the spectrum of emotion that Bradbury adeptly draws his readers through. And....If you like H.G. Wells and get a kick out of the alien phenomenon in literature at that time, you'll absolutely adore &quot;The Martian Chronicles.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This collection of short stories certainly deserves the classic status it has recieved. Each story in this book is an entertaining read. The settings pull you into a bizzare world were anything is possible.However, to describe The Martian Chronicles as Science fiction is a bit of a stretch. Bradbury's vision of the future, the late nineteen nineties through the beginning of the twenty-first century, is unremarkable. He describes a Mayberry colinization of the planet Mars, complete with cozy little cottages and hotdog stands. This is completely forgiveable if you go into the book realizing it is really fantasy not science fiction. Bradbury makes up for his lack of futuristic vision with his ability to create intriguing scenarios."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Ray Bradbury clearly carried the Western Frontier of Walt Whitman and Horace Greely to the Martian Frontier in this classic novel. If 1950's America would have had the rocket ships, and an inhabitable destination, planetary colonization would probably have gone very much like this. As the text says:\\" They were coming with small dreams or large dreams or none at all. But a government finger pointed from four-color posters in many towns:THERE'S WORK FOR YOU IN THE SKY: SEE MARS!\\" Heck, I'd go right now if I could.His Mars is the essense of the wild frontier: the path finders, the pioneers, the pilgrims, the homesteaders, the townsfolk, the eccentrics- and then the bureaucrats.... Bradbury's Martians are haunting and tragic- and fare about as well as the Plains Indians in the face of \\"progress.\\"Actually, this story parallels the story of American West a little too closely- especially when it talks of the \\"silent towns.\\" If you've ever seen the dead and dieing farm towns of the plains you know what I mean."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I read Martian Chronicles not knowing what to expect. I had found it on a list of books i had to chose from, read, and write a report on. At first I found some of the stories (or chapters, or diary entries if you wish to call them that) quite odd. The one involving the man who met the martians that would manifest strange things like nude flame women that would crawl out of their mouths. Yet as odd as it was, I couldn't put it down. I just kept reading, and in the end, I enjoyed every moment of it. It's one of those books that really gets you thinking. It helps you realize the brutality of the human way, and that is an important thing for all to be aware of. Because of that, I rate it as one of the best science fiction books of all time. One of sci-fi's most noted autors, Phil Dick, said that science fiction isn't science fiction becuase it has spaceships, takes place in the future, and has advanced technology. That is simply just a story that takes place in the future where technology became more abundant. He said that science fiction is much more deep and always has a metaphor of some sort, a relationship with life itself, that makes it much more deep in meaning. This story is a shinning example of that. I recomend Martian Chronicles to anyone and everyone. Even if you don't know how to appreciate great science fiction, you may still learn from it for what it is. Ray Bradbury's writing style itself would also warrant you to getting this book. He's an excelent author that can not only weave an incredible tale, but he can do it in such a way that the words flow smooth like wine and never sound awkward, always welcoming you to continue on with the journey that he has set forth on paper. Now that I've told you how great it is, GO GET THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I gave this novel a five out of five because i think this book is a great science fiction novel. This novel leads the reader through journal like chapters and explains all misterious things that could happen if the human race tries to colonize Mars. This novel gives the senerio that we are not alone in the universe. Earth sends a shuttle to Mars, hoping to colonize it. After a few weeks on Mars they lose radio contact. To find out what happend to the first crew, and of coarse see if we can start colonizing on Mars, they send up a second team. The second team lands and finds out there is life on Mars. When they land they expect a huge welcome, but did not even get a smile from the martins if they looked at them. They start talking o the martians ask who they could talk to about the significance of their journey. They end up finding that person to talk to and he does nothing. Like he heard it all before. So he gave them a place to stay, which the astronauts soon found out that it was an insane asylum and later were killed. The novel continues on with stories just like this one and leaves the reader in suspense. I hope this will help your decision in whether or not to read this novel."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Nas Crnicas Marcianas, Ray Bradbury imagina um lugar cheio de esperanas e sonhos, com pilares de cristal e mares fossilizados &#8211; onde uma fina camada de poeira cobre as cidades vazias de uma civilizao devastada.Os terr&aacute;queos conquistaram Marte e por ele foram conquistados, enganados por perigosas mentiras de uma raa nativa misteriosa, de human&oacute;ides telepatas.Nesta fico cient&iacute;fica cl&aacute;ssica, Bradbury espe nossas ambies, fraquezas e ignorncia, quanto a um mundo estranho e encantador, ao qual o homem no pertence.

It was such an easy book to get sucked into. The concept was 100% original, and it was even fairly believable - albeit a little frightening to really dwell on. When I started The Martian Chronicles, I was expecting something similar - and initially, it's exactly what I got...initially...I really liked the beginning. Though quite fantastical (bahh I'm embarrassed - I read over that word at least 10 times and wasn't sure if I made it up or not!), it was actually pretty believable. There was this feeling of unease that permeated through each story, which upped the enjoyable factor quite significantly! Now cue, oh I don't know...100 pages later, and what went wrong? I can't even really pin-point it - I just sort of lost interest. We may have on our hands another case of too many disparate stories not tying into each other. I'm always a sucker for character development, and when each character is featured for max 10 pages, you tend to lose that a little bit.I think you could have guessed I would say this - if you've got the Bradbury itch, go for Fahrenheit 451. Been there, done that? Give The Martian Chronicles a try - it's pretty short, and you might enjoy it more than I did."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Ever since I was required to read the Orwellian speculative-fiction novel \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" in high school, I have loved Ray Bradbury's writing. While it may be up for debate as to whether he's one of the best science fiction writers of all time, I certainly rank him as one of my favorites. His lyrical way with words, insight into human nature and its vices and weaknesses, and frightening but all-too-plausible view of the future made him one of the most powerful writers in the genre, and his passing marked a great loss to the science fiction community.Despite loving the aformentioned \\"Fahrenheit\\" and many of his short stories, however, until recently I had yet to read Bradbury's other popular classic, \\"The Martian Chronicles.\\" I had already heard from other sources that the \\"science\\" and predictions in this book were somewhat outdated, but I figured I could forgive this. So I picked up the book... and was blown away. This book is just as good, if not better, than \\"Fahrenheit 451.\\"Unlike \\"Fahrenheit,\\" \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" is a collection of short stories instead of a single narrative, although all the stories end up tying together to form a cohesive story arc. We see the first explorers arrive on the Red Planet, and the fates many of them meet at the hands of the native Martians. As conditions on Earth deteriorate, more and more humans begin to colonize Mars, and while some of the natives resist while others try to co-exist with the invaders, eventually they die out as humanity encroaches on their territory. Man conquers Mars... but at a terrible price, and as Earth is wracked by war and destruction the Red Planet may be humanity's last hope for survival.Bradbury has a remarkable gift with words, his prose lyrical and almost poetic, much like Peter S. Beagle of \\"The Last Unicorn\\" fame. His descriptions are apt and beautiful, making one feel as if they're right there witnessing events in person. Some readers might find his description of Mars somewhat jarring, as Mars had not yet been explored when he wrote his \\"Chronicles,\\" but if one can accept this or think of this as an alternate version of Mars, then they'll find that this inconsistency doesn't detract from the book.Some of the stories in this book are whimsical and fun, such as \\"The Green Morning\\" and \\"Night Meeting.\\" Most of the others, however, have a tragic air to them -- humanity seems to have not learned from its mistakes in the past, and the manner in which Mars is colonized and its natives wiped out bears more than a passing resemblance to how the Native Americans were treated during the colonization of the US. And more than one story veers right into horror in the end -- \\"The Third Expedition\\" and \\"The Off Season\\" have particularly chilling endings.By far my favorite story in this anthology is \\"There Will Come Soft Rains.\\" This story is unique in that it doesn't take place on Mars at all, but on a war-torn Earth... and it has no characters, but rather focuses on an abandoned, automated house. It still manages to be a powerful statement on how mankind has remade his world to be an artificial paradise... and how even in our absence the world goes on, as much as we would like to think it won't.\\"The Martian Chronicles\\" is a powerful book that remains meaningful even today, and I would even go so far as to say it's required reading if you're a fan of classic science fiction. While the technology and Martian landscape might feel dated today, the messages it conveys are timeless and necessary. And the writing is beautiful, far more so than one would expect from a science fiction novel. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"When I wrote my novelThe Merry Life of Charles ParkerI turned again and again to Ray Bradbury for a guide -- I wanted to write a realistic portrayal of 12-year-old boys. My book is set in 1959 and Bradbury wrote these stories in the 1940s, but they've been popular ever since. I wasn't around in the Fifties so I had to rely on popular culture to give me a sense of some of the dreams and nightmares seizing American minds at the end of Eisenhower's presidency. If a kid was at all interested in science fiction back then he would have absorbed some of these stories. Bradbury was everywhere. Bradbury *was* popular culture. From Mars to Moby Dick to Fahrenheit 451 to his many other strange and wonderful stories -- he was the one writer Americans couldn't get out of their heads. And still you can read the stories in this slim volume as great pieces of powerful literature, but you can also read them as bits of evocative history. What did people think about space exploration decades ago? Or about aliens living on Mars? Or about the future of life on Earth? Was there fear of the atomic bomb? Oh, yes. Was there fear that mankind might be its own worst enemy? You decide. It's all here in haunting detail. The language is always crisp. Bradbury was an autodidact with the need to impress -- and he never disappoints. Because of Ray Bradbury American history is never a dull subject. It's a history of nervous energy and restless imagination."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"It took me 4 tries to read this book, but once I got past 1/3 of this book, it took off! Excellent collection of stories.It's pity that ALL major Bradbury's books are only in print format, no e-book versions. Tragically for a writer who was so much focused onto the future to have his books in last century format..."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Having only read one short story by Bradbury before this book, both his style and the genre (in book form) were new to me. This compilation of stories are all dated in the future, from the 'magical' sci-fi year of 1999 (which in the forties and fifties must have seemed a long long way away) and although individual stories, they read like diary entries.Varied in length, with some just a couple of paragraphs or pages long, the balance works well because the shorter stories are to the point and punctuate the longer ones. Although classed as science fiction, set on (or about travelling to) Mars, the main theme running though all of them is how human's react to situations. Racial tension, loneliness, hope, fear and greed all play a part in these deftly put together stories and whether they're about being isolated on a planet, met by long dead loved ones or children just being children, they each have something to offer and leave you in ponderous mode."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I read this book as a young boy.

It is completely packed full of insights into the darkness of the human nature. Different stories tell of different expeditions sent to mars, on which beautiful ancient civilizations of martians live. Unfortunatly, when the humans reach mars, the perfect images of a green, earthlike mars are shattered.Ray Bradbury effectivly expresses under a series of stories the grim reality of the human race. A reality that has been supressed, yet always reappears periodically.If you enjoy reading about science fiction, and about the greediness and evilness of the human race, this book will be your best treat! Just remember. Don't read this late at night, or your head will be bursting with so many thoughts that you won't be able to go to sleep."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Martian Chronicles is a series of short stories explaining the colonization of humans on Mars. Bradbury takes issues concerning the 1940s and incorperates them into his novel. Bradbury has the ability to create Mars in a way that makes you feel as if he has been there. His characters are strongly developed and build strong relations with each other. With each story in his novel he has a new set of characters with different kinds of personalities. He shows how each character reacts differently to life on Mars. It is almost like he was using his novel to make a prediction on the future of space exploration and gives possible outcomes of the future. The book is extremely well written and that gives us an interesting possiblity of the future."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This book got me hooked onto Ray Bradbury for good. I usually dislike short stories,but the way Bradbury comes up with an original concept for each story and manages to tie them all together just amazes me. Since reading this, I've acquired all his other books and devoured them, but in my opinion this is his best. When I finished this book, I was extremely disapointed- I wished I hadn't read it so that I could pick it up and read it for the first time. This is a must read- trust me, you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The Martian Chronicles is truly one of Ray Bradbury's finest. It not like any other book I have ever read before. It is a book with lots symbolism and a book that brings up a debate about our own American civilization. The Martian Chronicles is a very fragmented book. There are no main characters in this book. It does not have a climax and it does not have a fairytale ending. This book as a whole symbolizes: America's Manifest Destiny, how we can be wrong and right about types of civilizations and how we shouldn't try replicate our old civilizations that just do not work in other regions that already have their own system of colonization (i.e. America, Vietnam, Cuba and etc...) due to our own instincts to build the greatest empire (i.e. The Roman Empire, America's Manifest Destiny and etc...). This book is basically about people from Earth going to Mars. They have a slow start with three unsuccessful missions, because the Martians execute or isolate the creww members in ways I will not mention because I do not want to ruin the best part for you, which is the Third Mission. On the Fourth Mission the humans are successful, because most of the Martians have died because of the chickenpox. Then people from Earth start to settle on Mars. They change the red landscape into a green earthlike world. Then there is an atomic war on Earth and everyone evacuates Mars except for one man and an ugly women. The end is the part with the most amount of symbolism and would be better if you read it yourself instead of me ruining it for you. This is a brief summary of the whole book I believe that this book does not have any weaknesses due to its abstract style. It is hard to criticize this book because it is a one of a kind and cannot be compared with other books. The strong points of this book are the parts with the heavy symbolism. The Four Expeditions explain what is going on in the story and I think are also the best parts. The end is also a great part. It symbolizes that appreciating the civilization that you have found is right. This book is a great book. If you have vivid imagination, are fluently literate in the English language and have a pulse, then this book is definitely for you. When reading this book expect the unexpected. If you think your understanding of each chapter is wrong because it is too abstract then chances are you are not wrong at all."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Bradbury's Mars reminds me of something out of a Ronald Reagan fantasy--a world where people sit on porch swings and sip mint juleps after a hard day's work in the fields while the aroma of Grandma's homemade cookies wafts out the window. Considered as a sci-fi classic there really isn't much science here and not much in the way of plot either, but as a collection of mood pieces dripping with nostalgia for a vanished way of life that has somehow been transplanted to Mars, this book is without peer.A personal side note here--I heard Ray Bradbury speak once when they brought him to my junior high school in West Los Angelos 35 years ago. He's a good speaker, actually, and a bit of an eccentric. For example, he admits to being deathly afraid of flying and therefore drives a car everywhere. But he said he would get on a spaceship tomorrow and fly to Mars if he could--something surely more dangerous than a typical plane flight.Anyway, Bradbury himself turned out to be quite a character, and perhaps some of that gets into his stories like this one. The Martian Chronicles shows Bradbury at his best, in a story that ranks as one of the greatest mood pieces in science-fiction and as a story of a people's hopeful, romantic, but failed vision of a new life in a new and unknown world."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Let's see here: A man builds a reproduction of the House of Usher, an alien impersonates a lost child, an ironic tale of the last man and woman on Mars, the story of a house after the end of the world. The only thing that links them is the planet Mars and the themes that run through out Bradbury's entire body of work. These stories, like most anything by Bradbury, are amazingly poignant and lyrical. This and Gene Wolfe's Fifth Head of Cerberus are perhaps the two best novels made up out of short stories ever writen."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Dear Reader... I think that the Martian Chronicles was a great book. It is one of those stories that shows the good guys as the bad guys. He shows this in a neat way, by having Humans invade Mars. This is neat because Alien Invaders mostly come, in science fiction stories, from Mars (For example Mars Attacks). Bradbury just switched it around and had Earth invade Mars. Not only did he just switch it around, but he also made a mirror and showed people how they don't care about others and just care about ourselves (reference: June 2001). To know what I am talking about, you have to read the book. lol This book is a MUST read and I suggest it to EVERYONE!

The books power lies not in the fact that it is scientifically accurate or plausible, but that it forces its readers to think. As a high school student reading this book for a project I found that it is very easy to write on. It is without a doubt one of the best books I have read in high school and I feel that it is not a book for those who have read little other material. An interest in Poe, and also some knowledge of F451 was very helpful and lends a great deal to the value of the book. I hope that you decide to read this book, because it is a great look at the past through speculating on the future."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This is a terrific collection of short stories that provide a social commentary through the lens of humanity's travel to and exploration of Mars. The social commentary really relates to the 1940s and 1950s though, I think that modern readers are likely to have trouble identifying with the issues described in the book. The topics covered by the stories in this book include man's destructive impulses, nuclear war/annihilation, racism, among a host of others. Bradbury paints a bleak picture of humanity and humanity's fate. It isn't as if these problems don't exist in the 21st century, of course, they just aren't as important in our collective psyche nor are they framed in the same manner. I think that the primary interest in this book for the 21st century reader is historic - to see how science fiction and social criticism provide a window into the world of the 1950s. The message(s) of this book just won't be so relevant to 21st century readers. If you are looking for an action story with lots of bugs being slaughtered, this definitely isn't the place. There are also some really dated ideas (e.g. the mass availability of rocket ships for travel between Earth and Mars or simply to travel around Mars). Before reading this book I rented the TV miniseries made in the 70s. This miniseries is surprisingly close to the novel and would provide a good companion to the book."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Chronicles is less a novel and more a collection of short stories, some just a single paragraph, tied together by an overall narrative. There are Martians and the planet is portrayed with flowing water and an Earth-like atmosphere. This isn't realistic but it doesn't matter since the planet is a backdrop for the colonization and abandonment of the planet by humans. In fact, the book is mostly a character study of the humans who come to Mars and the impact they have on the planet. Some are adventurers, some idealists, some are just running away from something.The stories also have a distinctive flair to them and reflect the 1940s in which they where written, several deal with 'atomic war'."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The martian chronicles is a book about the colonization of people on Mars. The begining of the book started out pretty good. Men from the planet earth came to Mars and were exploring the planet and the culture. When I got to the middle of the book it kind of hit a flat spot and it seemed to just drag on. The book also made it incredibly difficult to remember what character did what through out the story. This was because the names the characters had such as Mr. Iii, Mr. Ttt, and Mr. Xxx. Overal I think this was a pretty good book. But it just did not catch me as it might catch you.

When I first saw the book, I had no idea it was going to be what it was. I was expecting some typical sci-fi book with aliens crashing to earth, or maybe vice versa. But the way Bradbury presented the whole essence of the book was so thought provoking. He really made you think about if what he wrote could really happen. It's written as if some one just compiled all the history there was to know about how man came to conquer and make a civilization upon mars. You really need to read it to understand what I'm talking about because words can do no justice to this book.

The book was written in 1946 and was very outdated for my taste. Although the stories that I did read I found them only somewhat interesting but not horrible. And the stories that I did not read and learned what they were in class were very strange and for the most part uninteresting.Although I did not like this book one story that I did find interesting was Way In The Middle of the Air. This story showed the controversy of blacks and whites in any society and I think that that subject is something important to talk about in a book. The story that I liked least was Ylla because I really didn't pay attention to what was happening and the events of the story. Also it was very boring and the story was retarded and horrible. Poor Ylla, I can't believe she would stay with a total jerk like Yll!!!I think this book is a boring and worhtless book to read in school because it shows nothing about English class and is really a pointless book to read.

The Martians think the people are Martians because Martians have telepathy and they think the astronauts are crazy Martians. After that the astronauts die and then the people on Earth think that the spaceshipped just crashed when it got to Mars. They all have no idea about the Martians and they decide to send another spaceship to Mars. When they get to Mars there are no Martians there and then they start going crazy because one guy is obsessed with the Martians. The Martians are thought to have died out and the one guy who's going crazy claims he's the last of the Martians. He starts killing the rest of his team and he eventually gets killed. More people start coming to Mars after all this and started to colonize the areas (there's still no Martians there). Some man leaves the town to look at the Martian ruins and he ends up running into an actual Martian. Both of them are arguing saying that the other one is a race that died out. Then the Earth somehow gets destroyed and everyone on Mars had to go to Earth to fight in the war. The remaining people on Mars try to make a new life there because they can't go back to Earth. It ends where basically humans were ancestors of Martians and that it worked through almost like a time vortex.I thought the book was pretty interesting actually. Although some parts were really confusing and I wasn't sure what was going on, it was still a pretty cool book. I would recommend this to people who are older only because they can probably understand it better. I actually ended up asking my brother alot about the book since he read it.

But in 'The Martian Chronicles', a somewhat loose collection of short stories involving humans (from Earth) colonizing Mars, this reader was left wanting for something insightful or special. Instead I found this collection of stories to be very readable, at times interesting, but also at times rather bland. And at no time did I sense this book deserved to be considered a classic. This would be an insult to its author who has indeed written classics (eg, 'Fahrenheit 451').Bottom line: a somewhat forgettable book that seems to have garnered more readership than it deserves.

While it was good to read in school, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for intellectual stimulation. It was written by Ray Bradbury sonetime in the 40's or 50's; I don't really know. &quot;The Martain Chronicles&quot; is a completely unreal story about the human civilization colonizing Mars. While some science fiction fanatics may beleive that this book was the greatest thing written in the 20th century, I like books that pertain to my life. It might only be good to a select few readers. If I had to choose a specific story that I liked, I guess I would have to say that I liked &quot;Ylla&quot; the best. It is completely amazing that the author could create a world as ornate as that of this planet. One story that I really hated was &quot;Night Meeting.&quot; I really did not understand this story. That may possibly be who I did not like it. The whole Conversation about who was from the past and who was from the future had me going in circles. I think that if you like science fiction then you would like this book, but if you are looking for intellctual stimulation, find something else to read. It is definately not a book for anyone who doesn't like science fiction. (Please keep in mind that these are my thoughts and my thought only. If you liked this book, more power to you, but don't criticize me for my comments. Also, please keep in mind that I am a bad speller, and that I am sorry for any spelling mistakes.)"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Novels are written everyday by countless authors. Some are tasteful and some are not. Ray Bradbury, known for his skillful blending of fancy and satire, terror and tenderness, wonder and fantasy, has written many novels which have made him the master of fantasy and the greatest living science-fiction writer in the world. The Martian Chronicles begin on Mars where first contact is made by the Second Expedition, led by Captain Jonathan Williams. The Second Expedition is unsuccessful like theone before. The missions end in terror for both crews. No one knows if the First crew even made it to Mars; however the second crew is shot in cold blood by the very Martians they had hoped to communicate with. The Third Expedition also meets the some fate as the other two, but this time there are survivors who pave the way for the colonization of Mars. The Martian civilizations lay in ruins caused by disease brought on by Humans who came to settle the new world. As The Great War breaks out on Earth, giant explosions can be seen as far away as Mars. People of Mars rush back to their home planet Earth to protect their nation against others who might want to destroy it. All is lost, and both Worlds lay in ruins.The author leads you to a unique twist in the last sentence of the novel. It reads, \\"Themartians stared back up at them for a long, long silent time from the rippling water.\\" One of thelast remaining human families escape to Mars, where they make their new home. As they watch their reflection in the rippling water, they know that from this day forth they are truly Martians.Bradbury's science-fiction novels are really a cluster of short stories which make up anovel. The 26 different chronicles share nothing except they either take place on Mars or Earth.They really are a cluster of short stories which describe the history of Mars, starting from the year 1999 and ending in the year 2026.It was a great disappointment from what one expects of this author. This novel does not live up to his unique w!riting ability. The Martian Chronicles starts strong but dies as it jumps from one chronicle to another, a poor ending to a great start. The Martian Chronicles is one fantasy-story which a die-hard science-fiction fan can do without. This writer owes apologies to everyone. It's the least one should expect after reading this novel."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I.People come to Bradbury in different ways:a. they are assigned to read this book (or Dandelion Wine or Fahreheit 451)for school,b. it's on a summer reading list,c. you heard he was good sci-fi writer and influenced Stephen King (yes, that's true)d. and is with the greats such as Poe and Vonnegut and etc;e. or you just happened upon it the way Bastian Bux happens upon the Neverending Story in the book of that same name: while you love entertainment, you love also, meaning - unlike those who chased Bastian in the trash bin in the movie version.1. I notice this is how it is with much of literature,2.therefore that would include Bradbury.II. Truly in response to many questions and almost epithetical statements made by some reviewers,:A. the book was first published in 1946.B. We hadn't even been to the moon yet.1.A movie, &quot;The Mouse in The Moon&quot; with Peter Sellers shows just how far off people were in exact science, even right b4 the moon.2. So some say, of Bradbury and other such sci-fia.&quot;They were completely inaccurate, unrealistic, Bradbury didn't finish college and therefore, he and they are now obsolete.&quot;b.Some even claim Bradbury is not sci-fi.1.Firstly, Bradbury was completely realistic in depicting human relationships in going by humanity's past actions yes, the colonizations and etc;).2. Some are jealous at hearing he may not have finished college. He actually wrote Fahrenheit when he was only 19.3. I have gone to college.4.Alot of successful writers haven't gone to college.5. On the other hand, people also once read books more, people like Bradbury,people like Jack London. Stephen King hated creative writing in college.a.there are plenty of smart, intellectual people who are elitist and like to think themselves better than everyone else,b. thus showing their own low self-esteem and worry about their own success.6.A similar premise of not going to college and being a successful writer isn't possible for a certain alliterate part of the population who actually have three tvs (like in Fahrenheit 451) in the wall at a time, or more.a.We see such usage of tvs even in the mall.b.It's happening now.C. As for the book not being sci-fi,1. &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; is sci-fi,2. simply because it involves a scientific fiction.III. What Bradbury has written is literature that will endure as long as this world is aroundA.because the social issues he described are all very possible and have happened.B. He uses literary and myth references in all his work, and references to actual history.C.That, people, is what makes literature.1. For instance, During Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte's time, there were popular authors who wrote supernatural and action packed thrillers, like today.2.No one but English Professors or specialists know who they are.3. It is similar with Shakespeare, and also, with Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman.4. There were those popular during their day but what they wrote did not transcend to a spiritual, meaningful level;a.it was more of what you might call greeting card doggerel, which serves a purpose,b. but it does not at all transcend the time to reach a larger human consciousness.c.That is what the sort of writing Bradbury does is all about--d. he takes the elusive, everyday mundane and turns it into an event which transcends time and place.e. He thereby transcends genre, which the other writers previously mentioned also did.IV. A human being, esp. a writer conscious of meaning is able to discern the link to the past, the present and the future so that they all become one and the same.A. Especially by the way the stories are intricately woven together,B. in the same sort of way that when we pick up a news paper, we know what happened may have been at a different place on the other side of the world, or time,C. but we know we are still part of the same world it took place in.D. He also links many of his stories to other stories in other books he's written -- check Balzac, Faulkner etc; Excuse me, I must thank you for giving me something to publish an essay on for myself now!"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The first time I read this book I was in high school and in the latter half of a research program on chemical perception enhancement. At the time I thought this was a great book. Based on those memories, I bought the NBC Television Mini-series on VHS in my second year of university. Then, I attributed the suckage level of that production to the typical mid-seventies literary &quot;interpretation&quot;. However, a recent re-read of the book has led me to reevaluate my assessment of this opus of Bradbury's. Now, Bradbury is famous for such classics as &quot;Farenheight 451&quot; and &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;. The Martian Chronicles though, lacks any of the sophisticated storytelling one might expect from a master with Bradbury's credentials. One of the annoying things was the ridiculously unrealistic schedule at which major events occurred. On top of that, in one chronicle, when faced with an unbelievable scene at their arrival on Mars, the astronauts of an expedition perform some pathetically nave mental gymnastics in order to rationalise what they are experiencing.Later chronicles don't improve much. Granted, Bradbury was trying to make a statement regarding the human tendency for violence not only toward each other but also toward our home planet. Unfortunately, he goes about it in such a ham-handed way that the characters come off as clownish morons and you end up spending more time wondering how these idiots ever made it to Mars without blowing themselves up. Of course, you are less than surprised when they do. Humans blow themselves up through their arrogance and disrespect for the environment and Native peoples. For that message, I can think of better presentations."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Ray Bradbury's &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; is, in my opinion, one of the indispensable classics of 20th century science fiction. The book tells the story of human colonization of Mars--a Mars marked by the remains of a dying indigenous civilization. One can read the book as a metaphoric meditation on human history, or as a straightforward tale of an alternate reality. But however you approach it, the book is brilliant.&quot;Chronicles&quot; consists of a series of interrelated short stories. The overall feel of the book is that of an epic saga, but it is an epic told in brief, intimate fragments. Particularly fascinating are the tales which capture the complex relationships between the human colonists and the native Martians.&quot;Chronicles&quot; is at times whimsical, at times painful, at times ironic. But Bradbury's vision is always rich in compassion and insight. This is truly one of those science fiction masterworks which both transcends and ennobles the genre. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"at a brief point in my life when I was interested in astronomy and otherworldly planets, this was among one of my favorite books to read in high school instead of listening to my boring teachers. This collection of Bradbury's short stories are quite far fetched from being even remotely possible, which is what makes this book unique in it's own way mixing the fantastic and the sci-fi-istic (is there such a word? now there is :) and sometimes the horrific. Some of the short stories are chained together, usually containing the same characters but all have their own struggles and quarrels. What also makes this Mars-fic book unique is how Bradbury put most of Earth's worst problems on Mars--genocide, pollution, religious fanaticism, greed, censorship, racism, war... you name it. Yet Bradbury also confronts these harrowing realities/possibilities with a glimmer of hope, without being phony about it (as in, he took subjects seriously in this book, instead of making it a mindless action-packed-explosions-and-stunts story. Jules Verne is smiling in his grave). and yes, The Martian Chronicles contains the same style of vivid imagery and mental paintings that Bradbury is well known for. The only complaint I have is that I remember a couple stories I had to read 2 or 3 times before I could understand what's going on. overall, this is a classic piece of literature from an era when it seemed that -everyone- wrote about Mars, only what makes this different is that Bradbury put thought and effort into this work."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"As the paranoia and fear of the early stages of the Cold War escalated and the prospect of global destruction in an atomic war crystallized into a terrifying possibility, a pioneering trip to a more placid Mars must have seemed welcoming. As early successes with the development of technology such as \\"Sputnik\\" made a an exploration of this magnitude a likely technological achievement within the next few decades, manned exploration and the colonization of Mars no doubt evolved into a sexy and exciting dream, indeed.Bradbury's series of loosely connected vignettes set against the backdrop of America's first landing on Mars, the false starts and failures of several expeditions and the spread of disease resulting in the elimination of a planet's entire population, actually constitute a scathing critique of what he saw as the worst failings of the social fabric of 1950s America - imperialism, bigotry and racial prejudice, xenophobia, guns, environmental pollution, waste, foreign policy, censorship, and the untrammeled growth of technology all wrapped up in the unfailing smug sense of superiority that the American way is the only way!\\"The Martian Chronicles\\" is not a straightforward read. In the opening chapters, a light and fluffy approach borders on inane as the reader is left wondering precisely what is happening. It's only perseverance that will lead the reader to a more profound understanding and appreciation of Bradbury's intention. \\"Way in the Middle of the Air\\", for instance, is perhaps the most moving single piece of writing I have ever experienced - extraordinary in its simplicity and yet blistering in its condemnation of the treatment of blacks in the American south in the 50s. Finally, the reader will be rewarded with the warm, optimistic closing of \\"The Million Year Picnic\\". This is perhaps the only story in the entire collection in which I believe Bradbury really is talking about the future and the possible colonization of another planet. It is his simple suggestion that these efforts would be doomed to an extended and painful failure if Americans attempt to shape another planet into the mould of their US-centric terrestrial expectations. Only through adaptation and the re-formulation of society according to what the planet will allow, would such colonization be expected to prosper.Everyone who reads to the end of this story will wonder whether it should be considered as science fiction at all but nobody will harbour the smallest doubt that the term \\"Classic\\" is richly deserved.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This was the first Ray Bradbury novel that I have ever read and it definitely will not be my last. &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; is a set of many short stories about the people of Earth landing on Mars and making a brand new civilization. All of the ideas that are in the stories are great and the stories can be broken down so you can identify themes that Ray Bradbury wanted the reader to learn.&quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; was written during the first half of the twenty first century and I'm sure that it is still a fascinating read today as it was when it first came out. Bradbury had all of the stories take place from 1999 all the way to 2026 and it is very interesting to notice how almost nothing that was in Bradbury's futuristic novel has happened thus far in the history of the world.Most of the stories of this book are very interesting and can be enjoyed whether you read one or two and read none for a while or whether you read the book from cover to cover, enjoying this book like it holds many fragments to what may be a future that can end up happening. The people that make the journey to Mars leave for a variety of reasons. People may be leaving Earth to start a new and better life, to get away from Earth and it's events, to escape being punished for a crime commited on Earth, or to get away from the atomic war that is predicted to happen on Earth. This book holds the stories to the people that make the journey to the red planet and the stories contain just fragments of their lives there.Bradbury brings forth many issues that may have been very important when the book was written but that are not very important to today's general population. Things that Bradbury brings forward are that one person in the book may find a certain thing okay but are not okay to someone else, human nature and man's want to own all and rule all, and other things such as love. &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; is a very important novel for anybody to read. You don't only have to be a science fiction fan to appreciate the important things that this novel teaches. On top of teaching, however, this novel entertains greatly. I gave this novel four stars because I thought that there were a few mediocre stories, but these stories don't really detract from the overall enjoyment of the novel. This is a must read.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This is one of Ray Bradbury's best books next to \\"Fahrenheit 451\\". It is an easy-to-read sci-fi, but I really do not want to call it science fiction, since it was written by Ray Bradbury.The story is not easily described except to say it is about the colonization of Mars. The landscape and life on Mars is described and very interestingly. The book ends with a timeless theme set against the realities of nuclear war.Read it, you'll enjoy the ideas, the scope, and the way words are created."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The book was in excellent condition, but the cover shown was orange, like the one i was looking for,but the one i got was a newer updated cover. would have liked to have the one that was pictured"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Bradbury is a master of social commentary. His books consistently hold up the mirror, challenging us to face the best and worst in human nature, and \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" is no different.The story is set in the early twenty-first century, making its exploration of Mars dated. Although reading more like a cohesive series of short stories, \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" provides an interesting view of mankind's urge to find something better out there, a paradise, an escape. At times frightening, at times beautiful and haunting, the stories touch on very human elements.At its core, this collection seems intent to explore the motives and ethics of space exploration. This theme rings true and has parallels to America's global tactics. Bradbury's tight prose and weighty themes prove once again why he is a master of his genre."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Clever, intriguing, and suprising!

Now that I just finished re-reading it, I'm overwhelmed by all the details, and by the incredible irony of a destroyed alien civilization. From the first page to the last, this book captures me. Hunamity is so incredibly destructive, that even the world itself is destoyed. And humanity is so incredibly stupid, it doesn't see what's coming. Irony abounds, from chapters to the whole book. Humans come to Mars, and are killed by Martians. As a result of their contact, the entire martian civilzation is destroyed by the chicken pox. Of all possible ways to die. The humans who come over, for the most part, have little regard for the ancient cities. The settlers wanted to get away from sifling Earth, but wind up destoying the last few traces of Martian civilization. If you like your view of humanity to always be rosy, forget this book. You'll hate it. But if you're willing to get a glimpse into the possible future, don't pass this book up."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Ray Bradbury's Martian Chronicles is a story the holds many things true today even if the story itself is not a reality, and probably never will be. Bradbury once again takes a cynic's position to writing as he has in other works (Fahrenheit 451) and includes many of the problems that man faced during his day and that man faces in ours. Bradbury's style of writing is very unique in this book as well, in that rather then focusing on one specific set of characters, he jumps around with different characters all the time. The Book could be considered more a interconnected collection of short stories as opposed to a novel.The short stories in the book are all well written each including their own set of characters. Some chapters do include some of the same characters, giving it the feeling that one part of the novel was connected to another.I especially enjoyed the chapter titled \\"Usher II\\". In this chapter a man is fighting the system that he will no longer be a part of. In this chapter Bradbury does a few interesting things. First, it seems that he connects this book to his one of his other books, Fahrenheit 451 from the quote, \\" \`Of course.' Stendahl snorted delicately, a combination of dismay and contempt. \`How could I expect you to know blessed Mr. Poe? He died long ago, before Lincoln. All of his books were burned in the Great Fire. That's thirty years ago-1975.'\\" (Page 134). I have read Fahrenheit 451 and immediately picked up the connection, whether intentional or not by Bradbury I do not know, but it interested me that he connected his books together. If you have not read Fahrenheit 451 I suggest you do as it is another of Bradbury's great contributions to literature. Bradbury also pokes a little bit of fun a fellow author, Ernest Hemingway, in this chapter. In another quote by Stendahl, \\"Just as you put a stake through the heart of Halloween and told your film producers that if they made anything at all they would have to make and remake Ernest Hemingway. My God, how many times have I seen For Whom the Bell Tolls done! Thirty different versions. All realistic. Oh, Realism! Oh, here, oh, now. Oh Hell!\\" (Page 137). In this chapter Bradbury also depicts the stupidity humans. It yet another quote by Stendahl (can you tell he's my favorite character yet?) \\"Garrett?\\" called Stendahl softly. Garrett silenced himself. \\"Garrett,\\" said Stendahl, \\"do you know why I've done this to you? Because you burned Mr. Poe's books without really reading them. You took other people's advice that they needed burning. Otherwise you'd have realized what I was going to do to you when we came down here a moment ago. Ignorance is fatal, Mr. Garrett.\\" (Page 147).Of course, this is just a small hint at what the entire book has to offer. The entire book is full of points and questions that make you wonder about this world. There was nothing I did not like about this book, I sped through it faster then any book I had ever read before, I recommend everyone read it."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I finally sat down and read this novel -- a collection of loosely-linked short stories, really -- and caught myself comparing it to the sophisticated sci-fi of recent years. If I had kept up that mindset, I'm sure I would have rated it lower. But...Think back (those of you who can remember) to the days when the giants of sci-fi roamed the Earth: Bradbury. Asimov. Anderson. Clarke. Farmer. There was something fundamental, something elemental, about their writing, born of the dime novel and magazine column-inch, that you don't have today. That gritty, anti-Bronte sense where character development didn't matter as much because the writer's energy was going into creating a universe that heretofore didn't exist.Bradbury's Martian Chronicles is all this and more. In some ways, it is a Western, where the Martians are the (dare I say it?) Indians and clutzy Earth Men are the Europeans come to take what was never theirs. Like all great novels, it is a mirror, a dark one at that.All Science Fiction poses a question: if the laws of the Universe behaved thus-and-so, what would the outcome be? The Martians are a sophisticated and cultured race of telepaths and time-travelers, and are about to meet up with homicidal and self-absorbed Man. What will the outcome be? Bradbury doesn't flinch from painting an all-too-likely ending.Four stars, however, because Martian Chronicles, while a classic, has not stood the test of time well. It does owe almost too much to its noble and humble roots, and reads far more like a set of magazine articles than a homogeneous novel. Still, it is well worth reading, and gives a good glimpse into the glory that science fiction used to be."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"If it were not for NBC's wonderful and faithful mini-series adaptation of Ray Bradbury's classic novel, I would not have ever read it. Since viewing British director Michael Anderson's six-hour mini-series from 1979, I have read Ray Bradbury's science fiction classic on more than one occassion. With each reading, it gets better and better. I'd have to say that The Martian Chronicles is my favorite book of all time. Not just in the science fiction genre, but in the literary genre, period. It is a mesh of both space mythology and space opera, that seamlessly, if not smoothly, fits into the science fiction genre. It also acts as a mirror for humanity itself. Especially when it comes to Man's arrogance and perpetual tendency for ruining big, beautiful things. Let alone, Man's nasty habits of violence and destruction.From 1999 to 2026 AD, The Martian Chronicles tells the story of man going to Mars. Of learning the Martian Way Of Life, and about itself. Leaving Earth on the brink of destruction, Man colonizes Mars, and in a sense, Mars conquers Man itself. It also conveys a message about how Man could enjoy life to its fullest and derive pleasure from the gift of pure being. A life that is beneficial and totally devoid of destructive tendencies.To this day, The Martian Chronicles is still considered to be a science fiction classic. In many ways, it is the great science fiction novel novel ever produced. Ray Bradbury has given science fiction fans a wonderful, if not surreal, adventure that could teach the human race, or to be more precise, humanity itself, a better way of life. The scene between John Wilder and Jeff Spender is one example of this. Especially the scene concerning Tomas and the Martian in the dead Martian city.If enjoy classic science fiction that has not been affected by Hollywood, then you will enjoy this epic science fiction adventure. I would also recommend the 1979 NBC six-hour mini-series adaptation of this book, too. Both are just as memorable and thought-provoking, if not deep when it comes to its philosophical storyline."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"An interesting tale of how humans interact with another world. The premise of colonization is tertiary to the actual stories that abound in this series written over 50 years ago.The stories themselves are vignettes that tell of life on Mars, but in classic Brabury style, they have other tales to tell. Principle to the first few stories is the human race's 'virus like' defeat of the Martian planet's defenses. Is Bradbury staking an early claim to a title of environmentalist? Another is the constant examples of how humans who are seeking to escape problems on Earth simply recreate them on Mars.Political corrrectness is most definitely lacking in some stories, but the overall brilliance of the series should not be pulled down by overzealous censors.This is an excellent SciFi series that should be read by all who call themselves fans of the genre."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"When I read Ray Bradbury books I cannot shake off the feeling that reality is constantly replaced with fantasy and fantasy is replaced with reality.

It stuck with me. Bradbury is a deft satirist -- he makes many excellent points about modern society through his allegorical look at the exploration on Mars. I found the book fascinating, challenging, and yet not too hard to read. I don't particularly like the use of the short story format -- I think if he'd written it as a novel rather than interconnected short stories, it would've worked even better. I also found it a bit violent at times; I'd have preferred to have the violence be a bit more implied than stated. But overall, I think this is an important work that everyone, sci fi fan or not, should probably read for the underlying message about accepting others. The book is as relevant today as it was when it was first published."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend, and I started and finished it today. It starts with a bang, and after that its all uphill. This book gives the cold hard facts of mankind, how we pilfer, and destroy everything we touch.

Yes, some of it seems outdated, and Bradbury seems to view the colonization of Mars under Manifest Destiny, i.e., American expansion, but the stories could've been written yesterday. And the images are fresh and vivid, like holograms that melt like wax and people seeing the plumes of fire from the blue marble. These descriptions are fresh and vivid. One can read this as a novel or as a collection of short stories, which is originally what Bradbury intended. I love this book so much!"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Ray Bradbury wrote a lot of short stories set on Mars. 'The Martian Chronicles' collects most of them together in one book (missing out 'I, Mars', in which the last man on Mars automates a town in order to combat loneliness, and 'Dark they were, and Golden Eyed') arranged so as to form a loose story which, in typical Bradbury style, is actually about America, and not Mars at all. Bradbury is a writer first and a sci-fi writer second, and if you're expecting endless descriptions of nuclear propulsion you probably won't like this book. Because of this, it's one of the few sci-fi books from the period that hasn't dated. It's also one of the ultimate downers, but in a good way - the general tone is one of loneliness and despair, without being doomy. It's a shame that, judging by the lack of reviews, this book is so obscure nowadays, especially compared to his contemporaries Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke, neither of whom have aged as well."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"At the beginning, it was very confusing, because I had no idea what was going on. The first time a &quot;main character&quot; was about to be killed(in the first story) I thought, he can't die now, it's only page 5(or something like that). Then he died, and I was like, well, what is the rest of the book supposed to be like then?! I soon found out that there were many different stories. I don't particularly like sci-fi novels, but this one was pretty entertaining, I have to admit. It was kinda neat how when the author wrote this book(around the 1950's, I think) he thought that by the year 2000, people would actually be visiting and living on Mars. If you liked Fahrenheit 451, you'll like this book."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Presented is an interesting take on a \\"futuristic\\" takeover of Mars by inhabitors of the third planet from the Sun. What transpires is a series of expeditions to Mars by men from America.They are greeted with everything from murderous rage, indifference, nostalgia, and an extinct planet.Throughout the tale, which spans a period of 27 years, there are hints of a global breakdown on Earth, which is slowing tearing itself apart.While an entertaining read, the only complaint that I have is that this reads like a collection of tales, with only slight hints at continuity throughout the novel. Otherwise, I very much recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"At first, I though that Bradbury's discription of Martian life was kind of simplistic... just Earth things in a different color. However, as different entrees of the martian chronicles indicated, martian life was more advanced than I had realized.The overall plot of the book does not seem to make sense until the reader realizes that each segment is a mini-story. BUT in the end, all of the stories are connected, but just in minor ways.Each of Bradbury's little stories has a different \\"flavor\\" to them. Some of them are even creepy. Reading this book at night gave a me a rush on a few occasions. Its not too bad though.I really thought it was interesting to see what the view of technology of the new millenium in 1950.

Reading these stories reminds me of these days. Luckily, the end of the book did not happen as Bradbury predicted, but it is a good snapshot of the mental attitude and the social beliefs of this era of time. It has not aged well, to be truthful, but if you can get behind the veil of time and return to those days, you will enjoy these stories. My version had the story about all the African-Americans leaving for Mars, so I'm not sure what some of these reviews are grousing about."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The astronauts have landed on Mars, but they see not barren wastes but a green town from 1926 in Illinois.

Somewhere else a phonograph, scratchy and faded, was hissing out a record of 'Roamin' in the Gloamin,' sung by Harry Lauder.\\"Now the phonograph record being played was:'Oh, give me a June nightThe moonlight and you....\\"...They set foot upon the porch. Hollow echoes sounded from under the boards as they walked to the screen door. Inside they could see a bead curtain hung across the hall entry, and a crystal chandelier and a Maxfield Parrish painting framed on one wall over a comfortable Morris chair.

In a distant kitchen, because of the heat of the day, someone was preparing a cold lunch. Someone was humming under her breath, high and sweet....\\"Of course, everything is not as it appears."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Having read numerous Bradburian works, a predominant theme emerges. Ray Bradbury's prowess as a crafter of science fiction lies not solely in the realm of Verne or Wells, depicting fantastic technology in an alien world, whether it be in the far reaches of space or 20,000 leagues under the sea. Rather, he highlights heavily upon social phenomena in the context of a futuristic environment; gadgets and new-fangled interplanetary transportation appear as merely garnish, an element of setting rather than theme.Chronicles is no different. In the very same manner of Farenheit 451, Bradbury brilliantly illustrates the rise and fall of social practices, removing terrestrial constraints in an alien setting. An ancient race of martians is exterminated by disease, subsequently replaced by human life, and in turn, a saga of the growth of America emerges. From the character of a post-modern Johnny Appleseed to the emotional disconnection and physical separation of a nuclear showdown on the neighboring Earth, Bradbury ironically highlights the American heritage while alighting upon the social implications of modern-day practices such as nuclear proliferation.Although the novel is naturally a series of installments compiled into a single entity, the piece flows remarkably well from subject to subject, following a chronological structure and drawing upon previously described events. For the fan of Ray Bradbury, individual filled with ardor for the genre of science fiction, or even the casual peruser of pages, The Martian Chronicles proves to be a highly satisfying read."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury is more or less an in-depth timeline about the humanization of the planet Mars. It starts off with the stories of the first three missions to Mars, which all failed. The third mission ended up giving all of the Martians Chicken Pox, which also killed them. The fourth mission brought the first permanent settlers to the strange planet. Soon people such as explorers, entrepreneurs, and the entirety of certain races, such as the African Americans, came to live there.The planet became commercialized and prosperous while Earth was busy struggling with nuclear war. When nuclear war finally broke on Earth, they sent radio signals to the humans on Mars to tell them to come back because they would no longer be able to supply them. The flight that took all of the humans back disappeared and all that was left were a few humans left on Mars. The irony of the book is that since there were no more humans on Earth, the few humans on Mars named themselves Martians. I liked this book very much and it was the one of the best science fiction books I have read.I liked the irony of the entire book in general. I thought it was very clever that the last remaining humans lived on Mars. The last remaining family called themselves Martians and, in a way, it reminded me of the beginning of Earth.I liked how the book was a lot like a timeline. It wasn't too long so you could grasp a sense of exactly how long this humanization process took. There were many interesting and different stories in the book, which I greatly enjoyed. I also thought it was interesting that the Martians were so different from the humans.I enjoyed the description and detail that was put into the book. It was amazing that the author could fit it into those short stories. It really was what connected the stories to one another. When I was reading the book I had a perfect visual of the Martians in my head.I enjoyed this book very much. Out of the few Science Fiction books I have read, this one was my favorite. It was the most believable book about the future. In fact, I could imagine this actually happening, except hundreds of years later (the book was set in 2000-2026) and on a different planet.-T. Alger"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"In Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles, the notion is developed that nostalgia is an extremely powerful force. It can be comforting and pleasant when seeking a diversion from the burdens of reality, but at times it can also be dangerous. This theme is eminent in several of the stories in this collection, including The Third Expedition, and The Martian.In The Third Expedition, a crew of astronauts land on Mars and find an innocuous-looking town populated by long-deceased family members. At first the men are truly happy for the first time in a while. But, as Bradbury unfolds this tale, the people turn out to be Martians, who have used these buried memories to lure the unsuspecting astronauts into a deadly trap. But at the final moment of terrifying realization, it is too late. This moment is written with slow, chilling horror by Bradbury:\\"And wouldn't it be horrible and terrifying to discover that all of this was part of some great plan by the Martians to divide and conquer us, and kill us? Sometime during the night, perhaps, my brother here on this bed will change, form, melt, shift, and become another thing, a terrible thing, a Martian. It would be very simple for him just to turn over in bed and put a knife into my heart. And in all those other houses down the street, a dozen other brothers or fathers suddenly melting away and taking knives and doing things to the unsuspecting, sleeping men of Earth...\\" (Bradbury 47)A similar theme is used in another story, The Martian. In this story, the theme that is developed is people's inability to escape the past. An elderly couple takes in what appears to be an abandoned child who looks surprisingly like their dead son. Little do they know, however, that their \\"son\\" is actually a Martian who is able to disguise himself by simulating their son's face. The Martian does not have any ulterior motive, he is only seeking a home and to be accepted and loved. In fact, that is his talent, as described by Bradbury in this passage:\\" \`That's true.' The voice hesitated. \`But I must consider these people now. How would they feel if, in the morning, I were gone again, this time for good? Anyway, the mother knows what I am; she guessed, even as you did. I think they all guessed but didn't question. You don't question Providence. If you don't have the reality, a dream is just as good. Perhaps I'm not their dead one back, but I'm something almost better to them; an ideal shaped by their minds. I have a choice of hurting them or your wife.\\" (Bradbury 127).Unfortunately, the other people realize this, and in this creature they see the silent ruins of a past long forgotten, and unintentionally kill him through the power of their false hope.Another theme that is examined in The Martian Chronicles is the dividing line between reality and illusion. In the story called Night Meeting, an Earthman and a Martian meet on a dusty, deserted road, only to discover that each is an impalpable phantom to the other and that each sees a completely different Mars. Their shock at their discoveries is eminent:\\"The Martian touched his own nose and lips. \`I have flesh,' he said, half aloud. I am alive.'Tomas stared at the stranger. \`And if I am real, then you must be dead.\`No, you!'\`A ghost!'\`A phantom!'\\" (Bradbury 82).Each individual is unavoidably unique and sees the world in their own way. This, according to Bradbury, is evident in this story.The Martian Chronicles is a science-fiction collection, but it actually bears many startling resemblances to our own world, our own life. Beneath this beautiful poetic fantasy lies myriads upon myriads of biting social criticism. For example, the story titled Way In The Middle Of The Air relates the dismay and shock of a group of white racists when they discover that all the local blacks are emigrating to Mars. This, of course, can be interpreted as a passionate condemnation of bigotry and racial prejudice. The racists are cruel, ignorant and cannot imagine an existence without potential victims.Another story, titled Usher II, deals with a group of bureaucrats who come to Mars to try and limit the settlers' freedom, both politically and imaginatively. In response to this movement, a man named Stendahl builds a lifelike replica of the House of Usher, inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's famous story, The Fall Of The House Of Usher, peopling with a series of deadly traps taken from various Poe stories. The bureaucrats, who are criticized for their ignorance and lack of imagination, (something I see every day) are dealt with promptly, swiftly and severely. This story has been noted for its vehement disapproval of censorship.There are not many works of literature that can be compared with The Martian Chronicles, as it is a very unusual kind of book. Its style is rather akin to that of a prose poem, which is how many people have chosen to interpret this work of Bradbury's. Although this type of book may not be common in mainstream fiction, it is more common in the genre of science-fiction.Bradbury's name has always been synonymous with the genre of science-fiction and although his heavy use of adjectives and metaphors may seem slightly wearing today, he remains one of the most sophisticated writers in the genre. Or in any genre, for that matter. In a style that is precise yet eerily poetic, Bradbury manages to describe, with all the grace and imagination of a master, this utterly alien yet strangely familiar world.He is quite fond of similes, using them often in his transitional passages. He describes \\"housewives lumbering like great black bears in their furs along the icy streets\\" (Bradbury 1) in Rocket Summer, or the landing of the rockets in The Locusts:\\"The rockets came like drums, beating in the night. The rockets came like locusts, swarming and settling in blooms of rosy smoke.\\" (Bradbury 78).A lot of the poetic language in The Martian Chronicles is rich with symbolism. This gives it the quality of allegory, which helps to add depth to Bradbury's fiction.For instance, when Bradbury compares the rockets to a swarm of pesky locusts, he helps to enhance his theme of the dangers of reckless exploration.What readers remember most about The Martian Chronicles is what I have just described: complex, surrealistic passages that create Bradbury's dream-like, wondrous and fantastical vision of the fourth planet beyond the sun."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Ray Bradbury's, The Martian Chronicles is a novel that is focused on one theme, but contains different stories. The theme is the effect of humans exploring or living on another planet, Mars, which is already inhabited by Martians. Throughout the novel, humans send four expeditions to Mars to explore the new world, but they are stopped or killed by the Martians. Several stories within the novel tell what life is like when the Martians no longer exist due to their extinction from the humans and how the new world is governed. Soon, everyone wanted the opportunity to be able to start a new life on a new planet. At first the wealthy and powerful were able to take a rocket to the planet and later anyone was able to live on the planet including African American slaves. After several years of humans living on the planet, news breaks out that an atomic war is happening and humans begin to go back to their home planet in support. The planet remains uninhabited except for one man who was left behind when the people went back to earth. This man begins to go mentally insane due to being so lonely on the planet and ends up wondering it. Some short stories are encounters with the Martians in a different dimension, humans begin to see their dead loved ones, and the beginning of the migration by African American slaves to the planet.This novel is great for a person who enjoys reading science fiction. In generations to come, the space exploration of the universe will begin to grow and humans may be able to sustain life on other planets. This novel was written in 1950, and it is what Ray Bradbury pictured the future to be. The exploration of space in our future may be what the author pictured it to be in 1950. The Martian Chronicles is a novel for any age that is able to comprehend what is happening within the short stories. It may be difficult for a younger person to understand how the stories relate to each other and also understand the relationship of the stories to the theme of the novel. I enjoyed reading this novel. It is one of the best novels I have read. What captivated me the most is the amount of mental imagery this novel brought to me. Thinking of the future 50 years from now would almost be impossible. The lifestyles of humans are constantly changing. The fact that Bradbury had the ability to describe the future also captivated me as well.The novel has a several connections to the science and/or technology theme. In one case, the novel is based on the science of space exploration. It is easy to see the differences between the launching of rockets to the modern day shuttle launchings. The government spends billions of dollars on the NASA program to explore new worlds just like in the novel. Humans have only been able to explore the moon and remote modules have been sent to the planet Mars. In the novel, life existed on Mars as well as space exploration that explored even farther past Mars. People used the planet's materials to build houses and in other cases, houses and cities were built as they are built today. When people would leave the planet earth, they were limited to the amount of belongings they were able to take. What about the required materials and technologies to the build cities and the houses? They were the main priority and were sent to the planet first. One short story is about a house that maintains itself and the family that lives there. The house does the chores that a human would normally have to do. Imagine a house of the future that is able to cook, cut the grass, and clean the house without human intervention. Life for humans on earth would be much easier.The Martian Chronicles has a lot more connections to the science and technology theme, but that is for you to read and find out. Enjoy reading the novel and follow your imagination while reading."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Even under the guise of a sci-fi book, this book, as other reviewers have pointed out along with the editorials, it is a comment on humanity it the human condition. Even to the point of Man bringing his fears and strong desires to Mars and, after &quot;conquering&quot; the Martians, becoming &quot;Martians&quot; himself. A great work, just like the other sci-fi works I own and love, both new and old: &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Puppet Masters&quot;, &quot;Foundation&quot;, &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, &quot;Ringworld&quot;, all the &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; books, as well as books as new to the genre as &quot;Advent of the Corps&quot; and others."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Bradbury came up with a totally original idea of instead of having the aliens the ones who come to our planet and explore, it is instead the humans who are the curious ones and search mars for life. Bradbury mixes the old and the new by having the humans and aliens switch roles when it comes to alien abductions.I, personally, like how Bradbury gave all the Martians telepathy, which enabled them to speak in all languages. But since all the aliens are telepathic they all know what everyone else does which makes the story much more interesting and a lot more difficult to write. That&iexcl;s why I admire Bradbury&iexcl;s work. I also enjoy how Bradbury doesn't follow the other books in the alien genre. This new idea has discovered a new form of Martian science fiction.Although Bradbury didn't give much thought to creating the characters' names, he did a wonderful job on creating an exciting page-turner that has an interesting new twist at every page. Bradbury can always find away to make each page unique and exciting, whether it&iexcl;s sending the humans to a Martian insane asylum or having the Martians move to the planet earth. I believe that this book will be the start of a whole new way of writing alien books."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I liked it because it took a look at human nature"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"50's Science fiction at its Best"},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"I for one am not a big fan of sci fi books,novels or movies.

This book is very good for someone w/a good creative immagination.It had very creative inventions in it, such as the metal books and the flamming birds.Not one particular story stuck out at me.Maybe if I had a bigger interest in sci fi I might have enjoyed it more,and or thought about the book deeper."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"&quot;Martian Chronicles&quot; is an average book. It isn't something I would read for personal enjoyment, but I didn't really mind reading it as a class assignment. It had a lot of original ideas and a weird twist that made you want to keep reading. The class discussions based on the concepts of the stories were interesting and actually got my class in some heated debates. My least favorite chapter was &quot;Ylla&quot;. As the first basic chapter of the book I thought it should have been more interesting. It made me not want to read the rest of the book. It was too confusing and boring. Thankfully, the rest of the book got better as it went on. My favorite chapter was &quot;Usher II&quot;. This chapter had me turning the pages as fast as I could. It gave the book a bit of a horror novel twist. I would reccomend this book for a class assignment, but that's about all."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"Martian Chronicles was an enjoyable and entertaining book. It made me look at the way things lived differently from they way I do. Even though the book got boring at times, it still grabbed my attention enough to finsih it. One chapter I dont believe kept my interest very well was The Silent Towns. It didn't really go along with the story too well. Walter Gripp and Genevive may have been the last two on the planet but the chapter after that had people living once again. The whole deal about Walter not liking her for her bringing the wedding dress didn't really make sense it was more because of her personality and looks. The chapter that I like the most was Way in The Middle of The Air. I liked the whole situation where Silly and all the other blacks took a stand for what they believed in and left for Mars. It just gave s sensation of how people are prejudice and that the slaves didn't deserve the treatment and weren't going o take it any longer. For those who read this review keep in mind that this is only my oppinion and you dont have to agree with it. I enjoyed the book for the most part but then again it lagged here and there.

My least favorite section in the book was Ylla, and my most favorite was -And the Moon Be Still as Bright. Really I liked the last chapter the most, for the simple fact that it was THE LAST, and I knew that Ild be finished soon. I read the first 3-4 sections hopoing that it would get better, and then when it didn't, I had to force myself to finish it, so that I wouldn't fail the exam over it.

I like how they have mini stories in the book even though it gets confusing. It's pretty funny of how in 1999 people can go to Mars, but Bradbury had a good imgination.If you are an African-American who gets offended easily by racial slurs. I'm not sure that this would be the book for you, because in a mini story there is a white man who just criticizes and threatens a character,who is black and uses racial slurs.Anyway I'll keep this book, it's a book I'll remember for some time."},{"Title":"The Martian Chronicles (Time Reading Program)","review":"We, an English course at a German Gymnasium, rate the book, The Martian Chronicles, a two because the structure of the book seemed quite confusing to us.

There were some parts that I understood very well like the gruesome parts were the martian kills the astronauts that were making up hallucinations and then commits suicide himself. One thing about the book that was weird was that the humans are invisible to the martians and the martians are invisible to the humans, but somehow they still saw each other. For example, the city of humans was not seen by the martians because of their transparency and the martians thought that the humans were not even there. The humans thought that they were settling the planet by themselves but really the martians were all over the place. This book was also different because of racial hatred present in these years. How blacks were treated like they were in the fifties. Also the martians treated the white astronauts like the whites treated the blacks.
