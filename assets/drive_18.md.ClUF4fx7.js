The medieval parts, especially, seemed pretty realistic. I enjoyed Kivrin's struggles with Middle English before the translating device finally kicked in. The characters in the 2ist Century were mostly meant to be droll, I know, but I didn't find them all that amusing. Yeah, the ending was sad. Too bad Kivrin's rescuers couldm't have gotten there in time to save one or two of her friends. Actually, for a while I thought Father Roche was going to turn out to be a time traveler, too. The way he prayed was similar to the way Kivrin talked into her 'corder. Moreover, we have to suppose that the art of time travel was pursued and refined way past the 21st Century--in fact, into the indefinite future. So why could Roche not have been a traveller from, say, the 25th Century? It would have made for a more interesting book...."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Interesting concept.The story started too slowly, and the ending gave me that warm, fuzzy feeling.The historical perspective was interesting, but hardly worth a novel. Perhaps this story should have stayed a novella?I don't think this is as good as the hype."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I greatly looked forwarding to reading this one because I had heard good things about it. Like the ultimately disappointing \\"Passages\\", I found this one fairly absorbing until the inevitable depressing conclusion. Part of the problem with the book is that the \\"twist\\" (ie, where or when did Kivrin actually end up) is not very well guarded. The little review blurbs on the first page of my paperback copy gave it away. And honestly, it wasn't that surprising a twist in the first place. And without that element of surprise, much of the buildup of this book is pointless.I was even confused as to why I found it absorbing, because I kept thinking \\"nothing has actually happened yet\\". And really, the plot doesn't involve much more than a whole lot of death. And if you aren't prepared for that, I don't think you'll like it.I think some of the plot devices are contrived, and like others have said, people kept fainting at inopportune moments, to drag things out even further. The characters were exceptionally slow at figuring things out that I had guessed early on in the book, which was annoying.There is some interesting symbolism (like the Virgin Mary statue in the bar that Dunworthy keeps knocking down - and ooh, Kivrin is wearing blue). Bells are another symbol - bells seem to signal transitions - through from past to present and present to past and from life to death and death to life. Which I did think was pretty cool, except that I couldn't help but feel that the American bell-ringers were there for the sole purpose of servicing that bit of symbolism. They had no other real purpose in the story.And has no one heard of cell-phones, email, or answering machines in the future?All and all, I was disappointed in this book - it's graphic, depressing and ultimately leaves one feeling heavy, not uplifted as the back cover promised."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Doomsday Book, by Connie Willis, is a futuristic book on history. It's the year 2054, and historians have the luxury of going back in time and immersing themselves in past events. A gung-ho student gets sent to the Middle Ages in England in the 14th century. Unfortunately, the timing is a bit off (time travel is an imperfect science) and she ends up in a village just days before the plague bacillus arrives.Bummer.In the meantime, in 2054, a viral epidemic is affecting the ability of anyone to come to her rescue.Double bummer.The book is called Doomsday Book because the student picks that title to chronicle her trip to the Middle Ages, and because one of her teachers is worried about her visit to this time period.She should have listened.The book plods along, and the repetitive nature of the 21st century laments, \\"What went wrong, what went wrong?\\" scenes got real old, real fast. The book is saved only through the detail Willis goes into regarding life in the 14th century.Life in the 14th century stinks, literally.Frankly, I'm surprised this book won any awards, let alone the Hugo and Nebula. It's not bad. It's just not... fine science fiction."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Willis is one of the very best writers of our generation and she has half a dozen each of Hugos and Nebulas to prove it. This is far and away her best book yet, and it won both awards. THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW called it a \\"tour de force\\", and they're not wrong. The setting is the university community in Oxford in the mid-21st century, which hasn't changed in its essentials since Victorian times. There are numerous casually mentioned technological gewgaws, but the academic world is still largely the same. The big change is that time travel is now available for historical research, which she first made use of in \\"Fire Watch.\\" Kivrin is an bright undergraduate who's eager to travel back to the early 14th century; Mr. Dunworthy is a volunteer tutor from another college who has very grave reservations about the whole project, largely because the colleague in charge is pompous and arrogant and has no idea what he's doing. But Kivrin goes through the \\"net\\"a few days before Christmas (there are ingenious reasons for the timing) -- and there the story abruptly bifurcates to become two exciting and appalling parallel plotlines with numerous points and characters in common. Kivrin, though she's had all her inoculations, is very ill when she arrives and is nursed back to health by a priest and the family of a minor knight who is away on legal business. Back in Oxford, the same disease strikes down the technician who sent Kivrin on her way, and the people he was in contact with begin dropping like flies. The world has already barely survived one pandemic a generation or two before (thirty million deaths just in the U.S., someone mentions) and the quarantine barriers are up almost immediately. Dunworthy's good friend, Dr. Mary Ahrens, takes charge and quickly has her hands full; her visiting great-nephew, Colin, provides much of the comic relief in Willis's dry style. About those parallels: Kivrin in her time and Dr. Ahrens in hers provide the medical expertise, such as it is, while Dunworthy and Kivrin's friend, Father Roche, follow orders and lend a hand. Even Colin has a parallel in the two young girls whom Kivrin takes in charge. Even God has a role in both centuries -- and not to forget the ancient bell tower and the modern bell-ringers from America. Willis is extremely skilled at making you care about her characters and you'll feel a pang when things begin to happen to them. There's comedy here to leaven the tragedy, just like real life. This is a book to re-read every few years, more for the fiction than for the science."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book is utterly intoxicating. I first read it many years ago; it is one of few books that remain fresh in my mind, and yet delivers more with each reading.This book is not for all comers; it is appropriately catagorized as Sci-Fi/Fantasy, and yet it is unusual in that catagory. There are no epic battles between good and evil for the fate of the world; there are no villians in the typical sense of the word. This book explores our perception of the universe and our place in it, and how we integrate the things that happen which are beyond our control. It is about people and how we relate to each other and our society. It is a book for mature and thoughtful readers, but not a book for when you are looking merely for entertainment and escapism. Don't pick it up if you are seeking action/adventure.Willis's writing is rich and detailed, smooth and elegant. The plot unfolds gracefully; the characterization is complex and well-developed. Doomsday Book characterizes the genre at its best."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Kivrin, a young student of history is sent back in time to 14th century England to learn about the lives of that time. Unfortunately, she leaves just as an epidemic breaks out at her university in Oxford, and she is herself infected. The story then follows parallel lines, telling of the influenza epidemic in 21st century Oxford, and the onset of the Black Death in Kivrin's villiage in the past.The main characters, Kivrin and one of her Oxford profs, are well rounded and memorable. You come to care about them and root for them in their trials. The 14th century villiage is a fascinating construction - presumably the author took 5 years to write the book because she was boning up on life in the 14th century. These people ring true, the life in the manor house especially so. Equally fascinating are a number of little true-to-life touches that Willis adds, both to the 21st and the 14th century stories - there is a subtle undercurrent of social commentary throughout. One such example (dear to my own heart) is a general misunderstanding of probability and statistics that pervades the non-scientific personel running the time-travel experiment. Some things never change!There are a few points that detract from the overall enjoyment of the book, most notably Willis's irritating tendency to allow her characters to blindly ignore the obvious for hundreds of pages after the reader has already figured out some important point. This wouldn't be so annoying if Willis didn't leave such obvious hints to both the reader and the character. Secondly, I have to question her description of the poor 14th century peasants. While I believe they would be dirty, have poor clothing, etc., I don't believe they would be so stupid (or lazy, or overworked) that they would not fill in the cracks in their walls with mud or straw, and simply allow the winter wind to blow through. I'm more inclined to agree with the descriptions in Crichton's Timeline: people may be superstitious and vicious, but that doesn't mean they are stupid.However, the narrative is engrossing, the characters well-written, and we get a fascinating glimpse into 14th century life. I prefer Timeline, that has more action, more science, and a more plausible time-travel system, but for character development and a thoughtful look at the timelessness of human nature, Willis's book is heartily recommended."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I am always searching for new science fiction, I figured that books that won acclaim and awards came highly recommended and this book had won two of them the Hugoand the Nebula awards. I don't know that I would concur with the awards. I did enjoy many aspects of the book, however I had several gripes. First of all, I thought because of the way she wrote the book it was too long, comprising of over 500 pages. I am not opposed to long books, as long as they are able to justify their length, which due to my other critiques I did not feel she accomplished.The premise of the book was intriguing: Time travel (a Sci Fi standard) where historian's in modern age (2050's) travel back in time to previous ages for study and observation. This book is about a young college girl Kirvin's journey to a medieval Christmas in 1320 England, to a small village just out side of Oxford.Willis does a great job of leading up to Kirvin's \\"drop\\", but from there, rather than focusing on the medieval story she alternates each chapter, back and forth between modern day. I found myself with really little care for the modern story line and was quite annoyed at how long she drug on certain points of the tale. For well over half of the book she beats to death the mysterious cause of a modern plague (which seemed rather anachronistic to me) and created unendingly tedious intrigue over what possibly had gone wrong with the drop. This got in the way of what I thought was Wilis's real power, rich detailed story telling regarding medieval life. This storyline was fascinating and insightful, largely due to Willis's extensive background research. The last fourth of the book was good read, where Willis finally wraps up the mysteries of the book and gets on with the anchor of the story. I won't spoil the ending, and you'll have to decide if the book sounds intriguing enough to read.My wife on the otherhad just finished this book and loved it...."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"&quot;Moving&quot; is an unusual summary for a science fiction book, but I was amazed at how much I cared for the many characters in this story. Willis places you in medieval Europe during the black death, and you feel the characters' pain, fears, hopes, and frustrations.It has been about a year since I read this book, but I was reminded of it after reading &quot;The Cobra Event.&quot; Doomsday provides a very vivid picture of life with a rampant disease over which we have not control spreading through society; Cobra reminds us that we may not be far away from reliving the experience.Definitely read Doomsday. If you get the chance, follow it up with The Cobra Event."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I stumbled upon Doomsday Book while browsing through the new release section at a public library. I read it back in 1993. After returning the book, I forgot the name. I have spent countless hours in bookstores and libraries describing the book to the sci-fi gurus in hopes that they could tell me the name. I've even spent many a hours here at Amazon trying to find Doomsday Book. Finally, I checked out Borders.com and found it. Borders has a fantastic search engine.I am not a sci-fi fan. All that techno stuff turns me off. But, I loved this book. The author paints a vivid landscape. What I loved most is the realistic descriptions of characters and living conditions.Can any of you reccommend other novels like Doomsday? I also liked The Alienist and I am looking forward to Lady in the Loch. Please email me with any reccommendations that you may have."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Yes, I agree that alot of the futuristic part of the novel is a little silly. But, honestly, I don't care. An English professor once made a comment to me that I feel can be applied to this novel. We were discussing &quot;comic relief.&quot; He told me &quot;Most people consider comic relief in the sense that the light moments provide a release of the tension built in the dramatic or tragic moments. But, in my opinion, the term is appropriate in another way: the comedy throws the tragedy into 'relief'--and makes it all the more harsh for the comparison.&quot; The bumblings of the whole &quot;future crew&quot; serve a purpose in &quot;The Doomsday Book.&quot; They show how, in a scientifically advanced society, disease can still wreak havoc among an unprepared populous. Even a world that understands disease and germs and contagion is vulnerable. Thus, how much more do we understand the confusion and superstition that ran rampant amongst the medieval plague victims! And for all those readers who condemned the book for a lack of connection between past and future, I recommend a basic course in literary symbolism. Trust me, it's there (just a hint: for the most obvious, let the bells lead the way!) Anyway, all this aside, read this book for the plague story. Period. It's fascinating and heartbreaking. I finished &quot;The Doomsday Book&quot; a week ago, and am now halfway through my second nonfiction book on the Plague. I can't help but recommend a book that peaks my interest in any subject (let alone such a tragic one!) to that extent."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"OK, OK, so there's really no suspense regarding just WHEN Kivrin wound up, but you KNOW you've got a great book in your hands when you can glare right back at errors like that and say, &quot;I don't care.&quot; And you don't, you really don't, because Willis handles the material so well. Leave the suspense for Dunworthy and Ahrens and all the rest from the future--YOU'RE too busy following Kivrin through an ice-encrusted, haunting medieval landscape, falling in love with characters (like Roche and the two little girls, Rosamund and Agnes), learning to dislike quite strongly such meanies as Lady Imeyne, and discovering (surprise, surprise!) that the Middle Ages was hardly the deeply chivalrous, romantic era it has often been made out to be. The ultimate tragedy is that you really find yourself CARING for the characters in the story. You can read in a text book that one third of the population died of this plague, but it is infinitely more moving to watch one or two characters you love become stricken and die. Willis does an excellent job of making 1348 and the people therein and the trials they faced accessible to a modern audience. And to those who found the book too depressing...I found it to be, ultimately, a message of hope for the faith and survival of the human spirit. The scene in which Kivrin tends the dying Father Roche at the end is incredibly moving and illustrates this point perfectly. To any Medieval buff, to anyone who's just plain interested in an excellently-crafted story, READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I bought this book on the strength of the very entertaining and funny \\"To say nothing of the Dog\\", thinking that this later work would be even better and more evolved.How utterly wrong I was. It is excruciatingly boring.The blurb says it was \\"five years in the writing\\". Well, aren't we all made to suffer and relive those five years of research. We have to sit through pages of gibberish before the \\"translator\\" kicks in; are treated to all sorts of historical anecdotes which are not interesting by themselves and do nothing for the story - they seem to be there only because the author did lots of research and wanted to cut-and-paste every single jotted note into the novel.The characters are mere cartoon caricatures and so obviously and clearly painted as the good-guy, bad-guy, irritating fool etc that we are given no chance to genuinely connect.The story moves so slowly and piainfully that you quickly get the urge to skim. That urge becomes even stronger as tedious scenes play out to an entirely predictable conclusion.The core problem is that you always know more than the characters in the book. That leads to a constant case of waiting for them to discover the bleedin' obvious; or waiting for person-X to finally contact person-Y; or reading page after page of a character's confused meanderings when you know exactly what's going on, but have to wait for them to realize it. You never discover things *with* a character, you are always pulling them by the arm trying to hurry them along to the obvious next step.This makes the whole thing maddeningly frustrating.I got about a third of the way through and just gave up. There is more dynamic action and plot twists in a wall of drying paint."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I don't really understand how this book has so many 5 star reviews and awards. All the characters in the future seem the same, and it feels like some medical drama with some time travel elements thrown in. I found myself starting to skip paragraphs, then entire pages, hoping something interesting would happen. Disappointment for me."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I so wanted to like this book, but its flaws put a huge shadow over its strengths.It's 2054. A mechanism for time travel has been discovered and has become a tool used by academics to study history. There are two central characters - James Dunworthy, a professor at Oxford, and Kivrin Engle, a history student. Kivrin travels, ostensibly, back to medieval England, 1320. The story alternates chapters between James Dunworthy, in 2054, trying to figure out if Kivrin is endangered and dealing with a virus that has quarantined the campus, and Kivrin, in the past, recovering from an illness and trying to find her way home.The chapters set in the past are interesting. Kivrin is an interesting person, as are the people she meets. The speculations of medieval life are interesting. The threat is tangible. Unfortunately, the chapters set in the future are not at all interesting and are not well written or thought out. The depictions of 2054 aren't at all believable - not even as the present, never mind the future. Dunworthy rushes around, trying to get a hold of people and constantly trying to get people to take messages for him when he's expecting a call. Apparently cell phones are no longer popular in 2054. Cell phones did exist when this novel was published, in 1992. The supporting characters of the future aren't well defined, either, but are instead a series of cliches. The events of the future become repetitious because there just isn't as much to the future story as to the past story.There are also some story choices made late in the book that I found disappointing and left me wondering about the point of the story.Doomsday Book won the Hugo and Nebula awards, so it was well received by critics - but I can't figure out why."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Winner of both the Hugo and Nebula Awards for science fiction, this book is a tour de force that is sure to captivate all those who love time travel themes, as well as those who have a deep appreciation for medieval history. The author masterfully melds these two genres, creating a novel that is riveting and highly entertaining.The year is 2048 A.D., and a young history student named Kivrin is preparing to do an on site study of the turbulent fourteenth century. Her mission has placed two of the University's professors at cross purposes, as the proponent for this study, Mr. Gilchrist, finds himself pitted against Mr. Dunworthy, Kivrin's mentor, who believes that this trip in time is far too dangerous. Mr. Gilchrist, however, is in the position to have the final say on the project.Kivrin is scheduled to land in the rural English countryside of the fourteenth century some twenty years before the Black Death savages England. Armed with the knowledge of fourteenth century customs, dress, languages, religious practices, and history, Kivrin is raring to go back in time. When she travels back, however, an unforeseen crisis in the present places Kivrin in a potentially deadly situation upon her arrival in the past.The book alternates between what is happening in the present and what is happening in the past, as those in the present work to unravel the mystery of what went wrong. Meanwhile, Kivrin struggles to overcome the anomalous situations she encounters that run contra to her expectations. Believing herself stranded in the past, Kivrin artfully maneuvers around the precarious situations in which she finds herself, never losing her humanity despite the horror of her situation, given what went wrong.Steeped in well-researched medieval life, it is the story of Kivrin's sojourn in the past that captures the imagination of the reader. This is a stunning book that is totally gripping. The spellbound reader will definitely keep turning the pages of this wonderful book, which is clearly written by a master storyteller. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I had not read any of Willis' other books but discovered this one when doing a search for books about time travel. I found this book at once compelling and frustrating. It was written in 1992 and I am surprised that while Ms. Willis forsaw quite a few changes by 2048, she nevertheless has her one of the main character forever waiting around for the phone to ring. I kept wanting to say \\"where is your cell phone?\\".I genuinely cared about the characters and loved the bits of humor is a hugely tragic story."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Set in the year 2048, this science fiction fantasy religion masterpiece, tells the story of an English history student--Kivrin--in a world where time travel has finally become a possibility.The phenomenon is limited by the fact that nothing significant can be changed in the past, limiting its usefulness and delegating it almost entirely to research and academic types. Kivrin secures permission to travel to and study a 14th century English village. When she arrives, her situation is exponentially complicated by the unexpected arrival of the Black Death, the great plague which killed half of Europe, and which should not have reached England for another 20 years.This gripping story won both the Nebula and Hugo awards, and has a theological appeal that extends beyond the realm of science fiction. This is one of the finest works of fiction I have ever read.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is the first book by this author I have read. She writes a time-travel story while maintaining a present-time plot and thread, which is no easy challenge. Eifelheim, which I read recently, had notable problems with this Then and Now 2-thread structure.Some spoilers will appear in this review. You are warned.The NOW thread depends on 2 awkward devices to keep Dunworthy et al in the dark about Kivrin's complication - Gilchrist's incompetence and personality, and (name of the tech who did the drop)'s coming down with the Virus almost immediately after the drop, preventing him from reporting the issues and likely causing the miscalculation in the first place. Basingame has become almost a joke, does the person even exist? Beyond that, discussion of life in near-future England, with quarantines, communication issues, etc., was not very illuminating. The story was apolitical. By the above devices, the author did bind the story to the Then story, with the need to retrieve Kivrin while surviving the virus.The Then story was a good bit more interesting, with the device of Kivrin not knowing the correct year leading to a number of important misconceptions. The description of the near-absolute lack of understanding of basic hygiene and medical care is accurate (reality may have been worse?), and in any event the black death was really quite bad by all accounts. A major relationship in the story is Kivrin with Roche, but oddly very little comes of it, little dialogue is reported, etc.Once the Now and Then thread re-merge, the author chooses to use the tactic of simply dropping the curtain without any epilogue. It seemed abrupt, but once I thought about what the author could do for an epilogue, none of the options seemed more effective that simply ending the story with the rescue.I have noted some quibbles above, but let me state clearly that this was a very enjoyable novel, and that I will read more by this author."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I came across this book while reading a review of Ken Follett'sWorld Without Endand decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised, having never before heard of author Connie Willis.Much of the specifics are covered in other reviews, so I'll focus on the highlights.The year is 2048, and time travel is now possible. Kivrin, a young History student in Britain, goes back to the Middle Ages over the objections of her pseudo-mentor, Mr. Dunworthy. The novel follows the action in both the Middle Ages and the present day as the two primary characters deal with the events of the day.Pros:1. The book is well-written, with enough description and background to give the reader a clear idea of what is happening.2. The characters, particularly Kivrin, are very engaging, and I found myself caring very much about her fate.3. While I don't know if this goes to the level of historical fiction, it's certainly illustrative of the Middle Ages, and I learned a few things.4. Willis manages to inject several humorous moments into an otherwise very-serious tale. We all know somebody just like the ponderous Mrs. Gaddson.Cons:1. As pointed out in another review, some of the difficulties faced by the characters in 2048 just don't make sense, with communications problems being most unbelievable. They had video phones and can send people back in time, but there's no wireless communication?2. The chapters may be a little long for some people. There are no natural breaks in the chapters, and you probably won't be able to comfortably read this in bits and pieces like you can with many books today. Settle in before you pick it up.3. Some terms are never really explained, and their meaning is left up to the reader. For example, \\"contemps\\" seems to mean \\"contemporaries\\", but the book never tells you that.This seems to fall under the Science Fiction genre, but other than a self-zipping jacket I don't think there was anything very futuristic about it (other than the time travel, of course).The pros greatly outweigh the cons. This is a very good story that will teach you something while entertaining you."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This may story may disappoint the hard-core sci fi crowd whose first priority is imagined technology, and it will certainly scandalize some devout religious believers (if Christ can ask, \\"Lord why hast though forsaken me?\\" why can't the heroine?), but for the general reader it is a treasure. Among other insights, Willis' novel suggests that, despite all the earnest research, we may know only a little more about the past than we do about our future. But \\"Dooms Day Book\\" does testify to the endurance of the human race's saving virtues--compassion, fidelity, tenacity. If the human condition is to be improved, it will be more through their agency than through that of techonology. And like any honest and realistic narrative about the past, it leaves you grateful that you live now."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I recommend that you skim the parts of the book that take place in the present day, which get bogged down in boring minutae, and concentrate on the parts that take place during the plague, which are rich in exciting detail and give the reader a good sense of what it must have been like to live through such a calamity. The severity of the plague may be overblown a bit in this novel, but it is still whithin the realm of possibility that local populations could have experienced just what the book describes. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Connie Willis is simply one of the finest contemporary SF writers and here is the proof. I bought this book on a whim after reading the cover blurb. It's become one of my favorites.The idea of time travel is a real warhorse in SF and often yields interesting results. I liked the premise of making the travellers history students; the added attraction was making the period under surveillance the Plague Years of medieval Europe. This may ring your deja-vu bell by now but Willis tackled this issue before and far better than Michael Crichton (Timeline, for those who aren't Crichton fans, covered similiar territory.)The story involves the journey of Kivrin, an Oxford student of British history in the mid 21st century. Due to some complicated coincidences between past and present, her time travel goes off course and she lands in England 100 or so years earlier than planned at the height of the plague. Meanwhile, a mysterious illness is wreaking havoc on modern-day England which complicates rescue efforts. Kivrin is cut off from the present and attempts to save her host family and village with what modern medical knowledge she possesses and the aide of the village priest.I expected an adventure tale and I got it but the real gift of Willis' writing is the incredible pathos she inspires toward her subjects. The story moves quickly and expertly between the present and the past and never loses steam. What I most enjoyed was the transition in Kivrin's mind from her subjects being abstracts (&quot;contemps&quot;) to real people who love and strive and suffer. The realization is one the best historians must of necessity arrive at but most of us rarely contemplate when sitting in the comfort of a classroom or armchair. I can't look at the study of history quite the same after reading this book and any work of art that permanently alters your perception of life is worth pointing out to others.All of Willis' work is excellent and should be sought out. For her lighter side, check out her short story collection &quot;Impossible Things.&quot;"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"A time traveler visits the Middle Ages and finds she may not be able to return -- and the Black Death is devestating Europe. The actual plot doesn't matter much as well as Willis' imagining of life in the Middle Ages in a village visited, and destroyed, by the plague. It is a rare writer who can so thoroughly imagine and convey the sense of place and people -- from descriptions of a peasant's hovel to the tending of victims of the Black Death. It is not a cheerful book because she so deftly pulls you entirely into the times 700 years ago. The tone is so completely different than her fun and funny science fiction, or her hilarious take on Jerome's 3 Men and a Dog that it is hard to believe it is the same writer. But Doomsday, with its frail plot, is so beautifully imagined and conveyed it is both hard to put down and unforgettable."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I love time travel stories when I want to just have some fun! This is by turns exciting, moving, and funny. A real plus is a female protagonist in an adventure story who shows -- to anybody who needs convincing -- that courage and nurturing femininity are not contradictions. If you have ever taken care of little girls you will appreciate how real Agnes, the little girl in the 14th century, is and find you really care about her and the other characters. I don't say this about much fiction, but it was hard to put down when I had to stop reading and deal with mundane reality."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"If you like sci-fi, fantasy and history you'll love this book. I did. The characters are totally engaging and it's fascinating. The only thing that stops it from being a 5 star book is the long parts about Dunworthy, they got a little boring. All the parts that take place in the 14th century are totally excellent."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"\\"Doomsday Book\\" by Connie Willis, Audio Edition recorded by Jenney Sterlin, 2000.An excellent, prize-winning book enhanced by the talents of the reader in the Audio Version. Connie Willis is an established author who has turned her talents to common sense approach to time travel. Since I have recently received my MA in History, I am intrigued by her proposition that future historians will be \\"hands-on\\" workers, actually travelling to the era they are interested in, which requires them to develop an in-depth understanding of that time. This means that the time-travelling historian must know the language, understand the era's technology and be able to fit right in. Tall order! For example, I could not even order a soda in the 1957-1958 US South, when I was stationed there in the US Navy. My New York English was not understood in Memphis.Besides her common sense approach, Connie Willis has done some fine writing, as for example, she describes the starry night sky on Christmas Eve in 1348. I am certain that she has read Edgar Allan Poe's, \\"The Bells\\", since she uses the word, \\"crystalline\\" to echo his use in that poem. Personally, I have not seen the word \\"crystalline\\" used outside of Poe and electronic engineering texts on transistors.The author's irritating British bureaucrats, (e.g. Gilchrist), of the 21st Century are reflected in the rigid class system of 1348, and I wonder if Willis did this on purpose. She does develop interesting characters, more in 1348 than in the future, and it is sad to see the pouting, almost spoiled young girl, Agnes, come down with the Black Plague.The author could do a wee bit more research on the Catholic Church (which, by the way, is alive and well in 2002), as she has Kivrin saying that she \\"..said the Mass for the Dead\\" for Fr. Roche. Only an ordained priest can \\"say\\" a Mass, in 1348, or 2002, or 2054, so Kivrin might have prayed for Roche, but not by saying a Mass. Her comic relief characters, (we are running short of lavatory paper!) could be minimized, but the boy, Collin, moves things along. Her almost causal announcement of the deaths, due to flu, of Dr. (Great Aunt) Mary and the protagonist bureaucrat, Gilchrist, seemed too easy a way to eliminate them.The Audio Tape version was easier than reading the actual book, since Jenney Sterlin does such a good job of pronouncing the Old English texts, so you almost could understand the words. Especially if you had studied German. Sterlin's reading of this book helped me through many an hour on Interstate 495, the ring road around Boston. Good book!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This exceptionally well written and researched novel takes place in a future where time travel is routine, and an expected part of the college curriculum. But for Kivrin, a bright and dedicated student of medieval history at Oxford, everything goes awry. When she embarks on a research project, and she's mistakenly sent back to the wrong time by bungling academics and improperly inoculated to the plague by inattentive medics who unwittingly unlease the black death among the university and its community.Kivrin, along her contemporaries and the medieval people she meets, are compelling and believable, the shifting perspective on time and language, and the level of emotion the story generates keeps the reader enthralled. Loaded with subplots and mysteries, the story is most gripping, and seemed quite plausable to me."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I really did not enjoy this book. The story itself is passably interesting and could have resulted in a much better result. I think the two things that bothered me the most were the characters and the annoying plot mechanisms used by the author to try to build suspense and tension. With regard to the characters, most of them were either weeping and wailing over their self-created predicaments and misunderstandings, or allowing someone else to walk all over them when it would have been just as easy to speak one word and put a stop to it. While characters of this ilk have a place, this book has nothing but. By far the most annoying thing in this book were the contrived 'crises' that were seemingly designed to increase tension and/or increase the page total. The book is rife with examples of one or another of the aforementioned characters bemoaning the fact that they absolutely MUST speak to another character in order to straighten out some grave misunderstanding or find out some vital piece of information. They try and try, but something always prevents them. They finally (chapters later)get a perfect opportunity and GET DISTRACTED AND MISS IT (and then moan about their loss)! This happens again and again and again (at the hospital, trying to find her entry point, etc). It is as if the author is so enamored with this plot device that she can think of no other. It gets very tiring and frustrating and in at least one instance led me to throw the book across the room. Another annoying plot contrivance is that we have to wade through page after page of the heroine trying to figure out some trivial event when the answer has been made painfully clear. It just makes her look stupid. An example: The little girl is repeatedly(for over two pages) bugging our heroine because she wants to visit her dog's grave at the church. Our heroine keeps saying 'No'. Moments later, the little girl disappears. We have to slog through TEN PAGES of the heroine's frantic searching of the attic, the basement, the stables, etc. before she thinks to look for her at the church! Nothing comes of it, it was apparently just put in to pad the page count. Perhaps this is supposed to induce tension, but after countless episodes of this stupidity it is just annoying. I have lost much respect for the Nebula and Hugo awards because of this book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I'm in that terrible situation that readers occasionally (if they are lucky) find themselves in. I'm within a few pages of finishing this book. The terrible situation is that I am going to have a very difficult time finding a book to follow this one that will even come close to being this good. I have been nearly incapable of putting this book down--I read it way past my bedtime, I read it when I would normally be watching TV or web surfing, I have spent every spare minute turning the pages, completely engrossed in the story. As close as I am to finishing it, I don't know how it will end.There are few fiction books I have found of this caliber. Highly, highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book would be twice as good if it were half as long. Three times as good if it were a third as long. Some characters we can care about, some compelling conflicts and situations, some moments of lovely writing: all of these were ground to dust under the enormous tedium of words, words, words.My best guess is that this novel won major awards based on its brilliant perspective on the time paradox. Trying not to give too much away here - but by the end of the novel we see that Kivrin has spent her entire adventure working well within the strictures of the time paradox. In one brief moment, Kivrin even sees the paradox as a form of fate and even perhaps as a form of a benevolent god. And Ms Willis makes this point in ways that are smart, devastating, and deeply humane. But, good lord (pardon the pun), she took the long way around getting there. It wasn't worth the effort. This book is boring."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Connie Willis has written a fantastic book! I have read it multiple times, and this summer I have recommended it to dozens of people, who fell in love with it. You can't help but fall in love with some of the characters. You cheer for them, and dread their passing! It is a great read. The audio version is also fantastic!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I stumbled across the title of this book doing research on the Black Death. What a find!! I just couldn't put it down and love how tightly Connie Willis weaves her stories. This launched me on a new search for anything she has ever written. Without doubt she is my favorite author!!! The characters are so well developed and the story line is positively captivating. What a great movie this book would make, and yet it is not in any way written like a screenplay (thinking of how M.Crichton's books denigrated from great books to poor screenplays)."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is a great book. I'm going to detail some critisims I have of the book, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great book. I could barely put the book down, and I recommend it to all!Kivrin is a student historian in 2054. Time travel has been around for quite a while, and there are many historians who have traveled back to the 20th Century to study it, but so far no one has been back to the Medieval period because it has been deemed too dangerous.Kivrin is about to become the first person to travel back there. She has been studying for years, learning to ride horses, hunt, light fires. She has been vacinated against the Black Death and other diseases, and sets out to travel back to 1320, around twenty years before the plague hit europe.But something goes wrong with the trip, and Kivrin may be stuck in the past forever.The story juxtiposes the 'present' (the present in the story, slightly our future) and the past. In my opinion this could have been done more tightly. The major plot twist is oooh so obvious and should have been revealed much earlier.This book is written in 1992, and is already dated. For instance, while there are video phones, there seem to be no evidence of mobiles, answering machines, or even the internet and email. It is easy to look beyond this, of course, but at the same time it sticks out like a sore thumb. That is the problem with science fiction these days - often the present can be more futuristic than the story!In the medieval period, I felt very detached from the characters besides Kivrin. You never really get to know them, they are always seen from only Kivrin's view and never really have a voice themselves. They seem so passive, almost out side the story. THat was a little dissapointing, I would have loved to have gotten to know them all better, to know what their hopes and dreams were, what their feelings were, etc. What we knew of them was what Kivrin thought of them, and how she interpreted their actions. We were always observing, never getting in the 'action' so to speak.As for action, there wasn't much in this story. Not a bad thing at all, this was deffinatly a character driven piece. If you are looking for sword fights etc, look somewhere else.This is put forward as a 'science fiction' book, but I think lovers of fantasy and history will enjoy this more. This book isn't all about technology and how time travel works, etc. It is more about describing - living - the medieval period, and it is also a study of character.For all my critisms, I enjoyed this book alot. It moved me deeply."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"With 300+ reviews, maybe it has all been said. But just in case....The parts of this book that deal with the Middle Ages are wonderful. The author really brings to life a small but fascinating English time and place. If one is interested in learning about life in the middle ages, the plague, and religious issues then this book will have much to offer.The future the author describes, however, is another story. Her 2048 feels more like 1958. The book shares that odd quality that one gets from viewing certain British films, like Day of the Trifids or even the Avengers series, i.e. the total population of England is about 500 persons, and 50% of them are eccentrics in a shawl or odd hat. One can picture the book's hospital ward right out of a black and white movie, bare iron beds, shiny tile floors, female nurses with pointy white hats and starched uniforms jotting things down in a chart.OK, this is supposed to be science fiction, so foreseeing that mobile phones might be in our future should not have been such a huge stretch even for a book written in 1993. This is especially vexing since the plot leans heavily on main characters running off to find a phone, or just missing a key phone call, etc. And, in 2048 will one comely and kindly local doctor and a few nurses be expected to handle an epidemic of SARS proportions on their own? It seems so at odds with the bureaucratic and journalistic frenzy that disease outbreaks cause. The future in this book just seems very thin on people and new technology (even by 2004 standards). Wait, but time machines? Apparently in 2048 you can find one of those in the basement of just about any ivy covered history dept. building. Cell phones, not so much.I did like, however, the way the author handled the time paradox issues (e.g. what happens if you prevent your grandfathers birth, etc.) Basically she just assumes there cannot be one - and that's that! Pesky physics problem solved! Probably that is the most unassailable approach I have seen to this always dilemma in any time travel story.My advice: read the parts of this book that take place in 2048 quickly, but save time to relish the more carefully wrought and well researched sections on the Middle Ages."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. It seemed to be well researched, but I found it to be a bit predictable. I found myself a little bored with the modern day story, and flipped to the 1300's for the more exciting story.It seemed a lot of key points were repeated, as if the author forgot she had told us already. I also found the antiquated medical aspects (even for 1992 standards, when the book was written) were a bit childish (I'm an emergency R.N.) , and there wasn't enough &quot;high tech stuff&quot; (time travel aside) to make me interested in the &quot;modern story.&quot;The characters were sympathetic, and I found I liked them all. The story was thought provoking, and I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Time Travel, medieval lore, or just a good read."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Not a traditional science fiction book, but a deeply felt story about human lives lived long ago during the Black Plague. Ms. Willis, as in her book Lincoln's Dreams, explores the treatise of whether people who lived long ago can affect our modern existence. The question is-- if so, can they give our lives (and theirs) meaning?A truly beautiful book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"While at first glance Doomsday Book seems assembled from classic science fiction tropes -- time travel plot, eccentric scientists, tech-based mysteries to be solved, brave young protagonist coming up against the cold realities of existence -- author Connie Willis has assembled from these well-worn parts a riveting and surprisingly fresh read. This is one of those rare books that once begun is very difficult to put down.This is partially due to the incisiveness of the writing and the book's seriousness of purpose: this is not a SF book of paradoxes and puzzle-solving, but a harrowing tale of plague in two centuries. It is also due to the vivid and memorable characters populating both time periods.But the most striking and original quality of Doomsday Book is its pitch perfect blend of trauma and comedy. The book opens like an academic screwball comedy and as events darken, the sparkling, laugh out loud wit becomes an integral part of the characters' reaction to tragedy.In a genre not overly reknowned for its sense of humor, Doomsday Book, brutal and funny in equal measure, is a great read."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"As someone interested in both Sci Fi and the cultural affects of the Black Death, I was excited to hear about the existence of this book - especially because it won both the Hugo and Nebula awards. I was surprised to be so disappointed. I've read Connie Willis' book Bellwether as well and while I like that novel better it suffers from the same two problems.The first problem is that Connie Willis seems to rely on tensions between the protagonist and the &quot;Irritating Others&quot; to drive a lot of the events in the book - people whose only purposes for existence are to throw trivial obstacles in the protagonists' paths. The Irritating Others are 2-dimensional caricatures of annoying people - the Officious Administrator of the competing school who won't let one character into the time travel room; the Overbearing Mother who keeps demanding that her son get special treatment because he's so delicate; the Demanding Americans who are more concerned with their scheduled performance than the crisis going on around them; the Disapproving Stepmother who suspects everyone. These caricatures are not funny but instantly grating, and they appear again and again and again...Which is very frustrating because of the second problem; the plot just doesn't move forward very quickly. Most of the novel takes place in two locations and progress towards resolution is slow. This is fine if there is an interesting buildup with in-depth character development and interactions, but tedious when the Irritating Others are in those stagnant locations driving the plot with paperwork and scowls.If you're drawn to the plot ideas of Connie Willis' books, I would recommend Bellwether. Although the Irritating Others exist there as well, they are part of the plot rather than a tool-kit's worth of wrenches in the works."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"A friend of mine who lives in the same town as Connie Willis sent me the Doomsday book for Christmas because, eccentric as it might sound, I love plagues, particularly the Bubonic Plague of the 14th century. Not only did I get a wonderful discussion of the Bubonic Plague, but Willis gave me ANOTHER plague mystery to solve. I solved the second mystery the first time I read the book, but I have still reread it at least 3 times since I got it. In addition to the wonderful plague scenarios, Willis' characters, with the exception of Kivrin, are real people dealing with a crisis. The characters run the gamut from the superstitiously wicked Lady Imeyne to the wickedly funny Finch whose main worry is running out of toilet paper. But the best character is Father Roche, an unlettered village priest who embodies the medieval idea of the saintly priest who actually ministers to his flock rather than fleecing them like so many actual priests did. Willis' science may be &quot;iffy,&quot; but her history is right on target. As a literature professor, I am forced to read &quot;good&quot; fiction for a living, but for relaxation, give me a rousing science fiction/mystery/romance like the Doomsday Book. It's one of the best Christmas gifts I ever got"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I'm not much of a science fiction reader, so I'm still trying to figure out what constitutes award winning in this genre. And after reading this book, I'm no further along in figuring out what distinguishes a Hugo and Nebula award winning book (such as this) from others. Nonetheless, this is an interesting, engrossing story and I would recommend it especially to non-sci-fi reading fans.Most of the other reviewers have mentioned all the main good and bad points. One aspect of the book I found intriguing and compelling was the character and behavior of the village priest; his death scene answered a lot of my questions in the book up until that point. I appreciated the little plot twists in the end involving the archaeologist; I thought that was well done and it kept me guessing.I would have liked more details on the &quot;science&quot; of the time net; that whole gimmick was not dealt with very convincingly, even though it was integral to the plot.As other reviewers have mentioned, though, in spite of its holes and annoyances, this is a book that stays with you long after you've finished reading it. It really leaves you pondering what life, people, disease, the church, and the terrain were like there way back when. And whether the changes we've come through to modern times are necessarily wholely positive ones."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I feel obliged to write this review because of the average rating of 4 stars. The pacing of this book is very slow. I can skip entire sections, and still find the characters mulling on the same questions over and over again.It's a book of frustrations, none of the characters get any where, same questions are asked again, and again, and again, the same action sequences happen again, and again, and again... There are so many scenes of examining gobstoppers so as to induce involuntary snoring (I wonder if it's the same gobstopper! Hmmm...).Two questions really go through the entire book, 1. what time was Kivrin in the past, and 2. what caused the epidemic.Really, if this book is 1/3 of its size, it would be a much better read."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I know how this is going to sound. But I majored in comparative literature in college. I have been an avid reader all my life -- from the classics to Ann Rule and Jodi Picoult. And I must say that \\"Doomsday Book\\" is one of the very few books I reread and savour on a regular basis. I believe it's one of the best books -- in any genre -- of the last 50 years.Obviously, not every reader here agrees. And I don't imagine my few praises will win over any of those who tried it and found it \\"boring\\" or \\"poorly written.\\" I just want to add my voice to those who could not disagree more strongly. Every time I finish this book, I feel that I have come to know -- *truly* know -- flesh-and-blood people who lived during the horrendous days of the Black Plague. I'm not ashamed to say that the experience of reading this book has changed my life for the better."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book was my introduction to Connie Willis and I happened upon it by accident -- I found it laying around our office one Christmas Eve. With nobody around and nothing really to do, I started to read then found I couldn't put it down.If you're into SF for the science part of the equation, this may not appeal to you. But if you love speculative fiction when it tells a great story with well-developed characters, this is for you, and it's one of the best.As another reviewer said, this book is sad and haunting. There is also warm humor and, in spite of the sadness, the lasting impression is of hope and faith. I just can't say enough good about it. 100% recommended."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book is an absolutely incredible. It's like a perfectly crafted action-adventure movie, with drama, humor, suspense and excitement all expertly balanced in an engrossing story. It takes hold of you and doesn't let up until you reach the end. I literally could not put it down, I had to know what happened next. The characters draw you in and you can't help but care what happens to them. Will Kivrin survive her journey to the Middle Ages? Will Mr. Dunworthy find out just what went wrong? Will Dr. Ahrens discover the origins of the mysterious virus that has taken hold of the city? Is the virus connected some how to the time Kivrin has traveled to? Could it be the plague? (Will William Gaddson get caught making out with one of his many girlfriends by his mother? ^o^) These are just some of the questions you find yourself desperate to learn the answers to. The pace is relentless, the story never drags along waiting for the next thing to happen, something is always happening. The dialogue is natural and the story-telling is fluid. There is nothing I can complain about in regards to this book, I loved the whole thing from beginning to end. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a really good story."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Now I realize that everyone is entitled to their opinion and while I completely respect yours I have never read a reivew with which I disagree more. This book is in my opinion one of the greatest pieces of literature I have ever read, and I consider myself pretty well read. I say this not to pick a fight but to encourage those who might not read the book on the basis of such reviews to give it a chance. I found the novel brilliant, there's no other word for it. The detailed descriptions ere fascinating to me and the characters humorous and intriguing and lifelike. It's one of the saddest books I've ever read and I can't even think about certian passages without tears welling up in my eyes. It is a long long book but the writing style makes it impossible to put down. It's obvious the author did her homework and I realize I'm gushing on and on about it but I simply can't say enough about how much I loved it. I realize I'm not being very specific but if you want more information email me (Peglet98@aol.com) I'm always ready to discuss Connie Willis. So I guess I'm basically saying try it for yourself, if you hate it ok, but if you love it you'll LOVE it, and it will be one of your favorite books ever."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I love sci-fi and fantasy. I love time travel novels, even though it's the least likely thing in pseudo-science. This novel won a Hugo and a Nebula, and had mostly positive reviews on Amazon. But I was totally disappointed. In fact, I only made myself finish the book so I could give it this review without possibly missing something at the end that would redeem the entire thing. Alas, there wasn't anything like that. If you are a discerning sci-fi reader, then go read some other author like David Brin (one of my favorites) or Peter F. Hamilton. Now, to be fair this is the only Connie Willis book I've read. But I doubt I'll bother to give any of her other books a chance. That's how unimpressed I was with Doomsday Book. If you want some more details, read on...First, the novel feels very dated. Yes, this happens with sci-fi all of the time, and this *is* copyright 1992. But often a story is so good you can ignore the few minor things in it that might feel dated. But in my opinion Willis showed a much greater than average lack of imagination when writing this than I would've ever suspected. This felt like a mainstream writer *trying* to write sci-fi, not a science fiction author who knows her craft. Okay... Somehow by 2053 we have time travel, and it's been around for years. But there's scant explanation of how it came about or the pseudo-science behind it, only that paradoxes prevent travel to some places/times. But beyond that, Willis only adds in a couple of unimaginative concessions to technological advancement to her world of 2053. But it feels like the story was set in late 70's or early 80's England. I lived in England from '87-92 myself, and I don't remember it being as primitive as she describes 2053 England being! One of the characters spends most of his time running around trying to find telephones to use and getting busy signals left and right. I mean, features like call waiting or caller ID weren't commonplace when she wrote this book, but they were starting to be offered more and more in the US and DID exist in the UK - if what I found in my research was correct. Star Trek which was created in the 60's had Communicators for goodness sakes! Anyway, thats one example. But there were other similar things like that in Doomsday Book, and they completely detracted and distracted from the story such as it was. NOTE: Contrast this book to something like David Brin's Startide Rising, which won the Hugo and Nebula awards in 1983, and doesn't feel very dated at all.Next, Willis' foreshadowing feels like Chinese water torture - it goes on and on and on. Only someone under the age of 8 could fail to realize exactly what's going to happen at almost every turn. So zero surprises in this entire novel - ZERO. It could've used some too, because the plot was pretty thin and weak. Then we have the people. Most of them seem like bland cardboard cut-outs. I barely cared what happened to any of them, even the main two characters. The only thing I think Willis did well in this entire novel was to describe the suffering of the 1300's in fairly vivid detail. Yet it wasn't good enough in the story department for it to even be a good Historical fiction piece."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is the best, most moving time travel novel I have ever read. Fans of Jack Finney's Time and Again should find this novel even more compelling than his two superbly clever time travel novels.Time traveling in England to 1328, Kivrin Engle, a young Oxford historian, winds up in 1348 by mistake just as the Black Death spreads. She suffers through the Black Death's devastating effect on those around her, without herself being susceptible to the plague bacillus (though she is sick from a future flu). She helplessly watches as pettiness and ignorance hasten the spread of the disease.As readers, our sense of doom increases with each page. We know how the story will end for the inhabitants of 1348, but we are left wondering when, if, and how the time traveling historian will be rescued as those at home in a future England (some 700 years or so in the future) suffer their own out-of-control influenza epidemic.At first, this novel's setting in a future Oxford seems a bit tedious as Willis mixes in some elements of an English farce. But then the farce storyline turns deadly. Many SF readers will need to patiently plow through the first 70 pages before this hefty thriller grabs them by the throat and then doesn't let go. The appearance of a minor character in the end is both startling and emotionally moving.Doomsday Book certainly earned its Hugo and Nebula awards.Vincent Miskell is a SF writer whose short fiction has appeared in ROSEBUD, MILLENNIUM, and in the SF anthology, THE AGE OF WONDERS. His novelette Godspeed Inc.: A Naomi Kinder Adventure and his follow-up novel Rescuing the Future: A Naomi Kinder Novel are both available on Amazon Kindle.

This story successfully combines several genres - Fantasy/Sci-Fi, Historical Drama, and Medical Mystery. Granted, of the three, the Sci-Fi genre is least represented so if you're looking for a book that's all about time travel you'll most likely be disappointed. I find the glimpses into medieval life fascinating and would recommend it to those who enjoy learning about what life was like in times past."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Not being a Science Fiction fan, I was leery, but I read it and loved it! Connie Willis is an excellent writer, the right mix of everything. Worth the read."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Doomsday Book is well researched and well written, with many believable characters and an absorbing plot. The protagonist is both multi-dementional and likable, and the reader finds oneself drawn in to her story.Definitely a &quot;must read&quot; if you're into time travel and/or the middle ages, and a gem for Willis fans."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Doomsday Book was the first book I have read in this genre. I decided to read it because I am very interested in the Middle Ages, and I think that Connie Willis did a wonderful job. The futuristic chapters were not bogged down with scientific jargon, and the mediveal chapters were historically accurate and really the most interesting part of the book. I feel that the chapters set in the future were repetitive, and somewhat boring, and I did find myself skipping through them. Although the book is long, I wish it had gone on, I would love to know how Kivrin recuperates from her time travel."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Doomsday Book is a wonderful novel with brilliant characterization. The characters will live on in your mind after you finish the book. I'm not a big fan of science fiction and I loved it!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"The premise of the Doomsday Book by Connie Willis is a world in the near future in which historians can travel through time to discover more about the history of a period. While the technology is there it is not perfected so errors may occur. Kivrin an eager young scholar want to travel to the fourteenth century in the pre-plague era. Through unforeseen circumstances prevents her easy return as planned. The book transitions from the past to the future each of which are having their problems.The reader is able to follow Kivrin through the harrowing aspects of the time. Willis effectively describes the period and the people. She explains points which Kivrin will have to be aware of to fit in to the society. While in the middle ages Kivrin befriends two children and a local priest. Through these friendships we are able to learn about fashions, values and mores of the society.Characters in the book are interesting and entertaining although all are not fully fleshed out. None the less the reader grows to care for both the characters of the past and future.Some of the scientific details and technicalities seemed a little overdone. The description of the translator which allowed Kivrin to understand medieval English was lengthy and tedious.This book provides two of my very favorite elements time travel and the medieval period. For fans of either this is a must read."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I've read Doomsday Book so many times I've lost count, but I still love it. This is by far the most cinematic of Willis' works, but it seemed that she put a lot more work into the characters in the past. The sisters--Rosemund and Agnes--were my favorites. Yes, Rosemund was constantly in a bad mood, but who can blame her? How would any young girl react if they were betrothed to someone like Sir Bloet. Agnes, though, stole my heart. She was such a spirited little girl (I did feel sorry for Blackie, the puppy).... What I liked best, though, was when Kivrin first arrived in the past. The sections written in Old English are fun to try to decipher. Do yourself a favor and read this book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Doomsday Book's strengths include the well-researched and plausible setting of 14th century rural England, a good portrayal of epidemics and how to deal with them, a variety of themes and imagery (try figuring out each character's analogue in the other time period), and of course Willis' fine writing and dialogue. Rarely resorting to exposition, her characters and lively and vivid, and you care for them.The book's problems mostly stem from its plot, which disappoints: Some characters behave willfully stupidly and for no apparent reason than to keep the plot moving. One character is off-stage from the very beginning to get the plot started and his absence is never satisfactorily explained. Finally, there's no unification of the plots in the seperate time periods; I kept waiting for the grand explanation of what was going on, and was sorely disappointed. The book also needed another chapter or two of denouement; it ends rather abrupty.So while the middle of the book is quite a page-turner, and I wouldn't tell anyone NOT to read it, I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend this novel to someone, either."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is the first Connie Willis book I've read, but it will not be the last. The family of &quot;contemps&quot; and their everyday life is extremely thought provoking. The middle third of the story is generally character development, you get to know the contemps and the modern characters. Sometimes this is tideous to get through, but I assure you it is well worth it. Without this section of the book, it's just another time-travel novel, with this section it becomes a heartbreaking study of how people can endure the most painful of circumstances.While the contemps are the main story, there are still modern characters that ,while not as tragic as the contemps, still capture your heart. This story will capture your heart, it is a wonderful book that should be enjoyed by many."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I think those who criticize the pacing of THE DOOMSDAY BOOK miss what makes it so powerful, which is the time Willis takes to define her characters, so that their lives and deaths truly mean something to the reader. This book may not be perfect, but it's very strong, and better than 99 percent of other science fiction."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I couldn't put it down! The storyline takes place in two times - one roughly 50 years into the future, and the other 700 years in the past - in England. In the future, apparently, academic time-travel (for research) is commonplace, but when a grad student is sent to the middle ages things start going terribly wrong - both in the past and future. The descriptions of the middle ages are wonderful, the cast and characters all believable and captivating, and the adventure on both sides of the time machine kept me glued to the pages. The story wasn't too heavy - I was still able to enjoy it as a distraction from my daily grind - but it had pathos! I highly recommend this book if you're at all interested in historical fiction or time travel."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"In this book, set in the not-too-distant future, historians from Oxford University have a time machine which they use to study history firsthand (a number of Willis' other books are set in this same world). A young historian named Kivrin goes back to the Middle Ages and things begin to go wrong. A mysterious plague rages through Oxford while she is trapped in medieval England during a plague.The parts of the story taking place in Oxford have some humorous elements thanks to a few ridiculous (but believable) characters and Willis' witty narrative style, but the parts of the story set in Medieval England are pretty unremittingly dark...I loved it even though it was depressing!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Ms. Willis has done a wonderful job with this book. Hugo and Nebula prizes were deservedly bestowed to this work.Time travel is a classic sci-fi subject and there are different possible approaches. The author chooses to research in depth the time period involved and that is a big plus. The medieval environment is presented to the reader with accurate strokes.Even if the story is a little slow to fully develop, after you pass the first hundred pages you are hooked and incapable to put this book down.Ms. Willis draw a parallel between past and present (future actually as present is year 2050), confronting a deadly epidemic situation in two different time periods.Characters are fully developed and show human depth. The reader is introduced to the intimate perceptions of many of them. Self sacrifice vs. selfishness; true deep religious belief vs. superficial self serving religious attitudes; human foolishness vs. humanitarian procedures are described in a gripping way.The dark background is mitigated by an underlying sense of humor that softens most dreadful scenes.Time travel is presented in a very coherent way, avoiding paradoxes and silly conflicts that spoil other novels.For fans' delight Ms. Willis will revisit Oxford and its time travel lab with a more comedic set of adventures in \\"To Say Nothing about the Dog\\".A book that may be enjoyed by sci-fi and fantasy adepts as well as people interested in historical novels.Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I remember reading this book when it first came out. I was a freshman in high school and thought it was amazing. About a month ago, when I was in the mood to revisit some of my favorite books, I picked this up again. I have to say I'm more amazed with it now than I was at age 14.The characters are genuine people whom you'd expect to meet the next time you visit a college campus. They're resourceful and interesting, holding themselves together through the worst of times. Both renderings of Oxford come off as startlingly real. Add those elements to the most compelling time travel story I've ever read and it's easy to see why this book has garnered the awards and praise that it has.Nearly two decades after its initial publication Doomsday Book leaves the reader with a sense of awe when the back cover drops.Several years ago, I had the honor of meeting Ms. Willis at the Los Angelges Times Festival of Books. I asked her what the inspiration was for writing Doomsday Book. She told me she'd wanted to write about the first time the world ended. An answer like that can only make you appreciate this work even more."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"You fill in the blanks. Kivrin, Oxford medievalist, is prepared for the journey of her life, quite literally, as she travels through time to 1300's England. Years of studying and researching everything from language to culture to politics of the era cannot possibly get Kivrin ready for this adventure. In a society in which time travel is possible (mid 21st century), one would think all bases have been covered, right? Wrong! A big mistake has been made and I won't spoil it for you what that mistake is, but it's a biggie.This book is not for the faint of heart or those easily offended by graphic descriptions of human suffering. And there is that aplenty. But this book is for those who want a realistic depiction of life in the Middle Ages (Willis did her homework better than the Oxford hacks in her story did). Read this book for the triumph of the human spirit over insurmountable obstacles."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Winner of both the Hugo and Nebula Awards for science fiction, this book is a tour de force that is sure to captivate all those who love time travel themes, as well as those who have a deep appreciation for medieval history. The author masterfully melds these two genres, creating a novel that is riveting and highly entertaining.The year is 2048 A.D., and a young history student named Kivrin is preparing to do an on site study of the turbulent fourteenth century. Her mission has placed two of the University's professors at cross purposes, as the proponent for this study, Mr. Gilchrist, finds himself pitted against Mr. Dunworthy, Kivrin's mentor, who believes that this trip in time is far too dangerous. Mr. Gilchrist, however, is in the position to have the final say on the project.Kivrin is scheduled to land in the rural English countryside of the fourteenth century some twenty years before the Black Death savages England. Armed with the knowledge of fourteenth century customs, dress, languages, religious practices, and history, Kivrin is raring to go back in time. When she travels back, however, an unforeseen crisis in the present places Kivrin in a potentially deadly situation upon her arrival in the past.The book alternates between what is happening in the present and what is happening in the past, as those in the present work to unravel the mystery of what went wrong. Meanwhile, Kivrin struggles to overcome the anomalous situations she encounters that run contra to her expectations. Believing herself stranded in the past, Kivrin artfully maneuvers around the precarious situations in which she finds herself, never losing her humanity despite the horror of her situation, given what went wrong.Steeped in well-researched medieval life, it is the story of Kivrin's sojourn in the past that captures the imagination of the reader. This is a stunning book that is totally gripping. The spellbound reader will definitely keep turning the pages of this wonderful book, which is clearly written by a master storyteller. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book was so fun! I don't read SciFi - ever. This one just might make me reconsider. I told myself at the beginning of the summer that I needed to step outside of the box, and try something different. On the other hand, I do tend to read a lot of historical fiction, so this wasn't a total stretch for me either.The parts set in the Middle Ages were just - wow - great. Who knows if that's actually how things were, but it was sure vivid. And the parts set in the future didn't seem too wacked out and far fetched to believe. I thought the back and forth in time was great, and added to the suspense. I like a story that shows a variety of perspectives, and I think the back and forth in time does that very effectively.The characters were well thought out. The beginning was a bit slow, but once you got into \\"Book 2\\", it took off like a flash and things just started to happen.I don't think there's anything earth shattering here, but if you just want a fast, fun escape this could just fit the bill for you. I would highly recommend it. Brilliant book!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book won both the Hugo and Nebula awards, so obviously I'm in the minority in not liking it. When reading for pleasure I'm generally hoping for at least one of the four following things:1. A fast paced page turner that keeps me breathless with anticipation.2. New, interesting ideas or insights about people, society, or nature.3. A world of wonder. New places, people, beasts, magic, technology, etc.4. Masterful writing. An author with the ability to make me smile simply through their use of language.Great books give me three or four of the above. This book gave me none."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"There's more than a few coincidental similarities between Connie Willis' \\"Doomsday Book\\" and Michael Crichton's \\"Timeline\\". In Doomsday, Willis tells a story of a young grad student who travels back into medieval Europe and inadvertantly gets stuck for a time. In Timeline, Crichton writes of several grad students who travel to medieval Europe and inadvertantly get stuck for a time. Willis' heroine Kivrin has the aid of a chemical interpreter in her head, but it doesn't seem to be functioning quite right; Crichton's gang has a chip or some such that they can't use in fear that they will be exposed. The time travelers in both novels have a tougher time in the past than they ever could have expected.The comparisons end there. The differences between these two novels are vast. Willis reveals a meticulously researched view of English life in the 1300's, a superb skill at characterization, and the ability to keep a reader totally absorbed in a complex narrative for 578 pages; Crichton reveals, in my opinion, how much he enjoys getting paychecks when his fourth-grade level writing spawns Hollywood action movie drivel.My recommendation: Read both of these books and then don't waste anymore time or effort on one of the authors (you can pick which one )..."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"The story was amazing and it was a fun book to read. Descriptive enough to give a picture of what The Plague must have been like but not so much as to make it laborious. The characters were developed and interesting. The concept of time travel involving historians was alluring.The downside was the predictability and, as I read in another review, the repetitiveness.Overall, a good book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I found Doomsday Book to be an intelligent and well-written book with a lot of fine detailing to back up its central idea of time travel to the medieval period.The atmosphere of the book is well-done, with the aura of sickness carried both by the plague of the medieval period and the pandemic-stricken world of the book's modern period.There were times where (like a number of the other reviewers) I felt the pacing suffered in the book-- although in my case I felt like issues such as 'when' Kivrin actually was were artificially stretched out and strained the realistic layer of the novel in the service of adding additional suspense. Similarly, I felt that the book was hindered by the constant need for people to wait by the telephone and the inability to reach people-- even though the book was written a while ago, cell phones and answering machines were obvious components of the future.However, the flaws do not detract too badly from the overall worth of the book, or the pleasure in its reading."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is the only the second sci-fi book I've ever read (the first was Connie Willis' &quot;To Say Nothing of the Dog&quot;). Doomsday Book is absolutely exceptional. I couldn't put it down. Easily the best book I've read in years. Highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I had to read The Doomsday Book for a college class on Science Fiction novels. I was never a science fiction fan, but I found this book to be exceptional. I leant it out to a friend(who selfishly never returned it)and I am buying it again right now. I do not normally buy a book more than once, so this one obviously impressed me. It was well written, placeing me in the future and the past with little questioning on my part."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I'm in a bit of a dilemmna--I'm at the end of this book, roughly where Kivrin learns the \\"shocking\\" truth about when she is, but I can't bring myself to finish it up. I'm pretty astounded that this book has gotten such good acclaim. It has its strong points--14th century England is very interesting, especially at the beginning when Kivrin first passes through.But as science fiction, this book is quite poor. It seems that in the year 2050, the only technological advance we will have made is the video phone. I'm not kidding, that's it! The time travel rules are in one sense well thought out, but wouldn't that kind of thing be done by some govt. agency, rather than some rather bumbling college professors? It seemed pretty easy for the fatal mistake they made to be made.Above all, Ms. Willis' writing style is the ultimate challenge here. It's dull, often deadly dull. The present day story isfull of routine detail but is set in the midst of no real action or plot. We follow Dunworthy as he tries to manage the plague crisis as well as save Kivrin. A typical passage goes is at times laughable: Dunworthy making phone call after phone call (there's that video phone again...does no one have a cell? They must have been outlawed) and trying to deal with crises on the Oxford campus (another thing, Ms. Willis' obviously knows the campus well, and shows this off in the book, but if you've never been there, you'll be confused with the locations). If I do finish this novel, if Dunworthy spends more that 3 sentences calling someone who isn't there and leaving messages, I'm going to find a shotgun to dispose of this book.I kept waiting for something to happen, for all this detail to pay off, but no. Willis doesn't really have anything for the present-day characters to do, so she just keeps pointlessly adding more. The action is confusing as well; characters bounce around from one place to another for no reason.The past fares a bit better, but it's often as repetitive. At first, I was immediately struck with the similarity to Michael Chriton's TIMELINE, and I'm still amused that Chriton seems to have...borrowed the basic plot for his book. A book, btw, that has a lot of the action that I think is missing from this book, but TIMELINE was a true piece of junk (and the movie as well, natch). But the repetitive writing just drags....the story...along....Kivrin...sick....plague....bells.....HELP! I don't need explosions and swordfights, but Ms. Willis needed to throw in a heaping helping of plot. Yes, Kivrin, you need to get to the drop--we got it the first time! Repeating this fact 2,000 times does not constitute a plot.Maybe I'll finish it, we'll see."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I was going to write an elaborate critique of this book (and a very negative one at that) but I see that there is quite a number or previous reviewers who already explained why this book deserves no more than * or **: this is a boring, incoherent anti-story, in which the characters are allegedly given \\"depth\\" through lengthy and tedious descriptions but in fact one gets the impression that Willis was paid by the page and simply needed to inflate the volume of the book, where Oxford and the Oxonian system are portrayed completely inaccurately (I am a graduate of the University of Oxford so I know) and where so many things, from the telecommunication of the year 2048 to the medicine of 2048, are absolutely implausible (particularly considering that this is a SF book that was written in the early 1990s, not 1890s). The historical descriptions are as trivial as the ones you can find in any college-level history textbook. This was my first Connie Willis book, and most probably my last (I cannot believe it won the Nebula; SF surely was experiencing one of its worst times)."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I was so excited to read this. I had read that it was one of the top notch books about the Black Death. So many reviews have already covered the details that I am going to keep this short and just say it was a huge disappointment. I think it MIGHT have been salvageable if the whole story was set in the Middle Ages. I need to read an outstanding book now to cleanse my palate."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. The story develops slowly to draw the reader into it's world. Throughout the pages. details that foreshadow coming events are cleverly revealed, leading to a mounting tension and a brooding unease. I found the concept and storyline to be very unique and thought provoking. I couldn't put the book down. There is tremendous depth within this book, themes of isolation, the dichotomy's of the past and present brought together by time travel, greed vs. goodness, the list goes on. I highly recommend this book for it's thought provoking concepts and richly descriptive text. As far as there being too many pages and repetitive sections, I don't think that reviewer was reading the same book that was. I don't think it could have been written in any other way. I guess the best thing I can say about this book is that it has stayed with me long after I finished it and I think about it still."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"After reading all the wonderful recommendations for this book, I decided to give it a try. What a dissapointment! Granted, perhaps at the time this book was written, the idea was rather original but the author was so long-winded that it made it a frustrating read. The reader has to get to halfway through the book before the plot finally got interesting, but by that time, I found most of the characters so irritating that I skipped several pages at a time to get to the end of it!I would recommend you check this out from your local library before spending precious $$ on this book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This blend of fantasy, science and historical fiction, unlike so many other attempts, is entirely successful, in large part due to the author's writing skills and ability to create believable characters and circumstances both in the future and in the past. Replete with some of the most memorable characters and moving interactions I have experienced in any genre, Ms. Willis invests her protagonists with a humanity and realism unparalleled by any other genre author I can recall reading. Criticism that some of the characters are flatly rendered is preposterous, Ms. Willis' characterizations even with the secondary characters rising far above the typical protagonists encountered in most fantasy and science fiction. And, as other reviewers have commented, the final scenes with Father Roche, Agnes and Rosemund should stir the emotions of even the most cynical, nor have I ever encountered children more realistically and poignantly portrayed.The author has invested this tale with a great amount of historical detail and realism, bringing the period of 1348 England back to life in a way that should satisfy even the most fastidious historical scholar. And, as others have noted, there is an element of humor running throughout the narrative that alleviates some of the grim circumstances being recounted, offering a balance to what essentially is a tragedy leaving the central participants forever changed . Even more astonishing is the author's ability to interweave both the tragic and comic elements without their ever seeming forced or overtly contrived. She avoids both the farcical as well as the melodramatic, making the events she narrates and the characters she creates utterly believable.It is a shame that a recent work such as Michael Crichton's &quot;Timeline,&quot; with it's obvious borrowings from this book, should have garnered by comparison such a wide readership, while &quot;The Doomsday Book&quot; remains relatively ignored except for devotees of fantasy and science fiction. While perhaps lacking the rousing action that typifies much of the common currency of these genres, the author's skill of writing and the humanity in which she invests her tale elevates this work well beyond the ordinary tale encountered in any genre. It is a memorable work that easily stands alone, and I would strongly recommend it to anyone, regardless of his or her taste in fiction."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I found the pacing frustrating, she slowly moved through material I thought relatively unimportant, and then I thought the ending was rushed."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I love history, particularly the medieval period. This is the book that started my reading Connie Willis. The book is fascinating and full of rich detail and characterizations. It remains my all-time favorite from Connie."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"For me, this is one of those uncommon books I absolutely could not put down, took with me in the car to read in parking lots when I could steal a free moment, and stayed up late into the night to squeeze in a few more pages.Other reviewers have covered the plot in detail (some too much detail, giving away surprises), so I will simply add as a general, non-spoiler warning that if graphic descriptions of illness and crude methods of treatment turn your stomach, there will be numerous pages that are very difficult to read.That said, I adored these characters, particularly the young girl Agnes. I wish there were a sequel to this book! If you can suspend your disbelief that in the future, no one has a cell phone (this novel was penned before they were prominent) and get over the fact that getting to a phone is a significat obstacle much of the time, you will be in for a terrific journey.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I read this book out of the need to experience Nebula Award winner Connie Willis more than anything. I'd not heard of Willis until recently, and can say that she is a fine, above the fold writer, who can tell a captivating story. I agree with many who think the book was longer than it needed to be, but it seemed that everything worked to propel or stop the story as a way of manipulating the reader into similar emotional experiences felt by the characters. When the main characters felt frustration, so did I, on multiple levels. I also agree with several reviewers that the last 1/3rd of the book is its redemption, and that anyone feeling frustration up to that point might well find their reward should they power through to the end.The story line takes two paths, one follows Mr. Dunworthy, a professor at Oxford in the near future (mid 21st century). It is here that historians not only study history, but observe it. Trained as time travelers, they visit the time periods they wish to study. It is in this Oxford that an epidemic of enfluenza breaks out, just as Kivrin, a history student is sent back to 1320, just prior to the outbreak of the Black Death. While Dunworthy runs around trying to get Kivrin back from the middle ages, everyone around him falls ill, and he finds himself frustratingly trying to track down the source of the flu and the head of the University, while setting up sick wards, etc. It is this story line most people find fault with, but Willis does a good job of pulling Dunworthy in so many directions that he couldn't possibly get anything accomplished. He becomes the father figure who is impotent to save his student from imagined horrors, while he can scarcely do anything to help those around him falling like flies due to the modern day horrors of an unidentified flu strain.The second story line follows Kivrin into the middle ages and into the lives of \\"contemps.\\" WIllis has created a much more engaging story here, in which Kivrin becomes part of these peoples' lives, and we begin to question the time travel paradox laid out before us. Is it really true that time travelers cannot affect the lives and outcomes of those they come in contact with. As the story progresses, we see Kivrin figure out that she is not in 1320, and we watch as she struggles to save the people around her.Has she infected the people she's come into contact with? Has she changed the future? Will she ever manage to get back to 21st century Oxford? and in the end, will it matter?This is an engaging read, if slow and frustrating at times. The ending, while full of sadness, is the story's (& the characters') redemption. Willis weaves the two stories together with a loose thread, but the connections are very palpable and hold true. Read Dooms Day Book with a willingness to experience the failings and hopefulness of the human condition, then go out and do something fun."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I love this book because you pick up a book ostensibly about time travel, and you get an adventure, a mystery, a comedy, an unidentified plague running rampant and a relationship story. No sex, no gore, some death (it's a plague after all!), but no violence. I laughed, I cried, I got surly when people interupted my reading time.Read this, and then \\"To Say Nothing of the Dog\\" also by Connie Willis. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Although it took a good two thirds to decide, I've come to the conclusion that I really enjoyed this book.\\"Doomsday Book\\" follows two parallel stories separated by about 500 years. 50 years in the future, history Professor James Dunworthy finds himself caught amidst an epidemic, trapped in a quarantine and unable to confirm the safety of his most beloved student, Kivrin. Kivrin has been sent into England's medieval past, to 1320, in search of understanding a pre-plague England. It's clear that something went wrong with Kivrin's jump into the past, but it's less than clear what it was or how serious it might be. While Dunworthy balances life in quarantine, Kivrin finds herself in 14th century England lost and very ill.Willis carves out parallel paths between the present and past. Characters from both worlds mirror each other and reflect what's different in each era and what remains very much the same. Both paths have religious intolerants, blindly blaming sickness under a pretense of godly rationale. Both tell stories of hope and courage in face of intolerable odds. Both stories tell stories of how religion effects people - both believers and non alike. All of this is strung together by disease running rampant across the modern and historic England.The story is thick and rich. Each world is built very steadily and is framed in the minutiae of life's daily details. Through these details, a very character-driven story emerges and this is what ultimately led to my enjoyment of the book. Kivrin's relationship with two young girls who live in the home in which she recovers is the most potent. A bond develops quickly, and Willis writes with a tone and palette and that feels very genuine, both in time period and in the voice of youths. Dunworthy develops a relationship with a friend's great-nephew, Colin. This relationship is paralleled by Kivrin's to the girls, and sewn together by the touching relationship between teacher and student.The middle 150 pages or so includes a lot of hand wringing and anxiety. Credit to Willis for writing it such that I couldn't help but feel the worry as well. Willis' purpose in pushing the reader through this development becomes apparent only in the final 150 pages when the story screams to its conclusion. There were times when I felt the story's mysteries were obvious, but in fact they weren't. Only towards the end did I truly understand why Willis spent as many words building relationships, characters and environments as she did.The book is as much historical fiction as it is science fiction. It's not a light read, but it's deep and satisfying."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is the second book I've read by Connie Willis. To Say Nothing of the Dog was the first and it was absolutely fantastic. I still loved this one, but for a different reason. The story sets out with an ominous tone, and the paranoid feeling that something bad is going to happen never really lets up. While it sounds bad, it's actually a good thing because Willis has a way of getting you to care about her characters early on in the story, and I know it worked on me because I was fretting about what could happen to the characters. That, to me, is one measure of a really great story. If I find myself adding commentary about the characters in my head (\\"No, no don't do that!\\", \\"Yes!\\", \\"Oh drats\\"), then I know the author and the story has won me over.And what a story. There's mystery, plot twists, drama, and humor. I love the snappy remarks, and the witty banter between the characters. There were a number of slow points in the story, but not enough to make me want to quit reading altogether. I found it to be one of those books that feel like they're long and are just going to go on forever. Trust me. Stick with it because the last 100 pages or so fly by and are just amazing. I'm really glad that I read it."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I find myself recommending this book to friends all the time, and yet, I can't stand to part with my well-loved copy, even for a few days. I finally buckled down and bought several extra copies so I could give them away without separation anxiety."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is my first book by this author but I will pick up a few more. I loved the time-travel concept and this one was well done. The descriptions of the Dark Ages was informative and seemed realistic (as much I can be).The characters were well-fleshed and interesting. Good book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"One thing that distinguishes Connie Willis fromother writers is that she does her homework. Doomsday Book is the culmination of five years of research that Willis did on the time period and the Black Death. The end result is a rather dark novel, but one whose characters are not only sympathetic, but mulit-dimensional and well-developed. This is Willis' forte in her writings, and this book is no exception.This peek into fourteenth-century Europe-- during its darkest times was a little too dark for me, I liked the novel, although personally felt that it was a bit too hopeless for my taste. This is my least favorite Willis novel-- which is not to say that this work is bad-- far from it. In fact, Doomsday Book earned her a Hugo and a Nebula award. It's just not to my tastes."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I came to this book expecting a fairly lighthearted story, such as what Ms. Willis wrote in &quot;To Say Nothing Of The Dog&quot;. While this book is anything but frivolous, I still found it to be a very entertaining read. I found the characters believable and the dualistic plot very well done. I highly recommend it with one word of caution: the book gets very dark at times. If you dislike that sort of fiction, you will likely not enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"A historian by training, adventuress by nature. That describes Kivrin, the young woman whose dream is finally coming through as she is sent to study life in the year 1320. The middle ages is a time fraught with danger, especially for a woman alone. Kivrin shrugs this off as she prepares to be a part of something that she has dreamed of for years.Nothing can go wrong. There are checks and cross checks and redundancies everywhere. The net has been used before and often. So often that Gilchrist, the arrogant, self serving unprepared and untrained man in temporary charge of the facility seems fine with foregoing some of the tests and checks.Kivrin is all too willing to believe him, and to take the risk to live her dream. Nothing can go wrong.She has made preparations down to the last detail of proper clothing, and language, She even made sure that her nails were worn and broken by volunteering at a local archeological dig before she leaves.The archeological dig that was nearly the undoing of everyone for miles around.Kivrin herself and Baldri the tech assisting at sending her to 1320 are both infected by a bacteria that has survived the tomb they helped to uncover.Not only does Kiverin arrive at her destination infected, but something else has gone gravely wrong. People are dying in the time she left and the time where she is now living. Was it her? Did she bring this upon them?I admit to an affinity for time travel stories. Who would not want to see what it was like when the Pyramids were being built? Who would turn down a chance to see a time before they were born, a simpler, happier time?The characters in this story were realistic, complicated and human. People doing the best that they can to have the best that life can offer them. They lived and loved and worked together in communities 700 years apart, but not so different after all.This is a story filled with dreams, with anguish and fear. But it is also a story of love and hope and strength. I was captivated by the characters and the tale. I couldn't put it down, until I finally learned how the story ended."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I agree with the other reviews saying that the book should be 1/3 of its lengh. It is just VERY SLOW going. I almost put it down never to read it again. The last 150 pages or so is were the action finally happens. I also had a hard time getting past the lack of cell phones in what was supposed to be 2050. One of the main characters spends way too much time trying to track down the head of the college with only wired phones. I know this was written in the early nineties but even back then car phones existed.All in all I would not recommend this book because is it just too long and too slow going. Yes the end is really good but I would not re-read 400 pages to get to it again."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I will say that I almost didn't keep reading the book after the first 50 pages. Getting to the time travel was excruciatingly boring and complicated....And it was done on purpose. Some smidgeon of interest would be sparked by the author, who would then change the chapter and emerge a new scene, leaving the reader to wait until later to find out what happened (TIME and TIME again).BUT, I must say that once the time travel actually got to medieval times, I was quite interested in the story. The characters were interesting and the depth of the author's research in medieval times was evident.I would recommend this book -- but only to those who have the patience to wait for the good parts."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Rarely does a book make me change the way I look at life (or in this case, death). This was one of them.It made me understand truly what \\"dignity in death\\" means. And yes, my heart ached for the protagonist who was simply too young to understand the importance of the gift that she had bestowed upon the village."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Here is the backbone of this science fiction/fantasy/historical novel. In the middle of this century, time travel is a reality. A graduate student from Oxford is chosen for an assignment to go back to the same city of the 1320's and report her experiences there. The thing is, through a blunder, she is sent to Oxford in 1347, just as the Black Death arrives. This story makes a 650 year-old event seem as tragic as if it occurred in the present, and puts faces and names on the victims of the worst pandemic in recorded history. It is well-written, fast-paced, imaginative and impacting. I've never known anyone not to think well of this book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I don't like Willis's writing style. I'll say that right up front. She repeats herself constantly, and feels the need to tell us everything her characters are thinking, even when they are just thinking again about the same things they've been thinking about for several chapters. She tries to use this repitition to build up suspense when instead she is building up annoyance. More than once, while listening to this story in my car, I yelled at her to just get on with it.That having been said, this is a compelling story with engaging characters. I can't actually say I enjoyed reading it, but in places it was deeply moving. Whereas I'm more typically drawn to the fantastic action-oriented heroism of works like _The Lord of the Rings_, this book is more about the much more realistic and desperately-needed heroism of people like Mother Theresa: the heroism that doesn't save the world so much as just try to ease as much of the pain as it can.It's a good book, and I can recommend it, though I'd recommend an abridged version more if it's available. My only complaint story-wise is one unanswered mystery: where did Basingame go? I still don't know, but I guess it really doesn't matter.I can't find it in Amazon's catalog, but I was actually listening to the Recorded Books edition of this book, narrated by Jenny Sterlin, who did a superb job of bringing the story to life."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"The development of character and place in this story of time travel to plague ridden England in 1348 overcame a plot that sometimes plodded along toward the inevitable conclusion. Willis made the historical characters come alive, so this reader grieved when they black plague killed them so awfully."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"To put it simply, Connie Willis's 'Doomsday Book' is one of the best book I've ever read.When twentysomething Kivrin bravely journey's to the 1300's, she had no idea what terrors lie waiting for her. While she is trying to stay alive and sane in the brutal 14th century, her counterparts back home in 2058 are dealing with their own brutality, trying all the time to save the young, lost historian. Amazingly, like the angel she is thought to be, Kivrin takes the entire town under her care, nursing them as each one becomes increasingly sick. On the edge of death herself, Kivrin stays strong for her make-shift family, until she left completely alone.Desperately funny, painfully sad, unbelievably terrifying and astoundingly visual, 'Doomsday Book' is more than simply read - it is felt."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Great book. The characters are well drawn and the story is enthralling. Could not stop thinking about it."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"In a modern world where even time travel is possible, society faces a deadly plague. And a time traveler, copes with one of the worst plagues is history.Connie Willis shows how two societies -- one past one future -- struggle with the onset of uncontrolled disease.In our post September 11 life, this book is both diverting, and ominous."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I must say, this book was one of the most excruciating things to get through. Although I am not a fan of science fiction literature, I was thoroughly intrigued by the plot. The author's writing style, however, is terribly formulaic and annoying. Many of the facts presented in this book are quite interesting and informative (I must say that it is an extremely well researched book); nevertheless they are repeated over and over, as if to beat the reader over the head with them. The one thing I will take from this book is that 1348 was recorded as the year the plague entered England. Honestly it would be impossible to forget... that fact was mentioned SO OFTEN it is ingrained into my brain. I must also say that there was very little, if any, character and plot development... the story begins rather abruptly. Upon finishing, I still have no clue what motivated nearly all of the characters. Too many things were left unanswered and unexplained. Oh, and I did not like the strange abbreviations (Which I assumed were feeble attempts at slang) such as \\"contemps\\" and \\"vids\\" and \\"vac\\" to name a few. Perhaps these are just british slang? All in all, I would say that strictly based on literary criteria... this books fails entirely. It is extremely formulaic and reads as if written with the help of \\"Science Fiction Writing for Dummies.\\" I do, however, applaud the author's detailed and precise research. That alone, garners it one star."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I am finally finished! What a monotonous journey. I will not attempt to say once again what has been so eloquently said many times before. However, one thing that I had to mention was a phrase that has stuck in my mind. I found myself last week picking up the book so that I might be able to put closure to it. So there I am reading (ok skimming) this book as some say, \\"Best time-travel novel I've ever read!\\" or \\"a study of people's behavior\\" what behavior, all the characters did the same thing over and over again. Oh but I digress... so there I am late night reading this when suddenly out of nowhere comes the words \\"I brought a locator\\" ... ok on I read.... What! ....What the @#@# a locator. I went back and read it again, no that can't be.... Kivrin the young historian who travels back in time has only one concern and that is to find the \\"DROP\\" which turns out to be a dreary undertaking. Why wouldn't she have taken a locator with her in the first place? If she can have a recorder (chip corder) and an interpreter then surely she can have a locator. Does it take a young boy to figure that one out? I would have been spared about 200 pages! At this point, I was going to toss the book over the balcony, but then I realized this was an autographed book, just my luck."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"A great deal of the book was annoying and felt contrived. After reading other, good works, by Stephenson, Gibson, Simmons, Gene Wolfe, &amp;c, I was quite let down with this one. I can't imagine how it won a Hugo award."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I bought this book beaceuse it got the Hugo AND the Nebula. Ever since Harry Potter got the Hugo I do not trust that award at all, but the Nebulas have been all very good. Well, this book is a big disappointment for me. I also read \\"To Say Nothing of The Dog\\" and this is even worse. The characters are ridicoulous, nothing happens, the plot is agonizingly slow, the plot twists are abvious chapters before they happen and the author just keeps repeating herself over and over again. I do not agree with other reviewers that female sci-fi authors are not good. Try some Le Guin or Nancy Kress, they write the best science fiction out there. But after 2 shots at Mrs Willis I give up."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I got this book at the library, not sure if I'd finish the long book. It was very good and I couldn't stop reading it. I must say, though, that the part of the book about the future got a little boring after a while, and interupted the exciting 14th century part of the novel."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I knoweth naught how I shall bide the toil of this day, when I wish nothing more than to goeth hence and seek yon feline and read of Doomsday.Ah! Mamalinda was charmed and enveloped by this amazing story of time travel into both the future and the past. Truly an amazing and clever &quot;don't set it down&quot; kind of tome. Most of the other reviewers have said pretty well everything, but I felt moved to other worlds. However, this 7 year old book does miss a few things about the future - as in cellphones and e-mail - it was amazing to even imagine our futuristic friends hanging about for a phone call.Aye, the but the sky to the north drops clean snow. Do not waste yet more time on drudgery, but seek ye solace and comfort with this book and thy hound and/or feline. I would but seek ye Lord of the Manor and bade him some distant toil, and send him thence. Then perchance thou may partake of tales of distance times, mayhap with a warmed jar of libation and a cheery hearth."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"There is a great idea buried in a whole bunch of annoying characters many of whom don't do much more than walk around the house waiting for more bad things to happen to them. At the least, Ms. Willis needs to find a better editor."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I don't know where to begin except to say how disapointed I was in this book. I actually feel bad that Willis wasted 5 years of her life on this. I have read most of the Hugo awards winners and this just doesn't stand up. I guess she spent a lot of her time researching the 14th century and the Black Death but it didn't pay off in the entertainment department.The only semi-interesting aspect of this book was the time travel aspect. Willis has a well thought plan here with some originality in it that makes for an interesting premise. I like how the different time periods are rated based on how dangerous they are and how the detail behind the training that time travelers go through. Unfortunately pretty much everything else about the rest of the book is horrible.The plot switches from the main character stuck in England in 1348 on the eve of the Black Plauge to her fellow colleagues in 2048 England. The biggest problem of this book is that it is flat out BORING! The main character is a whiny grad student who knew she shouldn't be traveling back in time and really does nothing to capture the hearts of the reader. Part of the problem is she is a twit, part of the problem is the plot devices used are bad choices. She arrives in 1348, gets lost and sick and almost dies at that takes 300 pages. In the next 250 pages she slowly starts to realize that she is off her target by X amount of years and is there on the eve of the plauge but the reader has realized this long before. Back in 2048, we sit through stupid characters going through the usual political intrigue stuff involving opening up the time portal and debating wether or not to send people back to save her.It's a shame that this book turned out like it did. I wouldn't mind reading another shot at the 2048 world and time travel ability that Willis created. Willis does a great job of putting you into the setting but this village in 1348 was just bland and boring and maybe this book could of benefitted from a change of setting. Also Willis needs work on her charaters. By the end of the book I couldn't care less if Kivrin made it out or not. Most of the other characters were one-dimensional at best. Finally the book was just way too predictable. Everything that happened was telegraphed so early that I was screaming at the book for a surprise.Its funny how the Hugo award was split in 93 with this trash and Vernor Vinge's A Fire Upon The Deep. Both books are similar in the sense that they deal with individuals in a foreign land dealing with external forces and trying to come to terms with themselves. A Fire Upon The Deep is an amazing book that is does everything right that Doomsday does wrong and I can't fathom how a tie possibly occured.Bottom Line: Avoid this like the Plauge!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Although the writer's style is good and words seem to flow, I can't really say what this story is about. The whole plot revolves around the symptoms and the progress of an epidemic, which is hardly a deep conflict felt by the main character , but a mere accident she is the victim of--in fact, the only decision she has to make is to wait. Too much of the suspense relies on the fact that, due to the quarantine and the pace of this epidemic, characters fail to communicate with one another. When at LONG last communication is reestablished, the story ends. Without a theme that bounds the elements of the story , this turns out to be a bunch of anecdotes, medical data, and descriptions of several attempts and failures at communication, thrown together.It doesn't convey anything else."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"People have been recommending this author to me for years, and I finally picked up her Nebula &amp; Hugo award winning title... and wow, was I disappointed. Read the Amazon editor's sumation and other reviews for the storyline, but here's my complaints:- contrived plot that doesn't explain itself- many 2 dimensional characters that were uneeded, except as comic relief and a way for Ms. Willis to demonstrate her obvious knowledge regarding 14th century EnglandThis book would have been much better with characters who had believable motivations and if the project had a better editor; no matter how long a book takes to be written, any good editor would've chopped well over 100 pages off this."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book is far too long. A good idea is wasted by the author's relentless repetition of every detail, and her inexplicable inflation of every tiny plot point (Kivrin is so sick--will she make it to the window seat? Will she make it down the stairs? Will she get back to the manor house?).I lost respect for the Hugo award years ago--this book makes me wonder about the Nebula as well."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I got so annoyed reading this book. This book was written in 1992 about the year 2048. Now I understand its difficult to predict the future, but this author didn't even know what technology was going on around her in 1992!. There are no mobile phones in this 2048 future. In 1992 I has owned a handheld mobile phone for 4 years!. People do not have answering machines or voicemail in 2048. Voicemail had been around for at least 6 years in 1992, answering machines had been around for 20+ years. There is no mention of the internet of course in 2048. You might say that would have been a bold prediction, however computer networks like Compuserve were around in 1992, I was using it, and bulletin boards had been around for several years, yet there are no computer networks in 2048. There are almost no computers in 2048, only a brief reference to \\"consoles\\". However in 1992 lots of businesses had computers. I personally had a computer at home since 1988, and before that I had a commodore 64 that I used for word processing, but in 2048 there are no obvious computers people read \\"typed\\" pages - with a typewriter?This author was so out of touch with commonplace technology in 1992 yet she tried to predict the future 60 years ahead!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"In summary, a graduate level history student travels back in time to do research on the Middle Ages. Pandemic occurs in both time lines. Chaos ensues as efforts are made, amid the current day crisis to rescue the student.This dual Hugo and Nebula Award winning science fiction novel certainly generates opinions all over the spectrum. Having recently completed the work, I can verify every negative comment contained in the dozens of \\"one star\\" reviews. Without question, the book is extremely frustrating in its repetition and refusal to resolve simple matters. As a result, what could have been a well crafted 400 page novel becomes a 550 page slog.In addition, fans of \\"hard\\" science fiction will be extremely disappointed in what is essentially historical fiction with time travel thrown in as an afterthought. There is very little explanation or \\"science\\" involved, beyond the simple declarations of what occurs. Many others have documented very well the \\"plot holes\\", inconsistencies and nonsensical threads that detract from a \\"hard\\" science fiction reader's enjoyment of the story. Readers of Frank Herbert, Robert Heinlein or Philip Dick will not stand quietly by.In fact, with few exceptions, there is very little to differentiate 2050 Oxford from 1970 Oxford. Tossing a \\"time machine\\" into the history lab and putting video screens on the rotary phones hardly elevates a novel into the realm of science fiction. Did this novel truly win both the Hugo and Nebula Awards? Really???That said, this novel has many ardent fans. Those readers simply enjoy a good story and don't need everything to make sense or fall neatly into place. I enjoyed some of the work, but am simply too anal to look past many of the problems cited above and by others. Too many fine writers have penned outstanding stories AND gotten the science and the plot lines correct to label this work anything close to a masterpiece. The idea that the Dean of an Oxford College would be completely incommunicado in the year 2050 for nearly a month is too absurd to consider.Consider the matter of communications. Much of the book involves numerous unsuccessful efforts to reach others by telephone, the only difference between communications in 1950 and 2050 being a video screen. Now, some have excused the author's failure to account for advanced communications technology (aka cell phones) by arguing that cell phones were not pervasive when this novel was written in 1992. However, I'm pretty sure bag phones and even clunky cell and satellite phones WERE in existence. Other science fiction writers have shown remarkable vision in forecasting the future. Their work, as a result, remains timeless. This novel, on the other hand, reads silly only 15 years after its publication. H.G. Wells was describing submarines and rocket ships 100 years ahead of his time. Connie Willis fails to recognize cell phones even after their introduction. That is the difference between classic science fiction and run of the mill two/three star work."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I had this on my \\"buy list\\" for quite a while so when I finally had the time to read it, I was interested to see a new take on time travel. Things that were well done: the actual mode of time travel via \\"the net\\" was not a focus of the story at all, which kept one from getting lost in the technology and focused on the story. Also, the author used a technique that I appreciate of not telling us every little detail about the backstory of the characters, so you felt you like had to get to know the main characters.However, there were a few issues in the storytelling that moved this from a 4-5 star to a 3 star rating:1. The characters in the \\"present time\\" were so similar to each other that I couldn't remember who was who. Led to a lot of page skimming as they dealt with their version of \\"a plague\\", people coming in and out of rooms generally asking the same questions over and over.2. The lack of any reasonable safeguards about time travel (like using a locator, which apparently was possible) and other means to allow for finding the drop point, made it seem like a completely unregulated adventure by historians who were willing to take unreasonable risks (solo, no weapons, no recon, etc.)3. Overall, the story played out fairly well, but became repetitious."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"After reading Willis' To say nothing of the Dog (my first of her books), the Doomsday Book was slightly disappointing. Not only was it sombre,(which, given the subject, was to be expected), but hardly fleshed out. People dying like flies left you cold, there was no emotion really explored, and apart form the priest's character, none of the others were really interesting. It all seemed like a cardboard set. Still, given the period and Willis' verve for writing, it is more than passable."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I have no idea how this book won the Hugo and Nebula awards. The writing is extremely repetitive and the parallel structure of the novel (present + time-travelling past) is obvious an uninteresting.A good idea wasted on poor execution."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I'm VERY surprised this book won the Hugo and Nebula awards. The Science Fiction part of this book is VERY minor. I wouldn't say it's a bad read, but it just isn't really science fiction. Other than the fact that 'Kivrin' timejumps to the middle ages, there is pretty much NO science fiction to it. Even the parallel storyline of her 'contemporaries' dealing with a virulent flu epidemic in 2048 could easily (other than the fact they are able to send people back in time) be set in 2011.If you want to read a plausible story about what it might have been like to live with an 'upper-middle-class' family in a small village in England when the black death hits, this book is for you. The parallel storyline of a virulent flu epidemic that hits the 2048 timeline is a similarly plausible story of what might happen to us today if a 'strange' flu epidemic hit us. If you're looking for science fiction, I suggest you look elsewhere (if you haven't read the Nights Dawn Trilogy yet, I suggest you check that out!)."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I read this book back in the early 90s and never forgot it. Somehow the phrase \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" came up in conversation recently and I flashed on a particular scene toward the end of this book that's been burned into my mind for close to 20 years. I guess I would take that as a sign it's a pretty good book. I'm ordering it now so I can read it again. Although I vividly remember almost all of the scenes set in the past, honestly, I've forgotten most of the scenes set in the future. It will be interesting to see how they read 20 years later. I gave it 5 stars anyway because if a book can haunt you for that long, it's got something special."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Willis has written a wonderful, enlightening book that is destined to be a perennial favorite of time travel fans. The characters and settings ring true throughout. She was particularly good at conveying her extensive research in relevant ways, avoiding the common \\"I know something that I've just got to include, even though it doesn't progress the story\\" so common in historical fiction. This book is a joy to read."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This review contains no spoilers. The book wasn't as much a sci-fi, or even a time-travel story, as a study of people's behavior in crisis. As many others here, I happened to read this book based on it winning Hugo Award. I enjoyed it despite many of its shortcomings. Like most other reviewers, I wish there was more character development - especially when it came to the main character. Still, I ended up caring for the heroine, and the book does get better in the 2nd part. There are a few good ideas here, that make up for the slow plot. I actually enjoyed it enough, to pick up the sequel \\"To Say Nothing of The Dog\\", which takes place in the same universe. We'll see how that one goes."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is not your typical science fiction novel which is long on technology and short on character development. I think that Connie Willis has written a remarkable and ambitious novel; she has taken an time travel story and turned it into a public health mystery and a historical novel with some wit and humor thrown in for good measure. This is the story of a historian from the mid 21st century who travels to the 14th century to study medieval culture. The story is told in two parts, one in the future and the one in the past. The future part of the story involves the search for the origins of a killer flu which has descended upon Oxford, England, and the struggle to get back the historian who was sent to the past. We learn what happens to the historian, Kivrin, in the part of the story that takes place in the 14th century. In both parts of the story we learn very important human truths. That you can never completely forsee the outcome of any endeavor no matter how completely you plan, that human being will alway behave in a foolish and irrational manner when confronted with a crisis no matter how &quot;advanced&quot; they have become, and the love is indeed the most powerful force in the universe and perhaps our greastest gift from God. I recommend this novel highly."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I read this book on the strength of the other reviews, and of the favorable mention that it got in the reviews of The Plague Tales. The whole first half of the book should have been condensed down to one chapter. It's so full of stalling, filler, and just plain stupidity, especially in the future section, that it hardly bears skimming. I was so exhausted by the time I got to the meat of the story that I almost resented spending the time to finish the book. Keep away from this one unless you have a very high tolerance for pointless prose."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Doomsday Book was very difficult to get into, a really slow read. This book had a depressing story line with no payoff."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"It's really dry and boring; I cannot see why it's a hugo and nebula award winner. The way the author is trying to create suspense is really frustrating. Please don't waste time on this book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Could Willis foreshadow a little more? The first 200 pages read something to the affect of &quot;does she have the black plague?&quot; I wonder what's wrong with her, she had been syptoms similar to the plague, yet it is unconclusive....and so on and so on...Willis's characters have little depth and a central character, Dunsworthy, is an enitre yawn. This story could have been told in 200 pages opposed to 600. Save your time and your money.Get Micheal Creatines 'Timeline' instead if you like sci-fi."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Like others, I found the writing in this book overly repetitive (after being told for about the sixth time, I was pretty much willing to accept that one third to one half of Europe was wiped out by the plague) and sometimes tedious. Something that was particularly annoying was how the characters were constantly coming into and going out of most scenes, especially in the future part of the story. Similarly, the plague and influenza victims all seemed to be on a rollercoaster of getting worse, then gettng better, then getting worse, ad nauseum. It may be an accurate description of the progess of those diseases, but it hardly makes for page turning reading. Anyway, despite this, I stuck with the book and actually liked a couple of characters (Kirvin and Colin). And the historical insights were interesting. Overall, I don't feel I wasted my time, but the story could have been written much better."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I am an avid science fiction reader, and I am puzzled about the accolades this book received. The story about the people in the future is painfully slow, with annoying characters pondering over and over the same questions: which time is Kivrin? where the virus came from? and where is the drop? The strategy of having some characters being affected by fever and thus presumably unable to answer questions and maintain the \\"suspense\\" is lazy plotting.The book publicity mentions the 5 years that went into researching this book. The reader is thus lead to believe that the book will be about the Middle Ages, the culture, customs, environment, and contrast with modern times. The book is not about that, because Kivrin gets stuck in two or three family \\"village\\" and never moves from there. Thus, the Middle Age perspective is very near sighted.This book is about the Black Death and how it would have been experienced in a very small village. That's all. The material in this book would make an interesting few page story. Connie Willis did not have a plot for a novel.Which book with high star rating did the other reviewers read?The plot is formulaic. What do you do to build a plot given you only have a topic? You make the story about (i) a rescue, (ii) a chase, or (iii) a search. What do you do to build suspense? You wipe away information so that people doing the search have a difficult time. For example, Kivrin is sick when sent to the past, so that she does not know where she lands and, thus, will need others to convey this information to her, but those others will not share that information easily. Kivrin keeps on wondering on the location of the drop. She cannot pose directly the question to the medieval person holding this information because of cultural reasons (a woman cannot approach a man), or because the character is accompanied, or traveling, and this situation drags on and on and becomes very tiring to the reader. Kivrin's transient sickness is, otherwise, not relevant to the medieval story.I grew tired of the people from the future. I could not read that part of the story. The pace is too slow, the questions are the same, there are tons of distracting satellite characters, and lack of ideas. I focused on the story of Kivrin then, but that story became irritating too given that she cannot ask the location of the drop. The only worth part of this book is the Transcripts from the Domesday Book by Kivrin, at the end of the chapters.I cannot recommend this book. To date, I have read several Hugo and Nebula award winners that I cannot recommend. What is the deal with those awards?"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I love reading, and I love historical novels about long ago places. My all-time favorite book is \\"Pillars of Earth\\", describing England in the 12th Century in the most detailed and colorful manner I ever came across. So when I heard there was this book about a present day person travelling to 14th century England, I knew I had to read it, and went about it right away. I struggled right from the start. I found the first chapters about sending Kivrin over quite muddled and incoherent, but not in a \\"work your imagination\\" way, just out of focus. The things I found most irritating in the \\"future\\" parts of the book are the dialogues. They are just terrible, impersonal and totally unnatural. Basically, a bunch of people having their say with little to no reference to what the others said, or the tones in which things are said. I think the most obvious to me was the constant bickering between Gilchrist and Dunworthy. I have to correct myself, calling it bickering would give it some interpersonal meaning, where there's clearly none. Whenever Gilchrist opens his mouth, it's obvious what he's going to say, some cheap shot about Dunworty, and not a very sophisticated one either. On the other hand, Dunworthy is either deaf of suffering from severe communication issues, because none of it ever gets to him. No matter which cheap shot is thrown at him, his reply is mechanized and technical. At least once, I would have expected him to display some human emotion, answer back and tell Gilchrist to shut up. Turning the other cheek is a human virtue, but only to a point. This endless ping pong between them, with nothing to help the reader relate to any of the other characters, is quite tiring. Regarding the \\"Future\\" parts, I find that as with a lot of other futuristic predictions, the focus is so often of the big things (we can time travel and fly), but the day to day routines of people remain unchanged. This book was published in 92, meaning it's been written in the late 80's and early 90's, and it shows, mainly the failure to predict our dependency of mobile devices in the decades to come. So in the next decades we'll be able to implant smart translators into our heads, and transmitters into our palm, but if one isn't at his office to answer the phone, he's simply not reachable for hours.I found the 14th century parts poorly described, and although I believe the comprehensive research by the author helps describe the era as it was, I still find the descriptions dull, repetitive and unimaginative. When I first read the part of her arrival at the 14th century and hearing the birds as she's sprawled on the road, I was really excited and my imagination was running way ahead of me. But the next hours/days, as described through her prism of her fever were unnecessarily blurry and disappointing.I left this book half way through, then went through reviews because I desperately wanted to find the review that says that later on the book picks up and becomes magnificent, but sadly the reviews I read promised me that if you liked the start, you'll like it though, and if, like me, you found the first half disappointing, you'll find the rest just predictable, with further disappointment. Great miss in my opinion."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Time travel, cool! But the book was a let down. The book reads like two separate novels, one set in 2054 and one in 1348. I found the 2054 portion to be irritating more than anything else. Perhaps it's been too long since the author conceived it, but this 2054 seems to have land line telephones that are always burdened by too many callers. How can they have time travel, but the rest of the technology seems 1980?In the \\"future\\" portion of the book, the dialogue really ruined it for me. I don't know if it was supposed to be suspenseful, but the characters never got out what they wanted to say before something would happen, or else they just never spoke coherently; the constant off-topic prattling really irritated me. The sections of the book that take place in the past are more interesting and have much more of an emotional impact, but after a while I tired of reading descriptions about agonized, dying people.In fact, I ended up skimming a good deal of the book. I wanted to like this book but couldn't."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Other reviewers have pretty well covered the story line so I will jump right to my opinion. I guess I was expecting more \\"hard SF\\" and this felt more like fantasy; only got half way through and put it down out of pure boredom. It was purchased based on the number of good reviews; should pay more attention to bad reviews."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is one of the best novels I have ever read recently. It is &quot;science fiction&quot; but really transcends the genre."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I've read this book three or four times now, and it never gets old. Willis is a master of suspense, and this is especially apparent as the reader already has some clue as to when Kivrin ends up and what will happen to her medieval friends. This is by far the best book I've read in years."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Its been 5 years since i read this book and it still stands as the most interesting read i've come across. It's a story anyone can relate to, one of tragedy, hope and myriad emotion. it is elegant yet accessible, one of the qualities i find lacking in so much of the science fiction that is available. The amazing thing about this book is that the story and the feelings it elicits stay with you long after you're through reading. It balances hope and technology with raw ignorance and suffering and an uncompromising ending that doesn't pander to the reader. Truly a tour de force."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Connie Willis gives us a &quot;tour de force&quot; in &quot;Doomsday Book.&quot; Willis has not only created intreging characters, but she has also obviously done much detailed research into the world of Plague England. This book is worth reading. Also (if you can find a copy, it's out of print), check out her short-story prequel, &quot;Fire Watch,&quot; published in her original collection of short stories, &quot;Fire Watch.&quot"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book has an incredibly engaging, well rounded description of both the 14th and 21st Centuries. Absorbing and terrifying, it shows that people now are little changed from the people in the 1300s through parallel plague stories taking place both in 1348 and the near future. I identified strongly with Kivrin - as I was reading I felt I was her. This book's description of the 14th century was so vivid that when my phone rang, I started in terror, being so wrapped in the middle ages that I could not understand where that sound was coming from"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I read Doomsday Book shortly after if came out in paperback and throughly enjoyed it. It is a book I have recommended to friends without reservation. One friend came back to me in hysterics complaining that I hadn't warned her how funny it was. This may seem like an odd comment about a book dealing with parallel plagues, but the humor of the 21st century nicely balances the horror of 1348. I know I'll never hear bells again without thinking of this book. Recently, I picked it up again to refresh my memory on a scene, and was hooked all over again. I started reading from the middle to the end, and then back to the beginning. This book has become my touchstone for the 90's the way Gene Wolfe's Shadow of the Torturer series defined the 80's"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Doomsday Book has a great plot and that is the only thing that kept me going. The dialogue and characterizations are from some run-of-the-mill 1950's British novel. Ms. Willis writes stock characters that could come out of a hundred mediocre novels written 40 or 50 years ago by a bad imitator of Agatha Christie: The put-upon Professor trying to keep his head above water, the prissy male secretary, the adorable abandoned kid, the over worked doctor who seems to be the only MD within 50 miles, the absurd mother hen clucking on & on over her her comic book stud of a son, the devious fingerpointing scientist interested only in his own agenda. And those are the \\"contemporary\\" characters. The characters in the past fair only slightly better: our plucky heroine could've been played in the movie by Sandra Dee, the bratty little sister, the valiant knight smitten by the harried married lady of the house, the slovenly drudge, etc., etc.Someone mentioned that this should have been a short story or a novella. I suppose so, but I've rarely read a book that frustrated me so much! An interesting plot dragged down by so much bad dialogue and drivel masquerading as exposition.Didn't this book win a Nebula Award in 1992? One can only imagine what really bad books much have been in contention that year..."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I first read Coonie Willis' novel \\"The Doomsday Book\\" when it first came out in 1992. It is a true classic, one of those rare books that stays with you long after you read it. A powerful tale, extremely well written. Highly deserving of the Hugo and Nebula awards, both of which it won. It is very rare for a novel to win both of these coveted awards, and that alone indicates this is truly a great novel. If you enjoy high quality historical fiction, science fiction or deep fantasy tales, read this book. Not recommended for those who must have a Hollywood perfectly happy ending."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Ms. Willis has done a wonderful job with this book. Hugo and Nebula prizes were deservedly bestowed to this work.Time travel is a classic sci-fi subject and there are different possible approaches. The author chooses to research in depth the time period involved and that is a big plus. The medieval environment is presented to the reader with accurate strokes.Even if the story is a little slow to fully develop, after you pass the first hundred pages you are hooked and incapable to put this book down.Ms. Willis draw a parallel between past and present (future actually as present is year 2050), confronting a deadly epidemic situation in two different time periods.Characters are fully developed and show human depth. The reader is introduced to the intimate perceptions of many of them. Self sacrifice vs. selfishness; true deep religious belief vs. superficial self serving religious attitudes; human foolishness vs. humanitarian procedures are described in a gripping way.The dark background is mitigated by an underlying sense of humor that softens most dreadful scenes.Time travel is presented in a very coherent way, avoiding paradoxes and silly conflicts that spoil other novels.A book that may be enjoyed by sci-fi and fantasy adepts as well as people interested in historical novels.Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Willis' book---which deals with time travel and the recurring theme of plagues in societies---is well-written and a generally interesting read.Kirvin is an historian specializing in the Middle Ages. Living as she does in a period when historians can and do travel to the periods which they study, Kirvin requests permission to travel to the Middle Ages---a period rated as highly dangerous and generally forbidden to time travelers. She ultimately receives reluctant permission to travel to the past---specifically the period just before the Black Death of 1348. As is to be expected, problems occur with the \\"drop\\" and Kirvin winds up in a small village just as the Black Death appears. Meanwhile, back in her own time period, a dangerous and devastating epidemic breaks out.As a medical historian, I was really drawn to this book. There are a few minor errors in the book (most dramatically in Willis' complete lack of knowledge regarding the diseases which were common in medieval Europe---these were plentiful but they were not cholera, smallpox etc.). But this is a minor quiblle (and probably stems from the fact that I know way too much abt medical history!).The real heart of the book is Willis' depiction of societies beset by unknown and killer plagues. The medieval part of the story is really well-written---the characters were fascinating and their plight seemed incredibly real (the modern part of the story isn't half as interesting). I found myself flipping over the modern sections of the book to get to the medieval story---this story had incredible drama and Kirvin's reactions to the plight of the villagers (even her reactions to their daily life) were fascinating.Despite the weakness of the modern section, I would still recommend this book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This should really have been a short story or novella. The entire time I felt like I was reading a school paper whose author was trying to meet some enormous minimum word limit. Everything was repeated ad nauseam. I found myself saying things out loud, like, \\"Gee, I wonder what Dunworthy thinks about the 1300s? Oh, here we are: the fourteenth time he grumbled about the Plague and the highwaymen really cemented his opinion for me.\\"Also, as others have said, the author clearly didn't know what she was doing with the dialog. I lived in England for 7 years--Oxford for 5 of those--and I never heard anyone say they were going on \\"vac\\" (they go on holiday), or that they saw something on \\"the vids\\" (referring to television, I assumed). I suppose we could chalk these up to the author's imagined future-slang, but it came off as grating for me. Also, every time the American looked at her \\"digital\\" I wanted to roll my eyes."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book is not as good as it could have been, yet it was sufficiently good to keep me up most of the night reading it. Once the story got going, it was very suspenseful and fast-paced-- thus the lack of sleep. However, Connie Willis does not, in my opinion, have the writing skills to keep up with her imagination. The book has a tendency to over-describe, which can be rather annoying. It is clearly well-researched, but one gets the feeling that Willis was so desperate to include every little bit of research, that she wasn't willing to cut anything out for the sake of a more streamlined narrative. Luckily, after the first few chapters, I was able to ignore this aspect and focus on the story, which is a great one.The story is set in mid-21st-century Oxford and tells the tale of a time-traveling historian who is sent back to the 14th century to study medieval daily life. Things go wrong, both in the 14th and 21st centuries, and Doomsday itself just about arrives. The details of the time machine and the mechanism (a 'corder') which helps the historian record her observations are fascinating. There is a human element to this story as well, which is very engaging.Though it's enjoyable, I don't think this book was as good as it could have been. It never felt totally authentic, which I think, is absolutely crucial for good sci-fi (the category this book technically belongs to). The characters are somewhat one-dimensional, which is unfortunate, since they have occasional glimmers of greatness, especially the medieval ones. I eagerly read to the end, but I was disappointed by the ending. I thought Willis had set herself up to tell a great story, but delivered a merely good one."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book would have been twice as good if it had been half as long. There is far too much repetition of the same points - as if Connie Willis had not done the five years of research she actually did and was forced to stretch a limited store of material.There - that's the bad news out of the way. Other reviewers have pointed out how unconvincing Willis' 21st Century Oxford is - and their points are valid - but this deficiency is counterbalanced by her description of life in the mediaeval village that Kivrin, the time-travelling student - finds herself in.The story rests on the two main characters and their response to the terrible circumstances they find themselves in, and here it comes up trumps, especially where it deals with Kivrin's courageous fight against an inexorable tide of disease and death. Recommended, then, but only if you have the patience not to throw the book at the wall at the nth repetition of the lavatory paper joke."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"If you've read \\"To Say Nothing of the Dog\\", you might expect this novel to be similar, just with the time set back further in English history. No, while this book is altogether as excellent as the other, they're different, very different.The time travelling \\"historians\\" set out from mid-twenty first century, and scatter back into the past, to study history, people, how they lived and went about daily lives. In this particular tale, the past and the future are connected by coincidental disease: there's a serious influenza outbreak in the mid-tweny first century (think back to the outbreak of 1918), and the effects of that result in what I will call severe \\"brain fog\\" (hey, we've all had that), which sends researcher Kivrin back to 1348 instead of the properly-assigned year, which means she arrives just as the Black Death took hold of that particular area of England.You grow to care for most of the characters in both centuries, and there's a lot of tragic death, and yet also heroic responses seen in both centuries. Venality is also something both centuries knew well.I like the detail with which Connie Willis writes: you can see the homes and farms of 1348, you can almost smell the livestock, the hillsides, the devotion to visualization Willis brings to her writing. Recommended."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"In Willis's \\"Firewatch\\" universe time travel is pretty much confined to academic use since nothing can be changed in history. Historians travel back in time and make observations.In this book, probably Willis's best. A historian is sent back to the early 14th century but ends up in the middle of the Great Plague in England. At the same time a new plague is overcoming her home in 21st century Oxford. Trapped in this alien world she becomes involved with a wonderfully drawn cast of 14th century characters in a doomed village. The framing device of time travel works very well and this produces a quite moving work. I read this more than a decade ago and still occasionally think of it.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I am not generally a time travel fan, but this book came highly recommended to me so I tried it. Though very grim in places, I found this book riveting and satisfying. I cared about the people. The plot hung together and was interesting. The dialogue is good, and the bits of humor (the bell ringers, for example)liven up a dramatic story. I will warn you that not everyone survives - but I still found the ending satisfactory. This is a book you think about, remember, and discuss with interest with anyone else who ever read it. It Connie's best book in my estimation."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is not just a good book; it's a great book. I'm sure that in times to come this will be hailed as a classic such as War and Peace and Moby Dick. Connie Willis's portrayal of what life was like in the Medieval Era is realistic and detailed. Her heroine, the time traveling Kivrin is one of the best portrayal of a brave, resourceful but ordinary woman in a calamitous circumstances. If you never read another novel, you must read this one."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"In the near future, Time Travel is a reality - a highly-regulated, university-sponsored reality. Historians travel through time to research various eras of time, and there is a bit of friendly rivalry between colleges in the Time Travel department. The latest jump involves student Kivrin travelling to the 1300's.As with any good science fiction book, things begin to go wrong. Kivrin's translator device appears to be malfunctioning, and she falls ill with a strange sickness. Back in modern times, Professor Dunworthy is confused and frightened because the readings show that Kivrin had been sent to the wrong time, but cannot tell exactly when she is. Meanwhile, more people fall sick and the college is placed under quarantine.The nice thing about Doomsday Book is that author Connie Willis has made everything from the characters to the time travel technology feel very natural. At no point is the concept of \\"slippage\\" described in detail, but you get a sense for it over time. The characters themselves are very strong, both in the present and the Medieval age. Colin and Agnes are especially memorable, which is odd considering neither is a main character.Don't let the book's title scare you off, either; humor is fairly prevalent throughout, from Finch trying to find enough supplies during the quarantine to the patter between Agnes and Rosemund to the overprotective Mrs. Gaddson. As with everything else, the humor is character-driven and feels completely natural.The narrative of the book does jump back and forth between present day and the past, which leaves the book riddled with many mini-cliffhangers. Just as you get into what Kivrin is doing in 1300, you're suddenly whisked away back to 2054 to get an update on the epidemic. It's not exactly jarring, but the transitions happen frequently."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Synopsis:It is the not so exciting future (other then... you know time travel) where historians are the new Indiana Joneses, the bell crazed British are sending historians back to the past, by themselves, to chronicle history. Shenanigans occur. One part historical fiction, one part sci fi, another part medical drama. A pretty surprising multifaceted book, that despite long sometimes frustrating inner monologues will keep you guessing (and you'll find you were probably right) and interested until the end.Thoughts:I liked this book. It wasn't what I expected (mostly because I'm bad at reading back covers/reviews). It really has a little about everything and keeps you interested. Connie Willis' view of the future is not super exciting (then again it's only 50 years from now) but the time travel aspect adds a twist. She in my opinion cops out though with the book's universe rule that you can't travel back in time and effect the past because \\"the net\\" that takes you back won't let you go if you can screw it up. Really takes a lot of balls to trust in that one.The characters aren't SUPER endearing but they are likeable enough. The parts in the past both anglicize the people of the time and forces the point that its not the fairy tale era that SCA members day dream about. Apperantly she did her research though (didn't travel back in time though... :/ Where's the commitment?) as best as she could and its pretty accurate to the 1300s.One sometimes frustrating and sometimes interesting aspect of the book was Connie Willis' ability to really get in the head of the unreliable narrators. Large stretches of the book are spent with the characters listing what they needed to do full of self doubt or full hardy promise. Made me stress and urge them a long. It wasn't Grapes of Wrath in length of description though so it was barable. The way she stretches on inner monologues also is mirrored in her plot reveals. Good twists but I guessed them 50-100 pages before as there is very obvious lead up.Rating:3 out of 5 penguins for gumption!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Fascinating, gripping, heart rending and satisfying.

The size of the novel isforbidding, but once into the story, the lights don't go outuntil the book is finished! The only part I did not like washow the author jumped back and forth between times.

Through the compassionate yet resolved Kivrin, the reader vicariously experiences the dark and fearful era of 1348. I love how the future of 2048 and the past of 1348 are used to explore the universal nature of beliefs, fears and inner strength.

There are suspence, mystery, history, archeology,computers, science, religion and medicine intricately weavedinto the plot, but it is all clearly done, with no boringspots.

Eventually (after about 200 pages) I found out that it is safe to just skip pages at a time and read two paragraphs, and not miss anything. The characters are imbeciles, the dialogue is not even filling enough for a soap opera, the technology is quite unconvincing (e.g. having a time machine and not having phones that work, having a state of medical emergency and not having enough toilet paper, etc), the plot is simply depressing for lack of any development. I cannot believe how some other people have liked this book, it is not unthinkable that they are relatives of the author or employees of the publisher.To sum it up: You cannot have read every other book, skip this one and read Reality Dysfunction or Hyperion instead."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Looking back on my life I can remember many times that I thought to myself \\"Self, why are you wasting your precious time here on earth doing what you're currently doing?\\" As I get older and time becomes more precious, I try to get myself into these situations as little as possible. All I can say about reading the Doomsday Book is \\"oops, I did it again\\". As far as books go, I try to protect myself by sticking to the recommendations of respected reviewers, (in this case the clerk at the local (bookstore), or winners of prestigious awards (Hugo). But in this case all that care and concern was circumvented by what was one of the worst books I have ever read; maybe not the worst in absolute terms, but certainly the worst relative to expectations.In the interest of not wasting any more of my aforementioned precious time let me be succinct. The characters were stupid, uninteresting, and predictable. The plot (I use the word \\"plot\\" with tongue firmly implanted in cheek) devices were shamelessly contrived, endlessly repetitive, and...Oh, did I say repetitive already? The supposed historically accurate perspective was laughable. I could be historically accurate too if I wrote a story that essentially takes place in one room and sometimes the woods.This was a terrible book in almost every way...except maybe weight. It was pretty heavy; I'll say that for it.(...) What a waste of time."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I can't blieve this - it's the first time i was led astray by Amazon reviews - usually well rated books are great. Let me state beforehand that I have not yet finished the book, but I will try (only because I hate to stop in the middle).The premise is great - time travel to the 1300's. And Willis' writing is very good - she's talented and has a good ear for speech.That's where the good things end. The girl travels all that way back and so far nothing interesting has happened, and I'm sure nothing will, since she's just sitting in a house with a bunch of girls and women waiting for time to pass. Oh yeah, some other people come to visit.But here is the worst part. Every other chapter is set in \\"present\\" time. Basically, absolutely nothing happens in those chapters other than people talking about things you wouldn't even bother paying attention to in real life. The only way it's even bearable to skim through those chapters is that Willis is a good writer.In the end you skim through boring \\"present\\" day chapters, waiting for something interesting to happen in the 1300's chapter...but, alas, in vain."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I don't get all the fuss about this book. If you've read \\"Timeline\\" by Michael Crichton, or \\"Time and Again\\" by Jack Finney, there's nothing particularly new here.I did sort of enjoy the academic back-biting and blame-positioning that happened when everything went pear-shaped. The actual story was a bit of a slog. The attempt to heighten tension by keeping everyone sick all the time gradually got a bit tiresome.Still, since I bought it for the Kindle it didn't cost all that much, so I really shouldn't complain that much."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I bought this book on Audible, thinking it would take while to listen to 26 hours and 30 minutes. It was one of those books you do not want to stop. The characters became real and I hated to stop.

It is science fiction, but the best part are the characters. You really care about these 14th century people. Ms. Willis has the imagination to develop a convincing portrait of people who look at life and live very differently than we do. Although Kirvin and Mr. Dunworthy are the main characters, you will be enchanted and also saddened about the historic characters.I've often thought that the book would make an excellent movie. I wonder if Ms. Willis has ever attempted to market it. I think the drama and the tension from trying to rescue Kirvin along with the storyline in the 14th century would be interesting on screen."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"After reading Doomsday Book, I loaned it to my mother (a devoted reader of mystery)... and never got it back. A thoroughly engrossing read, you'll be wanting to take it with you wherever you go until it's finished! You get caught up with the lives on both sides of time, and, indeed, at times it is harrowing. I don't think that reading should always be comfortable, do you? Especially if it means you're learning something about yourself and your views on others."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I'm a sucker for books that say 'Hugo' and 'Nebula' on the cover. This one had both as well as \\"A Tour de Force\\" written by some reviewer. So when I saw it for a dollar on the clearance rack at my university book store I thought, \\"How can I go wrong?\\"I did go wrong. I can see why this book would appeal to some folks, but it wasn't my kind of story. I'll start with the pros:-A good premise. I liked the idea of someone going back in time and struggling to survive in plague-ridden medieval Britain.-Intelligent, well written diaglogue and narrative. Willis creates believeable conversations between reasonably well fleshed out characters.-Believable settings. Again, Willis does a good job of convincing us that what we're reading is real. I'm no historian but her 14th century Britain seemed real enough to me. 22nd century Britain also seemed furturistic without loosing it's connection to the present or seeming cheesy.-Free of action/adventure-type violence. There are no sword fights, gun fights, explosions, death-defying escapes... etc.But here's why I didn't like it:-Free of action/adventure-type violence. There are no sword fights, gun fights, explosions, death-defying escapes... etc. Now, I don't expect a novel to read like a comic book- I would avoid any novel that did. But every time I thought this story was going to have some swashbuckling excitement, it proved otherwise.-Mostly, it's boring. Willis spends over 200 pages- nearly half the book- getting the situation set up. We're forced to wade through chapter after chapter of characters in the modern world wondering wether or not the trip back in time was successful and not being able to find out due to one reason or another while Kivrin (the protagonist sent back in time) spends chapter after chapter trying to figure out where she is and what year it is. Even when we find out the severity of Kivrin's situation we're still never treated to very much tension or conflict- Kivrin can't get the plague because she's been innoculated. So where's the drama? With the contemporary villagers. Granted, there's a bit of conflict as Kivrin tries to befriend them and help them avoid being killed off, but nothing that amounts to \\"A Tour de Force.\\" I won't give away the ending, but it ends up being rather anti-climactic.I admit that I enjoy a little good old fashioned L'Amour-esque action now and again to liven up a story. Maybe that's why I enjoyed Hugo and Nebula award winning titles like Ender's Game, Forever Peace and Dune more than I liked this book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Repugnant and obtuse, this is one of the worst novels I have ever read. The modern era (set circa 2050) is filled with stereotypical characters going about life without thought or intellect. The historical characters have a tad more depth, but are completely decimated by the plague. The central character Kivrin is heroic but futile. It's a depressing tragedy about the worst human qualities, where few characters are even remotely self-aware and even the few impressive individuals fail in almost every endeavor.From a science fiction stand point, it's complete tripe. The author wrote the book in the age of Gibson and Sterling yet is completely unaware that the information age is about to happen. Personal computers, the internet, cell phones, even answering machines are unheard of in the year 2048. This is inexcusable in speculative fiction published in the 1990s.Even the time travel aspect is completely unexplored, and not competently thought out. Time somehow monitors itself in Willis' eyes so paradoxes aren't created. How can time stop paradoxes when allowing time travel, as any time traveler could easily change history with a simple conversation or gaffe.The level of research on the disease vectors is excellent. I'm not capable of reviewing the historical accuracy, but it certainly seemed authentic.Everything else is entirely subpar.It's a sad commentary that such an obvious and completely flawed book won awards. It must have to do with politics, because it certainly isn't based on content.I'm going to avoid any further works by Willis like the proverbial plague."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I really tried to get into this book. I skimmed, slogged, finally skipped pages, it didn't matter. the tediousness of this book, page after page of unneeded words not pertaining to the story line, it's the difference between a monet and clumsy finger paintings, and the difference is boring. words are not art for this author, they are stumbling blocks. what really killed it for me were the common sense errors, such as life expectancy. yes, life expectancy may have been late 30s but people weren't dying in their 30's (naturally), it's an average affected by high infant mortality, high amounts of death while giving birth and of course disease. there were still plenty of old people living very long lives. it's just such a simple realization that if an author misses it because he/she is that dense, he/she probably doesn't have much in the creative department either. such is the case with this book. 2 story lines and yet not enough interest to go to the effort to finish the book. if only she spent as much time on developing the main characters as she does bashing Americans, perhaps I would have been interested enough to finish."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Ok, I know this book was about time travel and the crisis of epidemics, but I spent all 600 pages wondering when the author would throw a punch that would make the book worth reading. 15 rounds later I'm so disappointed, and my wife actually celebrated the end of me reading the book, so I would stop complaining about bad and slow and frustrating it was.I can't help but thinking that some how the author got obsessed with the history and lost the story, and the characters, and the drama.Every punch was overly, and redundantly telegraphed. \\"Oh no she is in 1348.\\" We finally read this on page 386, even though the authors not so subtle hints have been telling us this since the beginning. \\"Oh the disease came from the graveyard dig.\\" Again a hundred pages between us realizing it and her bumbling cast of characters. From self absorbed bell ringers (who add nothing to the plot) to a self absorbed historian (who is utterly utterly uninteresting) to his toilet paper obsessed assistant, the characters like the story are 15 rounds of nothing. Even the last 100 pages, the psuedo-climax, are boring and develop painfully slowly, with details like questions on how to feed a horse and other stunning page turners!I know this is a sarcastic and snotty review, but even the bad reviews give this book way to much credit. This is the first and last of Mrs. Willis' books I will read, and the worst developing story that I have read in my life."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Considering that this book won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards, and considering that I'm a fan of both historical fiction and science fiction, I was sure this was going to be a great book. It wasn't.As has been said before, it's a great idea: traveling in time to the middle of one of the most significant historical events in human history -- the occurrence of the Black Death in 14th century Europe. With that setting, one would assume they would be reading about sweeping events taking place in Europe during the time, but what you end up reading is a myopic, half-interesting story, filled with mundane details and repetitive writing, about a woman living in a small house with a 14th century family. Rather than getting any taste of the historical period, you sit there for much of the book listening to the characters repeat their thoughts and worries over and over (Shut up about the \\"drop\\" already!), and listening to the author cheaply and unfairly make fun of how primitive and uneducated the 14th century people were.Most of the characters were what I refer to as \\"TV characters,\\" people so stupid and one-dimensional that their laughable failures at realizing the simplest things become the critical plot devices that advance the story. As has been said by others, that turns out to be very frustrating. The 14th century characters are nothing but boring caricatures: the whiny toddler, the teenager trying to be \\"grown up,\\" the hypocritical Bible-thumper obsessed with appearances, the fat child-molesting nobility, etc. The characters in the modern-day portions fare no better: the colorfully \\"hip\\" youngster, the starchy, petty academic on a power trip, the kindly grandfather-type, the hypocritical Bible-thumper obsessed with appearances, etc. I'd be much more interested in reading a story propelled by events of the historical period and how they affect realistic characters, rather than a story constructed primarily on the contrived eccentricities of blatantly unrealistic caricatures. This was just a TV sitcom set in alternating locations of medieval England and near-future England.A note about how the characters are portrayed: One thing I noticed was how in the story, every character who was devoutly religious (whether in the modern parts or the 14th century parts) was portrayed as incredibly stupid, shrill, superstitious, hypocritical, and worse -- while every character who was ANTI-religious (as they appeared to be) was portrayed as intelligent, rational, warm and charming, etc. By the end of the book, this trend became nauseating.Also, the author's apparently fervent desire to blame God for everything, even to the point of accusing God of actively torturing the characters, was extremely annoying and unfair. I'm a student of Christian apologetics, and while the author's historical research on the period might be scholarly, her research into the religious issues and themes she sarcastically and bitterly criticizes is obviously poor or non-existent. I got the impression that Willis is a militant atheist, and this book was just a vehicle for her to preach her uninformed and irrational hatred of all things religious. Nonetheless, with all her hypocritical criticism of religion, we still find her protagonists wishing horrible, agonizing death upon the devout characters, who of course \\"deserve\\" it BECAUSE they are devout. This aspect of the story was very distracting, unnecessary, and unwelcome (for me anyway), and I found myself rolling my eyes and flipping pages, scanning them for something about the plot.I would recommend reading the book, if only to spur your own thoughts about time travel and historical events, but I wish this story idea could have been done better."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"SPOILER ALERT - THIS BOOK WAS TERRIBLEIf you're only going to read one book this year... Make sure this one is simply on hand in case you run out of toilet paper. If you think that's being crude, let me remind you a lack of toilet paper is one of her side plots she uses to move things along. And by move things along, I mean NOTHING IN THIS STORY GOES ANYWHERE EVER.This book won a Nebula and Hugo award. Oh swoon, right? OMG this must be awesome, right??? Well, no... And I just don't know if I have it in me to fully express how bad this book was.Let me start by setting the scene: the only vaguely science-fictiony thing is attempting to take place, where some guy mans a console and a history student, in \\"authentic clothes\\" sits among already damaged items so that when she's sent back in time to a bit before the black plague, she'll appear to be a high born woman attacked on the road, deserted by her help with a nasty bonk to her noggin from her contrived robbers. The console man will be attempting to send her through, then will get a \\"fix\\" on her to track her/pick her up later. In what can only be described as the \\"Crying Room\\" found in any church, (soundproof with glass wall) a bunch of hen pecking, annoying scientists all talk over each other and do a terrible Acting 101 soliloquy in which they listen to no one and repeat themselves like some contemporary art performance that would only have been improved if they re-inacted Carole Schneemann's famous performance.Okay, so what you want me to say is this: predictably, something goes wrong sending her back; despite the fact that \`no viruses can get through the net,' you as the reader are aware that the student went through and got flu-like symptoms pretty bad, as did the man at the console. The scientists that were squabbling about nothing interesting (and not actually talking to each other anyway) go get a beer next door to wait for the \\"fix,\\" when console-man shows up discombobulated to the pub, says \\"something went wrong... I got the fix...but...\\" runs off back to the console across the street and when they all get there, he never finishes his sentence but passes out ill. And thus this amazing tension of OMG WHAT ILLNESS WHAT WHAT OMG OMG. The console man got very sick... panic and quarantine, AND A CAPER!!! Eh, why make it interesting, though?I'd like to say that's what happened, but it didn't, not really. I mean, it is, if you cut 300 pages out of the book. (My electronic version was 884 pages) In the first 200 pages, all that happens is they send the girl back, the guy collapses without telling them what was off about the send. That's it. So far, nothing. What DID happen 46 times in those 200 pages is they got him to say \\"something's wrong...\\" before he'd pass out again. Actually, he continued to say this and not explain up through page 600 out of 884, when he finally spat out more of that sentence.And what of the girl that was sent back? Let's just say it takes you oh, about... a page.. a whole page... to figure out \\"hmmm, yes, something IS wrong, and deducing from the fact that her \`translator' in her ear isn't helping her speak the correct language, they must not have sent her to the right time!\\" Honestly. It took her half the 884 page book to realize oooOOOOoooh...they can't understand me because I'M IN THE WRONG TIME! Yes, she's sick and delirious...and I suppose we're supposed to be seeing this amazing historical novel, how they care for the sick and dying in the 1300s. Or that we're witnessing the Black Plague all around her. The girl is fitted with a recording device on her hands that activates when she presses her hands together like she's praying...So she records \\"I hear a rat gnawing under my bed.\\"Okay, so first of all... this book is touted as a historical masterpiece. But... UNDER YOUR BED? Under? What, where your cute little Tupperware tubs are filled with sweaters from last season? HOW UNDER YOUR BED IT'S A PILE OF STRAW. This one sentence is early on, so you, the reader suspect OMG RATS SHE WAS SENT DURING THE PLAGUE! But...ahem, historical novel? I mean, seriously, didn't poorer folks in the 1800's STILL use straw mattresses on the floor? Under her bed? COME ON. I did ONE GOOGLE SEARCH and found this: [...]THAT IS IN THE 1400s!!!! Poor people had mattresses on the floor. What, are you going to tell me that she magically had a future bed in 1330 something? How is this a historical novel? I think the writer did her research for this book on a cereal box. By the way, my favorite amazon review mentioned that while this is touted as being a historical fiction novel, she sources ONE LIBRARIAN in the back of the book. One. ONE. (Probably the person who sold the cereal box).Back to my point, while I get it that student girl is delirious, we're told over and over how she was to learn old English, French, german, latin, her cover story, etc... and ALL SHE SAYS to these people is \\"I NEED TO GET BACK TO THE DROP SITE TO SEE PROFESSOR SO'N'SO\\" over and over and over and over and.... Where is your training? I HOPE YOU GET THE PLAGUE. Omg I hope she dies of the plague.She doesn't, by the way. She effing doesn't. It's unjust.The author finds this amazing device to set a scene... we'll call it Crappy Writing. She'll take one character, and make them crawl into their own mind, spinning out of control, thinking \\"OMG what if something went wrong? What if the send didn't go well? What if there's a problem???\\" and then a second character, completely immune to outside signals people are putting off, just barks at them about how \\"you're always trying to mess up my experiments! You don't respect me as a professor! Any mistake here is your fault!\\" Now, these EXACT two sentiments... down to EXACTLY REPEATED SENTENCES will repeat for 8 pages. One paragraph, inner soliloquy. Next, berating jerk complaining without listening. Soliloquy. Barking. Soliloquy. Barking. If at any one point in 1000 times this occurred, the person being barked at said \\"HEY. SHUT UP.\\" And then maybe answered them, the conversation would be over and not have to be repeated 8 million times, but no such luck. Because that person that barked unanswered? They're going to keep repeating that sentence hundreds of pages in, just you wait.You ever read a word in a book, and it's such a unique word, that you totally notice when the author uses it again? Maybe \\"discombobulate\\" (like I used above!) or \\"juxtaposition\\"... something that stands out. I don't know if it's a British thing, but he never \\"dials\\" a phone, he punches it. He punched numbers 31 times in the book. OOoh, and my personal favorite, Rummage. In the beginning of the book, one of the scientists waiting in the crying room has a \\"shopping bag,\\" (which is mentioned no less than 20 times in the first 150 pages... 32 times in the book...shut up about the shopping bag!) But... this woman is constantly rummaging through this bag or some other bag, or shuffling papers. I never realized how describing something so irritating can be so irritating to read! STOP RUMMAGING. It's like the only way the author builds tension into a scene. She literally has someone talk at this character, then in response she rummages. So that person repeats themselves SO SHE RUMMAGES SOME MORE oh come on!But that's not all. This book, set in the future, spends much of it's time with busy signals. Yes, that's right, pull that memory out of the back of your mind, the most annoying sound in the world, brought back to life. The book was written in 1992, so, unfortunately the science fiction part wasn't her strong suit, apparently only masters like Gibson can get this one right... time travel, and no voice mail or cell phones. EGADS. And, every time he gets through somewhere, it's to someone that I AM NOT MAKING THIS UP wants to update him on the toilet paper situation, and mention that some foreign guests are really pissed about being stuck in a quarantine. The toilet paper and the grumpy guests. They are simply used as a device so that every time he calls this guy for info, these 2 problems will keep him from answering what he was supposed to answer, and then the call will end, with no one getting anywhere. \\"Yes sir, but...the guests sir... the guests are upset\\" OMG WHY DID I SPEND SO MUCH TIME ON THIS BOOK. If you think I'm exaggerating, the guests are brought up 45 times, the toilet paper 17 times. I had more fun using the search feature than reading this, by the way.I feel some of the fight drifting out of me. My sister recommended this book, and I so wanted to like it so we could chat about it... but I am just so angry these words were allowed to be printed on a page! It aggravates me! From the beginning of the book, we know something went wrong about sending her back, but the guy who wants to tell you what happened gets sick... he says something went wrong 129 times BEFORE HE SAYS WHAT WENT WRONG by page 600. By page 400, student girl finally figures out she must have been sent to the wrong time, and that's why her translator won't work. By the end of the book you realize none of it matters, and the \\"6th Sense\\" twist of this book is...there's no twist. They both just randomly got sick. Yeah, spoiler. Nothing in the past came to the future or vice versa. It's just dumb luck, lots of people dead, a pedophilia type love hinted at, and no reason to have ever bothered writing this book.The \\"touching love story\\" or whatever people are calling it? While people in future-present are dying off all around him, the professor is still totally focused on the student that got sent back. I think people think it's a love story that he's concerned about her welfare, despite everyone he know or loves being dead around him and that not seeming to sink in. There's no defined love story...it's an absent minded professor twice her age immune to the suffering around him focused on a too-stupid-to-have-survived-this-book student and her well being.I recommend reading Amazon's 1 star reviews, they're written far better than the book and they tell a much better story."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I have been inspired to pen my first book review; pity my inspiration is so negative. I have had a long time interest both in time travel as well as medieval history. That combined with many glowing reviews here made me look forward to buying and reading this work.It is easy to dispose of the time travel aspect of this book. To me, the interesting part of time travel speculation are the various problems that an interesting time travel story can produce. Does the traveler create non-historical change? Can he/she meet early relatives? In this book, the author disposes of all of that by insisting that a time travel trip cannot happen or occur if the traveler can thereby produce change in the history stream. That is just not very interesting.Much is made by some reviewers of the amount of &quot;research&quot; done by the author. I just don't see much of that. After all, the time traveler in this book is still in her sick bed by page 200!If a reader wants &quot;research&quot; on medieval history, I would refer him to a good non-fiction work by Tuchman entitled A Distant Mirror. THAT book demonstrates research!I do have to say, though, that the portion of the book dealing with events in the early 21st century does set a record for detailing the most number of phone calls completed, not completed, missed, dropped,or talked about of any book I have ever read.I cared about precious few of the characters--perhaps Agnes comes closest. By the end of the book, the major interest I had was whether or not that darned cow would be milked.From checking some of the many reviews of this book presented, I see that almost everyone either loved or hated this book. I was prepared to love it but ended up glad that I could get through it."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I read up to page 206 and then gave up because there is no plot and little description of surroundings. The main character travels in time only to lie in a bed, sick. Why bother to have a character traveling in time if she doesn't do anything once she gets there? Furthermore, both the main character and a secondary character are prevented from talking to other characters about important plot points because of their illnesses. The can't do anything and can't even talk because they are sick.What are we left with? Shallow discussion of shallow worries by secondary characters about what might be happening--never any description of what actually is happening unless the character is lying sick in bed. Description of movement by the characters--but they go places without any reason for it--remember, there is no plot! Much discussion over how to get the National Health Service number for a patient who can't talk when people controlling the files are away on vacation. General discussion that most people don't bother to remember, let alone write about: Yes, let's have some tea. Oh, are you tired, too bad! I see that you have arrived, where were you just before? What did the sick person who can't talk do before he got sick? I don't know, what do you think he did?"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I listened to the book on unabridged audio. I usually love long books, but 1/3 of the way through I had to stop. Ms. Willis uses language beautifully, but many of the sections are tedious and repetitive. The story creeps forward slower than her protagonists recovery from her sickbed. Ms. Willis may have researched the Middle Ages, but she didn't do much research on medicine-- it would be have been better to make up some drug than to have the physicians of 2054 using antibiotics we gave up on 30 years ago. If you want good historically based science fiction, read Stephenson's Baroque Cycle."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"that make the book stupid too? YES!!! As expressed by many other reviewers the plot of this book is paper thin and ruled by the behavior of obnoxious characters. Of course if characters behaved intelligently in this book it would be about 200 pages, not 600. I listened to this on Audio tape to try and prevent road rage, instead I found myself screaming at it as Bodrie (sp?) once again passes out without revealing the problem. Fake problems create no tension, only frustration. I do not think I have ever read (or listened to) a book with more hateful, annoying, ignorant, obnoxious and stupid characters, none of which were given the remotest sense of backstory. Even romance novels have better characterization.I also agree that the technology described in the future plotline was absurd. Did we not have cell phones, pages, answering machines, computers in 1992 when this book was written? And even if we didn't couldn't the author have spent some time thinking up a plausible technology base for 2054?The mark of a good plot is having intelligent characters react to situations in intelligent ways and still having problems (problems that are logical ones stemming from the situation itself, not the obnoxious behavior of subsidiary characters) that then can be worked out in intelligent ways throughout the novel. This book has none of that.Needless to say, do not waste your time."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I will never again use the Hugo or Nebula awards for reading recommendations.As has been said by many reviewers, pages of pages of silly miscommunications and characters continually passing out mere moments too early made it an utterly miserable experience.Yet, many, many liked it. I am fascinated by this."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book is very much why I don't usually purchase Sci-Fi by female writers. The entire book has that hugely detailed emotional content that just screams \\"female point of view\\", and is so deathly boring to me as a male reader. I don't care for shallow characters, but I really don't want to know their every thought, no matter how banal, and that's what a lot of this book gives you. Ms. Willis spends so much time detailing how the characters feel, that, by the end of the paragraph, you forget the situation and have to re-read the beginning to figure out how to put what you just read in context. Boring with a big \\"B\\".The men are tremendously weak too. The father-figure in the story is so wimpy as to be completely unable to confront the other scholar who thwarts his efforts to save the young student. No matter how nasty this person becomes, there is no action, long after a real man protecting a daughter or close female relative would have knocked him cold. This really strains believability. In fact, but for Ms. Willis' description of him as male, he is a thoroughly female character.I also found the portions of the book dealing with the people back home in England tremendously boring. Annoying, silly detail about bell-ringers, a few well-placed slights about American's (what book by an English author doesn't have these) and endless, ridiculous dialogue. One character favors the term \\"necrotic\\" as an expletive. Go figure. Must be funny somewhere.I ended up reading the book by skipping over the parts about the effort back in modern-day England and reading the parts about Kivrin in the 1300's. It was mildly entertaining, but again so full of emotion, unbelievable reserve (her survival depends on asking for the location of her previous appearance, and she never manages to make the effort to ask) and a veneer of period speech for authenticity's sake.(Slight Spoiler ahead...)Even when it is revealed just what amount of time-travel slippage took place, and the real year, it is really no surprise, and adds nothing to the plot except to tidy up the emotional loose ends so Kivrin can return to modern-day England without guilt.I don't see how this won the Hugo and the Nebula, because, honestly, it's just not that good."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Apparently the writer had taken the aspect of time travel so well that I find myself reading the same thing over, and over, and over...Reading every other paragraph would get you fluently through the story. Better yet, just tear every other page and you will end up with a perfectly good book.Normally, I love reading detail of situation when it help define the plot. But this book put a new definition to \\"the-art-of-writing-non-sense-and-put-it-all-together\\". I do not want to know every minor detail of surrounding world.. just get on with the plot already!!This book is highly FEMININE and more like reading romantic novel than anything that deserve the title involve \\"DOOMS DAY\\" (GUY READER BEWARE). The plot that could be sum up in two sentences took 150 pages to unfold *gracefully*... 150 PAGES!!!(now I understand what the other reviewer talk about when warn *sci-fi woman writer*)This book is anything but adventure. (It is more an adventure in your effort to try finish it).For those who love timetravel + have really high patience + love to read every (repeat EVERY) detail, you COULD try the book.For those who love time travel (without patience), try something else(recomm REPLAY by Ken Grimwood).For those who dont love time travel, best find other use for this book (ex. BBQ party)"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"The old adage \\"those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it\\" has never been more present than in Connie Willis's offering \\"Doomsday Book.\\" Laborously researched and brilliantly plotted, the novel's main character Kirvin travels back into the Middle Ages from her existence in the not-to-distance future to study the effects of the Black Plague and Western Europe's medieval people.What's truly exceptional about this is not only the effort Willis devoted to researching the past, but the thought she put into her futuristic setting. Set in London, not too much has changed socially, but as technology advances, history repeats. As Kirvin is exploring the past, the future is threatened by a newly-discovered plague that's - surprise! - rooted in the past. Time-travel is not treated lightly. Willis goes into detail about the problems it presents -- from minute calculations to effects that could result from any accidental alterations. This thoughtful presentation allows the reader to suspend disbelief more easily and ride along Kirvin's journey.Admittedly, the book is hard to get into. Lovers of history and medicine will have an easier time, but those who like novels staunchly set in reality may have a more difficult time. The result, however, is worth it. This is a complex, impressive, emotional, and heartening novel. Highly recommended to those who want to get lost in a good book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"As one who has an interest in the Middle Ages I was eager to see how Connie Willis handled the era, and more importantly, the people who lived in it. My eagerness was not misplaced. Her characterization of the people is consistent with what I have read about 14th century.The plot centers around a young scientist (Kivrin) who is part of a team at Oxford in the year 2050 that time travels to various periods in the past in order to learn more about them. The story bounces between the Britain of the near future and of the 1300's where Kivrin is supposedly gathering cultural information in the years before the Bubonic Plague struck Europe (1347) with its culture changing devastation. Unbeknownst to her colleagues in the 21st century (except for a suspicious mentor) she has actually dropped in right as the plague is making its way through England. But plot complications ensue in the Britain of the future, primarily in the form of virulent influenza that threatens to reassert itself on the heels of a recent worldwide pandemic that was apparently the plague of the early 21st century.So Kivrin is alone as we watch her deal with the dawning knowledge that she is WHERE she should be but not WHEN she should be. And that is the brilliant part of the book: how she and the contemporaries deal with a killer that is indiscriminate, horrific and invisible (except to Kivrin who has no antibiotics and little hope of explaining the concept of bacteria to people with a 14th century knowledge of the world.)What isn't brilliant (and why this book only got four stars) are the cast of characters inhabiting 21st century Oxford. They are either excitable, paranoid, crippled by arrogance, two-dimensional or some combination of the four traits. To me the sections in the middle ages are bright and alive with personalities that seem stunningly human as they deal with the issues of their time with the mindsets of the time. The sections of the book set in the future seem dry and flat in comparison and I found myself anxiously awaiting the book's return to the past. I didn't even care about the mounting fear and tension as Kivrin's benefactors race to rescue her. I wanted her to stay and be a part of that world even as it fell apart around her."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I've read close to a 1,000 books during my time here on Earth, but only a couple of dozen have stayed with me the way that Doomsday Book has.In a ranking of time travel books, this would probably have to be on or near the top. Not only does Willis generate an engaging story, but she creates real flesh-and-blood characters, not cardboard at all, and breathes life into them. And as the book is about the Black Plague, you can imagine how moving it is to watch these characters try to come to grips with the plague (and often fail).Worth reading at least once!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I am an ardent reader and until yesterday my favorite book was The Wolf and the Crown by AA Attanasio. Yesterday, however, I finished the Doomsday Book. Science fiction or not (which it was, just a little more educated than most in that genre) it was a book with incredible ideas and a vivid imagining. All aspects were realistic, and the characters were perfect. The symbolism and metaphors were exceptional and not glaringly obvious (while being easily seen by all but the least astute reader). Yes, those who sought a novel of pure escapism were bound to be disappointed, but they should have read the back of the book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I bought this book not knowing what to expect. Typically, hard SF is more interesting to me, but I found the character development and human sympathy throughout the book to justify giving it five stars. While there is the issue of time travel, the paradoxes are cleverly avoided by a Net that ensures no meaningful deviation in the future. The ending, however, could have been a bit more thought-provoking, yet overall, the book was excellent."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"As a fan of time travel novels, I read this book after enjoting Willis' \\"To Say Nothing of the Dog\\". While that book was very enjoyable, this book was in a class by itself. Time travel is expertly woven into a tale of despair, survival, and hope as two very far apart centuries come to grips with their own plagues. A must read."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"The story is dragging on the same event for too long, and there is really nothing happened. I also found the present day part of the story dull and uninteresting. I really have to stop myself from skipping those parts and go on reading about the Middle Ages part. That's why I only give it 4 stars.What I really like about this novel is the interactions between Kirvin and the people in Middle Age. The emotion is so real and believable. When it gets to the end with all the bad things happening, the horror, sadness, desperation are so powerful and vivid that it feels like I am right there in the book. I have this heavy, and depressed feeling when I finished the book, and I know it had imprinted a deep impression into my mind.If you are into action/adventure type, this really isn't the book for you. The plots move on at slooow slooow pace. You may not even be able to finish the first 100 pages."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book inadvertently turned me into a fan of plague fiction (see also Year of Wonders, by Geraldine Brooks, and The Leper's Companion, by Julia Blackburn). It's almost misleading, the way Willis sets up a \\"typical\\" SF time-travel situation, in that the story turns out to be a wonderful re-creation of a discrete time period. I mean, with a main character being sent back in time, the author might be asking to be forgiven anachronistic speech, attitudes, etc, right? (In my mind, the failing of many a \\"classic\\" of historical fiction, e.g., Pillars of the Earth.) On the contrary, Willis strives to give the reader an authentic sense of a specific period, addressing the perhaps scholarly issue of changes in Middle English, showing differences in the behavior of varying societal classes, and addressing the weather, landscape, etc.Even though she necessarily gets a pass on writing in a narrative voice appropriate to the time period, her almost stately, leisurely writing style (hence the complaints of the book being too long) results in a sort of classical storytelling that somehow fits the setting. Basically, the story tells itself -- in both time periods. It's been several years since I read this book, but I still have vivid memories of certain settings, characters, and interactions.An eye-opener for the historical fiction fan who could use a bit of a challenge, and a pleasant interlude for the sci-fi fan who's ready for a little less flash and bang."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Really not that much to add that hasn't been written in dozens of other reviews. There is just something about Connie Willis' writing that draws you into the story. As I told my wife numerous times &quot;You know, there is really not that much happening in this book, but I can't put it down&quot;. If you are still thinking about a book and the characters in it two weeks after you've finished the book then the author has done the job right. By the way, also loved To Say Nothing of the Dog."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This was the second book by Connie Willis I read (after the charming &quot;The Bellwether&quot;.) I'll be brief--this is one of the best stories I've ever read. It is intelligent, witty and highly informative, full of interesting historical bits about the subject (the first wave of bubonic plague in Europe), as all of Willis's books are. But it is also bittersweet and poignant, and I cried at the end. Clever parallels between the development of the plague during the history grad student heroine's time-traveling internship, and the super-flu epidemic in the modern era she's left behind. Timely in light of our current anthrax scare, and a fascinating study of how people behave in times of sickness and terror.But the single biggest attraction of this story--and I think of it not as a book but a good, a very good story--is Willis's incredible gift of pulling the reader right into her characters' lives. She's got it all--the big picture, the endearing details, the thrilling plot and the heartbreaking intimacy. I highly recommend this book if you love history, if you love a story with a plot and a heart, if you like an intelligent writer, if you like a story that will keep you thinking for days, weeks after you read it. Some of Willis's earlier works &amp; collaborations read like a Harlequin romance, but this is not one of them. This is a powerful book, about people that will feel as real to you as any you've ever met. By the end of this book you will truly care what happens to them, and you will be devastated by what seems to be a truly hopeless situation. Until you realize that Willis, as usual, isn't writing about the big stuff but the little stuff that *makes* us big--faith, love, charity, and that tiny thing called hope that ultimately makes heroes of us all."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"One can know the numbers and even various details of the Black Death, but Connie Willis makes her reader feel it in personal, human terms. The book is a world (or two worlds, since it is half in the 21st century and half in the 14th) of its own which catches the reader so that you cannot let go until the last page. Willis breathes wonderful new life into the old SF trope, the time machine. Typical of Willis' stories, characters are constantly ensnared in a mass of little problems that make it almost impossible for them to deal with the big problems-- a crummy phone system, an absent administrator, fogged up glasses, etc. (today's readers will notice the notice the lack of cell phones, now ubiquitous in Britain as elsewhere, but not extant when Willis wrote the book). Willis' 14th century episodes have the virtues of the fine historical novel: meticulous accuracy in terms of what is known, plus vividly imagined characters and situations."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"In 2048, history student Kirvin decides to do an on-site study of fourteenth century life. Now, by 2048, time travel is possible so on-site means an actual trip back to the fourteenth century. It's a dangerous time: the black plague is scheduled to occur twenty years after the year for which Kirvin is scheduled. But guess what? Something goes wrong and Kirvin finds herself smack in the middle of this terrible plague anyway. What's a girl to do?Connie Willis spent five years studying for her novel Doomsday Book and it shows. The description of the living conditions of the time will shock the reader. Willis also won both the Hugo and Nebula awards for this book, a rare feat.This novel is already a SF classic and a standard on many \\"must read\\" lists of SF books. I know it's one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"After finishing this book all I could say was &quot;WOW&quot;!!!! I was at a loss for words. I haven't read anything quite like it before or since.If you ever wanted to travel back in time to see what it was really and truly like back then, here's your chance. Willis has not only thoroughly researched that time period, she has created three-dimensional, live, fleshed-out people within it. She recreates not only the culture and speech, but also the smell, the feel, the temperature, the sound of that place and time. YOU ARE THERE!!This book is not perfect, but it's a flawed emerald rather than a perfect rhinestone. The modern-day goings-on (&quot;back at the ranch&quot; in 2048) are often dull and tedious. But they're worth skimming through in order to immerse yourself in history (without actually catching the plague).I've read a few of Willis's books - some were disappointing, some good, and one (&quot;The Dog&quot;) extremely funny. In my opinion, Doomsday Book is her best. It would make an awesome movie."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Time-travel fiction is its own subgenre of science fiction, and pretty much anyone who reads sci-fi has their own take on it. Willis adopts an unusual and refreshingly simple approach to time-travel in her lengthy award-winner. Instead of the usual questions about paradoxes or nefarious schemes to profit from time-travel, she sets it up as a smart system that protects itself from any paradox and abuse. Simply put, nothing that will cause a paradox or severely influence events can travel through &quot;the net&quot;, as the system simply doesn't allow it in either direction. And since one can only go back in time, and one can't bring stuff back from the past, there's not much utility to it other than for scholarly research. Some reviewers have complained that &quot;the net&quot; would never be put to such a routine purpose as observing daily life in the Dark Ages, but they forget that the system basically doesn't allow one to travel back to critical events or to meet major historical figures. Fortunately, Willis doesn't waste much time trying to cobble together a technical or philosophical basis for any of this, it's just the way it works, and that's all one needs to get along with the story. Of course, readers who prefer more science in their science-fiction are likely to be a bit disappointed.The story is set in Oxford around Christmastime in 2054, and it's a future that's awfully&oacute;indeed implausibly&oacute;similar to our present. Even though mobile phones were in existence at the time of the book's writing, they don't exist in Willis' 2054 (much less pagers, PDAs, or any other wireless communication), which is either strangely short-sighted, or a very weak contrivance. A great deal of the story is propelled and/or prolonged by the inability of characters to communicate in a timely manner, and had the protagonist had a simple cell phone at hand, many problems would have been averted. Indeed, much of the plot has a kind of &quot;comedy of errors&quot; aspect to it that the reader will either go along with or be driven crazy by. It more or less works in the context of Willis' whole approach, which is a kind of affectionate mimicry of an old-fashioned British formalism.The gist of the story is pretty simple, since time travel is basically so useless, it's become a sort of historical archeological tool. The acting head of history at Oxford has decided to use the absence of the dean to launch a female graduate student back to pre-plague 14th-century England. Her advisor is all against this, but she proceeds, and lo and behold, something goes awry and she is stuck there. Not only is she stuck in the past, she's stuck in the wrong past! A technician error has dropped her into the middle of the Black Death! But it's even worse than that, 'cause the technician falls ill with a mysterious virus before he can tell anyone what has happened! The book is a compendium of missed connections, misinformation, and general confusion, which can get a bit tiresome.The book then unfolds over several hundred pages to tell parallel stories. One is about the grad student stuck in the midst of the plague, and how she handles life in the 14th-century amongst a small village of &quot;contemps&quot;. Meanwhile, in Oxford, the mysterious virus is striking down people left and right, impeding the advisor's attempt to figure out what went wrong and how to get the student back. The 14th-century story is clearly more compelling, as Willis uses it to dispense five years of her research into life during Medieval times. The social life, customs, costumes, and details are remarkable, as we see the plague devastate a small community. It's not a pretty sight, and gets rather grim at times. The story at the other end of time is quite different in tone, attempting to even the tone with a more comic approach. I use the word &quot;comic&quot; very loosely here, since much of Willis' attempt to lighten the proceedings are lame. For example, the nagging Mrs. Gadson, or the nasty Mr. Gilchrist, or the sly stud William.The book is strong is showing the effects of an epidemic, both historical, and in a semi-contemporary setting. Willis is clearly trying to say a little something about human nature, and how we act in such crises and breakdowns of social order, but it's nothing particularly striking (This topic has been perhaps most ably handled by Nobel-winner Jos&Egrave; Saramago in his brilliant work Blindness). Similarly, there is a none-to-subtle critique of organized religion at work, again, both in the past and the present. The book isn't helped by occasionally placid pacing, and a whimper of an ending which leaves at least two major plot points unresolved and fails to provide the satisfying denouement such a lengthy work deserves. And yet despite these various weaknesses, the book is a mostly enjoyable page-turner as long as one isn't searching for epic quests or adventuresome escapades."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I cannot add much to all the other glowing reviews, except to say that I found this book to be completely devastating, which is a rare thing, I think, in such a tired old genre. In fact, I normally would have given it a miss, just from knowing it involved time-travel, but I remembered reading a really good story by Connie Willis called &quot;Jack&quot;, a subtle and extra-creepy vampire tale that's unlike any of the usual vampire cliches, and so I gave &quot;Doomsday Book&quot; a chance. And am very glad I did. Ms. Willis is a strong writer, with a great sense of character and place. Not many authors could venture into such well-travelled country and discovered a new vein of gold, but Ms. Willis can and does, consistently. So, even though I am mostly a fan of a whole other kind of SF, I am glad to recommend this touching, humane and very haunting book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I read this book a few years ago and have loved the story. This is a very absorbing book, fascinating and just a wonderful read."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Doomsday Book is my first Connie Willis book, but certainly not my last. I found it intelligent, meticulously researched and fun.It is rare to find good, well-written science fiction, despite this I keep trying. On this occasion I was very pleasantly surprised, although some might debate whether Connie Willis should be classified as strictly a &quot; science fiction&quot; writer. Certainly there are some science fiction elements, a semi-futuristic or alternate setting and time-travel, on the other hand this work is as much, or even more, a historical novel.Dooms Day Book is more serious than &quot;The Bellweather&quot; or &quot;To Say nothing of the Dog&quot; (both very good by the way) , nevertheless, Ms Willis, always a keen observer of human (and animal) behavior, finds room for her sharp sense of humour, which by now is as much a trademark as her wonderful writing."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Amazing cannot properly describe the book. Nor does 'the best bok ever' - It's simply too hard to grasp. But you will know what I mean after you read it. The strength of the book lies in its simply real characters and interactions. It is more real then any movie or book I've ever seen or read. The way she grasps the difficulty of understanding a spoken language you aren't fimiliar with, for example, even after you've learned the language completely, is something I was so excited about, because Its simply the way I feel, as an Israely whose written english is very well, but when I attempt to disregard the Hebrew subtitles in a TV show or movie, it required my full attention and I still don't get it all. Or the way each person is characterized. The mother's exceptional worry for her child. How lack of interest in a conversation is grasped. Those are all taken so well from reality, that the book truely grasped me, hugged me, and left me to cry when it ended. Simply and amazing masterpiece. You won't regret buying it, trust me."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I love time travel books and this is a good one. It's beautifully written with characters that really come alive. It starts slow, however, and drags a bit in the middle, but sooner or later you will get totally hooked. My only complaint would be with the ending. Not to give anything away, but the book ends with a thud instead of a bang. I was expecting a time travel twist at the end, a subtle Rod Serling epilogue, but it never came. Despite those warnings, I would say don't miss it, it's a goodie."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I can't believe the negative reactions some readers have. This book is worth every penny I have spent on it. It is one of the best fantasy books I've seen so far. I recommended it to all my friends and they loved it as much as I did. Even my mother enjoyed it and she usually hates SF. The voters who gave this book a Nebula and Hugo award obviously knew what they were doing. Connie Willis has written a realistic story with a \\"fantastic\\" touch."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I was drawn to this book by the interesting blend of science fiction and the medieval plague. What I found was a dragging story and a very disappointing end. Obviously the book is based on a lot of historical research, but it lacks at least as much in vision, ideas, and motivation. Too many things are left unexplained which is only enhanced by the dogmatic statements of the alleged experts (understandably the time travel part cannot be explained but just repeating that a virus would not be able to get through the net is not satisfying enough). While I was listening to the audio book in the car, I repeatedly thought I had skipped back to a previous chapter because some sections are so repetitive - word by word. In the end the story just ends - for lack of a better word, it doesn't resolve anything, conclude, or close. The two story lines in the future and the past do not connect and remain completely independent (apart from the protagonist). Very, very disappointing.The reading by Jenny Sterling is further slowing down the pace of the book. Sterling is a good actor with many voices but oh-my-god! this is just too slow. Additionally she is overdoing a few of the characters (especially the young ones) which may have been intended as being cute but is just making them look/sound embarrassingly stupid.Connie Willis is probably a good writer but this book has not won me over yet."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I picked up this book after reading Willis's amazing 5 star \\"Blackout\\" and \\"All Clear\\" - I couldn't get enough of the characters, and about her whole \\"time traveling historian\\" premises, so I went back to see what else she had written. To be fair, I'm judging this earlier book against the phenomenal ones she wrote later, once she had many more years to flesh out the premise and tech stuff. But the biggest impediments for me when reading Doomsday Book is the anachronistic communications technology and apparent lack of understanding of the scientific community and how it works. We're supposed to believe that in the not so distant future (mid 21st century), time travel exists, yet no one has mobile phones (a technology that already existed in 1992). Much of the plot centers around the inability of the characters to reach each other to convey crucial information - looking for a phone, waiting to use a public phone, getting frustrated when getting a busy signal, or having an operator tell them \\"the line is engaged\\". Their technology allows the scientists to get a \\"fix\\" on a temporal location in another century, but they don't have anything resembling GPS or tracking technology that can locate anyone's physical location right here in real time. The thriller elements add to the story, but take a lot of suspension of disbelief, as we're expected to believe a single university professor, with no human subjects review, ethics policy, or risk assessment board can simply zap a university student into the 14th century. And, even though it's a hallmark of time travel literature not to get into \\"the tech stuff\\", I couldn't figure out why they could only travel to the same date in a different century. It's time travel - why does it have to be in 365 day increments? Despite all this, I kept reading because I wanted to find out what happened to the characters, but it was hard to get past all the 1950's technology in what should have been a 2050's setting.If you've read Blackout and All Clear, some of the characters of those books make early appearances here, so it is interesting to look at how the characters have evolved and developed. But if this is the first of Willis's books that you've read and you don't like it, don't let it turn you off from this series. Blackout and All Clear are a lot better and worth the read."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Not sure why this book was so highly rated. It was OK, but I won't be telling my friends to read it."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This story is hard to categorize: it's not typical science fiction, but it's not really historical fiction either. In reality, it's more of a human drama, and from that perspective it excells.The character development was superb. The storyline was engaging, if sometimes predictable. My only complaint is that it was, in areas, agonizingly repetitive and slow due to unnecessary details. If you apply patience it is still an enjoyable, worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I love Blackout/All Clear. Doomsday was not as good as that series, but gets wonderful towards the end. I have read a few of the other reviews that it could have been a bit shorter, and I agree. Willis is definitely a detail-oriented author. It might not have been the same story however, had she left out all the small things. I love her writing style and am ready to get started on another of her books."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"As others have already written, this book can often feel \\"slow\\" -- sometimes frustratingly so. Various hurdles are placed in the paths of our protagonists, and by the third or fourth time they've encountered such troubles they begin to wear on the reader.Once the book hits its stride, however, there's no stopping it, and the latter half is a truly enjoyable (not to mention often emotional) run. Time travel is used as a device to enhance characterization and progress the story, not particularly as an in-depth look at the potential science behind it, so don't expect a \\"techy\\" novel. This is character-driven storytelling, and many of the characters are endearing, and easy to connect with. If by the end you are not feeling for Kivrin and cheering Mr. Dunworthy on, then you may, in fact, be without a soul. The trick is getting to \\"the good stuff\\" and slogging it through some of the less enjoyable chapters earlier on."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"A \\"Middle Ages\\" fiction story with a twist of Sci-Fi time travel story line. What made this story really good is the description of the experiences and thoughts of a person from our \\"time frame\\" living in the middle ages during the plague. This was well researched and made you really relate to the main character living through this \\"hell\\". The sub-plot of the potential pandemic caused by flu epidemic in the \\"present day\\" which makes some interesting plot twists between the past and the present adds to the complexity of this story. Well written and good prose.If you love Sci-Fi, this is in the top 100 listing. However, I recommend this to readers who want to experience a \\"believable\\" tale of the English Middle Ages."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Three main features of this book have been mentioned in a large number of the reviews on Amazon: (1) The story is interesting, and at times moving, especially the parts set in the time of the Black Death. (2) The world of 2054 is very poorly drawn, missing even such things as cell phones, and really looking like the 1970s + time travel. (3) The editing is awful, with tremendous amounts of duplication and padding.Having just finished the book, I can confidently assert that all three comments/criticisms are spot on. This is a pretty good book, which would have been a very good book with a more imaginative future England, and a great book if it had both had the more imaginative future, and been 250 pages shorter."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Just to keep it real, I had a hard time reading this when I started it back in June, but finishing it around Christmas time made it much easier to read, b/c that's the season/timeframe this novel takes place in. The book is divided into three major parts (booklets?), the first being the most tiresome, and the third being the hardest to put down. My impression of the main character Kivrin is a strong and brilliant heroine. A fun time traveling adventure, with frustrating battles with bureaucracy, and other challenges. A good read."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I found this book by accident - and am so glad I did!! I love the time travel plot, the middle ages, the future, the quirky characters, the sharp witty writing. Couldn't put it down and as soon as I was finished I rushed back online to order the rest of Connie Willis' books!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Most people who aren't big fans of science fiction (myself included) avoid it because the authors tend to get so wrapped up in the &quot;coolness&quot; of the fantasy or futuristic elements that character development is completely neglected. Not so in this book. Willis treats her science fiction elements subtly, using them to create the circumstances for the story, but not showcasing them in a distracting way. She focuses instead on the incredibly compelling plot, which grabs you within the first few pages, and her complex, sympathetic characters.As impressive as Willis's nonchalant use of science-fiction elements is her skillful blending of the genres of historical fiction and science fiction (which, in a way, can be though of as opposites). She sets up two parallel stories, one set in the 1300s and one set about 75 years from now (linked by one time-traveler), and leads the two sets of characters through situations that are remarkably similar, even 700 years apart.In both storylines the characters find themselves in the middle of a devastating plague, and readers will certainly be extremely tense for most of the second half of the book (especially since anyone who has any knowledge of history knows how the Black Plague of the 1300s typically played out). In fact, I would recommend reading this book only when you have several uninterrupted hours, because tearing yourself away is nearly impossible. (I would also recommend that anyone who is highly anxious about anthrax or a smallpox epidemic NOT read this book right now.)This is a great book that's equal parts adventure, mystery, tragedy, and science fiction. One of the best I've read this year."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Doomsday Book's strengths include the well-researched and plausible setting of 14th century rural England, a good portrayal of epidemics and how to deal with them, a variety of themes and imagery (try figuring out each character's analogue in the other time period), and of course Willis' fine writing and dialogue. Rarely resorting to exposition, her characters and lively and vivid, and you care for them.The book's problems mostly stem from its plot, which disappoints: Some characters behave willfully stupidly and for no apparent reason than to keep the plot moving. One character is off-stage from the very beginning to get the plot started and his absence is never satisfactorily explained. Finally, there's no unification of the plots in the seperate time periods; I kept waiting for the grand explanation of what was going on, and was sorely disappointed. The book also needed another chapter or two of denouement; it ends rather abrupty.So while the middle of the book is quite a page-turner, and I wouldn't tell anyone NOT to read it, I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend this novel to someone, either."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"The Doomsday Book was suggested to me for the historical merits of its story line, and I was not in the least disappointed. Having spent the past 4 years researching and writing a travel guide to medieval London, I found the history to be accurate, and the characters both authentic and compelling. I have never been a sci-fi fan--in fact have made it a point to not include it on my reading list. Connie Willis just might make me change my mind!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"&quot;Doomsday Book&quot; is a great read because it blends a high-quality sci-fi with developed characters.

However, this book's plot is paper thin, its characters are cardboard, and its extremely UN-exciting. The book drags on forever with no direction.

They laughed at me when I said I could not finish reading Doomsday Book during school for fear of weeping too loudly! Well, maybe a few of my hardcore student readers understood, but the masses cackled maniacally. Several comments: this is fantastic literature! I became a tad aggravated during the 21st century sections, but really came to admire Mary and Mr. Dunworthy. The medieval portions of the book are something else. I was utterly and completely moved by Father Roche and Kivrin; these 2 people are not cardboard characters in the least! It is too bad that some of the complainers about this book never made it to the conclusion; it moved me as much as any literature I have read within the past 5 years, and believe me, I read a ton.

Oh yeah: Wills doesn't even have the decency to punish the moron Gilchrist or whatever his name was...she lets him die peacefully offstage, never getting his comeuppance! An astonishingly miserable book. Run, do not walk, away from it."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book is neither literature (it isn't even grammatical) nor a page-turner (nothing happens in it). It certainly isn't science-fiction (it isn't premised on the human consequences of a new technology). You might call it &quot;historical fiction&quot;, except that it keeps to a tiny claustrophobic corner of the epoch it is supposed to explore, possibly because it fears to be found wrong. In short, no matter how you slice it--and there is a lot of very, very repetitive verbiage to slice--, it is worth little. I can only think those praising it have not read many books, at least not many good books.(If the idea of someone venturing from modern times into the middle ages and eventually finding himself, against his initial prejudice, sympathetic with its inhabitants appeals to you, then read Mark Twain's &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot;. Novels treating the era more realistically include Umberto Eco's &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; and Hermann Hesse's &quot;Narcissus and Goldmund&quot;. For fluff, but at least entertaining and diverting fluff, there is Michael Crighton's &quot;Timeline&quot;.)"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is quite different from most science fiction. Unfortunately, it did not work for me. The author emphasizes dialogue and developing characters at the expense of plot or action. Nothing really happens. We go back and forth between a health crisis in the 21st century and one in the 14th century, where people keep dying and the characters cannot do much to affect it, so we are forced to endure their grim fate along with them. For those who prefer characterization to action, this book may be enjoyable, but to someone like me (who admittedly tilts to escapist space opera when reading science fiction) it was simply a slow-moving story about dealing with death."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Doomsday book is a fine example of Connie Willis' skill as an author. She successfully tells the story of two epidemics in two very different centuries. She tells her stories using very believable characters who each have their own foibles and fears. She also peoples her novels with a great supporting cast of eccentrics, Doomsday being no exception. I truly enjoyed this book, it was well researched with believable characters and story. Father Roche is a character that will live in my memory as long as I live. I would recommend this book as well as Firewatch and Bellwether by Willis"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Words fail in attempting to describe the depth of this novel. I can only guess negative reveiws were by scifi fans looking for pure tech. This book goes so far beyond any one genre. Kivrin, Dunworthy, Roche, all the characters became like good friends.

Like LeGuin's &quot;The Dispossessed,&quot;this book transcends SF and would be suitable foruse in a classroom studying history orsociology. They finally changed the crappycoverart of the first paperpack editions to lookless like a romance novel (which it's definitelyNOT), but you still can't judge a book by itscover.

This book has the distinction of using time travel as a mere device to enable the main character to develop through the vicarious experience of tremendous suffering at the time of the black death. And develop she does, though not in ways that are desireable. A truly moving book that describes the human empathic response in believable human terms. 11/10 if youask me."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read.

Willis'sacknowledgement that modern historical re-creation carriessome great misconceptions generates food for thought,incorporation of Arthurian characterization (Gwayneand Gringolet) provides interpretive challenge, andthe consideration of the chasm between modern and medievalperceptions of childhood all challenge the reader tofurther thought.

I noticed in the book, Book Lust, the author said it was one of the best time travel books she had ever read. So, I remembered I had it in the back of a closet, bought long ago and never read, pulled it out ,and I just finished reading it in two days. What a great book. I won't go into the plot, everyone else that has done that has explained it quite well. I just want to tell you to READ THIS BOOK!!! I could not put it down, but now that it is done, I am off to read another of Ms. Willis's books."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Whew. I just finished reading the Doomsday Book, and it left me breathless. Perhaps the best thing about the book is not about time travel, but character development in the Middle Ages, and an aura of mystery right out of Doyle and Poe. You get to know the characters of a 14th-century English village intimately well, and you feel as if they are part of your family. This is what makes the impact of the Black Death so harrowing -- you feel as if you are losing a part of yourself every time a villager succumbs to the symptoms of the great plague. Soon enough, the village you've come to know so well becomes a ghost of itself, until what is left of it is an unmilked cow mooing for attention among the freshly dug graves and abandoned huts.Granted, this book is not perfect. It suffers from some rather obvious anachronisms and a focus on certain annoying characters (mostly those in the 21st century). Although Willis wrote this book in 1992 during the current Information Revolution, her Oxford of 2054 is still a community overly dependent on paper forms (yes, real paper) and wired phones that frequently break down. This is not the Internet- and wireless-dependent world that we are just beginning to see developing right now in 2001. Oxford in 2054 is still dominated by bureaucratic red tape that gets in the way of the intentions of our protagonists -- something the author could have done without because this is simply unnecessary.Plus, there are some 21st century characters that, in my opinion, do little to enhance the plotline other than to drive Mr. Dunworthy batty and throw unnecessary obstacles into the plotline. There's also a character in the 14th century who is similarly annoying, but I think she is more central to the plotline and thus a more useful part of the story.Yet, for all these shortcomings, this book does develop into something worthy of a mystery novel that masquerades as time travel. The parallel protagonists of this book, Kivrin Engle and James Dunworthy, are trying to understand what is happening to a time-travel journey that has gone wrong. When they run into various dead ends in their quest to understand the real truth, this adds spice and mystery to the story. You eventually start to figure out what's happening before the main characters do, and it is as if you're trying to will Kivrin and James toward the truth, and getting frustrated in the process. That's part of the beauty of this novel. I can understand that some reviewers find this book's plotline rather frustratingly dense and slow, but I guess I just liked the suspense of knowing whether or not we're in the Black Death of medieval legend."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book was so moving I read the last half in one night staying up late to finish it! I cried near the end, and it has been years since a book made me cry. The author brought me into the lives of the people in the 1300's, I felt as Kivrin did. It was surprisingly spiritual, especially through the religion and belief of the parish priest. The two stories, present and past, were related, but unrelated. It was so clever and all came together and made sense in the end. The story addressed loss and love of fellow mankind in a very effective way. I really cared about the danger Kivrin was in, I felt the author portrayed the dangers very realistically making us readers feel the fear and helplessness Kivrin must have felt, as well as Mr. Dunworthy."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"When I finished this book today I put my head down and cried myself to sleep. I felt that Willis was not just writing a story, but standing in for all those lost souls of the Black Death. &quot;Remember us,&quot; I hear them cry. How many died alone, unshriven? How many selfless priests and nuns, like Father Roche, tended them and caught the disease? We stand so smugly in the 20th century and think of them as ignorant peasants, wonder how they could think that the world was ending, that Satan was in control. After all, it's JUST A DISEASE. That's what Kivrin keeps saying. Just a disease. I've studied the plague in several history texts but nothing brought it home to me as this story did. I felt the despair, the terror. This isn't just a story. It's an experience. Don't read it if you like happy, undemanding books or technological gobbledegook. Do read it if you want to understand what it was like to live through hell on earth in the company of a saint."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I read two recent customer reviews in amazement. How could any reader of fantasy and/or science fiction not love this book???The premise of this novel is something new and Ms. Willis makes it absolutely believable. The characters, especially Mr. Dunworthy and Kirvin, are so real that reading the book put a crystal-clear &quot;movie&quot; in my mind. The fact that the author took the time to research a very murky period of history to write the book with detail any history buff will savour is even more impressive. I strongly recommend this book to anyone.(Another great book by Connie Willis-and a winner of the Newbery Medal- is &quot;Lincoln's Dreams.&quot; As a Southerner and a lover of science fiction/fantasy, I found it a must-read.)"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"The mental movie running in my mind while reading this was produced by the BBC in the 70's; the characters uninteresting and cliched, the colors washed out and the picture grainy. Am I becoming bitter and cynical about awards? Are they now given to the works that are the least imaginative and most user-friendly? If I find any answers I will probably also discover how Braveheart won an Oscar and the blandest top 40'ish musical groups win Grammies. Hugo and Nebula award winners are are not necessarily the vanguard of the genre, but they are usually sure bets for good reading. Read something that did not win an award for that year"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"The book is actually neither science fiction nor fantasy. It's an historical novel. Although it's about a trip to the 14th century, I could imagine a similar story about a mission to any isolated place, even in our own time. That said, the idea of sending historians to the past makes a very interesting premise with all kinds of possible stories. The fact that the time travel process magically eliminates any acts which could alter history is obviously absurd, but it at least allows the author to avoid such issues.However, the achievement falls far short of the possibility. There's essentially no plot- a young researcher (Kivrin) in 2050 is accidentally sent to the year of the Black Death by a technician ill with the flu. The reader knows this before he even opens the book, thanks to the summary on the flyleaf. However, it takes almost 300 pages before anyone involved in the story knows it. I found myself skimming large portions hoping I would get to something interesting. This could have a very good book if the page count were cut in half.In the interim, the author plagues us (pun intended) with a set of characters (Gilcrist, Mrs. Gaddson, the American bell ringers, Finch,...) who are annoying caricatures and who are ultimately irrelevant to the story. All of these, plus even the main characters, plod around for 400 pages or so doing trivial, irrational and contradictory things. Kivrin and Colin (the pre-teen forced to spend Christmas with Mr. Dunworthy) are the only modern characters who seem human.The science of the future world is absurd. It has video phones but no cell phones (even when Ms. Willis wrote this book there were cell phones) and almost no other useful technologies. Even ones that exist are ignored. For example, more than half Kivrin's story is taken up with her vain attempts to re-find the drop location, but it turns out that she could have simply taken a \\"locator\\" device with her.The last 150 or so pages contain whatever plot exists and are somewhat more interesting. However, I found the conclusion quite unsatisfactory. The author kills off almost everyone and the story just tails off.Even with all the above, my feelings are a bit ambiguous. Ms. Willis' command of the language is good, which is a rare quality. Any short excerpt from the book reads well- it's the cumulative effect of boring characters and inaction that bother me. I enjoyed some of Kivrin's story and most of the characters in 1348, although I'm skeptical of the historical accuracy of many of the descriptions. The 14th century sounds too much like farm life as described by my grandparents in the rural south."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Fabulous idea. Fabulous plot. Too much detail in some areas. Not enough detail in others. And it got far too repetitive in others. I mean, several conversational plots and issues were repeated two or three times .... extremely annoying. And did I mention it was s - l - o - w ?? I had to try many times not to skip over pages, it was that slow. Seriously, did the endless mentioning of running out of toilet paper, or not being able to get in contact with someone, do anything for the storyline? No.I was also very frustrated by the story's abrupt end. And I was left with too many questions.Why didn't Kivrin's corder work when she first landed in the 14th century? Like other reviewers, I kept waiting for Roche to turn into something other than a 14th century priest, specifically as Willis kept mentioning that he prayed in the same way as Kivrin spoke ... suggesting he was from the future. I kept waiting for him to turn into Basingame. Where did Basingame get to anyway?I enjoyed some aspects of the book though I certainly won't be finding anymore Willis to read in the future."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book is the winner of the 1992 Nebula Award for best science fiction novel of the year and cowinner of the 1993 Hugo Award. The History Department of a University (in or near Oxford) in the mid-21st century (I believe the year is 2048) sends its historians back in time to study peoples and events. A young historian is supposed to be sent back to 1320 England to study the customs of the Middle Ages. However, she is accidentally sent to 1348 just in time for the Black Death to arrive in England. The book depicts the effects of the plague magnificently and shows people at both their worse and their best. I really enjoyed reading it. As you can tell from a number of the earlier reviewers, there are readers who didn't care for the book too much. Some commented on the rather dark ending. Of course, that was the point. Whole towns were wiped out by the plague. There was no escape. Others suggested that there was very little science, even though time travel is crucial to the story. However, if one reads any time-travel novel or short story in which the characters travel to the past, one will typically see the same level of science as is presented in &quot;Doomsday Book.&quot; In addition, don't forget that epidemiology is also a science. There are even critics who suggest that the book has little relevance for modern readers. I find that hard to believe when the world is now experiencing a new epidemic, albeit not as fast moving as the Black Plague. Let us all hope that we don't have the experiences of our ancestors."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"It's hard to picture a future world where there is time travel, but no internet. I know the book was written in 1992, and I'm willing to give the author some flexibility in not understanding technology on any university campus. It reminds me of a bygone age where people could only resolve issues by being in the presence of someone else. One of the main characters tries for 400 pages to get another technician to run the equipment. I was an undergraduate at a university in 1993 and this would not have been an issue for us.However, my biggest complaint is how slow the novel is. The first 100 pages could easily be cut down to 20. The first 400 pages could be reduced to 100. The last 100 pages are interesting, but it's not worth slogging through the first 450 pages. If you are wondering if you should stop reading this book at 100 or 200 pages in, put it down and pick up something else.Since I'm not a writer, I give Connie a lot of kudos for creating this book, as I could not."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"In Doomsday Book, by Connie Willis, a young woman from 21st century Oxford travels back to medieval times to study the culture of English life in the 1300s. What she, and no one at Oxford expected, however, was that a very modern-day epidemic might endanger the entire trip and even the life of the historian.The story centers on Kivrin, a young historian who has eagerly awaited her chance to travel through time. Apparently in the 21st century, time travel is well understood - although it seems to have come under the control of academia rather than science or the military. The acting head of the Mediaeval department at Oxford has authorized a rushed trip. Kivrin, eager to go, is willing, but Mr. Dunworthy, her mentor from Twentieth Century (another department) isn't eager to see her go. Dunworthy is not pleased at the way Gilchrist has rushed the trip, ignoring safeguards in an effort to launch the project before the Christmas break.As expected, nothing goes according to plan. Badri, one of the techs on the project, suddenly falls ill with a mysterious virus and can barely warn them that something has gone wrong. Soon there is an epidemic in England, and Dunworthy finds himself fighting a battle on two fronts. As he tries to help the school track down the source of this virus and contain it, he also looks for a way to retrieve Kivrin from a horribly mistaken trip to the past.Doomsday Book is very easy to read, and enjoyable. I had to adjust myself to the English setting and the 21st century temporal location. Willis does very little explaining, forcing the reader to read carefully or reread pages to catch the significance of certain things names and places.Willis does an excellent job of creating characters that we care about. Considering the large ensemble, she does a good job of keeping track, but some characters are better fleshed out than others. Some, like Dunworthy and Kivrin are excellent. Others, such as Mrs. Gaddson, begin as caricatures and never evolve beyond that point.Kivrin is an excellent guide to the 1300s. She allows the reader to understand everything she sees from a modernistic point of view, noting those variations of our historical understanding of the period. I think she is one of the best understood characters, and Willis seems to put her heart into Kivrin.I highly recommend Doomsday Book for anyone interested in the genre. After winning the Hugo and Nebula awards, it hardly needs my recommendation, but for what it's worth this is a great time travel story and a fantastic piece of science fiction."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I'm not a particularly fast reader, but every now and then I'll amaze myself by reading an entire book in a day. These are usually shorter books. Doomsday book, being about 600 pages, doesn't quite fit into this category but I just absolutely could not bear to put it down and wound up reading the entire thing in a single sitting.Absolutely wonderful - you feel as if you've been transported back into 14th century along with Kirvin - a complete escape from reality! Wonderful characters, fascinating learning about a completely different time.Connie Willis is not your typical sci fi writer (as several reviewers often complain about on her books) -- but my feel is that a good book is a good book, regardless of genre. Personally, I enjoy science fiction because it takes you into worlds completely foreign to the one that you live in. While this book takes place primarily in the past rather than the future, it certainly succeeds at showing you a life completely foreign to what we live in today. I think it's a wonderful book, I'm sorry some people were so put off by what time it took place during."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"There's not a lot of SciFi on my reading list, but my dear friend Mamalinda not only recommended this but sent it to me. And I'm so glad she did; otherwise, I would have missed this stunningly beautiful novel.Kivrin is a young English historian in this novel set some years in the future when time travel is possible. Set to embark upon what is to be a short, tightly controlled visit to 1320 England, something goes terribly wrong and she is sent instead into the year 1348, a time when the Black Plague is ravishing Europe and the British Isles. Sheltering with the family in a minor rural manor, realizing at the same time that something has gone awry and she is not going to find her way to the drop point in time to travel home, Kivrin finds herself bonding with the family, coping with the difficulties of everyday medieval life, and immersing herself in the daily travails of their lives. And then the Plague comes and it falls to Kivrin, a thoroughly modern young woman, to nurse the victims as best she can in primitive conditions, bury them when they die, and try to survive herself. The characters are so beautifully developed that it is impossible not to feel the emotions they are feeling, to rejoice with them, and hurt with them. This period in history is richly and expertly chronicled by the author, right down to the subtle nuances of the still-evolving English language. This is a beautifully written, powerfully moving book to get lost in, to savor, and to think about long after the final chapter is read."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I'm not much of a sci-fi type, I came across this book while looking for books on The Plague. It sounded interesting so I took a chance and I wasn't disappointed! The writing is very \\"British\\" in tone and that might take some getting used to at first. I didn't feel like the book was screaming \\"science fiction\\" at me...the whole time travel part was really quite matter-of-fact. The story is a nice blend of history, mystery, suspense and the futuristic all rolled into one. It has some really heart-tugging moments as well. Overall, it's a great tale of survival in difficult times whether they be in the present day or 700 years ago."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I cannot add much to all the other glowing reviews, except to say that I found this book to be completely devastating, which is a rare thing, I think, in such a tired old genre. In fact, I normally would have given it a miss, just from knowing it involved time-travel, but I remembered reading a really good story by Connie Willis called &quot;Jack&quot;, a subtle and extra-creepy vampire tale that's unlike any of the usual vampire cliches, and so I gave &quot;Doomsday Book&quot; a chance. And am very glad I did. Ms. Willis is a strong writer, with a great sense of character and place. Not many authors could venture into such well-travelled country and discovered a new vein of gold, but Ms. Willis can and does, consistently. So, even though I am mostly a fan of a whole other kind of SF, I am glad to recommend this touching, humane and very haunting book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"A friend repeatedly begged me to read this book and I kept dismissing him, claiming I didn't have the time. Well, he finally just BOUGHT the book for me and I settled down to read it. I didn't put it down until I reached the last page. Doomsday Book's brilliant prose and erotic lure of time travel reached me deep inside and suddenly I wanted to be one of those characters. Although the pace of the book is evenly timed, Doomsday Book's &quot;slow start&quot; has put off several readers. Don't be one of them. Everything in this novel is crafted very specifically, even those seemingly throwaway characters. It will all make sense in the end. So, to make a long gushing review short, if you enjoy historical fiction and time travel, this is your ideal novel. And after you finish Doomsday Book, pick up To Say Nothing of the Dog, which deals with historians going back to Victorian instead of Medieval England. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Connie Willis' Doomsday Book will delight the reader of near-future sci-fi and the alternative history buff alike. Well-researched and seamlessly written, the characters of the future and bygone eras spring to life as they share eerily similar perils and frustrations bridging 700 years. Unlike the disappointing Timeline by Michael Crichton, Willis' novel is full of robust, three-dimensional characters with tangible emotions and desires. Whether the setting is near-future England or the sparsely populated village of a mediaeval manor, readers will recognize the settings as truly as if they lived in them. Connie Willis will make believers of even those who do not &quot;willingly suspend disbelief.&quot;"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Having found &quot;To Say Nothing of the Dog&quot; to be one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read, I decided to try another of Connie Willis' books. This turned out to be &quot;Doomsday Book&quot;. All I can say is &quot;Wow!&quot; This is an incredible book. Much darker and more serious than &quot;To Say Nothing...&quot;, the book is gut-wrenching, thrilling, thought-provoking, and ultimately quite touching (and at times, there's even a little humor). The basic plot: time travel puts a young researcher in the Middle Ages, perhaps on the eve of the Plague. Willis gives us two parallel stories, both involving epidemics, and the reader races toward a finale that I found sobering and uplifting at the same time.The characters are well-defined (a couple of them even reappear in &quot;To Say Nothing...&quot;), with some you are truly rooting for and some who you would like to slap across the face. You gotta love the Finch character! Willis does a great job making the 1300s come alive.How much did I like this book? I finished it on a roundtrip flight between Seattle and WDC. I almost always fall asleep on airplanes, if even just for an hour. I didn't fall asleep at all while reading this book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I really liked this book. It takes about 20 or 30 pages to figure out what is happening, but not in a bad way. It drops you into a situation where an inexperienced student is being sent on a time-travel mission. It ends up grabbing you and not letting go as a series of events leave many, many questions unanswered and the author keeps you guessing as you keep turning the pages. Rarely do I find a book that I can not put down, but this is one of them. Do yourself a favor and start reading it. If you're not hooked by page 50, find a new hobby."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"When I first noticed this book on the shelves I was not impressed, from reading the back cover the story appeared a little drab but then I saw that it had won the Hugo and Nebula awards, often a good judge of the quality of a book, so I bought it. I was not to be disappointed.The title is very appropriate, it really has two meanings in this novel written by Connie Willis. This is not so much a science fiction story but rather a tale of characters in two time zones, the first in 2054 and the second in 1348 medieval England. As such the book refers to the well known Domesday Book written as a kind of assize of the people of England under Royal rule and the second being the recordings the main character makes of the life of the middle ages.Kivrin, is a graduate student at Oxford in 2054, a historian in fact, and wishes to travel back in time to truly live the middle ages. Time travel is now commonly used and the paradoxes which are usually discussed are physically impossible. She prepares herself well for the role researching customs, clothes, language, the common occupations of women of the time and all of the necessary inoculations, such as the plague. The original assignment was to drop in in 1320, 28 years before the plague hit England, and study the life of people in the middle ages. This was to be a brief two weeks and she would then be retrieved. It does not go well and her life there becomes more and more the one she must live to survive. The whole way of life there is completely different from what she is used to but the people are fascinating. Her life with a family of the minor nobility, especially her love of Agnes the incredibly cute 5 year old daughter is simply wonderful, so innocent and delightful. Somehow Connie Willis manages this effortlessly. The horror of the plague is captured with astonishing depth, not the physical effects but the human emotional impact. This is worth reading just for the interaction of the characters. In addition, somehow the author manages to display the \\"Englishness\\" of the people involved, this is remarkable in that she is American.An astonishing story, Connie Willis can really tell a story. It was like you were there and the tragedy of the black death was as it must truly have been. It's unfortunate that the characters in the modern era (2054) are nowhere near as well developed as those in 1348, nonetheless a great novel. Easily the best I've read for a years."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is one fantastic book. Few authors glue me to a book like Connie Willis, and this one is her greatest."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I nearly gave up on this book halfway through. I'm glad I didn't; the last third of the book made it all worthwhile.The story, as a whole, is well written. The author has a way of poking fun at certain character traits that works rather well. Where I ran afoul of her style is with the way that, for most of the middle of the book, the characters are always on the verge of figuring things out.This sort of drawn-out, pained suspense annoyed me to the point where I wanted to reach into the novel, grab certain characters, and shake them vigorously. It's somewhat frustrating to find that, 200 pages later, a fundamental question that was *almost* answered earlier is still *almost* answered now.Some people have commented that you could skip about 200 pages in the middle and hardly miss a beat in the plot. They're correct. However, you would also miss out on some clever dialog, and you'd never get to know certain characters in a way that makes the final hundred pages so poignant."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"When I finished reading Doomsday Book I looked at my son's stack of library books and quietly placed it on the very top. It was the next thing he choose to read. For two days last summer all he did was read Doomsday and eat. In Father Roche he found a hero unlike any other and understood completely Kirvin's words that the man was a saint. He also made the comment, &quot;I wouldn't want to be a woman in the dark ages and have no control over my life.&quot; So for those people who don't understand what all the fuss is about, well, your loss and our gain."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"sorry to say ,i cant see why half people rate this a ten and others rate this low , the story as i see had potentail and some interesting aspects ,like the relationship between kirvin and agnes ,but in the end the two story lines never crossed in time ,or should i say the people in the 20th century never made it time to help kirvin , perhaps if connie really merged the two storylines sooner --more story could have come about .kirvin should have interacted more with colin -more to save something in this novel , who wants to read a book with rich charecters only to find in the end they all die helplessly ,if this is anyones cup of tea drink it Well my friend :-("},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Original story, well written, but SLOW. The plot suffers from the absences of all the advancements in communication and science that have occurred since it was written in 1996, ,but,ignoring those issues, it's really entertaining.

I picked this book up in college when a friend of mine handed it to me at The Strand in New York and said, \\"This book has one of the best conceptions of time travel that I've ever read.\\" He was right. Connie Willis has made a time travel story here where time travel makes sense scientifically; anything that could cause a paradox is made impossible by the system realigning itself. That's how paradoxes are treated in other version of physics, certainly.On the basis of that recommendation, I read the book, and found that not only was the time travel depiction incredible, but the dimension of the book that is a historical novel was also superb. The student Kivrin, who is a fairly strong female character, is accidentally sent to 1348 when she was supposed to be studying the *early* 14th century. She finds herself in a small English town during the height of the Black Plague. Through the residents of this town, the \\"contemps,\\" Connie Willis shows us characters who challenge commonly-held folk beliefs about how the plague progressed. Her research is excellent and her ability to show us realistic medieval people is fantastic. The town priest, I found, was an exceptionally compelling character. We see, through Kivrin, how the families and personalities of this small village deal with the devastation that was the Black Plague. It is very dark, and quite depressing at times, but it is an engrossing and sobering tale of humanity under the most dire of circumstances. I learned something that drove a total change in my attitude towards the humanities: that the study of the past can show us the true capabilities of the human spirit. Even though many of the people of the fourteenth century thought that the plague was the end of the world, we see how they persevered and kept going. I went on from reading this book to write my undergraduate thesis in History, about the Black Plague.In the present-day events of the novel, a disease outbreak coupled with Oxford University's winter break slows the historians' ability to rescue Kivrin from where she has ended up. These elements of the story are passably interesting but I didn't feel they added much depth to the novel; they simply provided a compelling explanation for why a response to Kivrin's problem took so long to happen. I could take or leave them, to be frank.This book may not appeal to some readers. If time travel and science fiction don't work for you, but historical fiction does...skip it. If historical fiction doesn't work for you, but time travel and science fiction do...skip it. If you like both of those things, this is a must-read."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"The story is great, but the vision of our future is so sad in that the people are motivated by self interest totally lacking in intelligence, logic, and common sense. Impulsivity drives all action. In the future, I would like to think we have developed a greater sense of working together on common goals for the greater good."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"An interesting premise, but I don't think that time-travel would be so unregulated as it was portrayed in the book. Also, the book was a bit of a downer. I understand that its focus is on the protagonist and how she &#34;grows&#34; during the story arc, but it was really depressing to wade through it."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is the first novel-length work that I've read by Connie Willis, and I found it to be an enjoyable read.The Doomsday Book follows two divergent tales. In near-future Oxford, England, historians use a time machine to facilitate research of past decades and centuries. Kivrin has been set on visiting the Middle Ages and has prepared diligently. When she is sent back, she falls suddenly ill upon her arrival, losing track of her exact location and the rendezvous site to return home.Once Kivrin has left the near-future timeline, the technician who ran the time machine falls ill. Badri is only able to communicate that something is wrong with Kivrin's trip before a fever leaves him delirious.Mr. Dunworthy had helped to train Kivrin for her trip and fears for her safety after Badri's message. He struggles against university politics and a spreading epidemic to try to discover what went wrong. The two plot lines echo each other in minor ways, as well as the major idea of an epidemic of infectious disease.I thought that the plot sagged in the middle during Kivrin's sections, but was otherwise engaging. The technology in this book is dated, and someone reading it now will have to accept that this future Oxford has no cell phones or internet, despite being able to accomplish time travel. There is never any attempt to explain the science behind the time travel, but the details are not necessary to the story.The characters were well-drawn and their interactions were believable. The author uses subtle humor through their interplay to soften the macabre subject matter at times. The ending of the book also caught me a little off-guard, but to avoid spoilers I'll have to refrain from saying more."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I thought the title reference would be to the historical Domesday Book, but that was not the case. Well-written and researched, this book told me way more about plague and disease than I wanted to know. Willis has a wonderful gift for creating characters so realistic that one can't help but root for them, but it's a bad idea to get too attached to any of the characters in this book. If you're looking for a grim time-travel fantasy, this is your book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is the type of book that the science fiction genre is all about. It has terrific characters, &quot;realistic&quot; plot, great suspense and is so well researched it makes you feel like you are there. I admitt am a Connie Willis fan, but this book deserved its awards! It is her best serious piece."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"If you had the chance to go back in time, knowing you could change nothing, would you? It sounds like an easy promise to Oxford University student Kivrin, heading back to the 14th Century. Her trip is meant to be an academic exercise, not much more, but through an error she is dropped in the path of the Plague and into the lives of a family she comes to love. Meanwhile, back at the lab, a ferocious virus has attacked the 21st Century city of Oxford -- including the only people who can to bring Kivrin home. Suspenseful, bittersweet and fascinating."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I've read close to a 1,000 books during my time here on Earth, but only a couple of dozen have stayed with me the way that Doomsday Book has.In a ranking of time travel books, this would probably have to be on or near the top. Not only does Willis generate an engaging story, but she creates real flesh-and-blood characters, not cardboard at all, and breathes life into them. And as the book is about the Black Plague, you can imagine how moving it is to watch these characters try to come to grips with the plague (and often fail).Worth reading at least once!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I cannot add much to all the other glowing reviews, except to say that I found this book to be completely devastating, which is a rare thing, I think, in such a tired old genre. In fact, I normally would have given it a miss, just from knowing it involved time-travel, but I remembered reading a really good story by Connie Willis called &quot;Jack&quot;, a subtle and extra-creepy vampire tale that's unlike any of the usual vampire cliches, and so I gave &quot;Doomsday Book&quot; a chance. And am very glad I did. Ms. Willis is a strong writer, with a great sense of character and place. Not many authors could venture into such well-travelled country and discovered a new vein of gold, but Ms. Willis can and does, consistently. So, even though I am mostly a fan of a whole other kind of SF, I am glad to recommend this touching, humane and very haunting book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I picked up &quot;The Doomsday Book&quot; on the advice of a friend and it didn't disappoint. It is really two stories: one in the future and one in the past. I liked the story in the past quite a lot more than the future one. It really gave me an insight into how life was back then: the social pecking order, the filth and disease, and especially the things about people which do not change over centuries, such as love, lust and duty.I recommend this book, though I don't think it is the caliber of some of the other Hugo award winning novels."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"A great book from start to finish. It's one of those books that once you start you can't put it down. Very fun reading!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I am usually wary of books that are branded with the label, \\"tour de force.\\" This one does not disappoint. It is a moving story about both the joy and sufferings of life in the past and in the future. The scenes from the 14th century are unforgettable.I admit that the writing isn't the best; I don't think you will find this being studied in any literature classes. However, the story is overpowering and the 14th century is brought to life in all of its glory and horror.This isn't just for sci-fi fans. I highly recommend this for anyone."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"A great story of time travel, the 21st century, and life during a very difficult time in the Middle Ages. Those who want a science fiction superhero to save the day will be disappointed, but let's face it, too many authors have already used that formula. An outstanding book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I consider this to be the best book I have ever seen in print. The characters of Connie Willis easily are the most vivid and human that I have ever encountered, and I would recommend this over all other titles."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Although it took me a little while to get into the book l was very interested in both of the two stories intertwined. The tragedy of the black death really affected me, maybe because of the children or just the utter helplessness of it all. The characterisation of Roche was very memorable; what a fantastic character."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I really enjoyed \\"To Say Nothing of the Dog\\" and thought I would also like \\"Doomsday Book\\". Unfortunately, I was disappointed.The book is probably a good 100 pages too long and has some glaring, annoying problems. Much of the conflict in the book hinges on an inability of the characters to contact each other. It's amazing to me that a science fiction writer like Willis was unable to foresee the ubiquitous use of cell phones even in 1993. Somehow, her futuristic society has time travel but no ability to contact each other without land lines. If the characters had cell phones, much of the difficulties her characters experienced would have been solved. Also, the medical technology available in the future seems to be worse than our own and the ability to transport medical supplies during a quarantine seem to be WWII era.The character development was excellent and the plot was interesting. I was just annoyed by the inconsistency of a society capable of time travel but incapable of rudimentary modern devices."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is probably the single most overrated SF book in recent years. I haven't read it in a while (and I *never* will again), but it left the impression of being slow, non-scientific (which you'd kinda hope a Hugo/Nebula winner *would* be), and generally boring. I forced myself to finish the book in the hope that it would get better. It did - when I was done, and able to read something else. The book is not horrible, just horribly overrated, and I'd recommend a potential buyer/reader to look elsewhere unless you've read everything else in the genre."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book proves the case that some reads are far better abridged, than unabridged. Repetitious, boring, tedious, rambling and, did I mention, repetitious and rambling? In the end, too many unanswered questions to situations mentioned over and over in the book, but never explained. Also, time travel can be a tricky thing, but at the very end of the book, the use of a \\"locator\\" has to be the icing on the cake. They didn't have satellites back in 1348 to my knowledge. Two stars would be too generous."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I don't normally read sci-fi novels. This book was recommended to me, although I can't imagine why. As far as novels go, it is okay - not all that exciting, but well written in its way. I think it would have been better if there had been more detail into how they invented time travel rather than endless pages of characters rushing from one place to another and then have them do nothing when they get there.The parts that take place in the Middle Ages were better than those taking place in \\"present time,\\" if only because there was some activity. After Kivrin regains her health, her interactions with the inhabitants of 14th century england were far more entertaining than the stymied medical personnel back in her home time.I assume the book was labeled as sci-fi because of the time travel element. It didn't seem too sci-fi beyond that. Overall, I thought it was mediocre."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Throughout the first part of this book it continually rains, which made me more than once wonder when all the cardboard characters were going to dissolve and wash away. This book is simply bad, and the part that should have been most interesting, the part spent in the past, contains too limited locations, plot, and characters to really satisfy. Several of the plot points are so artificial and poorly resolved that the book becomes an exercise in frustration. I cannot recommend this book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Doomsday Book is a thick novel, but don't let that put you off. The delightful characters and suspenseful plot make it a pretty quick read. A major theme in the book is that although technology & health science have grown tremendously from the 14th to the 21st century, human nature apparently has not. There are wonderfully kind and noble people in both time periods, people who enjoy life and who want to do the right thing. There are no classic evil villains in this book, none of the sort who set out to intentionally harm others. The \\"bad guy\\" in this novel is incompetence, delusions of self-importance, selfishness, religious obsessives who lack love, and fear. Make that Fear, with a capitol \\"F.\\" Examples of these types of people and/or character traits abound in both the 14th and the 21st centuries, and if these folks don't muck things up for others, they at least make people want to run and hide until the coast is clear. Of course at least one of these incompetent, impatient, glory-seeking nincompoops is in a position of authority . . . and so the story begins.The gist of the story is this: it's the year 2045 and historians time travel to get first hand experience of the period they're studying. Its Christmas time and the Medieval department of Oxford is preparing to send a young historian, Kivrin Engle, to the Middle Ages, specifically to the year 1320. No one has traveled that far back into time yet. The technology is fairly accurate in terms of \\"dropping\\" historians into a location, but no one knows how much time \\"slippage\\" there will be in sending someone that far back in time. Will it be five minutes? Five years? Fifty years? The Black Death hit Oxford in 1348, so the question of time is more important than simply wearing clothes that may be out-dated. Kivrin's mentor, the cautious Professor Dunworthy, does not think it wise to send a young, unaccompanied woman into the Middle Ages where cut-throats, rapists, and disease thrive. He's a professor of 20th Century History, but does all he can to help insure Kivrin will be as prepared as possible to meet the challenges of the Middle Ages. Kivrin has studied history, culture, and languages in preparation for this adventure, and has had a full round of immune system enhancers.But forces beyond anyone's control arise to cause havoc during both Kivrin's drop and her mission as well as in the \\"safe\\" environment of Oxford in 2054. Will Kivrin be able to return or will she be stuck in the Middle Ages for ever? Will she even survive the Middle Ages? Will Professor Dunworthy be able to get Kivrin back? Can he fight his way through the roadblocks his incompetent colleague has thrown up? Will anyone in Oxford be left to help her return?A friend recommended this book to me and as so often happens, a novel that was never even on my radar ends up being one of the most enjoyable books that I've read in a long time. I highly recommend Doomsday Book to history buffs, sci-fi/fantasy fans, and those who like to sink into a good story. I don't put a whole lot of stock in book awards (unless, of course, one of my favorite authors wins one), but Doomsday won the Hugo award and the Nebula award."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"It is one of my favourite books, one of the best books I have ever read. It is intelillent, funny, the personages and their personalities are very well introduced and interesting.The rest of her books (To say nothing of the dog, bellwhether,...) are also great."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"From the point of view of a historian this book is an excelent attempt at viewing the past how it really was with an engrossing spin of sci fi added. Willis obviously did a great deal of research before writing this novel because many of the misconceptions about medival times are not illustrated here, instead she manages to accuratley portray a time that is virtually unknown to us even though it is on our very own planet."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Although I really like the story, it keeps annoying that the communications in 2050 is not in sync with the devices of today. In half of the story (in 2050) the communication is disrupted and I keep thinking: you need an answering machine and/or a cellular phone. Why do people in 2050 miss the current available devices.Besides this annoying fact, I loved the book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is the book to read if you want to immerse yourself in the Middle Ages, You feel as though you are living during that time. Similar concept to &quot;Time and Again&quot; by Jack Finney. Highly readable novel, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I love stories that involve time traveling and this is my favorite one of all time. She has wonderful details and character development. It has been nearly 15 years since I first read the book and I can still vividly remember many, many details. Since then, I have read nearly all of Connie Willis' books with great enthusiasm and have enjoyed every one of them."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I read Blackout and All Clear b/f this novel. Blackout and All Clear were great. Doomsday Book is good but not nearly as interesting as the other two."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I remember in the early pages of this book being amazed at myself for being so hooked on a book that spent an entire paragraph describing making a phone call, not getting through, making a second phone call, not getting through, calling the first number again and the person was out (or some such thing). But I was hooked, and I remember thinking that the author was forcing us to be in the moment with the characters. It was a time travel book where the present moment was also important. I then settled in to experiencing time and events in real time with the characters, including not knowing what was going on and having to piece it all together from observations and bits of conversations; and the frustrations of delay, incomplete information, and being unable to control a situation. I was there with the characters experiencing everything, and I was eager to be there with them. Colin and Agnes were both delightfully drawn - I loved the details of their behaviors and what they said. Rosemund was a little girl-woman in a sad situation and with conflicting emotions, but she was brave, brave, brave. There are images in this book that I hope I don't forget - so many of them. I was a bit disappointed that there were no cell phones or voicemail in the future, but ultimately accepted it. It seemed like the reactions to the virus in the future were 1) overblown when the quarantine was imposed, and 2) confusingly understated when people were dying. I still haven't come to terms with certain deaths because the characters didn't seem to process their emotions regarding them either, but I believe that that processing was starting to occur, and that gives me a little closure. It seemed like the future, while facing certain fears and even death, was purposely kept lighter to offset the heaviness of the very real tragedy of the black death. I am left almost disregarding the future virus and being immersed in the loss of the black death. The book has made me want to learn more about the black death and the 1300's.

And if you do like timetravel get Blackout and its sequel All Clear, set in WWII, I highly recomend it."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I read this book on a recommendation from my sister, and was really glad I did. I'm not really into science fiction, but this book gave me just enough to not overload me. The story takes place in the future where, at Oxford College, time travel has aparantly been discovered and is used by the school. A student historian, Kivrin, goes back in time to before the plaque, but things do not go as planned, and the adventure she has is what make up the heart of the story. Also, her professer, Mr. Dunworthy, goes through his own dillema as he braves an epidemic to try to rescue his stranded student in the past. This book is a serious read, very full of details, and shows us the suffering and struggles and injustices of life during the plaque and the early 14th century. It was very interesting to learn about this. I liked learning about the time travel machine at the college as well, and enjoyed the characters who make up the story. I also read the sequeal, To Say Nothing of the Dog. Most of the same characters are back, but with humor, tons of humor, packed in. These are two great books. I wish there were more time travel books by Ms. Willis."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I didn't like the beginning of the book, but it ended up being very moving. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"It's terrifically written, but it's probably one of the most depressing books you'll ever read. It's sort of a laugh at the people who claim they know what they would do in a past crisis with modern knowledge. It tries to speak to human dignity. It's at the same time satisfying and utterly not. It seems to say a lot about human nature, but neither bad nor good.It is a severely depressing book though. If you are going to read it, try to have something to cheer you up afterward."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Very well written, gripping story. At first I thought, \\"Time travel?\\" Okay, it's science fiction, time travel from 2054 to the 14th Century, but descriptions of how life was lived then are fascinating.

I can pick up any book of hers and be instantly charmed by the characters and turning the pages feverishly to find out what happens next. Doomsday Book is no different. It is complex in that it carries two plots, parallel yet centuries apart, and it carries them smoothly and expertly together. I was instantly invested in the characters and grew only more attached as the story went on. I could not put this book down."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I would give Connie Willis' \\"Dooms Day Book\\" an unqualified five stars.It was a captivating read. I recommend it warmly. The four star ratinghas to do with the book's physical aspect. The printing of this editionwas truly disappointing. There is so little margin on the pages, onewonders if the publisher was afraid of running out of paper."},{"Title":"Classic Popeye Comic: Transportation Careers","review":"There are a number of reasons to buy this item. First, it is very rare and unique--a must for comic collectors and afficiandos. Second, it is a prime example of Nixon propaganda. Third, but most important, it was illustrated by the great Geo Wildman!Wildman, a lifelong resident of Connecticut, studied advertising at what is now the Paire College of Art. During the 1950s, he was a successful commercial artist, first working for an ad agency, and then becoming a freelance artist. During this time, he began producing freelance comic book art for Charlton Press in Derby, Connecticut.When King Comics ceased publication of their POPEYE title, Charlton acquired the rights. Longtime writer-artist Bud Sagendorf was busy with the daily and Sunday newspaper comics, and declined the job of continuing. George Wildman was offered a contract to produce the POPEYE illustrations, with prolific Joe Gill writing scripts. The first Charlton issue of POPEYE appears in 1969, the final one in 1977. Wildman was hired as assistant editor to Sal Gentile, and in 1971 was promoted to managing editor, and eventually executive editor. Assistant editor Nicola Cuti wrote several of the later POPEYE scripts for Charlton.Wildman's tenure as editor continued through 1985, while Western Publishing picked up POPEYE under their Gold Key and/or Whitman trademarks. Bill Pearson, by then assistant editor at Charlton, began writing scripts, and Wildman produced illustrations while off-duty from Charlton. Their crowning achievement was the epic 50th anniversary special published in 1979.Thanks to the Robert Altman POPEYE movie, a demand for Popeye-related merchandise led to Wildman's working for Random House, illustrating a classic \\"Pop-Up Book\\" which became a best-seller and later a display at the Smithsonian Institution. Wildman was also invited to produce a painted wooden Easter egg for the White House Easter event, his egg also now housed in the Smithsonian. Around this time, the National Cartoonists Society awarded him \\"Best Cartoonist, Humor Division.\\"Western Publishing ceased its comics line in the early 1980s, and Wildman retired from Charlton Comics in 1985, moving into a freelance comic book and children's book illustration career. His pencils, inks and paints graced publications featuring Disney, Hanna-Barbara, Harvey and Warner Brothers characters along with countless designs for various businesses.In 1994, George and wife Trudy Wildman were honored in a gala festival in Chester, Illinois, celebrating the 100th birthday of the creator of Popeye, Elzie Crisler Segar. Wildman received the Popeye Fan Club's Lifetime Achievement Award and performed a sketching show to a standing-room-only crowd. A return visit to Chester in 2004, to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Popeye, found Wildman teamed with Hy Eisman, the writer-artist of the Sunday POPEYE newspaper strip since 1994.Today, Wildman and son Karl operate their own advertising agency, producing computer animation, greeting cards, and a wide variety of products. Wildman's work is seen regularly in the \\"Hidden Pictures\\" publications of HIGHLIGHTS FOR CHILDREN. He celebrated his 80th birthday in 2007 and continues to receive mail from Popeye fans around the world."},{"Title":"Mickey Mantle's Greatest Hits","review":"I saw Mickey Mantle hit three or four home runs at Yankee Stadium, but there was one I clearly recall - his 30th home run at the last regular season game of 1962.

In court she is professional, always ready, and does a superior job representing the state except when defense attorney George Gibson is her opponent.After their latest amateurish debacle annoys the presiding judge, Amelia and George continue their squabble until they overhear a threat to kill jurors and judges followed by a gunshot. Amelia reports part of the incident while George blithely goes home,. The next day someone assaults Amelia in her home. A guilt ridden George visits Amelia to see if she is all right and to tell her that they need to trust no one until they find concrete evidence that dangerous wrong doings are occurring in the Los Angeles courthouse. As they work together illegally breaking and entering and stealing (borrowing?), they begin to better understand one another. Though they fall in love, both carry baggage from their childhood making anything lasting seem impossible.Though the lead couple is both lawyers, the story line is more an amateur sleuth romantic suspense thriller. The story line is fun to follow as Amelia and George try to solve the case using illegal means while falling in love. Though the conspiracy seems too far-reaching to be genuine plus his best pal is a cop who would do anything for him (why not ask), the lead duet make this a fabulous tale whose first kiss in the air condition duct is a classic representation of a superb read.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"You've Got a Hold On Me","review":"This novel starts off very slowly.

Each has a zest for fighting the good fight. Cunning and clever, they are well-respected in their profession. In anyone's book, one is well-to-do having grown up on the right side of the tracks, while the other was educated in the school of hard knocks as a child.Despite their differences, attorneys Amelia Farrow and George Gibson find more commonalties as they set forth on the daunting task of discovering the truth of a conspiracy that threatens to shake the LA Courthouse to its very bedrock. As they further become embroiled in the scandalous course of events, George and Amelia are thrown together - instead of bitter adversaries, they have to join forces to overcome the dangers that loom over them.

For me it is Kinsey Milhone that is addictive. Her wise cracks, her rather sarcastic sense of humor and her view of the world is always right on the mark. I am concerned about the final book in the series, \\"Z is for Z??????, will we see K.M. retire or will Ms. Grafton treat us to another series using the famous PD"},{"Title":"\\"F\\" is for fugitive: A Kinsey Millhone mystery","review":"Sue Grafton's alphabet mysteries are always fun. I'm reading them in order, and \\"F Is for Fugitive\\" may be my favorite one so far. Kinsey is called upon to solve an old murder case in a small, dilapidated beach town. The timing is perfect given that her apartment was just blown to bits in the prior book and is being redone. The residents of Floral Beach all know each other, and many of them seem to have motives for killing off 17-year-old Jean Timberlake. As usual, Kinsey manages to ingratiate herself into the lives of the suspects, which at times seems a bit forced, but certainly makes the mystery more fun.What makes this mystery work so well is the new setting and the plethora of interesting suspects. Grafton skillfully outlines the motives of the various residents and keeps us guessing until the very end. Of course, Kinsey manages to get confessions fairly easily, as happens in most of her cases. Fortunately, Grafton has a knack for sketching believable characters and situation, and she packs quite a bit of detail into her short novels. I did miss the old regulars from Santa Teresa, but Kinsey does have a change of heart about Henry that tugs effectively at the heart strings.Note: This review is for the Kindle version of \\"F Is for Fugitive.\\" The publisher seems to have taken care in the creation of the e-book version. I found no obvious errors, and the chapters are linked in the table of contents. Unfortunately, the color cover shown here is not available on the Kindle, not even the Kindle Fire version. In its place is a nondescript small cover comprised of orange blocks and orange type on a white background. The same cover seems to be used for all the Kindle versions of her books, as it is the same for D and E."},{"Title":"\\"F\\" is for fugitive: A Kinsey Millhone mystery","review":"I found this book fantastic. I read it in a couple of days I just couldn't put it down.Iam finding the series is very entertaining and I love the way some chacters and weaved through book to book."},{"Title":"\\"F\\" is for fugitive: A Kinsey Millhone mystery","review":"I'm now six books into Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone \\"Alphabet\\" mystery series, and they continue to be great fun, in turns dramatic, funny, dangerous, and breezily relaxing. \\"F Is For Fugitive\\" involves a years-old murder, who many say was never properly solved, and lots of small-community secrets. We get to see the tough yet winsome Kinsey wade neck deep into all of this, as well as enjoy a little dose of what's been going on in her life lately. As in previous books, though, the main mystery story is strong and Ms. Grafton keeps the primary focus on that, to satisfying effect. Latecomer or not to this long-running series, I'm really enjoying that I've finally joined the Kinsey Millhone party."},{"Title":"\\"F\\" is for fugitive: A Kinsey Millhone mystery","review":"Sorry, but I found the writing uninspired, with too many awkward similes (\\"An erratic breeze, as moist as the inside of an ice chest, rattled among the tree branches.\\" I kid you not.) The chronology was a straight linear progression from the first page to the last--nothing as challenging as, say, a flashback.I'm usually terrible about figuring out whodunit, but with this one I was a good 50 pages ahead of the protagonist. By that personal standard, not a great story.I like crime novels but don't read many; this one was definitely no standout IMO."},{"Title":"\\"F\\" is for fugitive: A Kinsey Millhone mystery","review":"&quot;F is for Fugitive&quot; is one of the better Kinsey mysteries: engrossing from the first chapter, it reads quickly and consistently. Although the book is 300 pages long - longer than most of Grafton's novels - there is no mid-story lull. It bypasses much of Kinsey's usual backdrop: the action takes place in a small town ninety miles away from Santa Teresa, so Henry Pitts, Rosie, the California Fidelity crew, and Kinsey's bachelorette life in her small apartment are peripheral or entirely absent from the story. The book focuses entirely on the mystery of an twenty-year-old murder in a small town and a cast of characters who all seem to have something to hide. It's quintessential Sue Grafton: suspenseful and well-written, a pleasure to read from beginning to end."},{"Title":"\\"F\\" is for fugitive: A Kinsey Millhone mystery","review":"It is probably pretty easy to write a book where a one-dimensional, uninteresting protagonist solves an easy mystery. It would be harder to write one where that same character solves an intriguing mystery, or where an interesting, multi-faceted protagonist solves a boring mystery. It is perhaps easiest of all to baffle the readers throughout, then pull a rabbit of the the hat at the end, trying to be clever. Sue Grafton does not take any of these easy routes. Kinsey Millhone is a very interesting, believable, just plain human, character. The mystery in this 6th installment plays fair. Until the very end, you have several choices of who the culprit might be. The actual killer was not a total surprise, but wasn't one of the ones I was thinking were most likely. I enjoyed this book, and I recommend it highly. By the time I get a chance to read the rest of the current books, &quot;O is for Outlaw&quot; should be out, then I guess I will have to eagerly await each future book, just like those who have been reading this series all along."},{"Title":"\\"F\\" is for fugitive: A Kinsey Millhone mystery","review":"Normally I truly relate to the main character, Kinsey Millhone, who is sufficiently offbeat to make me appreciate her. However, in this one there were so many references to fat and flab, and so many outright disparaging descriptions in general that I found myself entirely distracted from the story. I hadn't pegged Ms. Millhone as that shallow.The story itself was the typical riot, but it seemed to have less humor than previous ones. In \\"E\\", for example, I loved the relationship Millhone had with her pet policeman at the local station. Those descriptions were warm and human. These just seemed...snippy. Of course, there were still some laugh-out-loud moments. I think there always will be.I liked the idea of solving an old mystery and, while this took me two road trips to get through, I was satisfied by the end, which as always caught me by surprise.Onwards to \\"G\\" I go..."},{"Title":"\\"F\\" is for fugitive: A Kinsey Millhone mystery","review":"Sue Grafton's books are so GOOD that she makes mystery writing look easy. But it's not, she's just excellent at what she does.&quot;F&quot; takes Kinsey Millhone out of town to solve a 17-year-old murder case, and she's soon up to her ears in decades-old clues and crimes. One of the things Grafton does best is to create vivid and realistic communities of people. &quot;F&quot; is a great example of this--each character we meet is interesting, complex, AND has interactive relationships with other characters we've met. Everyone's connected, and when Kinsey solves the mystery, it makes sense because it FITS the characters.My only (minor) complaints are that I missed the usual cast of characters (especially that Hungarian-type woman at the bar where Kinsey eats) and that Grafton indulges in a little moralizing at the end, which seemed heavy-handed."},{"Title":"\\"F\\" is for fugitive: A Kinsey Millhone mystery","review":"Seventeen years ago, Jean Timberlake (a promiscuous, six-weeks-pregnant high schooler) was murdered on the shore of Floral Beach, California, apparently by her ex-boyfriend, Bailey Fowler, who was consequently sent to prison. However, after repeated escapes--and spending much of his time out of the picture in this book--Kinsey Millhone, the 32-year-old no-nonsense private investigator, is hired by his father to investigate Jean's death and hopefully prove Bailey's innocence.&quot;'F' is for Fugitive&quot; is yet another enjoyable Kinsey Millhone mystery with lots of quirky characters, particularly Bailey Fowler's family, who own the motel near where Jean was killed. It's also Kinsey's temporary residence while her apartment is being rebuilt after the happenings in the previous book (&quot;'E' is for Evidence&quot;). &quot;'F' is for Fugitive&quot; is relatively fast paced and has a more rounded ending than in some of Grafton's other books. And, as usual, I enjoyed Kinsey's sarcastic humor and refreshing first person narrative. Worth reading if you're into this alphabet mystery series."},{"Title":"\\"F\\" is for fugitive: A Kinsey Millhone mystery","review":"F IS FOR FUGITIVE is one of my favorites! Bad girl Jean Tiberlake was killed and her ex-boyfriend, Bailey Fowler, convicted of her murder. After seventeen years in prison, he escapes. Kinsey Millhone is hired to find the killer. The catch: Is the killer Fowler or someone else?Typical Grafton style in this book, you won't know who the real killer is until the end. Sue Grafton not only keeps you on the edge of your seat, but has you second-guessing yourself when you think you've figured it all out.Surprises abound in this book, from the unknown dangers, to the love and caring shown to Kinsey by her buddy Henry! Everyone should have a friend like Henry! I can't say enough good things about F IS FOR FUGITIVE without giving away all of the little curves Grafton throws at you in this book.

Bailey was imprisoned for the murder, but managed to escape until the police picked him up just 3 weeks before Kinsey is called on the case. Realizing the difficulty of finding evidence in a case that old, Kinsey still persists in her investigation. The small town where the murder occurred is just as inbred as most small towns and Kinsey hears gossip which tells her that Jean was a very promiscuous young lady. She was also pregnant at the time of the murder, so that gave a motive to any of the various men she was involved with at the time of her death. Kinsey keeps evolving throughout Sue Grafton's novels, both as a character and as an investigator. It's enjoyable to see the twists and turns which these books take as the series progresses."},{"Title":"\\"F\\" is for fugitive: A Kinsey Millhone mystery","review":"Kinsey Millhone is the star of author Sue Grafton's alphabet series of murder mysteries.

She is hired by Royce Fowler a motel owner in the small northern California town of Floral Beach. Royce's son Bailey has just escaped from prison where he was serving time for the murder of Jean Timberlake. Jean was a seventeen year old town tramp who was found dead on the beach after being strangled to death. She was pregnant at the time of her murder. Royce wants Kinsey to investiage the crime.The result is an exciting tale where town secrets are revealed and two more persons are murdered. Along the way we learn of secret love affairs and a murderer who is adept with a shotgun. To reveal more is to spoil this riveting tale of a murderer brought to justice.

I've enjoyed Millhone's A-E mysteries, but F took her detective skills to a new level. What a pleasure it was to take a vacation with Kinsey, in Floral Beach. I thought Santa Teresa was interesting, but this town made Peyton Place look like Leave it to Beaver. There were so many interesting and inter-related characters, that in order to keep up (and not miss out), I had to keep a notepad, jotting down the relationship each character had with others. Several times I thought I was onto the murderer, but this one kept me in the dark until the thrilling end. I could just feel my heart beating faster as Kinsey was on the run. I was pleased that all the loose ends got tied up in the end, with good explanations for all the bizarre behavior. Sue Grafton, you hit the top with this one!"},{"Title":"\\"F\\" is for fugitive: A Kinsey Millhone mystery","review":"Kinsey definitely deserves her reputation as a sharp, witty, and thoroughly likeable protagonist.

For one, I finally figured out that the fictitious town of \\"Floral Beach,\\" the setting for this book, is actually Avila Beach -- on the coast of Central California (12 miles west of San Luis Obispo). Sue Grafton drops a few clues into the story (like the hot springs, which the real town Avila Beach also has) that allowed me to figure out which town she'd used as the model for the locale of the story.As usual, Sue Grafton's descriptions of place and weather, through Kinsey, are so descriptive as to be nearly poetic. Early on in the story, when Kinsey is going to visit the pool hall, there's a description of the fog coming in at night off the ocean that practically makes me want to move there (me being one of those people who loves seeing the coastal fog creep in off the Pacific, as it does so grandly and so very often here on the West Coast).I slightly missed Kinsey's usual cast of characters back in Santa Teresa, but at the same time it was nice to have a different locale for a Kinsey mystery. I was absorbed in the story from beginning to end, and the descriptions of nearby San Luis Obispo are spot on, too. Ms. Grafton continues to impress me with her talents as a writer.

Bailey Fowler was convicted of the crime back when it happened but his father hires Kinsey to prove his innocence. Kinsey does the standard gumshoe routine, poking around and questioning everyone she can find with a connection to the murder victim. As one might expect, the sleepy little town hides some dark secrets that not everyone wants to see come to the surface. Kinsey weaves her way through the difficulties, and a fresh body or two, to reveal the killer.Kinsey Millhone is the star of all of Sue Grafton's alphabet series, and this is the sixth installment out of 20 so far. She cracks wise, provides a sympathetic ear to those who want to talk, and is not afraid to stir up a hornet's nest when she needs to. The Fowler family, her clients, are not pleasant or likeable. The mother, Ori, is a needy hypochondriac who actually does suffer from diabetes but uses her health like a club to maintain her place as the constant center of attention. The father, Royce, is domineering and rude to pretty much everyone, although he has a soft spot for Bailey. Ann, the long-suffering daughter is relatively nice and times and brittle as glass at others.The plot could have used a touch more action. In some respects, it feels like Kinsey does a lot of going around in circles. She talks to people, picks up a few tidbits, talks to more people, etc. There's nothing wrong with interviews in a murder mystery but it started to feel monotonous after a while.In the final analysis, F is for Fugitive was an interesting read. I had correctly identified the killer but only as a hunch and I was far from certain so I was definitely interested in getting to the reveal. I would have preferred it if the plot were a bit denser but it isn't boring by any means. This was my first Kinsey Millhone book and I don't think I saw enough to make me come back for a second helping. Millhone isn't a bad character, but I saw nothing compelling about her. The Fowler family was irritating and unlikable to the point that it really got on my nerves by the end of the book. I would certainly recommend the book to fans of Sue Grafton's work but first time readers should tread carefully. I'd suggest starting with a book that has fewer characters that are annoying as it might make for a more enjoyable read."},{"Title":"\\"F\\" is for fugitive: A Kinsey Millhone mystery","review":"...since below someone said what I was thinking - 'F' is for fabulous. ;) This is right up there with 'C' and 'A' as one of the most engaging, intriguing, page-turning Kinsey mysteries yet.

In this book, our protagonist leaves the usual setting of Santa Teresa and travels to Floral Beach, a small town, where she is hired to solve a murder that happened seventeen years ago. She quickly untangles a web of emotions and hatred between different characters.

The mystery is interesting and it took a while to figure out but Kinsey's attitude through the whole book was disturbing. She seems very contemptuous of anyone with physical disabilities, a family, any religious feelings or anyone that's out of shape. Her rude comments about people in these categories really distract from the story and I'm guessing that a lot of her readers fall in at least one of these categories.

I really enjoyed this book. In general, what I most like about Sue Grafton's novels is she is a master of foreshadowing. Foreshadowing occurs when the author gives us a hint of something that is going to happen in the novel. If you like a novel that takes you into the mind and work of an interesting private eye, you will like this book. The twist of foreshowing makes the novel different then most novels of this genre because it looks at foreshadowing in a different perspective. The perspective is from tough woman named Kinsey Milhone who is brought up as a woman who \\"takes no prisoners\\" and trusts no one.Sue Grafton makes the novel compelling reading for both men and women because the main character Kinsey acts like a man or the stereotype of a man most of the time. But the reader still finds she has an innocent feminine side at the most unexpected times. I think that's why I enjoyed this novel so much. Although there was only one narrator, Kinsey still looked at each situation with compassion and with an overwhelming feeling of practicality. One narrator for such a large number of characters is like having two streams of consciousnesses, kind of a split personality. After reading this novel one should get a realistic view of what life might be like as a private eye. Be sure and read all of the books in this series. It is not necessary to read them in sequence because they are not chronological but rather books that stand-alone.

But what's it all about? Tennis in the Boardroom? Golf swings by the water cooler?Myles Downey's book, despite its relative brevity, makes an excellent job of introducing some of the key considerations involved in training or hiring business coaches. At 135 pages (including the Introduction) you obviously aren't going to get an in-depth explanation of what coaching can do for you and/or your company. What I think you WILL get is a pretty good feeling for whether coaching is something you want to get involved with.If that makes the book sound a bit airy-fairy, I apologise. Mr Downey also does an excellent job of laying the groundwork for becoming an &quot;effective coach&quot; - if that's what you're after. There are plenty of very practical tips, including useful models, such as the &quot;Spectrum of Coaching Skills&quot; and the &quot;GROW&quot; (or &quot;TO GROW&quot;) outline for any coaching session.One of the highlights of the book as far, as I was concerned, was the inclusion of snippets of dialogue (ranging from a few lines to several pages in length) used to actually demonstrate how to handle various elements of the coaching function.The one element of the book I felt a little uneasy about was Mr Downey's hypothesis that a manager can also function as coach to one of his/her subordinates. As Mr Downey himself points out, facts and thoughts might emerge during a coaching session that could potentially be somewhat damaging when it comes to appraisal time. There seems to be an assumption that a &quot;good&quot; manager could somehow separate the two functions and ignore in 'manager mode' the things s/he has learnt whilst in 'coaching mode'.I'd suggest that this is a piece of impractical idealism, which places an unrealistic and unfair burden upon the manager and the coachee alike.Rather than sweeping such considerations under the rug, it seems to me that coaching is likely to remain a fad until issues such as this have been fully addressed and resolved."},{"Title":"Effective Coaching (Orion Business Toolkit)","review":"Miles Downey's book was quite an eye opener for me.

Ward provides essentials worth our attention in our still quickly-evolving board environment. Note that the book is useful for non-profit boards also as they face increasing mandates to ensure a business-like approach to their planning and execution.Three subjects in the book were especially important to me based on my work with board development: 1) Finding talent for boards, 2) Training boards, 3) Efficiency of boards.Ward notes the need to find the specific skills needed for the board. Finding high quality board talent is, to me, going to be increasingly difficult as the generational transition occurs. I have seen boards that have not aggressively chosen and trained new blood, and so they are not training the next generation of senior leaders in organizations. In so many boards, old \\"names\\" are recruited rather than skills. It is important that a thorough analysis of organizational needs be done prior to board recruiting, then the right match be made for the knowledge, not the family name.Training is an issue I have seen gain some attention in nonprofit boards, and I hope that trend continues. Ward provides good direction on creating the foundation for training directors. Training board directors never stops and I have found that some of the best training comes not from \\"presentation style\\" materials, but providing challenging technical and market issues to the board members and devoting time for real discussion in the board and subcommittee meetings. Ward hits the points well.That leads to efficiency. Ward notes techniques such as \\"consent agendas\\" as tools to move past the routine and into fuller dialogue for boards. I'd suggest lingering on Ward's list of \\"syndromes\\" on audit committees to stimulate your thinking about the ways that old methods can stifle progress. This list has applicability across board practices. Ward also notes techniques to handle nonproductive directors.This is a terrific introduction to board room work."},{"Title":"Saving the Corporate Board: Why Boards Fail and How to Fix Them","review":"When we hear about the scandals in companies like American Enron, Italian Parmalat and so on, we get a little bit of insight into what (also) happens around the mahogany roundtable in the obscure boardroom. We are witness to dictatorial executives, antiquated decision processes, incompetent amateurs, and sometimes even corrupt lawbreakers.Often the focus is on the catastrophic mistakes in management, auditing, and/or disclosures. But the sad truth is that many of these mistakes could have been found and fixed in the boards. The board's role is to supervise and govern. If the board does not have the resources themselves, they must make sure that an impartial third-party service provider does it.This book explores why corporate boards fail and also give ideas on how to fix them. The author reveals ten specific failings of the typical boardroom model and proven advice to get boards back on track. Some of the boardroom ills he diagnoses include:WEAK BOARD LEADERSHIPProblem: The board oversees (at the same time it is led by) the CEO. Too many boards accept that the CEO runs the board meetings - without being sufficiently challenged by the chairman or the others. In Europe, we divide the roles of the chairman and the CEO. But that doesn't mean that we don't have our share of scandals, since a strong CEO also can dictate solutions in practice by forcing rubberstamp decision processes in the boardroomSolution: Make some of the board meetings (or part of them) without the executive officers. Keep the meeting's chairman role and the CEO role separate.POOR DATA (and even worse delivery).Problem: Some boards receive too little or too much information - or just plain bad information.Solution: Too much data: Require a one-page-summary from the CEO summarizing the top three to five issues of the information pack. Too little data: Require more and better information before a decision is made.INCOMPETENT BOARD MEMBERSProblem: Inadequate time, resources, and expertise for the job.Solution: Better board member recruiting process as well as annual performance evaluation of individual board members.DIRECTOR ISOLATION: Don't-ask-don't-tell model.Problem: Outside board members are often amazingly out of touch with the staff, shareholders, and the firm for which they bear ultimate legal responsibility. This is a key weakness.Solution: Professional directors build their own informal networks with e.g. finance, investor relations, sales, marketing, production, or research. If the director then also talks to a few of the firm's external stakeholders such as shareholders, customers, and suppliers, then it will provide an even stronger background to base any board decisions.I have personally experienced board members who on their own have spent full days visiting head offices and production facilities and included individual talks with non-executive managers. It's very inspiring for the managers. It also gives the board member a much better feel for the views and competences of the broader management team.Management in corporations has over the last 50 years become more professional and universal due to formal education. However, governance of the same corporations is still stuck at the level of anecdotes and myths. This book helps to unveil many of the important issues of making corporate governance work in practice.Ralph Ward is the author of several fine books on improving corporate boards and publishes an online newsletter. You may want to check his (unsophisticated) website on www.BoardroomInsider.com.One of the best things of this book may be that Ward is letting many experienced board members comment on the issues and provide their advice for the reader. It makes the book much more extensive in scope and exciting to read.Having just started on being a board member myself, I already recognise many of the issues that this book raises. Having spent 15 years in businesses on preparing board material, I unfortunately also feel guilty of some of his very relevant points on (too much) information.Peter Leerskov,MSc in International Business (Marketing & Management) and Graduate Diploma in E-business"},{"Title":"A Magic Web: The Forest of Barro Colorado Island","review":"The pictures are really extrodinary and the text is very readable and understandable.

Mauriac is a craftsman and has a firm structure and progression in this book which will most likely go unnoticed because of his artistry.Mauriac, who won the Nobel Prize for literature, has given us here a universal, timeless tale of an old, dying man who wants to leave his inheritance to someone worthy. In the process of the story, which is presented as the man's journal, the images of many memorable characters are left in our minds, as well as the awe of perhaps the most beautiful conversion in literature.I would highly recommend this novel to anyone who can read French and who wants a lovely, profound read. This was the first literature I read in French, and it remains my favorite."},{"Title":"Le Noeud De Viperes","review":"Franois Mauriac was a profoundly Catholic novelist.

The story of a husband who treats his wife and family with utter disdain, verging on hatred; a man with a blackened heart, but for whom his impending death brings new insights and the possibility of redemption.It remains one of the greatest books I have ever read.If you prefer to read it in English, try:Vipers' Tangle (The Loyola Classics Series)"},{"Title":"Le Noeud De Viperes","review":"A love story that is more poignant because of the lack of any real &quot;romance&quot; and a lesson to all that ones tendency for egocentric scenario-building can be most self-destructive.

This is an attempt to get folks to avoid reading this book. I note that these people are not addressing some of the serious questions about the Mormon faith that are raised in this book. Any Christian, believing in the Jesus Christ of the Bible, who understands their own relationship with Christ, and can back their understanding of who Christ is Biblically, would have to consider some serious differences in who and what the LDS consider Christ. I do have friends who are LDS and they have backed many of the assertions of the authors that show distinct differences in a Christian ( Biblical) view of Christ and the LDS view. I know that the words may be painful for any LDS member to read, but consider the actual Mormon works cited and put the pieces together for yourself. When held against God's word (the Bible), many of them show falsehoods and inconsistancies.God bless and guide us."},{"Title":"What Do Mormons Really Believe?: What the Ads Don't Tell You","review":"I was raised in the LDS faith but chose a different path as an adult. I was taught to believe the Bible was not complete therefore we needed the other Mormon books to explain the word of God. This book actually helped me understand what I was told to believe vs. what the Bible teaches. For many years when I would read the Bible I would \\"interpret\\" it the way I was brought up vs. what it was teaching me. After reading this book, I was able to separate the two in a more distinct and complete way. I fully understand that when Mormons break away from the their church a large portion become atheist since they feel they have been lied to all their life. I was very lucky I had so many loving people surround me through the years with no pressure. This book has also assist me in explaining the differences when asked why I left the LDS teachings. Thank you for providing me with such a great tool."},{"Title":"What Do Mormons Really Believe?: What the Ads Don't Tell You","review":"I rarely take the time to write reviews, but this book was bad enough I felt obligated to warn the reading public. These authors have gone back to early mormon sources from the mid-1800s, some fairly obscure and others really obscure (Orson Pratt, for example) and written a fairly hateful (and often inaccurate) anti-mormon tract. Some of the book may be interesting in a historical sense, but unfortunately it doesn't correlate much with what mormons really believe. If you're interested in finding out what Mormons believe, I recommend \\"Latter Days: An Insider's Guide to Mormonism, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints\\" by Coke Newell--it's thorough and addresses a number of controversial topics (The Book of Mormon, polygamy, etc.)."},{"Title":"What Do Mormons Really Believe?: What the Ads Don't Tell You","review":"I do not think this gives a unbiased opinion of the true beliefs of the Mormons.

Historical background is a very important aspect in dertermining the validity of a faith.I would also like to respond to the reader from Baton Rouge, who wrote their review on August 15, 2002. To say that the historical background of the Mormon Church no longer reflects the beliefs currently held by the Church members today is to undermine the reliablitlity of its doctrine in the first place. A Church who's own past and founding principals is no longer reliable or in line with current belief should stop and take a look at how they got to where they are today. Unlike Mormonism, Christianity (not in any way affiliated with Mormonism) is consistent today with historical background and evidence, including medical, anthropological, and non-Christian history evidence.

You may be surprised."},{"Title":"What Do Mormons Really Believe?: What the Ads Don't Tell You","review":"Ankerberg and Weldon are a powerful, educated (at least 6 postgraduate degrees between the two of them) writing team with dozens of books to their credit.

The one star is only for the portion of historical content that was true. It is a shame that men in their positions of influence would publish fiction- that's more polite than saying lies. Like the Apostle Paul wrote- \\"professing themselves wise, they became fools\\". It is sad that many people will ultimately place their faith in the works of these 2 men, accrediting their \\"learned book knowledge\\", without ever researching their references and quoted scriptures for themselves. I found it contradictive that the primary thrust of this book was to attack that Joseph Smith was not a prophet based on setting forth that he may have made a prediction that has yet to be fulfilled. If that is true, Then we must also have to disclaim Isaiah, Daniel, Jeremiah, Saint John and many others (in fact all others making prophecies in eschatology) who have prophecies yet to be fulfilled. And then to pull Deuteronomy 18:20 as a sole hinge to supposedly prove that Joseph Smith wasn't a Prophet, because he was killed- allowed to be killed- martyred, (hmm like Jesus and the Apostles?) was pitiful. The verse itself that they set forth, in stating \\"THAT PROPHET SHALL DIE\\" presupposes that if this verse is applicable to Joseph at all, then HE WAS A PROPHET. I sincerely hope that readers will recognize the spirit of Christ is not one of contention as they see the apostle Paul's fulfillment of scripture as these 2 writers \\"Profess themselves wise, ..becoming fools.\\" My heart aches for those who will be mislead by it's message, which is easy to see thru if one will actually look under the guidance of the Holy Spirit for themselves at the issues. Their type statements and logic would teach me that Jesus actually did sin because he was rude to, and destroyed the possessions of, those in the Temple when he cleansed it. Yet we know there is more to the purpose and truth of that story. Even so, that is the type of surface scanning, attempt at objectivity taken in this book. I trashed it."},{"Title":"What Do Mormons Really Believe?: What the Ads Don't Tell You","review":"My review will be brief since a multitude of other reviewers dictated my thoughts about this book. I do give Weldon and Ankerberg the credit of doing a good job of research in this book. They analyze Mormon documents and appear to have a sophisticated knowledge of the Momron Church. However, my praise really stops there. The books makes several errors in its abstraction of evidence from out-of-context situations. Often the authors regard minute points in the Mormon faith far beyond their significance. They harp on points that really don't matter in the larger scheme. The result is that one must sort though a mess of writing before coming to a final conclusion. This makes the book very exacting to read. I suggest one reads something else before tackling the arcana these two authors invent."},{"Title":"What Do Mormons Really Believe?: What the Ads Don't Tell You","review":"I do not agree or believe in Mormonism myself, but this book is total and utter immaturity. It is like Jack Chick's badly-drawn anti-Catholic propaganda, only prettier looking.PEOPLE, LIVE AND LET LIVE. So WHAT if Mormons believe what they do? They can believe God is the Easter Bunny for all I care! As long as they aren't hurting anyone, what does it matter? If you all claim to be TRUE followers of Christ, then go and do what he commanded: be kind, loving, charitable and so forth.

I don't care how many degrees, doctorates or whatever these authors have, they are not LDS and are just trying to discredit the religion. I would suggest to any person who is searching for answers about the LDS religion to go to a member of that religion and ask.

The critical information included some interesting biographies/diaries of Dodgson (Carroll), as well as a few critical essays. I was disappointed in these because although they were mostly good, the editor clearly has some negative feelings about Dodgson's morals and included many unnecessary Freudian-finger-pointing passages. If I were younger or more impressionable, I'd have been left with a very negative view of Dodgson indeed! Because of these attempts at manipulating the readers' good opinions of Dodgson, I wish I had gotten The Annotated Alice instead."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"The Norton Critical Edition of Alice in Wonderland is the classic textbook of three of Lewis Carroll's most widely read works. The book contains authoritative texts of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Through the Looking Glass, and The Hunting of the Snark.Any one looking for a review of the two Alice books should see my review of The Annotated Alice, ed. Martin Gardner as I will limit my review to the additional material supplied by this edition.The Hunting of the Snark is presented in its entirety but without the classic Holliday illustrations. The poem is a masterwork of nonsense that would have been helped by adding the illustrations. After all, the edition leaves in the Tenniel illustrations to the Alice books. Snark is not the easiest poem to read and Donald Gray is somewhat sparse in his annotations.The remainder of the book is broken into two sections: Background and Literary Criticism. The Background section gives a fairly good portrait of C.L.Dodgson who became the nonsense writer Lewis Carroll. Included are selections from biographies, letters to friends and children and selections from the diaries. The annotations in this section are fairly extensive and helpful.The Essays in Criticism are the weakest section of the entire work. From my perspective they are dated and unnecessarily complex for the work at hand. Most of this section is made up of essays dealing with the Freudian analysis of the works. One may take this with a grain of salt. Everyone is entitled to there own opinion. The problem with this section is that the analysis seems to be somewhat dated. We have edited versions of the same tired Empson essay that was written in 1935. Perhaps the 3rd edition of this text will update the criticism and make this section more useful to the modern reader.This edition is worth having if you are a student of the Alice works or have a more than basic interest in Carroll/Dodgson and the development of Victorian Children's Literature. For a few dollars more I would highly recommend purchasing the Definitive Edition of the Annotated Alice instead.Recommended with reservations."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"I am very glad I was assigned this book for my Children's Literature class - I love discovering new things about classic stories and their authors. This edition shed new light on Lewis Carroll and his story telling. I thoroughly enjoyed it, more now that I am an adult than ever before."},{"Title":"Alice in Wonderland (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"This book is the Norton Critical Edition (Second Edition) of _Alice in Wonderland_ by Lewis Carroll, edited by Donald J. Gray, with the picture of the \\"Jabberwock\\" on the front. The Norton Critical Edition contains the following parts: a brief preface, the text of _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_, the text of _Through the Looking-Glass_, the excised \\"The Wasp in a Wig\\", the poem \\"The Hunting of the Snark: An Agony, in Eight Fits\\", background material from Carroll's early life, the Alice books, and later life (including letters of his), and several interesting essays in criticism. The Alice stories are some of the greatest classics of children's literature, but their bizarre nature and intriguing mathematical, philosophical, and theological speculations make them interesting for adults and thinkers as well. Many have tried to psycho-analyze the stories (using absurd antiquated Freudian methods), but I agree with G. K. Chesterton that to do such is to destroy the stories. These stories exist in the fine tradition of the Victorian fairy tale (which emphasizes what has been called the \\"Victorian cult of the child\\"), and despite modern difficulties, they remain an important contribution to children's literature. Among other things it has been suggested that the stories include elements that resemble drug use and that Carroll was a precursor to Einstein in his understanding of the relativity of size and shape, but despite these understandings the stories remain unique for their captivating power and intriguing as stories themselves. Lewis Carroll was the pen name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832-1898) who was perhaps best known in his time as a logician and tutor in logic and mathematics. Dodgson did quite well in mathematics as a youth (as he did in nearly all his subjects, but particularly in mathematics) and continued his studies at Oxford. Originally Dodgson had promised to become an Anglican clergyman upon completion of his studies, but he never fully completed his ordination. Instead he served as a lecturer in mathematics and logic, writing several interesting books in logic for popular audiences at the time (though he could not have foreseen more recent developments in logic, such as the work of Russell and Whitehead in the _Principia Mathematica_). Dodgson also served as a tutor to children (and he developed a particular fondness for children, particularly young girls, that many would come to criticize later). As a tutor Dodgson met the girl Alice Liddell, who served as the inspiration for the Alice stories. It is rumored that Dodgson may have fallen in love with her, which led to some difficulty. Dodgson's philosophical, religious, and social views were notoriously conservative and conventional, though it seems that he incorporated many unconventional ideas into his stories. In his old age, Dodgson remained a bachelor, though he increasingly involved himself in amateur photography (some of which proved particularly risqu&eacute; and has led to subsequent rumors about Dodgson). Today, what Dodgson remains most famous for are his stories for children. Within his stories interesting mathematical, philosophical, and theological issues are raised; among them, the issue of the meaning of words and language (Dodgson's writings and poems have been called \\"nonsense\\" and he frequently makes use of \\"nonsense words\\" of his own invention) calling to mind the later philosophy of Wittgenstein, various theological issues, the philosophical issue of the dream-like nature of reality, the issue of birth, adolescence, sexual development, and life and death, the issue of Darwinian evolutionism, and various mathematical and logical issues, as well as interesting puzzles. The essays included with this volume bring up some of these issues and provide interesting points about the stories.The works of Lewis Carroll included in this volume are as follows:_Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_ (1897 edition) - a rewrite of the original _Alice's Adventures Under Ground_ and beautifully illustrated. This is the story of Alice (based on Dodgson's student Alice Liddell) as she encounters a talking White Rabbit, travels down a rabbit-hole, and there encounters many bizarre happenings and various talking creatures. The story has an eerie drug-induced feel to it (which causes one to question the very basis of reality) and many have speculated that this story may include instances of drug use. In particular, while in \\"Wonderland\\", Alice eats various foods and drinks various potions which cause her to grow taller or shorter. In \\"Wonderland\\", Alice encounters the rabbit, a talking mouse (who she reminds of her cat Dinah and provokes him thus), various birds and animals (in which they have a \\"caucus race\\", perhaps calling to mind the \\"Caucasian race\\" and various racialist theories of the time which Dodgson disapproved of), a lizard named Bill, and a puppy. After this, however, Alice encounters a caterpillar sitting on a mushroom. The caterpillar is smoking from a \\"hookah\\" (perhaps a reference to drug paraphernalia) and invites Alice to take a bite from the mushroom. Upon taking the bite from the mushroom, Alice undergoes radical changes in height. Some have regarded these alterations to be reminiscent of the hallucinations that occur upon ingestion of certain mushrooms, such as the Amanita muscaria. Alice also encounters the Duchess and her baby (a pig), the Cheshire cat (who fades away leaving only his grin), the Madhatter (mad no doubt from mercury poisoning), the March Hare, and the Dormouse having tea, and then she encounters the Queen of Hearts playing croquet as well as the \\"mock turtle\\". Finally, a trial occurs in which the Knave of Hearts is accused of stealing the tarts from the Queen of Hearts. At this trial, Alice must testify and present her evidence. At the end, Alice awakes from her dream after realizing that the Queen and the King are nothing but a pack of cards._Through the Looking-Glass_ (1897 edition) - This story begins with Alice reflecting on her cats and a game of chess. Indeed, the entire story involves a set-up on the chess board in which Alice herself is to eventually become queen. Alice enters a mysterious world (\\"Wonderland\\" again no doubt) through the looking-glass and there encounters various creatures. This is of course the story where the infamous nonsense poem \\"Jabberwocky\\" appears. Alice encounters various talking flowers, various insects, two brothers Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty (an egg), and the lion and the unicorn. Alice also encounters the red and white queens and eventually is to become queen herself. During the course of the story the secret meaning of certain words in \\"Jabberwocky\\" are revealed to Alice. At the end, Alice is at a feast when she suddenly shakes the red queen who becomes a kitten. Alice awakes to conclude that it was \\"all a dream\\", though the issue of reality is raised again.\\"The Wasp in a Wig\\" is a short scene left out of the original _Through the Looking-Glass_.Also included is the poem, \\"The Hunting of the Snark\\" (1876), which is a nonsense poem about a group of men on a ship who are hunting a \\"snark\\".This Norton Critical Edition is an excellent edition of Lewis Carroll's children stories and poems. Carroll's stories are to live on due to their uniqueness and their bizarre nature.

I have been pleased, and find that overall it is a good series to teach from. THE GOOD: Each chapter in New Interchange has a good variety of skills to learn and practice. Students are constantly engaged in reading, writing, listening, speaking, learning new vocabulary and practicing new grammar rules. The content isn't too heavy, and the book makes good use of color and white space so as not to overwhelm the student. I find that the structure of each chapter is constant and reliable so that the students become used to how things are done. The tapes and Teacher's Guide are invaluable! The workbook provides additional practice of concepts that the students have just learned in the student book. All of these resources combine to make it incredibly easy for me (as a teacher) to prepare and give good lessons. THE BAD: I have found that my students are often confused with the grammar exercises. What may seem like clear-cut explanations to a native English speaker obviously aren't that clear to the learners. I am also a little saddened by the fact that each chapter really doesn't go into great depth for any one skill or theme. Each skill is presented, learned and practiced in what sometimes feels like a rushed manner. I have also found it difficult to present an entire chapter in two one-and-a-half hour sessions, as the authors suggest. OVERALL: A good series with lots of skills practice. It is very useful for learners who want to study a variety of general English skills.

The editor's Introduction addressessuch potential impediments for the Aristotelean neophyte and amplifiesproblematic issues of interest to philosophers of any acquaintance. Aristotle'ssubject is a general &quot;principle of life&quot; intrinsic to all plants and animals,not any contemporary notion about the soul (psyche) suggested by its Englishtitle, On The Soul. Aristotle's soul includes his psychology and topics suchas sensation and thought. Lawson-Tancred argues that Aristotle is indifferentto the issue preoccupying epistomologists and psychologists during recentcenturies, Descartes's division of subjectivity into the body and mind. He claimsthat Aristotle is concerned with general features of life, not with purely humanissues like consciousness. In discounting consciousness, Aristotle concurs withanti-Cartesian positivists, but Lawson-Tancred argues that when Aristotlesays the soul is substance, he really means it, contradicting physicalistcontentions that it is an epiphenomenon or a list of special attributes.Aristotle's soul is substance, but Aristotle rejects reducing the soul'sproperties to the body's material.Teleology is explanation implicating final causes, e.g., things fulfillpurposes for which they were created. Scientists reject creation andultimate purpose, and censure Aristotle for his teleological explanations.Regarding the soul, however, Aristotle suggests that to understand biologicalphenomena, the arrangement of material and its relationship to functions itperforms is key. Recent rethinking about Aristotle's functionalism hasreinvigorated his status in modern biology. Theologians generally view Aristotle'swork favorably, especially his emphasis on built-in purpose and final causes.Lawson-Tancred recounts Aristotle's powerful influence on intellectual historyfrom his immediate successors, to assimilation in the neo-Platonic West, throughincorporation by Islamic and Christian theologians, connections that madeDe Anima so important for over 2000 years.Lawson-Tancred also discusses Aristotle's personal history and intellectualdevelopment; his mentor, Plato, and their mutual influence; ideas ofother philosophers that Aristotle encountered, and De Anima in contextof his other works. He concludes by criticizing the interpretations ofAristotle by the philosophers Brentano and Wilkes. Lawson-Tancred helpsthe reader to understand many ideas, but two essential concepts Aristotledeveloped elsewhere are prerequisite to understanding De Anima:entelechy (entelecheia) and substance (ousia). Substance or essence is thefundamental reality of existence. Form, Matter, and their compositeare types of substances. Matter is the inanimate, elemental substrate ofwhich things are composed, e.g., earth made into a statue. Form is thestructure and function outlined by a formula (logos), e.g., a statue artfullyshaped to resemble a woman. Things exist either in actuality (puttingto use) or potentiality (unexploited capacity). Form is actuality;Matter is potentiality. Aristotle's theory is that Form combines withMatter following the the Form's plan to actualize potential. Entelechyis the possession of this intrinsic goal that is realized when Form andMatter combine. Thus, Aristotle's teleological approach is called &quot;Entelechism.&quot;Aristotle uses entelechy repeatedly to describe the soul, as the followingsummary of De Anima shows.In Book I, Aristotle describes his subject: the soul, &quot;the firstprinciple of living things,&quot; and considers its relation to intellect,emotion, etc. He comments on other philosophers's works: whetherthe soul is material, and what kind; its characteristic features(it moves, senses, and lacks body); how it produces bodily movement;etc. He criticizes theories that the soul is quantity or harmony orparticipates in the whole universe. He concludes that the soul lacksmotion and is not material nor made of elements. Instead, the soulcomprises several faculties: e.g., cognition, appetite.Book II begins with an important formulation: the soul is the &quot;form ofthe living body which potentially has life&quot; (the organism's first actuality).Having a soul distinguishes living from inanimate objects. The soul'snutritive faculty is essential for all organisms, but animals have thefaculty of sensation, separating them from plants. Thus begins a hierarchyof faculties from nutrition to intellect. In sensation, the sense organand sense-object, like the soul and body, participate in the Form/Matterrelationship. The sense organ receives the object's Form, not its matter,in Aristotle's words, &quot;as the wax takes the sign from the ring without theiron and gold.&quot; He discusses each of the five senses, and makes a famousdistinction among perceptual elements (special, common, incidental).Aristotle concludes discussing sensation in Book III by proposing functionsof the perceptive faculty that integrate individual senses. Imagination,a faculty producing imagery, mediates between sensation and intellect.Aristotle's remarks about intellect are among his most renowned, fecund,and difficult. He describes the intellectual faculty, which includes thinkingand supposition, with the same physiological approach of his sensory theory.The organ of thought receives the Form of the thought-object to realize thinking.He calls the intellect a repository of Forms and distinguishes the active fromthe passive intellect, providing inspiration for Thomas Aquinas's psychology.Aristotle concludes with a discussion of motivation, i.e., what puts theorganism into action.No other work contains a psychological theory like that presented in De Anima,excepting Aquinas's derivative. Its resemblance to attribute (behaviorist)theories of the mind cannot obscure Aristotle's radically different foundation.His Form-Matter and Actuality-Potentiality concepts are not explanatory, onlya framework for inquiry. Its relevance, as Lawson-Tancred notes, to modernpsychology depends upon identifying an empirical approach to Aristotle's Form.Aristotle's proposal that life has, or is, a principle provides an alternativepoint of departure for scientists who find contemporary materialist dogma lackingdirection. De Anima, one of the most important books ever written, and longneglected by scientific psychology, still puts life in an eternal debate."},{"Title":"De Anima (Penguin Classics)","review":"This book is something that everyone who is interested in truth and beauty should read.

Hopefully it is reprinted. Here is Watts' summary of this book (from p. 41-2):Chapters I and II,'The Primordial Pair' and 'The Cosmic Dance,' are based on Chinese and Indian sources, on Taoist, Buddhist, and Hindu myths and images in which the principle of polarity, of the inner unity of opposites, is explicitly recognized. I begin with these, not only to clarify the principle, but also to see what will happen if we take it as a hidden background for myths which do not appear to recognize it at all.Chapter III, 'The Two Brothers,' introduces us to myths - mostly from the Middle East - having to do with the conflict of good and evil, light and darkness. The fact that the pair, e.g., Horus and Set, Ohrmazd and Ahriman, are BROTHERS intimates that there is still some recognition of the basic unity of the opposed forces. But, in general, as we move Westward from the Indus basin, the common ground between the two drops out of sight, and the conflict begins to be a struggle to the death, fought in absolute seriousness.Chapter IV, 'Ultimate Dualism,' follows the disappearance of this inner unity to its extreme: the Christian mythology of Satan and of the Hell of everlasting damnation. We see that this ABSOLUTE separation of good from evil renders our choice between the two an ultimately perilious adventure. While this enriches life with an earnestness and momentousness hitherto unknown, it deprives the Divinity of all humour and playfulness. However, we see that the positive values of the contest between God and Satan are preserved, and the total insanity of ultimate dualism avoided, by the assumption of a 'hidden conspiracy' between the two to conceal their unity. This is related to the Hindu concept of Maya - the dramatic self-deception whereby the One plays at being the Many, and the Godhead lets itself be forgotten in pretending to be each individual being.Chapter V, 'Dismemberment Remembered,' brings us back - through the separation of opposites - to their eternally implicit union. There are myths of the creation of the world through the cutting up of some primordial being, of its division into heaven and earth, into the multiplicity of things, of into the two sexes - from which follows the generation of offspring. Thus many mythologies envisage the goal of life as the 'rememberment' of this original 'dismemberment.' The human ideal becomes, then, the hermaphroditic or androgynous sage or 'divine man,' whose consciousness transcends the opposites and who, therefore, knows himself to be one with the cosmos. We conclude with visions of the universe seen from this point of view.:-)Bao Pu"},{"Title":"The Two hands of God","review":"_Two Hands of God_ is an overall superior work by Alan Watts, and is instumental in understanding obscure Eastern-religious myth. Anyone who is interested in the mythical studies of authors such as Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell should check out this little-known and vastly underrated book. It is a very valuble contribution to our understanding of primitive and not-so-primitive myth. You will be amazed to see the parallels between modern psychology and ancient ritual. This book can also help us appreciate the profound significance and sophistication of mythology and ritual outside of the Christian world - it may help to break down some of our bias and superiority complexes.

First, it is very rare and unique--a must for comic collectors and afficiandos. Second, it is a prime example of Nixon propaganda. Third, but most important, it was illustrated by the great Geo Wildman!Wildman, a lifelong resident of Connecticut, studied advertising at what is now the Paire College of Art. During the 1950s, he was a successful commercial artist, first working for an ad agency, and then becoming a freelance artist. During this time, he began producing freelance comic book art for Charlton Press in Derby, Connecticut.When King Comics ceased publication of their POPEYE title, Charlton acquired the rights. Longtime writer-artist Bud Sagendorf was busy with the daily and Sunday newspaper comics, and declined the job of continuing. George Wildman was offered a contract to produce the POPEYE illustrations, with prolific Joe Gill writing scripts. The first Charlton issue of POPEYE appears in 1969, the final one in 1977. Wildman was hired as assistant editor to Sal Gentile, and in 1971 was promoted to managing editor, and eventually executive editor. Assistant editor Nicola Cuti wrote several of the later POPEYE scripts for Charlton.Wildman's tenure as editor continued through 1985, while Western Publishing picked up POPEYE under their Gold Key and/or Whitman trademarks. Bill Pearson, by then assistant editor at Charlton, began writing scripts, and Wildman produced illustrations while off-duty from Charlton. Their crowning achievement was the epic 50th anniversary special published in 1979.Thanks to the Robert Altman POPEYE movie, a demand for Popeye-related merchandise led to Wildman's working for Random House, illustrating a classic \\"Pop-Up Book\\" which became a best-seller and later a display at the Smithsonian Institution. Wildman was also invited to produce a painted wooden Easter egg for the White House Easter event, his egg also now housed in the Smithsonian. Around this time, the National Cartoonists Society awarded him \\"Best Cartoonist, Humor Division.\\"Western Publishing ceased its comics line in the early 1980s, and Wildman retired from Charlton Comics in 1985, moving into a freelance comic book and children's book illustration career. His pencils, inks and paints graced publications featuring Disney, Hanna-Barbara, Harvey and Warner Brothers characters along with countless designs for various businesses.In 1994, George and wife Trudy Wildman were honored in a gala festival in Chester, Illinois, celebrating the 100th birthday of the creator of Popeye, Elzie Crisler Segar. Wildman received the Popeye Fan Club's Lifetime Achievement Award and performed a sketching show to a standing-room-only crowd. A return visit to Chester in 2004, to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Popeye, found Wildman teamed with Hy Eisman, the writer-artist of the Sunday POPEYE newspaper strip since 1994.Today, Wildman and son Karl operate their own advertising agency, producing computer animation, greeting cards, and a wide variety of products. Wildman's work is seen regularly in the \\"Hidden Pictures\\" publications of HIGHLIGHTS FOR CHILDREN. He celebrated his 80th birthday in 2007 and continues to receive mail from Popeye fans around the world."},{"Title":"The struggle of the soul (The Smyth lectures)","review":"An excerpt read in this book over 30 years ago became my purpose for living (paraphrased);\\" Life is not just a saga or a meaningless treadmill, life is pilgrimage, the destination is the Holy City; the purpose of the pilgrimage is to seek God, find God and then get to know Him.\\""},{"Title":"An illustrated history of toys (Abbey library)","review":"There are a couple of things to note concerning this work before I begin the review.

(Note: I am not a big fan of \\"coffee table\\" books but this one is a bit different in that the text is not all \\"interesting fluff\\" and has been done in an interesting, although scholarly manner).For those interested in toys, German toys, history, art (The toy makers of that time and place must be considered artists my any definition), or simply the lives of people, this book was made for you. It is an absolute delight! The book is broadly divided into two parts: The first deals with German toy manufacturing in its historical context, with a very detailed analysis of the development and manufacturing of toys from the earliest handmade ones to the highly technical techniques used at a later date. The second part addresses the instructional use of toys and their function, from toddlers to older children...including the wonderful puppet theatres and toy soldiers.There are literally hundreds of black and white drawings charmingly created in the form and mode of old wood cuts...quite detailed and full of whimsy. This is supplemented by over 104 beautifully done color plates, photographs for the most part, but some paintings. Again, the detail of each piece is stunning (even more so when you consider that he printing and photographic technology in the early 1960s is no where near what it is today). All plates and notes are very well cross-referenced in the text which makes the entire experience quite nice and educational.It is interesting to note that so very many of the toys featured here are replicas of \\"adult stuff.\\" Fantasy, which we of often see in today's toys is quite missing in most cases. The toys are functional and reflect what the child actually sees around them...only in miniature. I fear you will find nothing is this book that lights-up, goes beep, or explodes, destroying entire galaxies or slicing and dicing and opponent in mortal combat...how refreshing!Not only is this work simply fun to read through, it is one of the most informative books on the subject I have in my library. If you are interested in such things, and can find a copy of this work (I found mine buried at the bottom of a stack of books in a used book story), then you need a copy of this one.I like toys; liked them as a kid and as I sink further into my dotage, I find I like them more and more...yet again.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Gardening All Year Round: A Comprehensive Guide to Planting, Growing, and Maintaining Your Garden","review":"Unfortunately am unable to review this book as it was never received, initial dissapointment with alabris was later lessened however after successfully chasing up a full refund on the orderded book........."},{"Title":"Gardening All Year Round: A Comprehensive Guide to Planting, Growing, and Maintaining Your Garden","review":"Unfortunately am unable to review this book as it was never received, initial dissapointment with alabris was later lessened however after successfully chasing up a full refund on the orderded book........."},{"Title":"Buddhism","review":"Although the cover of this book merely has the name \\"Buddhism,\\" it is, in fact a photographic reproduction by its original publisher, Philosophical Library, of Conze's widely-popular \\"Buddhism: Its Essence and Development\\" (1951), and is not to be confused with \\"Buddhism: A Short History\\"(1980), also attributed to Conze.[This review is from: Buddhism: Its Essence and Development (Paperback)]Although Edward Conze (1904-1979) was an interesting eccentric (check bio in Google), he was also unquestionably a great scholar of Buddhism. Still, readers may wonder why I give this book a 5-star rating. Although its explanations can be very clear, they can also be very dense; and no pictures - what would Alice think of that?Conze had a cranky disposition, often reflected in his writing. Sometimes it seems that he deliberately chooses the abrasive word -- \\"trance\\" for samadhi (J., sanmai, jo), or \\"self-extinction\\" for anatman (J., muga) -- when a more palatable alternative would suffice. In today's sound-bite world the appearance of such words only confirm the misapprehension of Buddhism as some kind of nihilistic \\"mysticism\\" which denies \\"the individual.\\"I stumbled on this book a half-century ago and pencilled comments throughout my copy testify to the impact it made on me. (Fortunately, this was before the advent of the awful-yellow-ink-felt-pen, so the pencilling can easily be removed.) In particular, it introduced me to the concept of the Mahayana Bodhisattva as a being defined by the CONTRADICTORY virtues of wisdom and compassion, and then to the prevalent use of METAPHOR in Buddhist religious language, which led to T.R.V. Murti's Central Philosophy of Buddhism, the Chinese \\"Ten Oxherding Pictures,\\" and The Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch [of Ch'an, Zen], Hui Neng (Eno, 638-713)]. \\". . . Since Buddha is made by your own nature, do not look for him outside your own body. If you are deluded in your own nature, Buddha is then a sentient being; if you are awakened in your own nature, sentient beings are then Buddhas. Compassion is Avalokitesvara [Kannon]; joyfully giving is Mahasthamaprapta [Seishi]. . . \\". Yampolsky, p. 158. It all fits together.Conze: \\"(The Diamond Sutra states:) \\"Here. O Subhuti, a Bodhisattva should think thus : \\"As many beings as there are in the universe of beings. . .as far as any conceivable universe of beings is conceived; all these should be led by me into Nirvana, into that realm of Nirvana which leaves nothing behind. And yet, although innumerable beings have thus been led to Nirvana, no being at all has been led to Nirvana. And why? If in a Bodhisattva the perception of a \`being' should take place, he would not be called an \`enlightenment being' (=bodhi sattva).\\"\\"A Bodhisattva is a being compounded of the two contradictory forces of wisdom and compassion. In his wisdom, he sees no persons; in his compassion he is resolved to save them. His ability to combine these contradictory attitudes is the source of his greatness, and his ability to save himself and others.\\" (p. 130)The Buddhism of Faith conceived of Bodhisattvas, embodiments of the virtues of windom and compassion, as concrete individuals, and furnished them with names, legends, and a definite tangible individuality. \\"Akshobhya and Amitabha [Amida], Avalokitesvara (Kuan-yin, Kannon] and Manjusri [Monju], all the celestial Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of this school are, however, obviously productions of the mind, and without historical or factual basis. It is not easy to understand that the Mahayanists could admit this, as they did, and yet deny that these new saviours were mere creatures, nay figments, of the imagination, subjective and arbitrary inventions. It is impossible to explain their attitude by the absence of an historical sense generally found among Hindus, since we know that the Indian Buddhists of the Hinayana used to argue that they could not believe in the celestial Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the Mahayana because there was no evidence of their actual existence.\\". . . in religion, one type of mind requires an actual historical fact to base its belief on, while another regards the productions of the creative mythological imagination as in no way inferior to the products of human history. . . The mythological school regards the mythological concept as the essential thing. Whether it is embodied, or not, in a person in history appears as a quite incidental and trivial detail. The names of Amitabha, etc., may be invented, but the reality behind them, the Absolute, is there all the time.\\" (pp.150-151)\\". . . The Tantrists agree, however, with the metaphysical assumptions of the Prajnaparamita, according to which only the reality of emptiness is fully real, whereas any kind of multiplicity would be ultimately unreal, and the fictitious product of our diseased imagination. The multiplicity of Gods would be really nothing but a fiction of the imagination, and not one of those deities would be really there. Our free thinking modern mind would whole heartedly agree with that postulate. There is, however, the important difference that, according to our modern assumptions, the multiplicity of things around us is real and the deities a less real fabrication due to the disappointments of our instinctual life when confronted with the hard facts of everyday \`reality'. According to the Tantra, things and Gods alike are equally unreal compared with the one vast emptiness, but on the whole the data of mythology represent a kind of fiction far more worthwhile than the data of our everyday practical experience, and when properly handled, can greatly assist us in winning emancipation from the fetters of existence.\\" (pp. 184 185).Does this speak to you? If so, maybe Conze is worth a second look."},{"Title":"Contextual Communication Organization & Training","review":"Contextual Communication Organization &amp; Training, by Diane M. Hoffmann Ph.D., C.N.C., is one of those rare publications that tackles a difficult subject with straight-forward recommendations which can be implemented immediately and show results that make a difference to the bottom line of a company. Not only this, but the principals revealed in the book are also equally relavent to everyday life, outside of the workplace. How many of us have been in a meeting where we try to put what we believe to be a valuable opinion on the table just to find out nobody is listening? This is the first book which I have read on communication that spends as much time on listening skills as it does on sending a message. It also links communication to the context in which it is being sent and received. This to me was &quot;the missing link&quot; as the book is subtitled.I agree that whatever we do in life should be viewed within its' context and that, demonstrates the effectiveness of communcation. For instance, when a person appears to communicate with you in an unusual or unfair manner, one must look at the context in which the message is being given rather than immediately reacting simply to the words being spoken.Diane Hoffman deals with this complicated subject by firstly looking at the organization, then communication itself and finally, after the key principals have been revealed, details training methods to become a better communicator. That simnply meens as both the person delivering the message and the person receiving it. Well done Diane!"},{"Title":"Contextual Communication Organization & Training","review":"This book deals with hot and powerful, sometimes provocative topics not usually tackled in management books. For instance, has &quot;accountability&quot; bestowed upon subordinates become a substitute for &quot;responsibility&quot; expected of managers in some companies? Are we ready and able to treat the newly evolved &quot;bottom management&quot; as managers? With all the talk about the shortage of talented people, are we capable of recognizing those already in our midst? Can we turn the old organization chart octopus into a new organization chart dynamism? Are costly and time-consuming seminars the only way to train people? The book innovatively compares communication between people to the biopsychological activities going on inside our bodies. It offers tools-within-the-tools to help us in our communication and shows the contextual missing link in all of the above."},{"Title":"Dark Canyon (THE COLLECTOR'S EDITION)","review":"Hey folks, here's another classic L'Amour.

I place this book along side the best Louis L'Amour wrote. That includes HONDO, SHALAKO, and among others, HIGH LONESOME.This one can be read in just a few hours, at one sitting. But that doesn't detract one iota from the excellence of this western.This 1963 western has the canyonlands of Southeastern Utah as it locale. Situated in the Robbers Roost area of the Colorado River. A very rough and isolated area reaching 3,000 feet, in some places. An area I'm sure Mr. L'Amour from experience knew only too well.I seldom like dealing with plots, because I don't want someone spoiling the beginning, middle, or ending for me. The plot is very plausible, however, for in the west many men who started against the law, eventually rode for the law, becoming good citizens. One of the interesting facts of this book which I had forgotten, is the appearance of Tell Sackett. And I recall from another L'Amour book, Emily Sackett stating the Sacketts were always to ride with the law, never against it. So, if Tell Sackett sides 'Lord' Riley, the main character, you know, as Louis would say, Riley is one to ride the river with.If you have never read much Louis L'Amour this one is an excellent one to launch your reading. If you are a seasoned reader you will still find several hours enjoyment with this classic western.

So with some time over Thanksgiving vacation, and in much need of an easy, entertaining read, I picked up Louis L'Amour's Dark Canyon. And it served its purpose relatively well. It definitely started out with intrigue; the characters, plot, and setting were set up well. I really like how L'Amour gives some good description of the events and set up. He also places each character carefully, leading up into what you can only assume will be an interesting showdown. All of that was handled very well, but L'Amour first loses his grip when he clumsily introduces the romantic interest, and then continues to fumble the playing out of his excellent set up. While I will accept the romance as a given in his novels, I felt that he gave no credibility to the romantic relationship. And then the interesting events he had masterfully set up tended to trail off, fizzle, and wrap up in a generally dissatisfying finale. I think the romantic interest was included for the sake of storytelling, but he was never able to make it fit as he did the other formulaic characters and setting.

Despite the hardships of life that cause delusions in love and innocence, the world remains a thing to celebrate and love, down to mere fungus and mold. Schwartz draws on the forces and creatures of the world around her to create a powerful collection of poems that tell of love, loss, life cycles, death, and the power of music. She presents these forces in her uses of imagery and metaphor, both of which astounded this newfound fan in their originality and detail. For example, her poem \\"Sex\\" reminds the reader of the metaphysical conceits of John Donne, who fascinates us with images of a teardrop that drowns the world and eyes of lovers connected by a necklace. In \\"Sex,\\" Schwartz compares the sexual act (through the climax) to \\"the church of pleasure and sorrow\\" as sex enjoys itself for itself only and is surrounded by broken glass (8).One of Schwartz's recurring motifs deals with the power of music. Music endures despite the depressions caused by life. Through music, we \\"seek and find,\\" according to Schwartz (57). Perhaps we find something to believe in; perhaps it's something to love. Maybe it is a reason to live or an understanding of humanity's past. In any case, music becomes a metaphor for life as it endures despite heartache and a metaphor for poetry, which is, after all, music in itself. For thousands of years-from Homer to the present-music lives on as a form of expression of life: who we are, where we've been, and where we're going. In words profound in themselves, Schwartz teaches us, \\"The music swallows us/...[it] is the making of love\\" (54).Throughout the collection, the author/persona appears to be on a search for self- discovery. In observing the world around us, we discover beauty and come closer to grasping the origins of life. While we cannot readily study our own body cells, we can examine the properties of leaves and learn about our own lives. For Schwartz, the world is a powerful, organic, positive place full of connections among people and nature despite the negative experiences and influences that, according to William Blake, cause our fall from our pure psyche, our innocence. This message is best conveyed in \\"Tangerine,\\" which tells of a flower that evolved from a fragrant, \\"innocent\\" piece of creation to a swollen plant with sour seeds, \\"each one bitter, as we are, and filled with possibility\\" (23). Life exists as it does without prejudice, bringing pain and joy indiscriminately, and while we suffer from our fall from innocence, we find sources of hope and rejuvenation. Even death inevitably serves to propagate more life.As Schwartz herself recognizes, the story does not end on page 67 of Dear Good Naked Morning. It is hard to tell where we are going to end up or where the story will end. All we can do is face life head on-the good and the bad-and come to terms with it. Will love be possible? Will the badness only continue? Perhaps if we take Schwartz's life lessons to heart, we understand that life is beautiful, for the beautiful can come out of the dead, the degraded, and the damned."},{"Title":"Dear Good Naked Morning","review":"These poems pay tribute to a world that is flawed, defies understanding, and the struggle to somehow make sense of \\"...the world in all its gorgeous indifference.\\" In poem after poem the author laments the sorrow inherent in the world and just when you think there is no hope she reminds us \\"What does it matter if, after all, we don't get what we think we want? Aren't we alive in the yearning, in the appetite?\\" Schwartz writes in a readable, thoughtful, honest manner that spotlights the struggle of one who is haunted by the indifference of the world and yet has hope because \\"The end of the story has not been written yet.\\" Autumn House is a small press that publishes extraordinary poets that are worthy of the readers attention. This is such a book."},{"Title":"Julia Ward Howe 1819-1910 - 2 Volumes","review":"\\"Julia Ward Howe 1819 - 1910\\" by Laura Richards and Maud Howe Elliott is a biography of a woman who was in many ways the moral cornerstone of the United States throughout her life. She was a poet, and a social activist fighting for the abolitionist cause, and later for the cause of the Greeks and Armenians in their fight for freedom and survival against the Turks.The edition of the biography which I am reviewing is the two volume set published in March of 1916 by the Houghton Mifflin Company. Volume I is a seventeen chapter 392 page volume which covers her entire life. The focus of this volume are the major events in her life, starting with her ancestry as the great-granddaughter of Samuel Ward who was the Governor of Rhode Island and a delegate to the Continental Congress. On her maternal side, she was the granddaughter of Sarah Mitchell Cutler, who was a niece of Francis Marion (a.k.a. the \\"Swamp Fox\\") who was a lieutenant colonel in the continental army. The book then has chapters on her childhood, early adulthood, her writing, the Civil War, her travels, and her support for causes such as \\"The Peace Crusade\\" and woman's rights.Volume II includes 15 chapters and an Index for both volumes, and is a total of 434 pages. This volume covers her life from the age of 58 through the end of her life in a much more personal way than the first volume. It draws a tremendous amount of material from her personal journals and letters, while the first volume uses a more diverse collection of sources. Each chapter in both volumes starts with one of her poems as a header.While one gets many of her poems included in these volumes, it is surprising that the only copy of the \\"Battle Hymn of the Republic\\" included is a fold-out copy (in volume one) of her hand-written first draft. I would have appreciated it if an easier to read printing of the hymn had been included as well. Of course, it is not that difficult to find the words to the \\"Battle Hymn of the Republic\\", but it certainly would have been preferable to me to have them included in one of these two volumes.Laura Richards and Maud Howe Elliott were the two youngest daughters of Julia Ward Howe and Samuel Gridley Howe, and assisted by Florence Howe Hall, another of Julia's daughters. They were able to make this biography feel much more personal as a result of writing about someone who they knew so well. It is not surprising that this biography was the first winner of the Pulitzer Prize for biographies in 1917."},{"Title":"Wellington's Peninsula Regiments (1): The Irish (Men-at-Arms)","review":"Hey it does not get any better than this!

In fact, this was the volume that introduced me to the forgotten world of popular 19th century lithographed prints when I experienced a strange sense of deja vu while flipping through it. That is what is revealed here- a forgotten world of America as she saw herself between the years of 1835 and 1907. These prints were sold for as little as six cents apiece when they were first published. They enabled the average man to bring artwork into his home and life at a price that he could afford. Indeed, these prints were the ubiquitous backdrop to the 19th century, since they could be found adorning the walls of barrooms, barbershops, firehouses, and hotels, as well as the homes of rich and poor alike.The book starts with a good concise history of the firm and it's founders, as well as, a brief description of the lithography process itself. Next, brief biographies are included of the principle artists (when the book was first published the author had actually known some of them in their later years.) Then there is a section of brief descriptions of the prints on the included plates indexed by number. There are 192 plates; each containing between one and four reduced sized reproductions of the original prints. Approximately one in five plates are reproduced in the rich, full color of the originals.The subject matter included in this selection is very representative of the firm's output and includes: landscape views, political cartoons and banners, portraits, historical prints, moral and religious prints, prints for children, country and pioneer home scenes, humor, sheet music, Mississippi river prints, railroad prints, horse prints, sporting events, and ship prints. Yet even this is only a small sampling of Currier and Ive's output since they claimed to have produced on average three new prints a week for over fifty years. Unfortunately the company itself did not maintain the most complete record of its own production- unknown prints still turn up to this day."},{"Title":"Currier & Ives: Printmakers to the American People","review":"This was a book I enjoyed looking at on a table at church, and out of curiosity thought to check on-line to see if I could get it.

THE ALISON RULES is a more serious book, and because of that it starts off a little slowly. But after a while, it begins to pick up, and I couldn't put the book down.THE ALISON RULES is about high school sophomore Alison and her best friend Laurie. Not long ago, Alison's mother died, and she's having a heck of a time coping. Laurie's the funny, outgoing, playful one - and she tries to get Alison to cope, but she's not overly pushy. Alison is more introverted and quiet, and she thinks that just avoiding everything that reminds her of her mom will make her pain go away.Halfway through the school year Patrick Kirk (or Patrick Kirkpatrick, as Laurie calls him) transferrs into their geometry class. The two girls befriend him, and also start to fall for him.On a class trip to Boston, Laurie tells Patrick how Alison's mom died (this is how the reader finds out, as well) and then the two girls are in a huge arguement. But a little while later, something happens that will - oddly enough - help Alison learn how to cope with losing her mom.THE ALISON RULES is an amazing book - its more serious than Ms. Clark's other books, but its also more touching and heartfelt. I couldn't put it down after a while. Warning: you might want to keep a box of Kleenex handy - I was crying like a baby during this book.Overall grade - A+"},{"Title":"The Alison Rules","review":"Right when I picked up the book I immediately wondered what in the world were the \\"Alison Rules?\\" I was surprised to find out that it is the rules of how Alison lives her life to keep herself, and her heart, safe. To help her stick to the rules she enrolls her one and only friend Laurie. Laurie is the life of the party. She is always there to make Alison laugh. She is the one that brings Alison out of her shell and pull her into the social circle of parties and fun. Without Laurie, Alison would stay in the limelight, hiding from those around her and never letting anybody in. Why does Alison act this way though? Why is she so reserved unless Laurie is around? You learn that Alison's mother has passed away and that she herself did not know it would soon be the end for her mom. She would not believe it and did not give herself time to come to this realization until it was too late. After the death of her mother she went into a depression state and Laurie was the only one who could bring her out of this.This is a book of coming to terms with the past, and letting down your guard so that you may enjoy the future. Alison has to learn that her rules are not going to save her from everything, and that there are some things she just cannot control-Laurie's crazy antics being one of them. Join Alison as she travels through her Sophomore year of high school, comes to term with her mother's death, makes a new friend, and maybe even lets her guard down a little. If you are like me this book will make you cry-hard. But that just means you can truly feel for the characters and understand where Alison is coming from.

The book is from the point of view of Alison, a sophmore in high school. She had lost her mother in the previous summer, and we get a feel of how it feels like to cope with such a terrible loss, and how much harder it really is than it appears to those who have never had that happen yet, or to those of you who have recently lost someone, this book gives a great explanation of view of significant teenage girl dealing with losing someone close.The author does a great job of thinking like a young teenage girl. I being one myself, understood where Alison was coming from through out the book, and all of it was really accurate, anywhere from not understanding math, to best friend disputes, to getting around to spending quality family time, along with other typical and not so typical events and scenarios through out the book.To those who do read this book, the beginning and well through the middle of the book, its pretty slow, but don't give up on the book!! It has a shocking ending, that really comes out of no where, and it really hits you hard. I recommend that you read the entire book. You need to read through to the end to really understand the whole meaning of the book.

I would recomend it to anyone looking for a good book to read."},{"Title":"The Alison Rules","review":"The Alison Rules is a great book. I checked it out from the school library to read after finals; and I'm definitely going to buy it.The Alison Rules is about Alison Keaney. From the first chapter, you know that Alison has been through a tragedy, but the tragedy's details aren't revealed until about the middle of the book. Alison's best friend Laurie is more outgoing, and Laurie develops a love for Patrick Kirk, the new boy who becomes both of their friends.Then, near the end, Alison suffers another tragedy that shakes up her life. Will she learn to deal with her mother's tragedy as well, or will she go into spirals of depression? Read and find out!I read this book in less than a day--I just had to know what happened to Alison. She's a character you can believe in: small town, normal girl with issues. I likey."},{"Title":"The Alison Rules","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book because the characters were believable. Catherine knows how to write. She hasn't forgotten what it feels like to be a teen. Her characters sound like teens. They act like teens. The Alison Rules is a sad story about a girl named Alison who is trying to cope with the death of her mother. I don't want to reveal too much here, but this book is a definitely a good one. I suggest to all teen readers and anyone who enjoys coming of age stories."},{"Title":"The Alison Rules","review":"This book had a good message and I can kinda relate to how Alison felt. But then again it was so hard for me to get into this book. I found myself rushing through the book just so I can be done with reading it. This is one of those book where you read it one time and then when your dont you never want to pick it up again. I read it in one day and then took it back right after I read it...that is not a good thing for me. To make a long story short, if you like really sad books that make you cry and pretty much make you depressed, than this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Alison Rules","review":"From the amazing author Catherine Clark comes this incredibly moving story, The Alison Rules.Despite what Alison's friend Laurie always says, Alison always insists she doesn't have a set of rules. However, she does follow a strange pattern of behavior. She broke up with her older, football-playing boyfriend (one of \\"the Gods\\"), she avoids her locker, and she refuses to go to Boston. And everything is getting along fine in Alison's opinion until the new guy Patrick comes along.The main issue with Patrick is the love triangle. Laurie likes Patrick, and so does Alison though she refuses to admit it. Patrick likes Laurie as a friend, but he likes Alison more than that. Alison believes she can't be with Patrick because she would be betraying Laurie.Alison is forced to confront her past and everything that has been bothering her on a trip to Boston. There, everything comes out. Laurie cruelly exposes Alison's weaknesses until Alison can't take it anymore. There we learn what terrible thing happened to Alison that caused her to create her rules: the death of her mother.The Alison Rules is the basic story of a teen learning to deal with the death of someone close when they feel like there's no one who understands them. After a period of withdrawal, Alison finally learns to cope, though the event that catalyzes this is most surprising and heartbreaking.This was one of the most moving books I have read in a very long time. I even spent the last half of the book crying; that's how sad it was. I wouldn't recommend this book if you are looking for a light read, but if you want something with depth and meaning, this novel and other from Catherine Clark are a good choice.reposted from http://thebookmuncher.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"The Alison Rules","review":"i was a little bored at the beginning because i thought nothing was ever going to happen but from then on it kept my interest and i could'nt put it down....literally oh yeah and the ending...oh man i never saw that coming! thats what made me love this book!!!!"},{"Title":"The Alison Rules","review":"Catherine Clark is one of my favorite authors and I fell in love with her books \\"Truth Or Diary\\" and \\"Wurst Case Scenario\\". Unfortunately, I did not fall in love with this book like I did the others.Alison is a smart girl with one good friend. Alison's mother died the year before and Alison is feeling withdrawn. A new boy, named Patrick, moves into her tiny home town and both Alison and her best friend, Laurie, get crushes on him. It turns out that Patrick likes Alison, and not Laurie, which leads to Laurie and Alison fighting. Then something happens that changes Alison's life forever, just as her mother's death did.I did not feel that this book kept up pace and by the end of the book, the whole story had changed completely and the plot line was not consistent. By the end I was asking many questions that did not get answered. What happens between Alison and Patrick? Why did the story have to change so suddenly?This was an average teen book, but definitely not the best. Look to Clark's other books for better reading.~Atalanta"},{"Title":"The Alison Rules","review":"Alison lives by many rules to help her cope with the sadness of her mother's death, in this new title by the well-known author of TRUTH OR DAIRY and FROZEN RODEO. The rules keep Alison in a brittle existence that is shattered by further traumatic events involving her friends. Alison learns that the pain of emotions rather than the numb existence she was striving for is actually better, as it helps her heal.Catherine Clark's previous novels were popular for their realistic characters and humorous situations, similar in style to Joan Bauer's books. Her female characters pursued their own interests and dreams in addition to dating and friends. THE ALISON RULES deviates from her usual style and themes.Alison herself is the narrator and keeps her mother's death a secret from readers until late in the book. We later understand that she was not ready to deal with her mother's death, let alone talk about it. But it would have made her a more sympathetic character if she had let us in on what exactly her problem was from the first few pages. It is not until we know what is going on that her rules begin to make sense. For example, she will not use her locker, we understand later, because she was standing by it when she was paged to the principal's office and learned of her mother's death.Laurie, Alison's best friend, does her best to support her. Their friendship is a strength of this book...until they fall out over liking the same boy. This storyline is disappointing to find here, but Clark has the friendship come first with the girls (even though they have a hurtful argument about it) rather than the boy, in a refreshing twist.A sudden surprise tragedy near the end of the book will cause readers to bring out the Kleenex. It's hard to accept that this final blow actually helps Alison begin to heal, but readers will not be sorry that it does. More pages could have been spent on that process.--- Reviewed by Amy Alessio"},{"Title":"The Alison Rules","review":"I just finished this book last night and I want to tell everyone that its an awsome book. catherine has never written a book quite like this but it siutes her perfectly.

In reference to your best friend's crush, keep your feelings to yourself. And never use your locker if that's where you were standing when told the very worst news of all in The Alison Rules (2006) by Catherine Clark.Some of her rules aren't the most rational. But when your mother is dead, rationality isn't really important. In fact, it isn't even really a concern. Between the rules and her best friend, Laurie, Alison manages to get by. Maybe she isn't having the greatest time, but at least she's surviving.Everything changes when a new boy moves to Alison's small town. Patrick is fun, different, and he might be exactly what Alison needs. Unfortunately both Alison and Laurie fall for Patrick setting off a series of arguments and events that will ultimately tear the two friends apart.The Alison Rules was not the book I expected it to be. After looking at the cover and reading the blurb it seemed like a fun book that would have an ultimately okay ending.I was wrong.Don't get me wrong. Being surprised by a book is fine. It is usually a good thing. But I found the ending of The Alison Rules to be completely unforgivable. It was unnecessary, excessive, and made no sense in the general arc of the story. I would love to pick it apart for you here, but I don't post spoilers. Suffice it to say this is a story about growing up, grieving, and friendship.Then Catherine Clark threw in a surprise twist that, for me, completely invalidated everything else I had read in the book.

In France, you can't avoid reading books of Gourieroux: it's the national hero of econometrics. In fact, when you discover all the research he has done, you have to admit it's a brilliant person. But his books aren't particularly clear. They are made for mathematicians (the only students in my classroom that appreciate this book aren't economists; the rest of us, simple mortals, use more friendly books, such as Davidson and Mackinnon, Greene, Enders and Hamilton). What can I say? It's a very complete book: seasonality is deeply treated, ARIMA models are studied profoundly and, you can even find a spectral analysis chapter and another of the Kalman filter. But they are pretty hard to understand. The notation is complex, more than necessary. There are lots of equations and little explanations. If you are a mathematician, this book will satisfy your needs; it's rigorous and fairly complete (even if the selection of topics it's not the ideal one, I think); if you are not, you should better go to Hamilton's manual. If what you want is a cookbook of time series, then buy Enders."},{"Title":"TIME SERIES & DYNAMIC MODELS","review":"This is a crap book. Don't buy it.

Numerous typing errors make the matter worse. This book spend a chapter talking about old fashion of moving averages, such as Spencer 7-point and 15-point. It almost goes into the field of graduation. What's the point? The chapters on ARIMA are also rubbish. My feeling is that the author lacks sense in statistics, all he saw are just mathematics. On the whole, this book is just on the wrong field, at the wrong time and with the wrong title."},{"Title":"TIME SERIES & DYNAMIC MODELS","review":"I have used this book as a reference for about 9 years.

The book is a translation of the original french version which was published in 1990 and some items are not are perhaps a little dated.

At best this book will confuse you even more than you already are. Thomas Jefferson wrote that he merited the same censure visited upon the author of Rights of Man \\"for I profess the same principles.\\"Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin were Deists. Another thing they had in common was their contempt for the so-called mystery of God, and the pious frauds that perpetuated it in order to obtain those things they desired. One who has any knowledge of God Almighty whatsoever would be outraged at the claim that He would need or want a fallen angel to battle; that He would use a snake, of all creatures, to entice a female to sin or use a whale as a motel. Those who advocate such things fall into one of two categories: sociopaths or herd animals. The buildings they erect supposedly to honor God serve everyone involved but God. While they are gathering places for those desiring wool and those in need of shearing, they serve a far greater purpose--they allow those without the desire to serve the true God, a God that cautions them before they can even get a lie out of their mouths--a mystery to worship.As Paine explains, \\"Mystery answers all general purposes, miracle followed as an occasional auxiliary. The former served to bewilder the mind, the latter to puzzle the senses. The one was the lingo, the other the legerdemain.\\""},{"Title":"The life and major writings of Thomas Paine,","review":"Paine who failed out of school at the age of 12 was not one of the best thinkers of all time. He joined the American Revoluntion immediately prior to its onset, and he met with the founding fathers and expressed the ideas of the American people of the time in Common Sense. Because of the fame he received from Common Sense he attempted to influence Christian nation he was living in. Although some of the other founding fathers were also deist, Paine's writtings in the Age of Reason (which contradicts his earlier statements)lead to his downfall. He attempted to take advantage of his limited fame and failed.Some of Paine's arguments state that he can't accept the revelations of others because he cannot be assured of THEIR credibility. This comes from a man that failed out of school at 12 years old, failed at every job he attempted, and is only remembered for his statements in support of the American Revolution, which he only was apart of for a few years before it took place.Much of Paine's arguments contain fallacies. His belief of an Age of Reason is not supported by logical or reasoning abilities. One example is the logical fallacy Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc (after this therefore because of this). One of Paine's arguments is that Satan was punished by being sent to a pit; Paine then states that the Greek god Jupiter punished his opponent (giants) by confining one under a mountain (Paine claims resulted in volcanoes). Paine claims that BECAUSE the legend of Jupiter imprisoning his rival allegedly preceded the concept of Satan being imprisoned that the Christian belief in Satan must have been derived out of the Jupiter legend. Paine's assumption excludes the fact that earthy crimes committed throughout all ages have had punishment or prison associated with them, and the claim that the Jews would have had to study Greek mythology to create their own beliefs is a complete hypothesis on Paine's part.Paine's statements are wishy-washy to say the least. He makes statements that the Bible is only hearsay and has no merit, and then at other times makes statements based on Biblical passages as though they were a matter of fact. He states that Jesus was a great teacher, and that he (Paine) is going to stick with the philosophy of Thomas (doubting Thomas) and demand to see proof of everything. If Paine's theories were true that the Bible was only hearsay, he would have no way of judging what Jesus taught as his (Paine's) beliefs do not allow for Jesus or Thomas to have even existed.A very interesting thing to note about Paine's beliefs is that if you apply his beliefs to his own work then you would PROVE in Paine's view point that HE never existed. Paine states that you cannot believe that Paul wrote the books of the New Testament attributed to him therefore the Bible is not true. This same principle can be applied to Paine's work to challenge Paine's very existence. None of us personally met Paine or verified that his writings were his own; we only have writings that we are told were written by Thomas Paine by others, and that the writings contained Paine's beliefs. If you apply this type of reasoning to Paine's own work then you would have to conclude that Paine's work might be a complete fabrication, and that there is no proof that he even lived that does not come from hearsay or documentation of other men.In LIFE AND WRITINGS OF THOMAS PAINE it says: \\"Deism teaches us that God is a God of truth and justice. Does the Bible teach the same doctrine? It does not.\\"This concept of God being a God of Justice and Truth is taken from the Revelations of the Bible and not from the Deist's use of Reason. By simply observing Creation to understand God as Deist claims you would not come to the understanding of God as a God of Justice and Truth. The world is not naturally just. If you base your religion on observing nature you are more likely to conclude that God is growing people in order to eat them, as that is what is observable in nature. Human's raise animals for food and are not concerned about providing the animals with truth and justice. These traits cannot be determined by observing the movements of the sun or the actions of man.Observing the nature of man; to rob, rape, and kill would appear to be a natural state of man, as these actions have been recorded throughout all history and still exist today. If Deists hold to the belief of judging God by observing the creation without giving any thought to Biblical Revelation then there is not cause to label such actions as sin. Revealed religion is what labels these instincts as sin. Paine's view originates in his Quaker up bringing, which he then perverts and intermixes with his concept of Reason to make up his odd belief and questionable belief system.Paine also rests some of his arguments on the new definition that he gives to the word Revelation. He redefines the word to meet his desires. The problem with this argument is that when debating the usage of a word relating to a topic thousands of years earlier it is necessary to use the definition of word at that time. By changing the definition of the word thousands of years later you do not invalidate how it has been used for centuries. This argument is also a logical fallacy called the Straw man in which Paine creates his own new definition of the word and argues against his own definition and not the actual topic.Much of Paine's view on Reason comes from ethnocentric thinking that He (educated to the level of a 12 year old boy) has a superior ability to think than those who have lived in the past. Paine views himself as an enlightened thinker when in fact the opposite is true. He values the usage of Reason in gaining wisdom, but the Reason that Deism promotes is ignorance. It involves a lack of study or research, and is simply the concept of \\"Believe whatever you reason without considering anything other than your own opinions\\", and leaves man to his own devices. The problem is that the Bible documents the results of man being left to his own devices, and if REASON were really being applied then an enlightened thinker would STUDY and learn from the mistakes of those of the past to prevent themselves from falling into the same snares.There is nothing enlightened about reasoning through ignorance. Much of Paine's problems with Christianity are not actually with the Word of God (as Paine claims they are), but are against man's hypocrisy and use of religion wrongfully. The Bible is also against these things, so Paine's attacks on the Bible are misdirected. Paine's argument that Christianity is wrong simple because other religions exist is foolish. One would not assume that all foods are poisonous simply because some of them are. If you do not want to eat poisonous food the answer does not lie in blindly making up your own recipes and biting into them hoping you wouldn't die, but lies in studying the good and bad recipes to determine where the poison is in order to use the correct recipe that will allow you to live; that is how REASON is to be used intelligently. If you are an enlightened thinker then you would analyze, evaluate, contemplate, understand, and reason to determine the truth. Making up your own philosophy based on what feels good to you is not enlightenment, and it is not even a new way of thinking; this error is commonly documented in the Bible.Paine's arguments show only a superficial understanding of the Bible. If he were to put effort into studying the Bible and applying reason to it then his questions and objections to it would be answered. He would also be able to answer why some religions are false ones and why they are so. As it is Paine argues that all religion say they are right and since they all cannot be right Paine assumes that none of them can be right. This is another error in his reasoning. Certainly there are an infinite number of examples of people doing things wrong, but someone else being capable of doing it right."},{"Title":"Bygone Coastal Maine","review":"What a gem of a little postcard guide to the Maine that most of us only remember as children, or as recollections in stories told by our parents and grandparents!

Only serious literature qualifies as fodder for this endeavor; romance novels and other entertainments do not ask us to challenge our \\"Final Narratives\\", but rather appeal to desires instead of needs. Edmundson laments the current state of humanities education as his colleagues are forced to pander to students whose main values are entertainment and preparation for a field or profession. Learning for personal growth is no longer a priority for a student body that now consumes education the same way that it consumes movies and electronic gadgets - to meet entertainment wants or practical career advancement desires. Edmundson makes a strong case for restoring liberal education to its former goal of enlarging the person. He forays into the field of literary criticism and criticizes most critics for creating categories and labels that stifle the reader's chances of drawing substantive, potential life changing experiences from the author. Where Edmundson falters, I believe, is in his conclusion that religious belief will ultimately be replaced by the values found via a secular, humanist education, and those primarily drawm from great literature. As far as I know, religious belief is not waning; perhaps it is expressed in less traditional forms, but it is not on the decline. Further, where does this place those authors - Tolstoy, for example -whose works were expressions of religious beliefs and whose readers grappled with and left with a new or a strengthened religious perspective? In sum, the book provides a disturbing analysis of current liberal education but finishes with a poorly grounded thesis."},{"Title":"Why Read?","review":"\\"Prepackaged\\"By Steven HaackI use the word Prepackaged to describe what some professors have pawned off as a college education. In comparison, one may ask, how healthy is prepackage food compared to a five star restaurant or you may want to compare your first car to a 2010 Lexus.Next month, I \\"celebrate five years since I graduated from college. I was forty-seven at the time. When I received my BA, I had one major question: \\"Is that all there is?\\" (Dr. V, forgive me for using there.)For the past five years, I have been on the prowl for something more. I even looked into Graduate School. However, I invite you to discover where the gods have led me. The following is a letter I wrote to a friend.\\"During a visit to a bookstore called the Book Loft in German Village in the summer of 2007, I watched a friend's eyes light up as she looked at a book called \\"The Knowledge Deficit\\" by E. D. Hirsch that I showed her. I too was fascinated by this book.Thank goodness, though, the powers that be made me so that I am never completely satisfied. Last Tuesday, I went to the Main Branch Library. I found this book, read a few chapters, and the next day, I took the bus to Borders and purchased it.A common theme and sensation that I get from this book is that I am and will always be incomplete. However, this does not mean I will not find some satisfaction at times.I mention an article that you can find on the Internet by the author of this book called \\"Why Read.\\" The title of this article is \\"On the Uses of a Liberal Education\\" by Mark Edmundson. This is article is what spurred him to write this book.While we have fantastic technology and awesome amounts of purchasing power compared to other \\"centuries,\\" we seem to have less satisfaction and more discontentment.Nothing makes me feel bad than the sensations that accompany three rhythmic words, woulda, shoulda, coulda. In reading this book, Why Read, it seems something has replaced these feelings and that is anxiety: anxiety about what I know and what I don't know.Although \\"Why Read\\" leaves me with anxiety, it is what some doctors call \\"Good Stress.\\" Truth is disturbing at first, however, living in the dark can be more scary and debilitating.\\""},{"Title":"Why Read?","review":"This is perhaps one of the most important books about the state of higher education in America today.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Why Read?","review":"I am particularly fond of Edmundsons erudite explanation of all things literary although he might strike some as pedantic and smug. Extending the argument of his tome Literature Against Philosophy: Plato to Derrida, Edmundson laments the state of liberal arts teaching--and, despite his protestations to the contrary, effectively caricatures critical theory as the soulless antithesis to his own humanistic pedagogical ideals. While a stylish, erudite piece of rhetoric, Edmundson's book is dated, rooted as it is in the author's Harper's article of 1997 and in the culture wars of that decade. Edmundson, a professor of English at the University of Virginia, claims he is not \\"antitheory,\\" but a humanist who believes a liberal arts education ought to expand minds rather than shut them down. For him, critical theory comes \\"between\\" the reader and the power of great books, distracting students from the big questions concerning life and how best to live it--questions central to a democracy. As an alternative approach, Edmundson permits students to identify with characters in a nave manner currently out of favor in the academy and highlights the author's voice (a technique he calls \\"ventriloquism\\"). Edmundson gives examples of how he teaches classics from Wordsworth to Orwell and takes positions on canonicity, multiculturalism and pop culture. Yet for all its learning and elegance, Edmundson's challenge to teachers might have done more to rejuvenate or deepen the tired debate in which it engages had its observations extended beyond his own classroom."},{"Title":"Why Read?","review":"I was looking for an enlightened mind that could add new directions.

Unlike that book, however, Why Read? is itself eminently readable-- in fact a great pleasure from first page to last. Teachers in particular will find Edmundson's diagnosis and prescriptions bracing; he reminds us what got us into books in the first place, and why reading great works is indispensable to living the good life. Whether you agree with him or not, Edmundson's swift, lively polemic is already ingiting a debate we badly need to have."},{"Title":"Why Read?","review":"Mark Edmundson's book will make you wish that you had studied English at the University of Virginia and that you had been fortunate enough to have been in one of Prof. Edmundson's classes. (I did not have this good fortune.) Edmundson's passion for life and learning, which no doubt makes him an outstanding professor, also makes this book such a pleasure to read.Edmundson's argument in support of the examined life is all the more compelling because it is so democratic. Edumundson believes that the life of the mind is available to all, not just to a privileged elite. Thomas Jefferson would be proud of Mark Edmundson and glad to have him on the faculty of his university.But you're already an avid reader? You read and you know why you read. Do you really need a book entitled \\"Why Read?\\" I think so. Edmundson's argument is really much broader than the title would seem to indicate, and he will also renew your interest in reading and reading widely."},{"Title":"Why Read?","review":"This is a wise, short, and difficult book. For example, he includes a fascinating discussion using religion as a jumping-off point for resolving post-modernism's overly relativistic thinking. Edmundson focuses on deep questions for readers - what does your reaction to a book say about you? Why do you like a character and how does he/she reflect you?I did find large portions of this book inaccessible--I haven't read Derrida, I am not particularly well versed in Shakespeare. I suppose I read mainly for pleasure and only partly for deep personal reflection. Edmundson would probably say--and rightly so--that this is because I am certainly a participatant/victim of the consumerism of the liberal arts education! And maybe that is one of his most important points. In any case, this was a stimulating read but it may make some readers feel intellectually inadequate."},{"Title":"Why Read?","review":"In his book, \\"Why Read,\\" Mark Edmundson writes that I once possessed \\"movie-star\\" good looks. That is not why I recommend the book. People who read to be sparked creatively, enriched and spiritually uplifted will be hard pressed to find a more satisfying book this season. There is one way. If you start by reading his earlier memoir, \\"Teacher: The One Who Made the Difference,\\" so that you have a sense of who Edmundson is, you'll get even more out of this book.Mark Edmundson is an earnest, honest, intelligent and disciplined teacher. What's more, he loves his students and work in the purest sense. He enters into relationship with them with an open mind, which is to say he attends and listens without predisposition, motive or bias. When he tells us to approach literature in the same way, to allow it its \\"maximum advocacy,\\" he is both modeling and advocating the same message. The man lives what he teaches and it makes for grace and power, whether speaking or writing.As Edmundson explains so elegantly, the real issue is not why we should read but how we should live. With the tail of our economic system increasingly wagging the dog of our political system - and swatting our freedoms in the process, it has become a critical question. Are we, as individuals as well as a society, going to proclaim our faith in ourselves and truly listen to one another, or are we going to give in to fear and assert to the exclusion of listening? Edmundson has the faith in himself to listen and he teaches us how to develop that same faith in ourselves by listening to ourselves through literature. Though short and sweet, \\"Why Read\\" is a profoundly wise and inspiring book."},{"Title":"Why Read?","review":"I kind of got sucked into this book by surprise--literature and literary criticism are not at all my fields, and I've never really sympathized with people who would choose them as a field. (My own primary interests are religious studies, and the philosophy of science).I got sucked in by the author's suggestion that literature can be a new religion, a secular religion. I got sucked in by his comments on modern pop culture. And then, since it's a short book, I kept reading.One of the key issues in the contemporary university world, in case you don't already know, is how the humanities fields can justify themselves in comparison with science. Science has become the measure against which the humanities are judged and found wanting. So what can the humanities do? They try to deal with science in various ways.I like Edmundson's implied answer: ignore science. Almost no one from the humanities dares to take this approach. But after all, does poetry ever try to do the same thing that science does? I wager, never. Thus, poetry has value as poetry, and criticism as an understanding and appreciation of poetry, with no scientific pretensions at all. Many arts departments have managed to learn this lesson thoroughly, but evidently literature is not.Edmundson goes on: literature exists to help us become better people. (Science doesn't do this: if Edmundson is right, obviously we need more literature in this world!) Literature helps us find our way, existentially, when we are lost--the way religion used to. The role of a literature teacher, then, is to enable the student to encounter the literature, to be changed by the literature, and then to freely accept it or reject it.I teach literature occasionally, as if by accident, when it falls to me. I often tell my students that the best literature is stuff that one can read over and over and over again, and it gets better every time. Edmundson says the best literature is literature that changes our lives. A good idea; I think we both might have a point.I recommend the book fairly naively, without being aware of many similar options you might explore. I was happy to have a little (though obviously very biased) glance into the world of literature and criticism. I've read a few books by Harold Bloom, and I've recently been reading \\"A Jacques Barzun Reader\\" which has some essays along similar lines to Edmundson's thoughts here; and Italo Calvino's \\"Why Read the Classics,\\" which you might want to browse as well. I suspect that, when I finish those two books, I may well decide that the book by Barzun was the best one, but this one will not be far behind."},{"Title":"Why Read?","review":"\\"Why Read?\\" is a further elucidation of a student's (or anyone's for that matter) journey to self-knowledge and understanding of the world that the author began in \\"Teacher,\\" an auto-biographical account of high-schoolers in a working class environment being given the opportunity to expand their horizons through the encouragement of an unconventional teacher. In the present case, the author has moved to the college classroom where literary classics are ideally read for their potential of answering such questions as: \\"Who Am I?\\" or \\"What Is Life?\\" There is the implication that the student at the college level feels a need to move beyond conventional socialization. This all seems to be standard practice - why write a book?The author is more than a little concerned that the university has essentially adopted the values and the modus operandi of the broader consumer and entertainment society. A certain superficiality has engulfed our society. Being \\"hip\\" and \\"cool,\\" that is projecting an image, must be the foremost stance taken in life, which excludes both passion and doubt. Multifarious information, often obtained via the Internet, displaces wisdom. That is what students expect within the university. Future technocrats and businessmen need an instrumental, factual education, not a \\"useless\\" wholesale examination of values. That entire orientation is to be contrasted with the author's view that \\"the function of a liberal arts education is to use major works of art and intellect to influence one's Final Narrative, ..., the ultimate set of terms that we use to confer value on experience.\\" The self-doubt and introspection crucial to developing a Final Narrative is outside the boundaries of ubiquitous casualness.Beyond disinterest in the classics, in criticism directed more towards the humanities professorate, there is the additional concern that literary works are being interpreted with a political agenda, which distorts the original authors' intents and, furthermore, interferes with the educational value of the works. For example, Dickens' novels concerning the horrid social conditions in early industrial England are used in hegemonic critiques not intended by Dickens. Nonetheless, the chiding of those advancing a Foucaultian \\"normalization and control\\" of society agenda by grafting such analyses onto literary works, comes across as more than a little disingenuous given the author's overall views.\\"Democracy and democratic humanism\\" - those are the components of the author's \\"religion.\\" He invites us to \\"imagine a nation, a world, where people have fuller self-knowledge, fuller self-determination, where self-making is a primary objective not just in the material sphere but in the circles of the mind and heart. We humanities teachers can help create such a world.\\" There is no disagreement with the nobility of the goal here, but where is the reconciliation with the realities of a superficial, consumer ethos and Foucaultian control. In a world of artificiality, how does a student become aware of a need for self-discovery? How can a student possibly know whether such a search is possible in an institution without the assumption that awareness has already been obtained? And then there is the very real possibility of such an enlightened student wrecking on the realities outside the university. We can't all have the safe haven of college tenure to widely explore and espouse eternal truths. At one point the author recognizes that seeking truth is a subversive endeavor. But there seems to be little appreciation for the consequences.The author disclaims that his approach is one of personal therapy. Yet it does seem to be very much one of personal growth and personal interpretation of the classics. He especially advocates the reading of poetry as being foremost in finding personal truth, which in the view of many is a particularly subjective endeavor. Literature comes before history in his view. Presumably that same ordering applies to any body of knowledge. He seems to require that a work engenders an emotional response, that the work of art can be lived, for it to be considered essential for self-discovery. He specifically discounts works that merely \\"teach us something about the larger world.\\" This is a most curious position. Broad, historical understanding of political, economic, and social systems would seem to enhance anyone's pursuit of trying to define a life to live. Constructing a personal reality based on the personal interpretation of literary works, devoid of significant context, seems to merely self-indulging, with little to do with attaining intellectual heights.\\"Why Read?\\" is thought-provoking, but puzzles because of the author's unwillingness to complete his analysis. It is clear that the author understands much: the culture is dumbed-down; the university system makes little effort to advance the growth and wisdom of attendees; a business mentality permeates our society; democracy, humanistic or otherwise, is a tenuous project in our society; and tremendous risks are incurred if one confronts this hegemonic situation.What is to be inferred here? Does the author accept the fact that substantial wealth is a legitimate litmus test in allowing attendance at his employing university, which ultimately will amount to little more than gaining a credential to enter the business world at an elevated position? Where is the call for reform? Where is the political critique? Is he genuinely interested in democratic empowerment?The book is ultimately just not that satisfying because even though the author is well aware of the landscape, he doesn't seem to be going anywhere with his understanding. What a waste."},{"Title":"Why Read?","review":"I approached this book thinking it was in the spirit of Mortimer Adler's classic How to Read a Book--an instructional guide on how to read effectively--but I was surprised with Edmundson's style and content. Why Read? is not an instructional manual but rather a compelling essay asking both teachers--mainly college professors--and students to approach their reading in a different manner. His main thesis is to learn how to live through the wisdom found in classical literature. Learning how to live does not mean knowing how to be perfectly happy. Rather, it is how to find more about ourselves from stories. Like ancient poets of old, great authors preserve a human narrative that runs through out all of our lives and which must be preserved for future generations. Whatever pain and hardship we've endured have been expressed in writings of the past.In his opening passage, Edmundson quotes William Carlos Williams saying that many people hold poetry (and poets) in contempt, thinking they are dreamers, but when we look closer we can see that men had died fighting for the ideas written and expressed in poetry and great literatures. Unlike the cold logical reasoning of philosophy, literature offers an accessible wisdom that touches us at the most sublime consciousness. Modern teachers have shun off this wisdom and refuse to challenge their students to approach literature using their own personal experience and see how what they're reading is similar to their own lives and personal struggle. Instead, many professors choose to create this false culture of intellectualism that imposes a strict system of deconstructionism that tears out the soul of great literature. What the students ended up is not a deeper understanding about their lives, but a false sense of intellectual achievement thinking they had triumph over the great authors by demolishing the authors' works in a classroom setting.Edmundson has given me a new reason to re-read many of the classic works I had passed off as irrelevant and to seek out new literature to enrich my own life."},{"Title":"Why Read?","review":"This is a short little book, but its brevity belies its significance. Here is one of the most clear-headed, profound, straightforward, well-reasoned, and eloquent arguments for the value of literature--as Literature, not ideology or entertainment or historical artifact or whatnot--I've seen in a long time. Since I was expecting something of a diatribe against critical theory, pop culture studies, and all that jazz, I also found this book to be admirably even-handed. Edmundson gives these things their due while critiquing the way they can get in the way of the matter at hand if given too much emphasis. And the matter at hand is of course literature's ability to expand the reader, to ask the big questions without providing pat answers or stereotyped solutions universally applicable, to challenge one to think and feel for oneself--to know oneself, in fact.Such themes could easily lead a writer to get self-inflated and pedantic, but Edmundson expresses himself with wit, dry humor, and a good sense of proportion. He is assured but not arrogant, and passionate but not apoplectic. He can discuss the most momentous issues in a flowing conversational idiom that is comfortably and unselfconsciously erudite. It's almost like being in your favorite professor's office as an undergrad having a good, interesting discussion, or (if you're a professor) talking shop with a friendly respected colleague.And if you indeed plan on becoming a teacher of literature, I VERY highly recommend this book; reflecting on what Edmundson has to say here should definitely help you define and refine your priorities and motivations...and teaching style, probably. And it will remind you of why you fell in love with literature in the first place."},{"Title":"Why Read?","review":"I read this book hoping to find some answers to the question \\"Why Read?;but found it to be too preoccupied with reading from the perspective of a teacher. What makes any teacher more qualified to instruct one as to what they should read? I have read a lot in my lifetime and have benefited greatly from it. My father read a great deal and was extremely well versed on a wide range of subjects,particularly current events and politics.More so, than the vast majority of the teachers I came across in school and university;and he didn't have the opportunity to complete high school,let alone attend university. I guess I developed my love of reading from him and spent endless hours as a youth reading the family's Book of Knowledge and any other book I could obtain.What about school ,university and \\"english teachers\\"? Well,to be quite frank about it;they tended to turn me off reading,and particularly the books and authors they talked about in their courses.I had no interest in authors such as Scott,Dickens,Kipling and the literature of England and English Literature;as if the only english literature worth reading or poetry such as Tenneson,Byron,and other European poets were what was important. I was more interested in Mark Twain or the poetry of Robert Service;but they seemed to be beneath what academics thought important.In other words,teachers tended to turn me off reading much more than inspired me.I have discussed this with many people over the years and have found that many lifelong readers agree with me;but obviously not teachers.It is not an easy thing to create an interest in other people and I have concluded that this is done by inspiring them as opposed to \\"teaching\\" which tends to be more a process of instructing and correction.One day ,while on a boat,I spent a couple of hours discussing this with a retired university president. I suggested to him ,that in all the teachers I encountered in school and university;I found only one or two that ever \\"inspired\\" me,and I thought that was what a good teacher should do.I expected he would disagree with me,but his response was,\\"If you had more than one,consider yoursely very lucky.The one teacher that stood out, taught high school Mathematics and Science. He had to quit Medicine due to back injuries.He inspired me in several ways. We were studying Logs and I was very impressed with them.I was telling him how much I was impressed with what one could do with them and he reached into his desk and pulled out a Slide Rule and asked me if I ever saw one of them.I thought it looked like some kind of a fancy ruler.He explained how it was basically a set of Log tables on a sliding stick and showed me how you could multiply and divide with it .He loaned it,and an instruction book to me,and I learned to use it .I was the only kid in the high school that could use a slide rule.Back to reading.I didn't care much for the type of books the teachers taugh us about,but on my own I \\"found\\" much to read ,and quickly read everything I could find by John Steinbeck;after stumbling upon \\"Cannery Row\\" and \\"Grapes of Wrath\\".I read \\"Teacher Man\\" by Frank Mc Court and found it a marvelous book.Now there is a teacher I would have loved to have had and I am sure he was inspiring to his students. How he fit in to the academic establishment and how he comes across to the conventional teacher ,is another matter."},{"Title":"Why Read?","review":"This is a wonderful book about reading literature. The book also has strong undertones about the complacency of modern students, the dullness of professors, and the commercial/consumer catering university. I found the book to be a great exploration into our own day and the error we are making in our attentiveness to the Humanities. I agree with nearly everything Edmundson wrote and really enoyed his chapters about Theory and Criticism-- both things he apparently detests.In the end, this book is about the failures of modern man, at the university level, to be a student of the Humanities, or to be a worthy professor of such. The reading is simple and clear and had many great examples from literary giants. It is also a short read and should take the average reader no time at all to finish.If you are interested in reading a Modern day's Humanist approach to literature and reading, this is the book for you.

Unfortunately, this book isn't.I bought this book on the recommendation of a bookstore clerk, who said it hadn't sold well but promised an appealing story. As it turned out, the story is pretty predictable and lacks a writer's skill in the telling. The author deserves credit for attempting to present an ensemble of interesting characters, but mostly they are caricatures. The writing is fairly clunky and the promise of the subtitle -- that the horrific 1947 explosion in Texas City produced a landmark legal ruling -- turns out to be something of an overstatement. The death of 600 people is no small event, but the long-ago events of Texas City have been eclipsed by the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center.As a regional book, City on Fire might kindle the interest of Texas historians and descendants of those who died in the disaster.

Erroneous statements, inaccurate facts, grossly exaggerated descriptions and imagined events dot the recounting of that fateful day. I know. I was there.The book evolves into more of a historical novel than a historic documentation, and as the plot unfolds, it begins to take on a biased political position. With almost Coughlin-like oversimplification of the socio-economic situation, the author weaves a tale of the evil and selfish \\"Ring of Steel\\" of industry around the city. He makes \\"The Company\\" sound like a dirty word, failing to balance this innuendo with a recognition of the strength of the unions in the town or of the genius of Col H.B. Moore who literally made Texas City possible. Through Moore's early efforts to woo transportation and industry, he attracted into the area not only sea faring workers and railroaders, but also chemists, engineers, administrators, construction builders, workers and money. The author's descriptions seem to cram this influx into a victimized three layered town.Roach and Trahan are portrayed as the heroes of the novel, but the heroes, acting in a manner in which victims never could, were all the people of Texas City, plus many from outside --doctors, nurses, morticians, firemen, ministers, Red Cross and Salvation Army workers, and too many to list -- who dealt with a bad situation most commendably."},{"Title":"City on Fire : The Forgotten Disaster That Devastated a Town and Ignited a Landmark Legal Battle","review":"The story of the long-ago explosion at Texas City has the elements for a good non-fiction narrative.

An absolute page-turner with a narrative that moves at a breakneck pace, it also, in light of the events of September 11th, couldn?t be more relevant. Combining both stunning and, at times, fiery prose with brilliantly detailed research, Minutaglio brings to life a cautionary tale of history long forgotten, of a 1947 explosion that leveled the factory town of Texas City, Texas, causing the deaths of over 700 people (as well as injured over 5,000), and starting a landmark legal battle. While a story of humanity at its worst?political ambition, big industry greed, racism?it provides the uplift of the indestructibility of the human spirit, of our ability to literally rise from the ashes.

I became interested in this book after I heard the author discussing it on National Public Radio's Diane Rehm Show. I am very glad I picked up this remarkable book...it is one of the best works of narrative history I have read recently...my favorite book of the year so far. I learned so much."},{"Title":"City on Fire : The Forgotten Disaster That Devastated a Town and Ignited a Landmark Legal Battle","review":"In short, I couldn't put this down. The author has told us a story that's needed to come to light for many years. Why it hasn't until now still remains a mystery. I have distant family who were in Texas City at the time of this disaster, but for years it has only been mentioned, never really discussed. Now, in this post 9/11 time, what happened there resonates even more strongly . Kudos to Minutaglio, a veteran Texas journalist, for telling this story so compellingly. The individuals, the events, the context, the long-term repercussions -- it's a fascinating, interwoven tale. I will highly recommend to family and friends."},{"Title":"City on Fire : The Forgotten Disaster That Devastated a Town and Ignited a Landmark Legal Battle","review":"I came across this book after conducting research on the Ringling Bros. circus fire. Again, another tragedy that I never heard of! Bill Minutaglio takes you through the paces of each event leading up to the explosions of the Grandcamp and High Flyer. As I'm reading this book, my mind had a difficult time comprehending all the devastation. The explosion was so great that it blew the volunteer firemen to bits. None of their bodies were ever recovered.The one thing I was extremely curious about was the after effects of all the petrochemicals (effects on the people, animals and the environment). 2300 tons of ammonium nitrate went straight in the atmosphere, and in Galveston Bay, along with the chemical plants that exploded. The entire townspeople (what was left of them) was breathing in that chemical soup. Even though they did evacuate the town a lot of people stayed to help with the rescue efforts. I wonder if anybody knows about the lingering after effects (cancer, respiratory problems, etc.) people had and how many eventually died of cancer. Not to mention that the government sprayed the town with DDT to stave off any diseases that might arise from all the dead bodies.I thought the book was well written, although in some places I wondered about the factual content. I found some chapters disturbing (he talks about the racial segregation) and how white people treated African-Americans and Mexican-Americans even to the point of burying the unidentified dead (blacks couldn't be buried with whites). A must read about a tragedy that should not be forgotten."},{"Title":"City on Fire : The Forgotten Disaster That Devastated a Town and Ignited a Landmark Legal Battle","review":"&quot;City on Fire&quot; is a book that had to be written, for it's the shocking true story about the industrial port city of Texas City, Texas, that was devastated by a pair of ammonium nitrate explosions in April 1947. It's an event that was largely forgotten about until Bill Minutaglio's book came along.That said, &quot;City on Fire&quot; was a disappointment for me. The first third of it dwells on Father Bill Roach, the Catholic priest who crusades for the city's underclass. This is the worst part of the book, for much of it seems utterly made-up. As another reviewer pointed out, there's no way all of this could be factual; how could Minutaglio possibly know what Roach is seeing, thinking and saying? Other characters are treated in similar fashion.While the book is full of florid characterizations, it has precious little about ammonium nitrate, such as how it is handled, why it is explosive, how it is manufactured and so forth. A map of the city prior to the event would have been helpful, too, as would a diagram of the Grandcamp, the ship that was the first to explode.Minutaglio writes as if he's writing the screenplay for a low-budget TV movie. Another complaint -- far too much italic type, much of which is put there for no apparent reason."},{"Title":"City on Fire : The Forgotten Disaster That Devastated a Town and Ignited a Landmark Legal Battle","review":"City On Fire grabbed my attention on the first page and never let go.

Excellent."},{"Title":"City on Fire : The Forgotten Disaster That Devastated a Town and Ignited a Landmark Legal Battle","review":"City on Fire captures perfectly the era in which the disaster occurred.

Much of it is written in the present tense, rarely ever appropriate in a historical work. Additionally, the book contains no notes or bibliography, another major warning sign in a work of history. Given how it is constructed, one has to wonder if the author intended for his work to read like a historical novel, but it fails on that level as well.It's a pity, because the subject itself is quite interesting and deserves a much better treatment."},{"Title":"City on Fire : The Forgotten Disaster That Devastated a Town and Ignited a Landmark Legal Battle","review":"Swings from over-simplification to exaggeration in City on Fire leaves this reader almost dizzy. It is fortunate the author incorporated the research of Hugh Stephens (The Texas City Disaster 1947) to somewhat stabilize his story. For ?story? winds insidiously throughout what purports to be an historical account. The book?s recounting of so many impossible-to-know private thoughts and actions of citizens, plus the seemingly arrogant absence of footnotes and sources weakens any credibility. Careless errors in first names of the citizens (sometimes even last names), the lay-out of the town in distances and directions and the 1947 construction materials of various structures add to the confusion.The blast was indeed a disaster, but the author seems to stretch for sensational descriptions. In the first hours after the explosion countless ordinary citizens voluntarily stepped in to do what needed to be done. Their heroism is a legacy.I found the book to be a mixture of fact and fiction with no map to help separate the components. Therefore, it is not credible to me. I will not add it to my library."},{"Title":"City on Fire : The Forgotten Disaster That Devastated a Town and Ignited a Landmark Legal Battle","review":"If you're not interested reading a story that is absolutely factual or at least as factual as someone's research can make it, this book is probably one you want to read. After all, it is a dramatic telling of the cataclysmic explosion in Texas City in 1947.Yet if you are a fussy reader like me, something is going to bother you about the narrative. It's very simple. In the case of at least one of the major figures of the book, Father Bill Roach, the author puts words in his mouth; tells us what he is thinking; and frequently informs us in detail of his routine actions. This is despite the fact that Father Roach died in the explosion, and unless the author knows the secret of time travel or can speak with the dead, this means there is a large amount of fiction in the book.To me, this wrecks the credibility of the narrative. The enormous amount of research Mr. Minutaglio did almost becomes moot. He doesn't even give us footnotes, endnotes, or chapter notes, so we can pick out what amounts to pure speculation on his part and ignore it.His only sop to the readers is italicizing some passages. These he coyly describes as &quot;external and internal dialogue&quot; that he &quot;built&quot; from what is known as fact. In the end, I find myself wondering why he didn't just stick to the facts like most other writers of non-fiction do or simply write a novel about the explosion. He writes very well, and I bet such a book would have sold."},{"Title":"City on Fire : The Forgotten Disaster That Devastated a Town and Ignited a Landmark Legal Battle","review":"Well defined description of merchandise and very pleased with seller's quickness in getting product to me.

As Minutaglio reconstructs the event one sees that it bears the hallmarks of a major disaster--ignorance, arrogance and extraordinary bad luck all mixed together to create the conditions for horror on a grand scale.Minutaglio uses the stories of several involved survivors and relatives of some of the prominent deceased to weave this tale. This lends a high level of credence to the reconstruction. There is, however, a fair degree of inference in what is presented.Beyond the pure human tragedy that Minutaglio chronicles it is the social aspect of the story that really riles. Having in large part created the circumstances that led to this disaster the federal government spends great time and energy in denying the people of Texas City any real comfort, compensation or even recognition of its culpability. When one looks at how the government reacted to 9/11 and compare that to the reaction to the Texas City disaster you can't help but feel anew for the victims.I found this to be a well written, well researched, lovingly tendered story. It's not a book that one can enjoy, but is a book that should be read. As has often been noted, we do not truly appreciate the power of our modern tools till something goes wrong.

I enjoyed the book for its human interest aspects derived from the author's interviews with survivors. The way he describes life in Texas City coincides with my memories of it from my childhood. I attended the church where Fr. Roach served and the author seemed to use his artistic license from interviewing those who knew him to portray Roach's thoughts and words.My previous reading on this topic was of dry historical narratives of events of those days in 1947. The inside look at the role of the federal government and the ensuing litigation and resolution of survivors' claims was new to me and fascinating to read.

Go back to junior high and fall asleep at your desk (perhaps underneath the asbestos). Buy this book and find yourself inside a story, walking the neon streets and smelling the factories. I was thankful that Mr. Minutaglio didn?t get too mired in some kind of academic repeat of microfiche minutia.

YOUNG LONIGAN, volume one of the \\"Studs\\" trilogy, is, in my opinion, one of the greatest works in literature about a U. S. boyhood--as great, in many respects, as Twain's masterwork HUCKELBERRY FINN. In volume 2, THE YOUNG MANHOOD OF STUDS LONIGAN, Farrell relates the shenanigans of Studs and his group of palsie-walsies of the 58th Street \\"alky-squad\\" in southside Chicago. Vol. 3, JUDGEMENT DAY, covers the decline of Studs, who has become thin and sickly (bad ticker), and lacks the volatility that made Farrell's characterization so unpredictable, and interesting, in vol. 1 and 2. Looser in structure than the others, vol. 3 also lacks the same fervent pace, but packs no less an emotional wallop...A common misconception, fostered by initial reviews, is that STUDS is about juvenile delinquents, the characters being street urchins and gamin from the underside of big city life. Though it is true that Studs and his pals act like delinquents, they are not from the \\"underside.\\" They are children of middle and lower middle class families. With exceptions (like \\"skunkish\\" Weary Reilley), Studs and his buddies are not bound for prison but for careers as cops, aldermen, businessmen, and politicians' bully-boys. The delinquent behavior of the gang is a \\"sowing of oats\\" before they assume the mantle of respectability. Studs' father is a painting contractor...Like HUCKLEBERRY FINN, which exposes dark truths underpinning the founding of the American Republic--chauvinistic, racist, and anti-intellectual attitudes--STUDS LONIGAN is also an expose of the nightmare beneath the surface of America the Beautiful. The horror of its nightmarish vision is that, rather than delinquents, Studs and company are the boys next door, future leaders, ward bosses, and political functionaries, not gangsters and inmates, and as such, the bulwarks of the nation. (WF Burke, author WRITERS LEFT OF CENTER, Shires Press, 2008.)"},{"Title":"Young Lonigan","review":"Over the past several years, as part of re-evaluating the effect of my half-Irish diaspora heritage (on my mother's side) on the development of my leftist political consciousness I have read, and in some cases re-read, some of the major works of the Irish-American experience. Of course, any such reading list includes tales from the pen of William Kennedy and his Albany cycle, most famously \\"Ironweed\\". And, naturally, as well the tales of that displaced Irishman, the recently departed Frank McCourt and his \\"Angela's Ashes\\", a story that is so close to the bone of my own \\"shanty\\" Irish upbringing that we are forever kindred spirits. That said, here to my mind is the \\" max daddy\\" of all the American disapora storytellers, James T. Farrell, and his now rightly famous trilogy, \\"Studs Lonigan\\" (hereafter, \\"Studs\\").Now my first kinship with James T. Farrell is not through literature, but rather through politics. For a period, and an important one at that, Farrell was a stalwart pro-communist, anti-Stalinist militant writer who served with distinction and honor on the John Dewey headed- Leon Trotsky Commission that tried to determine whether Trotsky was, or was not guilty, of crimes against his beloved Soviet Union during the height of Stalin's Moscow Trials in the late 1930s. Farrell rendered further serious services to the left-wing when he helped organize the defense of the leaders of the Socialist Workers Party during the beginning of World War II when the Roosevelt government had them jailed for opposition to that war. Thus, Farrell came with some good political credential in the eyes of this reviewer.And in his storytelling of his people, the Chicago Irish, Farrell does not let us down either. \\"Studs\\" is only marginally concerned with political issues, and then only of the bourgeois kind rampant amount the Irish in the early part of the 20th century when they were taking over local politics in a number of cities from their former WASP guardians. However, he has hit so many \\"hot buttons\\" about \\"lace curtain\\" Irish sensibilities and the struggle against \\"shanty\\" Irishness that he, Kennedy, and McCourt could have easily compared notes for their respective works.\\"Studs\\", even at a young age, and this first book of the trilogy only goes up to his late teens, is already having his existential crisis at that tender age. And that crisis for him is the tension between that surface \\"lace curtain\\" Irish sensibility that both his father and mother are, in their own very familiar way (familiar to anyone who has had the least bit of traditional Irish upbringing), trying to instill and his natural inclination to go \\"shanty\\" (hang out on corners with the guys, drink, loaf, and chase girls, or at least dream of chasing girls). For those who know, and even for those who don't know, Farrell gives us a primer here of common Irish experiences; the central role of the Church in daily and weekly life, at least on the surface; the \\"virtues\\" of parochial school education by the good sisters; the need to keep the \\"dirty linen\\" of family life in the home, and away from inquisitive neighbors; and, most importantly, the never-ending quest of what to do about girls. That last point drives home, as it does for almost all of us, the real central problem of early teenage existence. Hey, all of this sounds to me like it could have been written today about Irish-American kids, right? And that is what makes Farrell's work resonant to our ears and our eyes ,and is such a good work of literature. More later, as \\"Studs\\" moves into manhood."},{"Title":"Young Lonigan","review":"YOUNG LONIGAN, the short novel that introduces the STUDS LONIGAN trilogy, is the brilliant evocation of the tough youth of a tough kid in pre-WWI Chicago.

Once more Poyer weaves his tale masterfully, but this time he's telling a story about an internationally famous and widely studied event. Many pitfalls no matter how he presents it. So he has taken us inside the USS Monitor and the CSS Virginia, and shows us how it was to those on the scene. They have no clue to the outcome, and they know how many times in the battle a close call could go either way. Tragedy or victory, ending the war, seems within fingertips througout the epoch shaking confrontation. Technology makes a difference and individual personalities makes a difference, but no one could have predicted the end result of a standoff, the most tenuous of all possibilities. Rarely has historical fiction portrayed so well the context surrounding a famous event, showing that \\"nothing had to happen the way it happened when it happened\\", as David McCullough reminds us."},{"Title":"That Anvil of Our Souls: A Novel of the Monitor and the Merrimack","review":"David Poyer is a naval writer of some distinction. Some years ago, I read one of his books and wasn't impressed with it. I returned to him to try again when I bought Fire on the Water, and then its two sequels, A Country of Our Own and the current book, The Anvil of Our Souls. Frankly, I think I'm glad I gave him another try, and I'm considering going back and trying his other stuff again.The three books mentioned above are part of a series of novels that deal with the American Civil War, focusing on the naval aspects of the campaign. The first book recounts the experiences of the crew of a United States warship, most of the officers of which are Southerners. The second book follows the executive officer of that ship as he becomes a Confederate raider on the high seas. This third book instead focuses on most of the rest of the characters from the first book, following the black escaped slave who was a gunner, the doctor (a Southerner), an engineer who understands steam engines, and so forth. One of the main characters of this third volume is the ardent Southerner from the second book, Minter, who's portrayed rather negatively in spite of the fact he's a rebel.The central portion of the plot of this book surrounds the battle between the Monitor and the Merrimac. The author is obviously a sailor himself, and he's apparently done a prodigious amount of research, so everything is very authentic, right down to Worden's Elmer-Fudd-like accent and the method of pointing the guns in the Monitor's turret away from the enemy when reloading. The battle is recounted in considerable detail, and occupies what must be the middle 200 pages of the book. Even though you know how things come out, it's still suspenseful and interesting.I enjoyed this book a great deal, and I'm looking forward to the next book in the series."},{"Title":"That Anvil of Our Souls: A Novel of the Monitor and the Merrimack","review":"I enjoyed the technical detail of the CSS Virginia and the USS Monitor, as well as the somewhat similar and yet very different personalities associated with each. One reviewer stated he thought Poyer had a bias toward one side or the other - I don't think so. I think the book is mostly agnostic and presents the well known arguments for and against both sides as part of the story, without being preachy in either case. It is really more a book about naval technology, strategy, and how the best laid plans can go awry. Poyer is a naval adventure writer who produces literature and not just pulp. He creates the sights, sounds, and smells of the battle. the only thing I did not like about this book was that it was a bit constrained by the conceit of showing the same event from the perspective of perhaps a few too many people. But each of the key characters is well-developed and engaging, even when they might be repulsive or admirable."},{"Title":"That Anvil of Our Souls: A Novel of the Monitor and the Merrimack","review":"This book displays the author's fantastic knowledge of everything \\"civil war\\". However, if you know the history then there is nothing new. I got very bored reading about medical, food, poor attempts at human drama, and mechanics of the era. It seemed like this book was a tedious display of the author's knowledge via the eyes of mediocre characters than a good story. I already know what happened between the two ships, so the plot is non-existent and nothing about the characters adds to it.As a series I found it left some of the main characters hanging. For example, the doctor is one of the only characters to appear in all three. I feel he is only there as a vehicle to display medical knowledge of the era. Another is the engineer who is a shallow character present to describe in tedious detail the engines. The best character in the series is not even present in this book. Perhaps future volumes would have picked them up, but I suspect the series is dead in the water (pun intended). Where else can they go except to the river battles. If more books are written, I would not follow this series."},{"Title":"That Anvil of Our Souls: A Novel of the Monitor and the Merrimack","review":"As usual David Poyer writes a very thorough, very knowlegedable book, in this case the clash of the Merrimack and Monitor. so great is his expertise that the book in overwelming in its presentation of the technical aspects of this two historic vessals.

It seemed that the author was sympathetic to the South and anti North. Even more so, it seemed to be anti Lincoln in that over and over again Lincoln was referred to in various deragatory manners by people of the south as presented by the author. I came away with the feeling that the author was presenting the South as noble and in a favorable light while the North in a less than favorable light in that they were usurping the free men of the South the right to keep people in slavery. Furthermore, the wife on one Southern naval officer being held by the North is raped by another Southern naval officer and totally gets away with this. Maybe there is another book that will follow that will redress this incident, but I do not think I will waste my time."},{"Title":"Classic Popeye Comic: Marketing and Distribution Careers","review":"There are a number of reasons to buy this item. First, it is very rare and unique--a must for comic collectors and afficiandos. Second, it is a prime example of Nixon propaganda. Third, but most important, it was illustrated by the great Geo Wildman!Wildman, a lifelong resident of Connecticut, studied advertising at what is now the Paire College of Art. During the 1950s, he was a successful commercial artist, first working for an ad agency, and then becoming a freelance artist. During this time, he began producing freelance comic book art for Charlton Press in Derby, Connecticut.When King Comics ceased publication of their POPEYE title, Charlton acquired the rights. Longtime writer-artist Bud Sagendorf was busy with the daily and Sunday newspaper comics, and declined the job of continuing. George Wildman was offered a contract to produce the POPEYE illustrations, with prolific Joe Gill writing scripts. The first Charlton issue of POPEYE appears in 1969, the final one in 1977. Wildman was hired as assistant editor to Sal Gentile, and in 1971 was promoted to managing editor, and eventually executive editor. Assistant editor Nicola Cuti wrote several of the later POPEYE scripts for Charlton.Wildman's tenure as editor continued through 1985, while Western Publishing picked up POPEYE under their Gold Key and/or Whitman trademarks. Bill Pearson, by then assistant editor at Charlton, began writing scripts, and Wildman produced illustrations while off-duty from Charlton. Their crowning achievement was the epic 50th anniversary special published in 1979.Thanks to the Robert Altman POPEYE movie, a demand for Popeye-related merchandise led to Wildman's working for Random House, illustrating a classic \\"Pop-Up Book\\" which became a best-seller and later a display at the Smithsonian Institution. Wildman was also invited to produce a painted wooden Easter egg for the White House Easter event, his egg also now housed in the Smithsonian. Around this time, the National Cartoonists Society awarded him \\"Best Cartoonist, Humor Division.\\"Western Publishing ceased its comics line in the early 1980s, and Wildman retired from Charlton Comics in 1985, moving into a freelance comic book and children's book illustration career. His pencils, inks and paints graced publications featuring Disney, Hanna-Barbara, Harvey and Warner Brothers characters along with countless designs for various businesses.In 1994, George and wife Trudy Wildman were honored in a gala festival in Chester, Illinois, celebrating the 100th birthday of the creator of Popeye, Elzie Crisler Segar.

What impresses me most is that the authors have maintained a balanced and rational view on the many diverse and sometimes conflicting inputs - lab. tests, experience in the sport, folklore, practicalities - all of these impinge on the attitudes of athlete and coach, and can result in a lot of confusion and uncertainty. The book does an excellent job in unravelling these tangled strands of knowledge and half-knowledge to present the a clear and accurate picture to the reader. Uncertain points are made clearer, several myths are debunked (some of my own misconceptions were cleared up). Yet where the truth remains hidden or is unclear this is commented upon. Concerning scientific studies the source material is extensive and up to date.The layout and language are so clear and reader-friendly, and the material so interesting that I found it hard to put the book down. However, I'd have to advise readers not to try to take in too much at a time.The few inaccuracies in some of the details didn't detract from the message or the overall quality. There is one slightly surprising omission, namely the absence of any discussion of the Conconi test for aerobic performance.

This book restored my faith in the ability of sports science to provide useful guidance in a field where multiple variables render the usefulness of much research less-than-obvious. I would recommend this book to any athlete who considers the challenge of designing a training program an indispensible part of the fun. If you are looking for step-by-step, do-this-do-that, no-thinking-required instructions on how to train then keep looking, however if you are interested in building an understanding of the principles involved that will allow you to pursue your own training in a more scientific manner then this is well worth a read.

From age four on, Yuri's life is never easy, and his choices, when he has them, are never simple.I found this book harder to relate to than the previous two, but I didn't care about Yuri any less than the other narrators, nor was I less invested in his story. This book will drag you down into the darkness with him, and it's an incredible ride.As another reviewer said, I would not recommend starting with this book. Cagebird does not stand alone as well as the first two might. One needs the background from the first two to really get into Yuri's story and know what's happening. Which isn't a bad thing, of course, because Warchild and Burndive are well worth reading.My only complaint about this book is that it seemed a little rushed at times, and it ended far too soon!"},{"Title":"Cagebird","review":"Wow. Just that. Wow.Warchild made me love.Burndive made me think.This one made me feel.It's uncomfortable, it's raw, it's not easy. It drove me to finish.

I don't agree with it, but I understand it from his point of view now.I wanted more of Jos, and I still do. I wanted more of Ryan, heck I really expected we'd see a lot of him, which we don't. But I got so caught up in the story of Yuri that I honestly didn't miss either of them until the book was over. And frankly, it leaves me wanting more, which is the same feeling I've had since I first read Warchild. Most books, I read them, I finish them, I move on. Not these, they get under your skin. These are books that will end up dog-eared and worn from multiple re-reads.I would NOT recommend starting the series with this book. But for anyone who has read the other two, buy it. Now. And if you haven't read Karin's other books, you really don't know what you are missing."},{"Title":"Cagebird","review":"Lowachee is clearly a writer of great talent and promise. Her first three books (Cagebird is the third of a related series) feature compelling characters, two of whom experience life-shattering atrocities during their childhood. The third protagonist (Burndive) grew up in a reasonably wealthy family--but has his own demons to conquer.Lowachee has the capability to draw me completely into the emotional context of the character's experience. That is a sign of powerful writing. But considering the nature of some of some of those experiences--particularly in Cagebird--this induced empathy is sometimes hard to take. As I read Cagebird, I wondered more than once how much more Lowachee could ratchet up the catalogue of horrors before I'd have to stop reading the thing. I also wondered where Lowachee is going with this. Is it all just emotional titillation? A little dramatic catharsis for those of us who are so jaded that nothing less than child rape and androgynous 13 year old assassin-prostitutes will shock us? (Let the gentler, more sensitive reader beware.)Or is there a deeper matter in this work, does Lowachee have something to say about the mistreatment of children and the consequences of war? I know very well that the atrocities that occur in Lowachee's books happen in our world every day. There are children today who are being abducted by thugs (\\"pirates\\" whould be to grand a word for them), systematically raped, sold into slavery--and some of them grow up to do the same things to other children. If this kind of moral lesson is intended, then I think this is a heavy burden to be borne by a space opera. There are precedents of course--the allegory is a well known literary form. I cannot tell how to read Lowachee: allegory or mere hyper-drama? Perhaps that's my problem, not hers.I do hope that Lowachee matures a bit over the next few years. For one thing, I hope she learns to convey the meaning of suffering without bringing it on by the bargeload. I also hope she learns to write about old people. One can't help but notice that every significant character in the Lowachee books is a pretty male adolescent. Azarcon is is probably over 30, but he is nothing more than a fatherly stereotype. If I could put in a request, I'd like to see a middle-aged woman as the next Lowachee protagonist.Note: I only criticize authors I really like."},{"Title":"Cagebird","review":"Cagebird, the third novel set in the human/Strit universe, is a fantastic build on author Karin Lowachee's first two novels Warchild and Burndrive. Taking place at roughly the same time as Burndrive and Warchild, Lowachee presents the story of Uri Kirov the young pirate introduced at the end of Burndrive. Writing the novel from Yri's perspective was a stroke of genius as he was a less than sympathetic minor character from Burndrive. However, as the story unfolds, you can see how a child could be corrupted in a corrupting environment. Lowachee is very skillful at ratcheting up the tension as you read spellbound Yuri's decent into hell. There are several harrowing scenes including a gut wrenching description of an attack on Yuri's colony when he was only four years old. But what I like about Lowachee's stories is the possibility of redemption. Characters can and do make choices between good and evil. Cagebird, as well as Warchild and Burndrive, remind me of C.J. Cherryh's best union/alliance books. Like Cherryh, Lowachee has created a compelling and very human universe where character compliments spectacle! I hope this author continues to explore the fascinating human/Strit universe. I know I'll be back for more. One warning though, there are some rather explicit descriptions of sex and child abuse. It fits in the story, but might disturb more sensitive readers."},{"Title":"Cagebird","review":"I read \\"Warchild\\" prior to \\"Cagebird\\" and I should have reserved my judgement of Karin Lowachee until then. The first book stood out less, it was easier to dismiss as just another \\"boy grows up to be a warrior\\" adventure romp in space. \\"Cagebird,\\" on ther other hand, was discomfiting, left me disturbed (in a great way), and had me thinking back to \\"Warchild.\\"The writing is stronger here. Instead of meeting Yuri as a child and seeing his life in real-time, we first get a tantalizing glimpse of him as a young man, mysterious, dangerous, and damaged in some ways. The first several pages grab and intrigue you. Yuri's story is told in flashback, it's a more sophisticated writing device and works here very well. Slowly, the whole picture unfolds of why he is who he is.Eventually this book will be filed under the label of \\"Alternate Sexuality.\\" However, there are no labels used in the book. Men and women simply are. The main fixation of Yuri is on his older (male) mentor, but it's so not about that. It's done in a realistic way. Karin Lowachee definitely goes on my list now - recommend unabashedly."},{"Title":"Cagebird","review":"Once again, as in Warchild and Burndive, Karin Lowachee shows her mastery of characterization.What she also shows is that the versatility she displayed in the structuring of her first two novels was no fluke!Jos, Ryan and Yuri are each truly themselves only; Not just as seen from the outside, through great description, but *felt* from the inside out.It takes a special writer to place you inside the heads of three different people and weave such fully unique personalities.I was not disappointed with Cagebird!!"},{"Title":"Cagebird","review":"In Warchild, Karin Lowachee first introduced Captain Vincenzo Marcus Falcone, an ex-marine turned pirate. We caught glimpses of his sickness even then, but it is only fully realized in Cagebird. Falcone's habit of taking on apprentices-prot&eacute;g&eacute;s-resulted in the eventually recruitment of Yuri. As a child, Yuri watched his as his home fell under alien attack. He grew up a stray on a planet turned into a massive refugee camp, and there he met Bo-Sheng, his best friend. Together they entered into the service of Marcus Falcone, a supposed merchant. Anyone who has read the previous books will know what Yuri really encountered.Lowachee introduces Yuri's past in a series of fragments that interrupt current events. Readers encounter first the Yuri of today, broken and embittered by a tormented past. They meet him again as a small child, innocent of the stain that would soon overtake him. The book's message is powerful, the imagery captivating and entirely dark. Readers should beware of graphic sexual situations, including rape. If you can stomach the very darkest parts of Yuri's life, you will also be privy to his arc of possible redemption as he struggles with his past and the future he wants to create. Cairo Azarcon and Jos Musey play very fleeting but important roles. More memorable is a new character, Finch, who serves to draw Yuri from his shell. But it's Yuri's voice that really brings Lowachee's writing to the highest level. Warchild was a stunning debut, though Burndive floundered a bit. Cagebird, however, proves Lowachee was not just a one-hit wonder. Her writing produces powerful and relatable characters in a multifaceted culture. Despite the darkness of this book, there is a tiny ray of light that indicates we can expect more from Lowachee in the future. After Cagebird, I can't wait to see what's coming next."},{"Title":"Cagebird","review":"I don't know what it is about Lowachee's protagonists but they have a way of drawing you in and not letting go. I just finished the last book in this trilogy and I definitely hope that we can get more books out of this series. There's a lot of things left open and I hope it can get a proper ending. I loved this book, the only thing I would have wished for is maybe to have had more interaction between the old characters with the new earlier so it doesn't feel rushed at the end. I hope if another book comes out that it has either Niko or Cairo as the leads!"},{"Title":"Cagebird","review":"I've been a science fiction reader almost since I could read. Cj Cherryh, Isaac Aismov, Ben Bova, and more, I've read them all, but as an adult with varying views, a special place developed in my heart and mind for well written sci fi books with gay/bi characters in a positive role. This one surpassed my imaginings. Not only is the central character, Yuri, compelling in all his flawed beauty and strengths, but the story itself make sense, a very important thing for me. Sure some authors can write good action, battle scenes or aliens, but making it MAKE SENSE interspersed with the emotional parts of the story...well, there are not many who do that well in including gay/bi characters. Yuri and his Finch, the depth of their relationship rings true and movingly.Whether you are interested specifically in gay/bi science fiction or looking for a great space drama this is your book, your series: Warchild, Burndive, then Cagebird, definitely books I keep and reread. Very well done, very satisfying, am thrilled I came across these books. Absolutely thrilled!"},{"Title":"Cagebird","review":"In the third book in her as yet un-named series, Karin Lowachee produces a now familiar story of betrayal and abuse of a young child.The protagonist of this tale, Yuri, is another of the strays who at one time ended up inhabiting the world of Space Pirate Falcone. Unlike its 2 stunning predecessors, the main character in this book seems false, and contrived. Since so much of the book is the carried by the situation, reaction and choices of its main character, the whole book seems muddled. There is also a particularly bad (non) ending - where everything just seems to stop.Yuri actually leads a rather protected life until he is sent out as a 13 year old prostitute. But he isn't just any prostitute he is a Geisha (Lowachee's version) and as such has spent willing years learning the arts of seduction, betrayal, spycraft and murder. And here is the real crux of the problem with the character, Yuri is quite willing to consort with pirates, to kill, torture, maim, steal and betray. His only problem with those actions develops when they disrupt his life, his love affair, and his sense of comfort. He is never as physically devastated as Jos or emotionally tortured as Ryan. He is simply aimless and bored. So he actually chooses to leave his family for a better life, and doesn't much care that he has fallen in with predators.He was never as shattered by the evil that comes his way as were Jos and Ryan, so his sudden attack of conscience hits a false note. He doesn't care that he has done wrong, he only cares that he got caught. He isn't motivated to leave the life of a pirate because of the emotional pain of all the damage he has done to others, but because he at 16-18 or so, is burned out and can't stay on top of the predators he once thought were his friends. His sudden conversion is simply to save his life.The author tries to make Yuri, both evil, and innocent. Evil to serve the story, and innocent to protect sales - since if he carried on in his amoral manner to the bitter end it is unlikely that most readers would continue with Lowachee . She wants to show the depravity of the pirate's world, and the harm they do to their young recruits, but she (or perhaps an anxious Editor) is also trying to keep him 'nice' enough for the readers to embrace, and insure that her books continue to sell. So you get a conjunction of Yuri's: The Yuri in love with his sex-teacher/Elder Brother and the Yuri who enjoys displaying the perqs of power by shooting a fellow crew-member for the hell if it. None of the Yuris form a coherent whole. None of the Yuris seem real or their actions, thoughts or feelings believable.In the first 2 books I believed that the author was telling the stories of 2 young children that she knew, even with the SF trappings they seemed like real people, and their abuse, and reactions seemed real. Yuri seems like a literary construct who was designed to elicit sympathy, horror and finally comfort -- because for no apparent reason, he chooses the path of goodness.Finch, as his victim/co-conspirator is also muddled and not well done. There is no convincing reason for his ending up in prison, since once he gets there he acts like a babe in the woods, without even the sense to try and bluff to save his own life. Their mutual and instant attraction is another unbelievable attempt to hook Yuri into the good side. That Yuri would rather spend time with and protect Finch than with Rikev who is his \`sister', supporter and fellow Geisha makes no sense. As does Yuri's sudden inability to even attempt to deal with Cal, and his crocodile-tears concern for the 6,000 nameless potential victims on the star carrier.Once Yuri \`the good twin' swings into action, he and few other \`worthy' characters end up safe with Azarcon on the Macedon. Of course Yuri now has to accept the penance of Azarcon, who some how sees himself as the camp counselor for the galaxy's damaged children, as if he didn't contribute his own child to the sacrificial heap. At the very end we are left with Yuri pondering the fact that he has to make changes in himself to change his life. Duh. The story or plot is simply put on hold for the depiction of this platitude. And the only change in the whole story arc is simply to get Yuri out of prison and onto the Macedon.Finally Lowachee has taken what was an interesting tool, the reflection of known past events by a different character, and let it become a crutch that fills up way too many pages towards the end of the book. In Burndive we saw a few events that Jos lived through from another angle. In Cagebird there are simply pages and pages of old story regurgitated rather than anything new being developed. It didn't help to make Yuri more believable or more likeable, and it didn't move the story forward - it was just filler that crowded out what could have been an actual tying up of the plot, or a setting up for book 4.While I have been tough on Lowachee and disappointed by the flaws in this book, I would also say that it is still a better book than most others published in SF. If she had not already shown how she can truly sing with the first 2 books, this one would probably seem perfectly acceptable. But it isn't up to the standards set by Warchild and Burndive. I hope book 4 will redeem Lowachee and that she will stick to working with sympathetic main characters, since she is unwilling (or unable) to allow those lower down the food chain to be as amoral or as evil as they need to be to maintain the illusion of reality."},{"Title":"Cagebird","review":"When Yuri was four years old, the aliens who were at war with humanity, raided Plymouth Moon killing many colonists, and injuring a lot more. The survivors were relocated to the planet Grace, a half terraformed rock that was low on the basic things of life; food ,shelter and medicine. During the evacuation Yuri, his father and his siblings were separated from his mother and sister who were taken to another camp and it looked like the family would never be reunited.One day a visitor Bo-Sheng arrived on Grace and recruited Yuri to work on a merchant ship. When he signed up and was brought aboard, he learned he was on a pirate ship and he was Captain Falcone's new prot&eacute;g&eacute;e. During his years on the ship he learned to be a geisha who spied on the competition, a killer and eventually a captain on his own ship. He was eventually captured by Black Ops and made a deal with them but when you deal with the devil, a heavy price is paid as Yuri learns to his cost.CAGEBIRD is not for the faint of heart. There are graphic scenes of violence and training to be a geisha, which includes explicit scenes of same sex and male-female sex. Making love is not a pleasure in this book but a tool that pirates use to disarm the enemy, get information and recruit young blood. Yuri never had a chance to be a child and when he is finally caught by the authorities, they want him to pimp for their cause. Karin Lowachee provides a thought provoking science fiction thriller that applies to the world today.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Cagebird","review":"Warchild was a perfect book, especially in times like this, well, Vietnam, Afganistan, Iraq, and something which WILL come next.Burndrive? Hmm, it was a NECESSARY book to unfold the unfinished story of the universe, war and peace.Cagebird? Difficult. Difficult to be absorbed int the story. I am not mentioning some violences AND child abuses AND sexual assualts.Believe in or not, they are the key elements in all kinds of wars and riots. Especially, in wars which involvethe clash of different cultures.Some readers seems to feel awkward about child sexual abuses in this book, but come on, please?There isn't simply any single war nowadays which dosen't sexually abuse innocent children.Sexual assaults or traumas or memories involving children like these are horrible, but they have clear purposes not less than missiles or nukes.Bad guys uses these horror to control kids 100%. (If there are good guys in wars. Don't ask me.)So I can see all horror episodes in this book as natural causes.But a victim-children-turned-into-hero of this book?Yuri is too sensitive & too well-focused to be believed as a victim children.He remembers all atrocities of his life AND is focused like that?It is his well-focused ways of thinking which makes me uncomfortable.I suppose, although the author is absolutely talented, it was a impossible goal from the start : to make a victim a hero of a book which involve so many actions and plots."},{"Title":"Cagebird","review":"Its that book you can't put down, and then when you have to, you run it over and over in your head.

He was a Mormon and an Apostle of the Church in Utah at a time when the principle of plural marriage was going out of favor with the Church. In addition to Nettie May, the author's mother, John married five other women, had thirty-six children, and still managed to remain a heroic, beloved figure to all of them throughout his entire life. Each of the six wives lived secure in the knowledge that she was his favorite and each believed herself immensely priveleged to share, even briefly, the life of a prophet.A magnetic, forceful, tremendously enthusiastic man, John Taylor lived through a time of change and refused to bend. When the Church abolished the practice of polygamy, he didn't. Holding fast to 'the law of Abraham,' he took three more wives and was dropped from the Church for doing so.Nettie May knew that entering plural marriage with John meant taking on a lifetime of insecurity. For seven years after her marriage she couldn't even admit that she was married, although she had borne her husband three children. As politics changed, she was alternately a child-producing 'widow' on the underground and one of the elite of Mormondom as the respected wife of an Apostle. She had married a plunger and a speculator who even without the uncertainty of the times would have given her a chaotic married life. John's grand-scale schemes ranged from land speculation in Canada and the Utah desert to gold mining in Mexico and wild gambles on such unlikely inventions as a rungless ladder. He made fortunes one month and lost them the next. But Nettie May had a wonderful and breathless ride on the coattails of John W. Taylor in a life that was at best precarious, at worst never dull.FAMILY KINGDOM tells a story that is highly unusual to say the least, and tremendously interesting. It is filled with the warmth and humor of a big family that stuck together in spirit no matter how hot the persecution or how far they were physically separated. Both as an unusual and absorbing story and as a unique contribution to a little-known side of American history, FAMILY KINGDOM is an important and extremely rewarding book.\\""},{"Title":"Baby's Scrapbook","review":"This scrap book is perfect.

It's a very random, uneventful death.\\" And for that reason (among a few others) it is an unimportant tale to tell and a waste of time to read. But it is that reason - that it is an unexciting death, random, uneventful - that it is worth reading because it paints a detailed picture of all of us. You don't read Tolstoy for the fantastic; its not Harry Potter after all. But what Tolstoy has a great talent for is to take a single event, a single life, and turn into all of humanity. How many of us are Ivan Ilych, rushing headlong into eternity with no sense that at any moment we may cease to be? So, in a sense, it is a very existential novella because it speaks to the purpose of existence and to the right way that one should live.

In todays fast-paced, modern day society, Ivan Ilyich appeared to have it all--a high-profile job, a beautiful wife, a well-educated child, and a future son-in-law that most parents would be proud to have in the family. When Ivan Ilyich realizes that he is dying all that he thought he wanted in life is put into question. This book is descriptive, evoking powerful and provacative questions that cause the reader to reflect on one's own life.This is not a lengthy book, but Tolstoy has managed to discuss the subject of death and create a concise, philosophical piece.

Through the discovery of his illness, to the pain of it and trying to cope, then his feelings of abandonment of his wife and family.One of the few books I have read in my life that touched me because for me it was at a time when I felt as if I was \\"him\\".Everybody should read this once in their life."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"The Death of Ivan Ilyich tells the tale of a man whose seemingly perfect life was, in reality, nothing more than a sham. It begins after Ivan Ilyich's death, then backtracks to summarize his life and the events leading up to his final moments.Throughout the account of his life (which probably could've been shorter), we see Ivan Ilyich living a life dictated by the demands of society. Everything he does is for show and respectability. Not once does he form real relationships, not even with his wife and children. The only thing in life he actually enjoys is playing cards.As Ivan Ilyich's health begins to deteriorate, he is forced to look back on his life and evaluate it in light of his death. What he finds shocks him.This book is a debunking of everything society says is important - reputation, wealth, stability, comfort. It is a challenge to all who would die well, to make the most of the little time we have and live a life that counts, a life that has meaning, a life that is real."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"This is an exceptional book. On one front, you have an opportunity to explore Tolstoy's mind without devouring one of his more notable (and lengthy) novels (War and Peace, Anna K). That alone should be worth reading the 100 or so pages.On another front, this work ranks up there as one of the greatest literary achievements since ink found its way on paper. Do not be fooled by the titled. This book is not about death, but about life. After finishing this book, one question loomed frequently in my head: is death nothing more than a state of mind?"},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"There are books that must be read and reread, and there are great pieces of literature that really tell as much about the reader as the characters in the story. This story is great literature.I have read this short story several times, and am amazed at how much changes each time I read it.A simple plot. A successful judge, moving &quot;up the ladder&quot; (as we all aspire to), has what turns out to be a fatal accident. Over the next few months his health deteriorates and as he suffers he (and each of us as readers) is forced to see himself and the people in his life through a different lens. Slowly he has to grapple with THE great questions: What is life about? Has my life been worthwhile?The structure is superb. By giving us the story in the sequence he does, Tolstoy forces us to see his point, without being \`preachy' or pedantic. The gentle touch of a genius."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"The Death of Ivan Ilyich was a wonderful book that dove deep in to the realities of the death of Ivan. The character in the book named Ivan faces the fact that his life is going to be cut short, and he realizes that he never had the good life he wanted. I thought that this book gave a good realization on what death could be like, and what a person could truly go through. This book had a wonderful plot hat really left a person thinking, and wondering what would be in store for them. The book gave the reader a good sense of what Ivan was going through. Through out the book Ivan was denying the fact that he was going to die, and was in a sense going insane form all of his thoughts. In the end of the book, the author showed us how Ivan got over that insanity and how he accepted his fate."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"Much has been said about the quality of this book, but I read it from a physician's perspective as a patient history. Certainly the physicians in Ivan's life let him down, not telling him the truth about his cancer and his imminent death. He missed such an opportunity to relate to his family. It is so masterfully written that I expect to be able to look up the chart. We as physicians need to help pave the way when we can not treat the disease, to resolve conflicts and improve relationships not hide behind a falsehood tha, &quot;oh, you'll get better&quot;.

Reading it is an education into death--what it is like to die, but also of the potentialities that that awful process can take. Additionally, the novel is, oddly enough, funny. It accurately and realistically captures the self-centeredness of acquaintances, friends and family, in a manner so starkly true that it cannot help but be funny. For while Ivan goes through the process of illness, of physical pain and growing mental anguish, of denial and then acceptance, his wife, family, and colleagues incorporate the prospect of his death into their daily self-observed machinations, complacent that it is he, not they, who are dying. Additionally, the smug ineptitude of his doctors and their pomposity is gratifyingly portrayed. Tolstoy, as perhaps one of the four or five most revered novelists in history has an utter grasp of the human mind, its interior monologue, its rationalizations, as well as the politics of day to day conversation. The Death of Ivan Ilych can be a life changing read, and a reminder of the heights genius can scale in artistic creation."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"Not only are Tolstoy's stories enjoyable with their touching detail and, do contain valuable messages, they, are also beneficial in developing our writing skills.Death of Ivan Ilych: An upper middle class man is consumed with how to deal with the prospect of his death: the increasing pain in his body, and the question of why; the self-analyzing, the self-pity, anger, to finally, the last hours--acceptance.

I read this years ago as a student, and found myself remembering its bleak evocations of pain and loneliness. This is a strong story, not for the weak-willed or casual reader. I find it works better, perhaps, for those who've undergone some encounters with those facing death, although it may arouse sad memories.Now middle-aged, I listened to the Naxos audiobook version with Oliver Ford Davies in returning to the novella. In audio versions, Naxos intersperses classical music from the period deftly. Here, interludes enhance what will prove a harrowing, but necessary, delineation of how one man faces the Biq Question of how death comes, at last, to us no matter what.Davies captured the officious nature of those around Ivan, colleagues and family, who were faced with the necessary burdens of paying respects and going through the familiar motions we all have, once we've lived awhile, of attending to the impact of death on one we work with or know, but whom we don't feel all that close to. The tedium of funereal arrangements, and the impact of what a colleague or family member's loss will mean for us, will sound all too convincing, for many of us. Tolstoy makes us see, first, Ivan's demise through their perspectives, as ones we recognize with a twinge of guilt.Then, he shifts to his wife turned widow; we hear her own mixed reactions: she's happy in a way to be free of the torment of a husband she'd grown distanced from, and one whose last hours were but a howl of agony, from the hearing of her, their son, and their household, this being a respectable judge's residence. We understand her weariness with the duties inflicted upon family, and the wish, often unspoken but nearly always felt, by the survivors that the dying one be finally gone.The doctor is also harried, and we hear from him the routine platitudes and vague assurances that any patient does, no matter how grave the case. It's another day at the office for the medical profession, and what's a case study to solve for them reminds Ivan of his own aloofness as an educated, but detached, judicial functionary, above the reality felt by the troubled man brought before him to be analyzed and sentenced. Again, Tolstoy presents the administrative or familial point of view fairly, and steadily. It's human nature to step away from the messiness of fate and mortality, after all.Finally, we enter into Ivan's consciousness, indirectly but powerfully. Oliver Ford Davies navigates the gradual move from complacency and self-regard into raw, cold, mental and physical and spiritual brutality. Only forty-five, mostly convinced as most of us that success lies in accomplishments, comforts, a career, and status despite his misgivings, Ivan must confront what we all fear. Davies shows how he moans and contorts, in thoughts and words, as his final moments near. Gerasim, a servant, by his humble commitment to bedside duties helps Ivan find a saving grace of comfort when most needed.The final moments of this tale moved me to tears as I heard them. I recommend an audiobook version as this takes you away from too quickly skimming over the nuances of emotion and subtlety which Tolstoy brings to this novella. Hearing the prose reminds us of our common fate, and how Tolstoy captures unforgettably the revelation that we can only hope is not an illusion. The delicacy and craft with which he creates the same reactions in us as Ivan undergoes will astonish you."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"The book is in new shape and arrived within the time period.

It is difficult to imagine a more painful, slow and distressful way of ceasing to be. The target member or organ swells into a volcano of pus; the nerves, overwhelmed by a blaze of pain signals that incessantly climb them, spit legions of sharp impulses in the brain, involving it in a storm of pain, dissolving consciousness itself in agony; the fever march over the muscles drowning the skin in sweat (the shirts of the patient will need to be continuously exchanged, as one after another they soak in smelly water); the stomach, revolted in acidity, is assaulted by constant nausea ; the esophagus is burned by jets of constant vomiting; the lungs, as if crushed by invisible hands, are possessed by an overwhelming air hunger, but can not breath it, even though surrounded by the element. The mouth of the patient is always invaded by a bad taste, by a disgusting flavor. No position ever brings comfort, as pain is eternal, insatiable: the dying man lies on his back, but the pains will keep punishing him without forgiveness; he turns to the right (with the help of nurses), and after feel a little relieved, is again invaded by the torment that will only hide himself sometimes, but that shall never go away; the patient once more turns his body, now to the left, and there it is the pain one more time, gnawing slowly, but always, never satiated. As a hot and hungry rat, the tumor gnaws the bowels of the sick, in a lonely fight: there is no one with who to share that suffering, for no one would understand it. Inside the body, in the flesh, within the soul, is this terrible fever mouse, the tumor, death, and its hunger will never leave, but continue to feed itself, without noise, without any rest, without ever offering forgiveness. The mouse is here, everybody knows, the doctors can see it through test, through the X-rays; it is exposed for all eyes, and yet it is not possible to pull it out, to dissolve it, to extirpate it from the sick body: it has become an appendage of its victim. Morphine, in principle, gagged the biting mouth of the rat, dissolved the pinching and stabbing pain; with time, however, nothing will be able to contain the suffering. No position in bed brings comfort; no thought caresses the suffering and desperate mind; shouts and screams of pain do not produce any relief in leaving the throat. While the patient dissolves into unspeakable torments, his hospital room is filled with a putrid smell; everyone who enters the room, getting the flurries in the nauseated nostrils, know that death is there, sitting on the patient's bed, contemplating him. The food of the sick patient is nothing more than mere rice and mashed potatoes, which are swallowed with much pain and difficulty. Bathing, urinating and defecating are no longer normal physiological facts, but torment and shame (the patient can no longer relieves himself alone, but relies on adjutant ward, which include the complete abandonment of all dignity). The relatives await death without any tiny flame of hope (in fact, though ashamed to admit it, crave it, because they themselves want to go back to the living world, leaving the terrible atmosphere of the universe of the dead); they do not even speak to the dying man about a battle against the disease, asking him to get excited and do not despair, because they know that even for him the end is not a secret. Death is not the greatest of all torments: suffering has taken its place, has put is crown.Here is the subject of the story of Tolstoy, The Death of Ivan Ilicht. The book narrates, in a rapid flow of events, the life of his main character, narrates, also, in surgical details, the whole process of his illness and death. Death was never portrayed so horribly, horribly in being so lucidly, precisely and scientifically described. Tolstoy examines death as if dissecting a body, referring to every sinew, every nerve, every vein, every bone, to each muscle. Death is a creature that the writer puts on his desk, rummaging through its bowels with a coldness at the same time admirable and terrible.The tale is also extremely beautiful. There is no place for romantic ideas about death, for poetic words and thoughts sanitized with colored inks. With accuracy and precision of a geometer, Tolstoy builds a wonderfully pure, crystalline and clear narrative about one of the greatest horrors known to human beings: our one finitude. In order to do a full autopsy on the creature, the novelist chooses a painful, agonizing, and especially slow way of dying, and with it curses his main character. Thus, his study can accommodate the entire development of the consciousness of the dying: from the first symptoms, through the increasing of pain, by the boiling of the initial fears and concerns, through the first scary ideas about a possibility of death, until reaching the stage where death is already a certainty, where the dying person must accept its destiny and realize that soon will be its time to sleep and dive into the abyss of the unknown. The beauty achieved by Leo Tolstoy is derived in great part to his fanatical preoccupation with details, with accuracy; as mentioned before, one has the impression that a coroner is producing a necropsy report, and the corpse which is now itself being dissected is death itself, in all its details.The whole journey into nothingness is approached with an almost unbearable clarity: Tolstoy casts a very strong light on the subject, to be able to discern every detail, every little appendages and organs of its anatomy. Nothing escapes him: the bad taste in the mouth of Ivan Ilicht, the night sweats; the pain, gnawing in his internal tissues, sucking all his forces, licking his organs; the fear and denial of Ivan Ilicht and pity and final relief of his relatives; the repressed desire of the dying man for love (and, more importantly, his shame of yearning for caresses and strokes); the difficulty in meeting the most basic functions such as defecation; the lack of hope for Ivan and his sudden and pathetic faith in a resumption of health improvement occurred only a few hours before death; the weight on the chest that feels upon Ivan few days before he died ... Everything is analyzed, nothing is abandoned. This is one of the greatest qualities of Tolstoy's genius: his absorption of details, of each tiny body hair of the body of experience. Nothing will go unnoticed: He knows all environments, from a prostitute simple room to the large hall of the palace of the Kzar; he knows people clothes: the suits, the dresses, the pajamas; he knows all the physical sensations, in all its minimum characteristics; he knows (and have already felt - for that see his diaries) all the mental moods of mankind, such as envy, hatred, love, lust; he knows every thought that, if we wanted to write, we would find it ideal to tell, but we would not remember to quote (when we read him we always feel that what it is said is exactly what needed to be said). It is a man who had seen much, who has lived many experiences and (more important) knew when and how to bring each one of them to the work he was writing. Such details and sensations, because they are experienced by each of us, being read, hit us (because we have already feel that that now we read), as if it were exactly the perfect thought and phrase for the situation. To bring, however, such feelings and thoughts in the exact right moment and form in a narrative is a skill of genius, something extremely difficult to obtain. For that, thak you, mister Leo Tolstoy.Obs.

It's basically a critique of modern secularism and capitalism and how the ethic inculcated by both can poison life with meaninglessness. It revolves around the idea that death can become de-personalized, abstracted and pushed to the side in secular society - thus obscuring the horizon of our own death and allowing us to treat in a cavalier fashion the choices we make in life. It implores us to, among other things, cultivate deep human relationships so that we are spared from looking back on our lives and finding nothing substantial - nothing more than a mere cog in the machinery of an artificial society with insubstantial goals.

It is certainly great enough to buy alone but is also available in many editions with other stories, so there is no reason to get this unless one especially likes the translation.However, there is certainly no denying the excellence of the story itself. Tolstoy's first work of fiction in some time, it was greeted with worldwide enthusiasm, and it is a testament to its greatness that it did not disappoint. That conversion had a profound effect on Tolstoy's fiction is almost immediately clear, but his genius is still very much intact. The most obvious change is greatly increased didacticism; his major works always had overriding themes, but suddenly he was not only trying to say something but to make us act on it. The story is in one sense a portrait of a type - the hard-working, upwardly mobile, middle-class worker whose rise is admirable but who is perhaps ambitious to a fault and becomes so obsessed with advancement, success, and impressing others that he neglects all else to the detriment of himself and those dependent on him. Such people are rarely happy despite all the ostensible success; ambition keeps them in constant frenzy, and they are always worried about falling behind, becoming irritable and impatient. Family life, if they have one, is superficial and often miserable. Eventually they find, as Ivan does, that none of their gains bring peace of mind. Ivan is thus a warning; we must see his hopeless path's folly unless, like him, we die before amends can be made. The essential moral is thus so familiar as to be sentimentally clich&eacute;d - we must realize that the everyday aspects of life that few even think of after all take up most of our time, and neglecting them for supposedly higher worldly things is hardly the best or easiest way to happiness. Tolstoy conveys this so convincingly - and, what is far more important, movingly - that we could forgive the hackneyed message even if there were nothing more. However, his presentation is so compelling that the simple message actually reaches sublime heights, creating a true masterpiece even on this very limited scale.But of course there is far more. One need not look far to find strong evidence of the anti-capitalist, anti-materialist philosophy Tolstoy then held. The story is in great part a modern dramatization of Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, the basis for Tolstoy's theology; we should renounce worldly vanities for truly higher things. Few have called \\"The Death\\" a Christian story, but it is in this way one of the most truly Christian works. The famed agnostic Robert G. Ingersoll said that Tolstoy was the truest and most sincere Christian alive, and this is evidence. Of course one need not agree with Tolstoy to appreciate the story, as its core messages are universal; by using one character (Jesus) as inspiration and another (Ivan) as his vehicle, Tolstoy speaks to all.Perhaps the story's most elemental and sadly relatable element is its relentlessly unflinching, nearly obsessive death focus. Though only about sixty pages, it seemingly deals with all death's forms. The most immediate is simply a very detailed realist portrayal of a sick man's slow decline. Anna Karenina's long deathbed scene had already taken this tack, but this goes even further, emphasizing nearly every conceivable detail so painstakingly that we get a near-physical sense of how such a situation feels. Russian writers are famous for showing the dark sides of life that most authors, especially then, were unable or unwilling to even admit, and this is one of Tolstoy's major contributions. Death is also approached philosophically; this is indeed one of Tolstoy's most philosophical works despite the brevity. Ivan's ruminations are unfortunately representative to the extent that people think of death in any real way - it was but an abstract concept until it hit him. Tolstoy goes into the various psychological reasons for this with his usual acuity; his detailed, lifelike exposition of Ivan's thoughts is one of literature's most compelling psychological portraits. However, Ivan is again essentially a warning; few have ever been as fully aware of death as Tolstoy, and the work would serve a great purpose if it imparted even a little of his knowledge to readers - not because death is avoidable but so they can make their lives meaningful in a way Ivan was unaware that he could do until it was too late.Those lacking Tolstoy's meliorism may consider pointing out such a thing useless - or even perverse -, and even many Christians will be puzzled. Christianity after all teaches that life is vanity, that we should focus on heavenly things, and that earthly suffering is of no consequence because the good will be rewarded eternally in heaven. Here we begin to see Tolstoy's unorthodoxy and get significant insight into why his theology was almost universally denounced. Lacking belief in an afterlife, he wisely thought that we must make the most of this life, though not of course by embracing materialism. The story does not go into detail about what we should do instead, though Tolstoy's non-fiction covers that in detail. What it does do is show the other path's fatal consequences, and whether or not we agree, it is impossible to deny the strength of the argument as thus dramatized or the story's central power. Perhaps the most remarkable thing of all is that, unlike most art that tries to alter behavior, the story is not heavy-handed. Didactic elements arise naturally from the story and never overwhelm it - a lesson from which most sociopolitically conscious writers have much to learn.Though obviously famous for long works, those who read Tolstoy know that his prose is not overblown. He is indeed nothing less than precise and even concise, saying exactly what he needs to say straight-forwardly and - in the best sense - simply. His works are not lengthy because of excessive detail, overlong dialogue, or florid description but simply because they tackle so many issues and have so much depth. Nor is he hard to read in the usual literary way so feared by students; no Modernist, he avoids difficult language, is strikingly non-allusive, and otherwise writes in a way that anyone - or at least anyone willing to deal with length - can understand. \\"The Death\\" exemplifies this. It is the collection's shortest story, but its wealth of ideas and emotions are surely already clear. The economy of language is truly remarkable, definitively showing that Tolstoy is not only a master stylist but simply a master even in an area considered his weak point.All told, \\"The Death\\" should definitely be read, but it would be hard to justify by this or any other standalone edition."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"An excellent, soulful book in the vein of The Trial, and Crime and Punishment. Vladimir Nabokov sums my views of this Novella quite well.In his lectures on Russian Literature Russian born Novelist and critic Vladimir Nabokov argues that, for Tolstoy, a sinful life is (such as Ivan's was), moral death. Therefore death, the return of the soul to God is, for Tolstoy, moral life . To quote Nabokov: \\"The Tolstoyan formula is: Ivan lived a bad life and since the bad life is nothing but the death of the soul, then Ivan lived a living death; and since beyond death is God's living light, then Ivan died into a new life- Life with a capital L.\\"(Nabokov, Vladimir Vladimirovich: Lectures On Russain Literature pg.237: Harcourt Edition)"},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"Ask most people to name a work written by Leo Tolstoy and nine times out of ten you'll get two responses: &quot;War and Peace&quot; and &quot;Anna Karenina.&quot;However, one thing that I've learned about literature is that it is usually not a good idea to acquaint yourself with an author by reading a 1500+ page opus first. It's usually better to start with a shorter work so that you can get a feel for the writer's style. After all, a good author is one who teaches you how to read his/her book as you go.&quot;The Death of Ivan Ilych&quot; is a representation of Tolstoy's later literary output, following his religious conversion, staunch forsaking of all material possessions, and strict refusal to engage in sexual relations with his wife. His two greatest known works were written BEFORE this &quot;conversion,&quot; consequently they are very different from this.However, that is not to say that this isn't an extremely engaging read. Probably the most &quot;Dostoevskian&quot; of all Tolstoy's works, it is an dark, existential view of a man's death (or rather, his &quot;life&quot;)and the realizations he comes to on his death bed. Look for how the first chapter corresponds to his life's aims for a good piece of literary irony.Not a happy story by any stretch of the imagination, but a powerful one nontheless."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"I was fairly young when I first read the Death of Ivan Ilyich, and the man's story fascinated me.

Tolstoy is indeed a great author."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"Few literary works are capable of properly representing Christianity especially in such a brilliant way. The few that do are Flannery O' Connor and Dostoevsky's works. However, the problem that occurs is that people who are not Christians in order to understand the work create their own idea of what the author is trying to say. For instance, The Death Of Ivan Ilyich is often seen only in existential terms by those that are not Christian or is given a broad psychological analysis. What the work is really about is the selfishness of man, his loneliness,and the meaninglessness of life without Christ. He empahsizes the meaninglessness by Ilyich and their all consuming materialism. Notice how no matter how much his wages increase it isn't enough. This should resonate with American society, however it is too busy trying to act as Ivan and his family did. Although, written before Capitalism, Tolstoy stunningly rebukes it. In addtion, he brilliantly shows what true Christianity is about and not as the American church would like people to perceive it. For instance, he repeatedly emphasizes the notion of dying to sin (dead to sin) and being alive in Christ. But this is too often missed because people have failed to understand the true nature of Christianity. How he does this is brilliant. For instance, in the beginning of the book his supposed friends are seen as thinking well at least he's dead and I'm not. But Tolstoy is mocking them and everyone who thinks this way. For they are really dead in that they are spirtually dead and slaves to sin, while Ivan has moved on from being dead in sin to dead to sin and alive in Christ. This is what baptism is supposed to represent. Chiefly, this work is a blatant example of the process that an individual undertakes when they convert to Christianity. As a result, those that are not Christian too often don't understand the story and great it is. If you want to examine more work that is equally brilliant read Flanney O'Connors short story's, especially A Good Man is Hard to Find, which is best story available on demonstrating God's grace and essence of the gospel. As to the person who said that the story is ruined by the ending being told at the beginning you are missing the point entirely. Tolstoy was more interested in the content in the story making a specific point, rather than shrouding the ending in mystery. Additionally, the reader is unaware that Ivan will convert to Christianity in the end, so the ending is still not entirely known to the reader. And the title is ironic because Ivan is the one that actually finds life and didn't die, while all the other characters are spiritually dead with the exception of Geraism the servant. He actually represents God's grace being actively present on earth."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"This book asks powerful and important questions. When it is time for you to die, how will you view your life? What will you value about who you were? What is important to do and to finish before you go?The story presented a powerful impact on me because it had both a strong synthesis and contrast to my my mom, who died of cancer when I was 23. The synthesis is found in the questions; she had to face who she had been all her life, how she had spent herself, what things she had pursued, and how she should prepare for death.Unlike our friend Ivan, though, she was able to answer those questions quite well. She had lived a life that was meaningful in its submission to God, in her desire to love and serve others to display the glory of her King, and in her consistent choices to do the right thing because she had been saved and forgiven by Christ. For her, death was scary, but not something to fear, because her sins had been washed away.This book is very healthy because it presents the extreme danger of a self-serving life. We see a man who has no purpose, who serves only self, and who through self-deceit manages to waste his entire life. These sorts of books are quite healthy for us to look at and understand. My hope and prayer is that you and I will be able to look back someday and know that, once saved and forgiven by Christ, we went on to serve and honor our glorious Creator, thereby living a life of meaning."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"I can't read Russian, but I have to imagine that it's better than this garbage translation of \\"The Death of Ivan Ilych.\\"Do yourself a favor and buy a more expensive copy, otherwise you'll lose the story and become angry with the translators."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"Go see American Beauty.

The mans life has no meaning nor value and no one cares that his is dying. Those around him jockey for his position or concern themselves with securing a larger pension. A short book, perhaps three hours long. Tolstoy's books are engrossing because the reader sees himself in one of the characters. I look at Ivan Ilyich and see nothing of myself in him and so it is difficult to appreciate the death of a worthless person."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"I had to read this for a class. It was just as joyless as its title sounds. The story is that of a mean fake materialistic dude who realizes he screwed everything up while he is dying and realizes he realized this too late.I give this book one star, since on amazon, 1 star correlates to \\"I hate it\\", which is how I feel about this book. I don't think it is badly written or executed, just completely joyless and depressing. Its written extremely well, however the effect of this at least for me was I felt depressed while reading this book and after finishing it, since everything about it is so dour.Writing this review reminds me of a quote from hamlet:This above all: to thine own self be true,And it must follow, as the night the day,Thou canst not then be false to any man.Farewell, my blessing season this in thee!This is basically the message of the book, restated in a positive manner. Its ironic and telling that somehow Tolstoy hated Shakespeare's works. Clearly he didn't share his exuberant love of life, and was preoccupied enough with his own death to write this sad novel. Sadly Tolstoy became even more preoccupied with death and his own mortality after writing this (according to various bios), rather than it being cathartic for him. I doubt I will ever read any of his other works after reading this. I would recommend Dostoevsky's \\"crime and punishment\\" instead."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"I felt that this book lacked the kind of depth it needed to properly convey its meaning. Tolstoy rambles too much to make the story truely *interesting*, and Ivan Ilyich's untimely and meaningless end left me wondering &quot;well, then, what was the point of writing the story?&quot; The only factor that convinced me to give this book two stars instead of one was that at least the fellow gave it a really good try. Basically, it's too flat to cater to those who enjoy poetic or &quot;flowery&quot; writing, any messages Tolstoy manages to put across seem obvious and clich&eacute;d, and the characters have even less depth than the story. Furthermore, Tolstoy's apparent feeling about the nature of humanity is bleaker than Poe's. So if you want to read something meaningful with a mildly religious feel, go for George MacDonald or Peter S. Beagle and at least get a little enjoyment out of it. If you absolutely must read this book, though, take my advice and keep a bottle of Prozac handy. You'll need it."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"I chose to read this novella for a school project. I chose it because it seemed to have a good plot, etc. When I started reading it, I thought to myself that it was just \\"a slow beginning\\" which many wonderful books sometimes have. Unfortunately, most if not all of this books contents were dull and uninteresting. This is MY personal opinion of this book. Also, DON'T choose this book for a school project if you're trying to get a glimpse of the Russian culture, because there is really nothing here. Just a rich lawyer dying very slowly.

It has some unique ideas on death and religion, but I would only suggest it to people interested in DEATH and/or RELIGION. To someone wanting to read a decent book -- DO NOT PICK THIS ONE. If you've got to do a book report or something like that, I would DEFINETLY recommend this book.

I'd love to know -- what is everyone else getting out of this that I'm not?!Look, I'm not a person who struggles with hidden meanings or roundabout wording. I was reading Charles Dickens by the age of 11. But this... THIS I don't understand. As far as I'm concerned, it's a rambling, ranting, overwritten account of some random fellow's entire and entirely UNNECESSARY life story, interspersed with events leading to his death. It isn't an exciting death. It's a very random, uneventful death. This entire book was a waste of my time to read, and a waste of the author's time to write as far as I can tell.Really now. I mean REALLY, people... if someone can explain to me why any of this is useful or extraordinary, why it even qualifies as literature, I'll be happy to listen. But I've wondered and pondered and read it over again to see if I missed some single, crucial sentence that tied it all together... and no. No, I'm sorry, but if Tolstoy intended to communicate some lesson in the pages of this book, he failed miserably as far as I'm concerned. The man simply was not writing to whatever percentage of his audience I represent.I guess it's existential or something. Look... my advice is this: if you don't start to get something out of it by the end of the first chapter, put it away and don't look at it again. Ever.Utter nonsense, I call it. Oy."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"Since my own death is not imminent, or at least I do not know it for sure, the accuracy of Tolstoy's assumption on how Ivan Ilyich might have felt about his death is unsure. Above all, Ivan Ilyich is an imaginary person who did not and does not exist at all. Yet, the description of how this man felt while he was dying feels so real. I once read a theory, somewhere I don't recall, that the moment you are dying is the summation of how you lived your life and until you are about to die you will never know how your life has been.Unfortunately I cannot testify the truthfulness of the theory as I obviously have not experienced the moment of my death. However, I can speculate how I may feel if I must die next week, tomorrow, or even later on today. Then I realize that we all tend to be in a strong denial as far as death is concerned, although death is the undeniable reality that coexists with life. The fact of living now means death will come for the most accurate certainty. That's why ancient wisdom called Buddhism created something called \\"meditation on death\\" By realizing death as a reality, we realize the fact of being alive and we can actively live instead of passively passing the lifetime without actually living lives.Some quotes I find significant to me:\\"Everything you lived by and still live by is a lie, a deception that blinds you from the reality of life and death.\\"\\"Perhaps I did not live as I should have, but how could that be when I did everything one is supposed to? Then what do you want now? To live? Live how? Live as you did in court when the usher proclaimed: The court is open! The court is open, open, Now comes the judgment! But I'm not guilty! What is this for?\\"My interpretation of this novel is that Ivan Ilyich realized that he did not live a real meaningful life of his own. Only his realization of death as a reality enabled him to open his eyes to happiness, which he did not have though he thought he did have, and when the realization came to him, it was too late. So he would try to deny death yet find it impossible to do so. Then he would try to deny the reality, concluding internally that his reality is unreal, in an attempt to make him feel less miserable.Very well written novel, indeed."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"After Leo Tolstoy's religious conversion, his wife despaired that he would ever write anything of greatness again. He had become world famous for his novels War and Peace and Anna Karenina--both of which he rejected in his newfound spriritual awareness as promoting war and adultery. When she read her husband's completed manuscript The Death of Ivan Ilyich, she knew his gift had returned. Some might say it had returned with a vengeance, for Tolstoy seemed more evangelist than author, placing before his readers the ultimate question: What is the meaning of life? It is this question that is at the heart of Tolstoy's great novelle, the story of Ivan Ilyich, a prominent Russian judge in his forties who is dying of cancer. In moments of tormented introspection, Ivan cannot admit that he has missed the answer to this question, having lived the wrong kind of life, a life without spritual awareness or even deeply human meaning. Plagued by inner questions of the rightness of his life, the perceived coldness of his wife, and surrounded by the \\"great lie\\" that he is not dying, Ivan descends ever deeper into self-pity, denying his spiritual bankruptcy and railing against the \\"falsity\\" that surrounds him. As he lies dying, this Everyman (for Ivan Ilyich is a common Russian name), comes to know his own spiritual bankruptcy and the emptiness of those material things for which \\"he had given his life.\\" Tolstoy doesn't shy away from the harsh reality of Ivan's physical pain and decline, allowing the reader to experience the horror of Ivan's cancer and the fear that consumes him. Toward the end, Ivan feels something like compassion for his young son and tries to say to his wife, \\"forgive me.\\" But, in his weakened condition, he cannot speak coherently. This classic work is deeply rewarding to those readers who hunger for depth and meaning in fiction--and for those who are not afraid to answer Tolstoy's question."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"I picked up this story by accident a few years ago, not anticipating anything special, and was completely engrossed in the slow, sad decline of this masterfully drawn character.

Thanks to Tolstoy.This is also an excellent introduction to Tolstoy's oeuvre, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has been wondering just what the strange man with a prophet's beard has to offer.

What was your life about? Can I get better? How do others react to my death? That is the substance of this Tolstoy novel or novella.Short but powerful is the best description of this Tolstoy novel. For the average reader, this will be a one evening read and many will read it in a few hours.This is the story about the illness, death, and funeral of a bureaucrat, Ivan Ilyich. During his life and career he achieves some modest successes; but, after an accidental fall in his home he develops and internal pain that the doctor cannot fix. His illness gets worse and worse and eventually he succumbs.Tolstoy describes the experiences, the feelings, and the reactions in others that Ilyich encounters. In short, his illness and death is viewed as a burden or imposition on the happy lives around him: it interferes with their joy or perhaps he was never liked. Interestingly, his demise is secretly welcomed at work: his fellow bureaucrats look forward to his death so they can advance to his job. We learn how the doctor reacts to the patient, and how they give him little time and avoid telling grim how hopeless is his situation.What he encounters is perhaps the unacknowledged reaction encountered by some terminally ill people.Is it a fair statement on the indifferent state of the human condition? Not completely. But in many ways Tolstoy's description is close to the truth. Many people live an unappreciated and often hopeless life. Tolstoy's fictional character, Ivan Ilyich, makes this discovery when he becomes ill.This is a great and a compelling read."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"A brief look at typical (and brilliant) Tolstoy.

I got the chilling feeling that Leo was looking straight into my soul!It isn't easy reading, but the text seems to say that it is only by looking your own death/mortality straight in the face, that life can become meaningful.What I like is that there are more questions than answers in the book, just like in real life! The honesty of Tolstoy.In the end it's a story of hope. There is hope of a meaningful life..... and death can be a victory because \\"death shall be no more\\"!"},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"I really enjoyed The Death of Ivan Ilyich...well, I don't know if \\"enjoyed\\" is the write word, but it is a remarkable novella. There's a wonderful intro written by Ronald Blythe. In the intro Blythe writes about Tolstoy's great fear of death that eventually turned into an obsession with death that lead to the creation of The Death of Ivan Ilyich, his meditation on the subject.The book opens immediately after the death of Ivan Ilyich. Ivan was a judge and when his co-workers find out about his death, the first thing they begin to talk about is who will take his place. This scenes is followed by his funeral where we meet his wife who is in mourning. The book then goes on to introduce us to Ivan and his wife in the early days of their marriage and paints a picture of a marriage that was all bright colors on the outside, but rather dark behind closed doors. Ivan soon finds out that he has a \\"floating kidney\\" and his health slowly deteriorates over the next few months eventually leading to his death.The beauty of this book is that the plot is given away in the title. Ivan dies...you know the book ends with his death. Tolstoy's masterpiece lies not so much in the actual storyline, but in the thought process, the philosophy, and the atmosphere behind it. The only way I can describe the feel of this book is claustrophobic. From the minute that Ivan learns and recognizes that he is dying, the feel of the story is one of collapsing, closing in. It becomes a story of seeing the world fly by so fast that you can't grasp on to anything to stay in it. It's quite sad actually, but so wonderfully told by Tolstoy and becomes one of the most haunting stories I've ever read in it's final pages.I'm glad that I've finally gotten around to this one and look forward to revisiting Tolstoy in the future, most probably with Anna Karenina."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"First, I truly enjoyed the introduction of this edition. Being about 1/3 the size of Tolstoy's novella, it granted enough detail for a better understanding without being overdone. The writer presents ideas I would have missed.Much has been said in other reviews regarding the novella itself. What struck me in my reading of the approx. 100 pages was that despite the fact that the story concerns a man who hasn't considered death, and when faces it takes a certain approach to it, the rest of the story is simply too real for most everyone to leave any reader comfortable (that's a good thing). Without giving it away, the thoughtful reader will see him/herself in the other characters, regarding both attitude toward and activities involved in death. Even for those who look at death differently that Tolstoy's character, much of what he thinks is what most think when faced with death.Tolstoy has managed to look at everyone, you might say, and leaves any with a brain that can think with the necessity of self examination, not simply concerning death, but with the attitudes and cultures that surround death and its approach. This text would be excellent for a book club discussion, which, if handled according to the true number of statements of human reality, would take many weeks (months?) to cover in an honest manner of discussion."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"No writer has ever dissected the human psyche more brilliantly than Leo Tolstoy. His nuanced and detailed examinations of motive and emotion speak to us across years and cultural barriers because of the universality of his themes. The prospect of reading a novella that tracks in great detail the preoccupations of a rather ordinary man as he sickens and dies may not seem very enticing, but Tolstoy delivers such truth and understanding that the result is fascinating and moving. Here, the focus is on Ivan Ilyich, a government functionary who enjoys some professional success before succumbing as the result of a meaningless, seemingly trivial, accident. As death grows near, he is forced to reexamine his belief that he has lived a good life simply because it conformed to the expectations of proper society. As such, it also serves as an eloquent defense of the author's own decision in his real life to renounce the privileges of his birth to live the simple life of a peasant."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"What an intense, quick read! Be prepare to die with Ivan. There are few moments in life when we have a chance to truly analyze death.

I learned more about how to forgive, and what really matters...letting go of material falseness and into our true nature."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"While Tolstoy is known for writing lengthy epics, so much so that his \\"War and Peace\\" is shorthand for that long book everyone wants to read but never does, his less than one hundred page punch to the metaphysical gut \\"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\\" may be his most important and powerful work.Ivan Ilyich is, in many ways, the ideal man of society. Born with an even temper and pleasant disposition, though not charismatic, Ivan goes through life with the outlook of a protestant work horse. Study hard, work hard, apply yourself completely to your job, and direct your own goals towards those of society's- Ivan does all of these things, and while doing so, finds a wife, has children, and continues to advance his own life while constantly doing what he knows he is supposed to do. He is undoubtedly driven, but even when he finds himself working a job with immense power, he uses this power judiciously and thoughtfully, never once abusing it. Even when his wife turns into a jealous, spiteful woman, Ivan makes the best of this situation, and maintains the marriage out of respect for the institution.Then, one day, Ivan becomes ill. Pain slowly creeps into his life, and steadily over a period of months, his health declines until he has no choice but to take to the bed and essentially stop living. It is at this point that the book begins to pack an emotional wallop as Tolstoy takes his carefully crafted portrait of a man and begins tearing it to pieces. Ivan, as it turns out, is not happy and faced, for the first time in his life, with the inevitability of death, falls to pieces.The spiritual and metaphysical crisis Ivan confronts is devastating, and undergoing the same crisis himself while writing this book, Tolstoy conveys it with an immediacy and intimacy that almost makes it too much to read. Tolstoy also glimpses into the thoughts of those surrounding Ivan and what he reveals- the uncomfortableness of his family, the impatience of those tired of waiting around for Ivan to die- lend an even more disturbing yet sadly realistic tone to the drama.Only 82 pages in length, \\"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\\" manages to address numerous issues, both personal and societal. Unsettling yes, but Tolstoy has created a masterpiece that captures the complexities and at times horrors of humankind's mortality."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"I enjoyed the book very much, even though at first it was just for a class assignment I found myself reading ahead and finishing the book"},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"Leo Tolstoy has managed to write a novella rich in language, imagery, and the theme of death.

What if we all lived our whole lives wrong...?"},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"These sentiments, how antediluvian they are: that childhood, blissfully ignorant of society and responsibility is pure, joyful; that the further we drift away from that state, the more we find ourselves in the construction of society, the mask that hides authenticity. And that is what it's about: authenticity. Is it not easy to claim childhood as authentic, natural? In literature, how common it is to find an author exploring this idea of truth in an environment of illusion, yet how fresh and enjoyable Tolstoy is in THE DEATH OF IVAN ILYICH. Our protagonist, Ivan Ilyich, is not unlike many others: he lives a life of propriety, is wealthy, and has a family but finds himself woefully unhappy. He attempts to smother misery by focusing on work and happens to stumble upon contentedness. That is until the presence of death makes itself known. Ah how it changes it all. A familiar plot, true; a familiar character, sure. I cannot say it enough, though: how fresh and enjoyable Tolstoy is.Through excellent pacing, we are introduced to details and characters allows us to view in our mind's eye scenes so vivid, so fascinating. I cannot help but adulate the talent displayed in achieving this effect. Whereas other writers either describe too much--we are forced to imagine more than necessary--or too little--we are given a vague setting--Leo Tolstoy manages to balance the exterior of a scene with the interior in a way where the power of words is attested. Excuse me, but films will never triumph over the strength a skilled writer has when he or she properly navigates our imaginations, make the foreign unique to ourselves, special.If you wish to experience happiness, do not read this story. The beginning of the tale affirms that each individual must experience his or her own epiphany; Piotr Ivanovich looks at Ivan Ilyich and thinks, \\"Not me,\\" as Ivan Ilyich thought of Caius and said, \\"Not me.\\" However, it is a book I would wholly recommend to anybody. Its prose is not ostentatious and its themes are easy to identify with. As a nice surprise, the book cannot help but swerve into the emotional mind of the protagonist as it did in ANNA KARENINA with Anna. And like ANNA KARENINA, the result awesome. Again: the power of words. Again: read it."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"The Death of Ivan Ilyich is a paradox really-- it is both short and simple and, yet, Tolstoy evokes profound ideas about Man's existence and the role death will ultimately play. Impending death may cause various reactions in people; examining one's life is the one that Tolstoy seems to drive home with this short novel. While the story is powerful, I wished it would have been flushed out and developed a little more like his other novels. Still, I really loved this one.The story begins with the funeral service of Ivan Ilyich. Several of his colleagues are there out of necessity more than want. They think how better it was that he should die than them. Rather than grieving out of respect, the men begin to think about what role they could have now that he is dead. This brief scene seems to establish what will be a recurring theme of Ivan Ilyich's life: that self-importance, looking out for oneself, constitutes the most significant aspect of existence. From here, Ivan's story is told. He became a prominent judge, married a woman of high standing, and lived within his own circle of high society. Ivan's mantra of existence is his well-being, and so he takes measures to ensure that, when there is conflict with his wife, or if he is generally unhappy, he will take measures to ensure happiness and a carefree existence, even at others' expense. However, after an accidental fall, Ivan Ilyich gets the news from his doctor that something \\"serious\\" could be afflicting him. Ivan tries to continue his prosperous life; he seeks out work, which makes him happy, and continues on. However, he realizes that he is up against death. Ivan Ilyich must come to terms with his own mortality; he wants to cheat death, and continue to live a prosperous existence, but he cannot, and this makes him panic with fear. As his days and hours are numbered, Ivan Ilyich must find some means of spiritual redemption, or end life knowing that parts of his existence were superficial. His reawakening is examining and reflecting on his life in total, the memories of childhood right up to his shallow lifestyle. Only then does he experience a sense of peace.Tolstoy, in this short novella, depicts the common fear individuals have when up against death and seems to ask the question: Are you happy with how you lead your life? Moreover, it illustrates the spirituality and peace we can find if we examine how we live, and live our lives the right and just way. The Death of Ivan Ilyich is a fantastic story with a powerful spiritual moral."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"This book well desrves the designation \\"masterpiece.\\" It is an examination of death and dying, of retrospection on one's life, of social relationships, and of the strengths and weaknesses of human beings."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"What an AMAZING book! It's short, but you will be sure to read it over and over again. The book is about the life and death (but mostly death) of the highly esteemed judge, Ivan Illych. Tolstoy walks the reader through Ivan Illych's last months; it's really amazing to think Tolstoy could write such profound thoughts on the subject.A must have- especially for lovers of philosophy or psychology!"},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"Upon reading 'The Death of Ivan Ilych', the great Russian composer Tchaikovsky wrote in his diary that 'More than ever, I am convinced that the greatest author-painter who ever lived is Leo Tolstoy.' But the greatness that Tchaikovsky speaks of is not on the surface of the story, and takes some analysis to uncover and to fully appreciate.The narrative is beautiful, masterful, vivid, and in manifold hidden ways is also quite complex. To further the idea of this great writer as being the greatest 'author-painter', one might speak of his story as being similar to Da Vinci's 'Mona Lisa': it only appears to be a simple human portrait.It's plot is rather sad and almost boring. A group of judges discover an obituary telling of the demise of their cohort Ivan Ilych. The omniscient narrative portrays the judges' clich&eacute;-riddled responses and their barely hidden apathy at this news. The rest of the story looks back at the life of Ivan Ilych, including his last hours.Starting with that touching but prosaic outline, Tolstoy artfully winds his way from the outside to the inside of this reality. He takes us from the apathetic thoughts of Ivan's professional cohorts upon hearing of Ivan's death, through the obligatory but awkward visit by one of them to the funeral -- with all its' empty religious rituals that apparently no one finds significant -- where the cohort (a fellow judge) sees Ivan's rather greedy widow who plies the friend for information on how to improve her pension that will result from Ivan's death.Then the story goes back in time and accelerates inexorably from Ilych's shallow past towards his most intimate agony and isolation, often with an absolutely uncanny sense of real time unfolding in the story, even as time is bent backward and compressed so that the dramatic last page describes a day just prior to the setting of story's opening pages.When Ilych finds out that he is terminally ill and then begins to wither away, he doesn't understand why he feels so isolated from his family, despite his merely superficial connection to them which has been based solely on the respective roles they play in his career and on their value to his position in society. He's blind as to why they do not seem to care or even acknowledge the obvious fact that he will die soon.At the end, after meeting a peasant named Gerasim who is kind to Ivan and does not avoid the subject of death, Ivan begins to understand and finally make peace with his family, at least in his own heart and from a distance; but he has a hard time expressing this understanding before he passes on. His death is thus truly bittersweet.So the hidden complexity lies in the endless careful adjustments that Tolstoy makes to the time and space described, in order to serve the carefully sustained mood (a mood similar to that of a Greek tragedy, but somewhat less hopelessly foreboding.)One example of this occurs when Tolstoy wants to tap the breaks on the intense seriousness without actually contriving some comic relief as many authors might. At the funeral of Ivan Ilych, there is a moment when a loose spring in a chair seat creates an awkwardness for Ivan's wife and cohort that is not quite funny, but is odd and queer enough to break the tension perfectly, and to enhance the idea that these characters are merely striking one tedious pose after another in their various gestures of grief. This story is a chain of such perfect and perfectly subtle decisions by it's author.The narrative tone takes the form of an abstract and ethereal air of gloom. This gaseous gloom gradually condenses and solidifies into Ivan's Ilych's corporeal and intellectual being, like the spiritual equivalent of a star collapsing into a black hole. The flawless grace with which Tolstoy accomplishes this is majestic, beautiful, and is an uncanny imitation of an act of God, done without any attempt to draw attention to itself.This then is the complexity behind the story's faade. Tolstoy's complex craftsmanship is also the unseen cause of the subtly shifting pace (notice how time and space, like the mood, slowly squeeze in as the story progresses so that by the ending, time is described in minutes and seconds instead of days and hours, and Ivan's universe is his death bed); and above all in the depth of painfully accurate psychological detail used toward these ends. All the aspects of Tolstoy's art are wielded unobtrusively to show Ivan Ilych's suffering and growth. And it is the seamless execution of these aspects as much as the virtuoso's choice of the story's tiny details, which mark this work as a classic.By way of this superb execution, what Tolstoy's novella contains at it's essence is something beyond the scope of a mere cautionary tale about the emptiness of bourgeois materialism, beyond the limits of even a subtle meditation on life and death; and even beyond the living, breathing expression of Tolstoy's own deeply felt appreciation for the values expressed in Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. It contains much more than any of those themes could by themselves...there is the mystery of art at work when the author uses his originality, passion and intellect to create something altogether new, a kind of existentialist theater of the mind that must be experienced, preferably in one sitting, to be fully appreciated.Stripping the story of this indefinable -- almost mystical- aspect (though the only explicit, unambiguous mysticism to be found is a single brief and oblique reference to the big \`He' on the last page), its' point is the simple idea of how empty a life can be when that life contains, from start to finish, an abundance of every kind of approval and comfort that society can offer, except those of real love and soulful communion with others.There is a certain type of agony in Ivan's life. However, this agony is not death itself but what the threat of death forces Ivan to see; namely, that his isolation had already killed him. He is already dead when his health starts to fail, but awareness of this brings him to life for the first time as he is dying, at least for a final few bittersweet moments. It is as if he suddenly woke up from a nightmare in which he imagines himself helplessly drowning, only to find himself on a river tied to a raft which is moving rapidly downstream toward a waterfall, but with perhaps a little hope of getting undone before going over the edge, or at least shouting goodbye to his loved ones before going over. So in the end, he discovers the reality of his difficult situation (namely: spiritual isolation), and at least will die trying to solve it instead of continuing in the helpless fog of his nightmare. In fact, Tolstoy had written an essay describing just such a feeling in his own life a few years before he wrote this story.So we not only see in this great story a description of an existential dilemma, but even feel the dilemma unfolding within Ivan's mind as he drifts towards his physical death. Yet it is important to note that amazingly, it's not a sad or depressing story, at least not at the end and after it is over. If one has the courage to read it very closely, perhaps more than once, one will feel the power of Tolstoy amplifying the reader's own quiet intimate fears which pound away in the background of all human minds, only to show that they need not bring despair.Tolstoy allows us to face life, and shows us in the end that the only death of Ivan Ilych was the long period of his life when he was living superficially, mechanically, unlovingly, and therefore in isolation. That is the titular 'death'. In the end (whatever the reader's religious beliefs), this story comforts with the bittersweet ending which tells us and shows us that though we die, our death need not be \`deadly' to our soul if it has been lifted from the living death of spiritual isolation."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Illych is a short novella, especially in comparison to his magnus opus, War and Peace (or, arguably, Anna Karenina), but far from simple.

If you knew it was coming you would want to know what it was all for, whether you did everything you wanted and most of all whether you could look back ad say to yourself: no regrets, I'm satisfied my life was what it should have been. Just after reading this book, I had an experience which sharply contrasted with Ivan Ilych's experience. The daughter of a lady I know well, died, aged 37. When speaking to her, one of the first feelings she expressed was how her daughter had lived a life without regret, how they could all look back on happy memories and good times in their family.First and foremost I found this story incredibly sad, but it is probably also incredibly commonplace in terms of how many people live their lives.

The typos occur so frequently that they are a major distraction."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"There are so many levels upon which this story can be read, yet they are woven so inextricably into this masterpiece that the complexity is staggering. The premise sounds simple: a man who is about to die realizes he has never fully lived. We've all heard this before--in fact, Hollywood likes to drum such messages into our heads on a regular basis. But rarely, if ever, is it portrayed with the exquisite mastery which Tolstoy employed upon writing &quot;The Death of Ivan Ilyich&quot;.Paradoxically, this story is just as much about the life of Ivan Ilyich as it is about his death. This is in order to fully appreciate who he is and the man he has made of himself before disaster strikes. It is also to highlight both the tragic deterioration of his life and the gradual enlightenment of his inmost soul.In portraying Ivan Ilyich's character, Tolstoy's subtle but inexorable condemnation is devastating. Not a detail is gratuitous: every point further serves to illustrate what is essentially a life without ideals and without purpose. Yet the author does not beat us over the head with this, rather than allowing the clear and unembellished facts to speak for themselves. And the way Tolstoy knew exactly which facts to accentuate creates a psychological depth which is unparalleled.Many seem to be under the impression that Ivan Ilyich was some sort of villain, and that the story is a warning against corruption and bad behavior. My personal view is that Ivan Ilyich is no worse--although no better--than many people. Perhaps he is of a slightly lesser moral calibre than most, but that does not make him completely evil. To believe that he is evil is to miss the whole point, for this story was meant to be universal, to depict a reality which exists for us all. This is obvious from the way the story begins, with Ivan Ilyich's friends' and relatives' reactions to his death. Like him, they see death as something that can never happen to them, and like him they lead lives which are shallow and superficial in an attempt to avoid the unpleasant realities of life. By the time he dies, Ivan Ilyich has risen above these people by at last coming to the realization of the worthlessness of his life. This has elevated him above the common man, who avoids the reality of death and the effort it takes to make life worthwhile. In Tolstoy's own words, &quot;Ivan Ilyich's life had been...most ordinary and therefore most terrible.&quot;Therein lies the impact of this story: Ivan Ilyich is Everyman, and the message he represents is applicable at every moment in our lives."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"Tolstoy's novella makes rewarding and unsettling reading. Surely, I can think of no novel that treats dying as boldly. Death is a fact. In this story Ivan Ilyich's life and death are plainly represented in a fashion that remarkably resembles the times I have been aware of other, near people dying. What the novel puts on display in so satisfying and disconcerting a fashion is the remarkable inability or reluctance of most people (I ashamedly include myself in this group) to take part in the life of a person who is inevitably and rather immediately dying. Only one character in the novel has the goodness, humility and patience to care for a dying man, the rest scurry about and take care of their anticipated needs in the face of losing a loved one.I find that I read this book again every year and that it remains such a fine portrait of a bureaucrat whose family life does not entirely satisfy him and whose pursuit of a more meaningful life fails to cease even in sickness, when he understands that his mortality is soon to be demonstrated. There are few works of this nature that I can set in the company of this short novel. Despite many readings, I feel I still don't entirely understand it, but later in life I imagine I will do better. This book is so excellent and the edition here lends itself to portable and pleasant reading."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"...so I could read this story in the original. This novella is an absolute masterpiece. It made me think about things my jaded self had long since given up on, like God, purpose of life, death, fear. Tolstoy has an absolute deadpan sense of humor, which was so subtle it took me a while to catch on (for example, Ivan's fatal injury occurs while he is hanging expensive drapery out to impress his friends--what a beautifully ironic, even funny way to point out the meaninglessness of his life?).If you're like me, and don't have the time to slog through &quot;War and Peace&quot; but are interested in Tolstoy, try this book. It's outstanding."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"This book changed my life. No kidding. After reading it, I realized I was trapped in a loveless marriage, slave to a meaningless job, and listing towards a dark oblivion. In other words, I was your average middle-class, middle-aged married white guy. This book is a terrifying wake-up call to such guys--and I suppose to their female counterparts--to the life-not-well-lived, alas, the path most-taken.The premise is simple. A solid career guy with all the trappings of \`success'--secure job, nice house, presentable wife--lifts his arm one day and feels something go \`twang' inside him. No big deal, he thinks. Probably tweaked a muscle or something. Except the little pain doesn't go away. Its not ever going away. It's a message--a message of mortality. The Grim Reaper is at the door. Time's up.Now this is bad enough news, for sure. But that's only the beginning of this novel of existential horror. For as our hero lies a-dying he sees the life around him--the carefully tended garden of his years--as if for the first time. That is, he sees how bitter, fraudulent, and full of decay and vermin it truly is. From his fair-weather friends and business associates to his vain and self-centered wife who fritters about the inconvenience attendant upon her husband's impending death as if it were a personal affront and the greatest of injustices--to her, *The Death of Ivan Ilych* offers a bedside view of the cruel absurdity of the inhuman comedy. For as the protagonist lies suffering on his deathbed and reviews his life and how it has--and hasn't--added up, he endures a torment that is almost Christ-like in its intensity and resulting in a revelation as immense in its profundity. But whether one of heaven or hell, truth or pacifying illusion is up to each reader to decide.Said to be the result of Tolstoy's own middle-aged spiritual crisis, *The Death of Ivan Ilych* manages to say in a scant 100 pages what most novels don't begin to say in 500. Timeless and archetypal, this novel reads with the power of a myth--a cautionary myth to wake up this very moment and begin to live an authentic life before it's too late.Because at any moment, it may suddenly be too late."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"This shattering double novel on the awakening of the soul amidst the decay of the body is one of the rare summits of the world literature.It is, along with a few short novels of Dostoevsky, Melville, Faulkner or Conrad, life altering reading experience of this particular genre.

The parable on mediocre sufferer Ivan Everyman could have been written in Sumer, Iran, China or Greece. It could have been dated 2000 B.C. or 2000 A.D. Wherever human 'pneuma' is thrown against void within &amp; without, wherever shrieking fear of extinction is submerged by terrible cognizance of life lived respectably and meaninglessly- Tolstoy will be there."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"Tolstoy's novella \\"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\\" tells the story of a man confronting his own imminent death. Dying is a deterministic process in that there is an infinite number of ways it can be done, but the result is always the same. The way Ivan Ilyich does it is slow and painful, but this is not by choice; indeed, he had never considered the way he would die or even that he would die at all, and when the burden is finally thrust upon him, he is unable to handle it. In Jean-Paul Sartre's \\"Nausea,\\" written half a century later, the protagonist is horrified by the knowledge of his own inexplicably created existence; Ivan Ilyich is horrified to realize his existence is about to come to an inexplicable end.Ivan Ilyich is a middle-aged man who has played it safe throughout his life, following all the rules of society, studying law, becoming a judge, marrying a lady from a good family, raising his kids properly, and enjoying evenings of whist with his colleagues. One day, while working in his apartment, he has an accident and injures his kidney, which though at first seeming trivial, soon cripples him with pain and confines him to bed. He notices with bitter irony that the doctors who treat him (to no avail) play God with his fate similarly to the way he has played God with the fates of men on trial.His affection for his family cools as his thoughts become obsessed with death. His wife, who has always been little more than an accessory to his public image, and daughter consider the physical demands of his terminal illness more an inconvenience to their lifestyle, a clamp on their freedom, than a cause for lamentation; his friends find the social obligations of dealing with funerals and condolence calls tedious. His only comfort, small as it is, is his loyal servant Gerasim, who nurses him compassionately until the very end.Ivan Ilyich's scream of despair is the swansong of a man who can't believe the life he has cultivated so lovingly is so soon going to end on a sudden whim. As one who was born dying, he failed to heed Marcus Aurelius's words to disdain the flesh, and now flesh is all he can treasure. Tolstoy could have written this story as a spritual or metaphysical meditation on death, but instead it is simply a brilliant dirge for a man embarking on a journey--the one we all have to make--into the final unknown."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"This is a simple story of a ordinary man, who lives a respectable life as a judge, father, and husband. In the course of the story it becomes clear that, though he believes himself to be happy and successful, his life is an empty fraud, arranged solely on the basis of what society expects of him. He has no real connection to his wife and children. At work, he takes pride in adhering strictly to what protocol requires of him. And the closest he comes to actual passion is when he wins a game of cards.In the prime of his life he falls ill. Gradually he becomes aware that he will soon die. In the light of approaching death, he is forced for the first time to examine the way in which he lived, and comes to a horrifying conclusion.Tolstoy confronts us with the ultimate question: how should a man live, given that he must die? Ivan Ilyich's story is frightening because it is our story too. No matter how hard we try to evade it, when we are face to face with oblivion, we too will be forced to ask ourselves the terrifying question: have I lived meaningfully, or wasted my time on this earth?Volumes have been written about death and the ways in which we confront it, but Tolstoy's slender little book cuts right to the heart of the matter in a way that no other work has."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"Tolstoy's short novel starts with the aftermath of Ivan Ilych's death. His colleagues gather to execute the polite formalities before moving on with relief to their regular whist game. \\"Well isn't that something--he's dead, but I'm not.\\"Ivan Ilych is a self-satisfied high court judge who injured himself in a fall, and later fell ill with a vaguely diagnosed disturbance of his organs. At first the pain is an offensive intruder to his smug routine but it becomes worse and eventually it's clear that he is dying. Clear, that is, to him, though his family and colleagues infuriate him by living the lie that he will recover if he just follows the doctor's advice.Tolstoy makes it plain to the reader in the early part of the story that Ivan Ilych's life is hollow and calculating. His marriage was undertaken casually and for convenience, not love. He takes pride in the trappings and petty powers of his position as a prosecutor and a judge. When he falls ill and consults a physician, he takes umbrage at the impersonal formalities and the patronizing air of the doctor--a mirror image of his own demeanor in his court.Tolstoy himself was plagued by the idea of death, its inevitability and unfairness, and he wrote all his rage against death into this short piece. Critics believe that he also wrote his conversion to Christianity into it as well. Ivan Ilych denies the importance of his pain as long as he can, then pours out his anger at the unfairness of it all, becoming \\"difficult\\" at home and work. One moment he believes the medicines and positive thinking will put things right, the next he's overwhelmed with despair that life could all come down to this.Near the end Ivan Ilych realizes that his life may not have been a good one, a real one, and he thinks back to his childhood when things WERE real. His wife, son and daughter are no more real--only the kitchen boy who cheerfully tends to his physical needs is honest about life and death. In his last hour of life Ivan Ilych feels his son's kiss on his hand and breaks free of the pain and despair to an understanding of the transformative power of love and acceptance. His dying was the death, and at the end of his dying there was only light.The Death of Ivan Ilychis a powerful work, a template for much of our modern literature on dying. It's also as much about life as about death, if we can read the road map that way.Linda Bulger, 2008"},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"The Death of Ivan Ilyich (1886) is the easiest to read of Tolstoy's great works. It is only about 150 pages and is about as powerful as his two great novels in the questions he raises in the novel, questions that haunted him throughout his 83 year life...the question which has plagued man for millions of years, \\"What happens when I die, and where will I go? What if I'm not ready?\\"Count Leo Nikolayovich Tolstoy was, as the great introduction to the Bantam Classics volume, \\"a lifetime death watcher.\\" (I don't know if that's exactly what the introduction said so I had to paraphrase). Death was something that upset Tolstoy more than most people. For one thing, he served in the Crimean War of 1854-'56 (I don't know how long he served in that war particularly), but he served long enough to be exposed to the horrors of war and death.This short novel, which Nabokov referred to as \\"The Greatest work of Russian Literature,\\" (Nabokov was probably right) was the culmination of Tolstoy's great philosophical epiphany after he finished writing Anna Karenina in 1877. During that time, he sank into a deep depression in which he comtemplated very deep philosophical questions and rethought his behavior and outlook on life. It was during this time that he wrote A Confession (1879), which he wrote about this crisis and what he thought about life and religion. He went into this period as the aesthetic Leo Tolstoy, the great novelist who was responsible for the two great novels, War and Peace and Anna Karenina, and emerged from this period as the most known and recognizable Leo Tolstoy, the shaggy, long haired, bushy eyebrowed peasant social activist.This great work is the culmination of that period. It is a great allegory of how fragile life is and how small man is. The main irony Tolstoy presents in this novel is \\"the death of a judge.\\" Ivan Ilyich is a judge, immersed in his work, which is the only thing which gives him pleasure. He hates his wife and spends a lot of time playing cards with his friends when he is not working. After he hurts himself when he falls on the side of table, he begins to fall ill. The main drama of this story is Ivan Ilyich's agonizing reaction to his slow death. We all die and we will be judged by a higher being. The death of a judge, someone who judged others and condemned criminals to death dies after a long illness. That is the basic plot. In between, Tolstoy weaves an unforgettable story with very deep questions, and powerful dramatic scenes which never fails to leave a great impact on every reader."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"In today's media saturated world where introspection is taboo and all your problems can be solved by a drug or a material object peddled on your TV, The Death of Ivan Ilyich stands as a testament to the psychic void that is created by structuring your life based upon the expectations of others.

It is a slow spiral into decay, that actually begins long before the physical symptoms of his illness arise.If you ever feel like you're caught on a treadmill of materialism, this book will hit you like a splash of cold water in the face.

As if that were not enough, I fondly remember how my mom read this book as part of an English class assignment in college; she went to college at the same time as me (I was so proud of her, by the way), and Tolstoy even had my mom talking about this book to her family!The Introduction by Ronald Blythe is a must-read. It is sad to learn about the inner turmoil and conflict that Tolstoy himself had around death, and the precious time of his life he wasted obsessively worried about something that we humans can neither fathom nor explain. Tolstoy himself was the opposite of his main character, Ivan Illyich, in that the latter never wasted any time thinking about an inconvenience such as death until it were upon him, and yet both men were terrified of it to no end.Ivan Illyich is anything but likable - it's not his terrible flaws as much as his lack of all good and decent human traits. In a way, he is disturbingly neutral, neither negative nor positive and therefore, not terribly likable. But you don't exactly read Tolstoy for his warm and fuzzy characters. You read him for the way he describes the depth and breadth of human experience, and it may be the same reason you might want to avoid Tolstoy altogether because he pulls you in deep and hard and makes you think about his message long after you have closed the last page of the book!We simply refuse to think - really and truly think - about our own mortality. Even if we study the subject of death, it is a subject of study and no more. And when death happens to someone else, we go through the usual motions of grief and sympathy but ultimately, we are relieved that it was someone else and not us facing that eventual end.I warn you, it is particularly hard to put it down after the quiet and proper life of Ivan Illyich gets interrupted with an imperceptible pain on his side that first nags at him and then grows so large that it is all he can think about. As the pain grows, Ivan Illyich grows impatient with himself and becomes disconnected from society. His whole life turns into a series of battles: Him versus the pain, him versus the doctors, him versus the wife and the colleagues, and him versus It - It being this impending death that no one talks about but everyone fully expects of him.The ultimate highlight of the book is when Ivan Illyich hears an audible voice of his soul talking back to him in response to his incessant questioning of why this is happening to him. He questions why he has to die and the voice says what do you want and he answers that he wants to live and the voice asks, live how? And that's when it happens.And that is the question we will all have to answer at the end of our own precious life - yes, yours and mine too will come to an end someday and there is no coming back to this point in time to relive, re-do and have a second chance.Tolstoy may have written \\"The Death of Ivan Illyich\\" to help us better cope with our own eventual death, but for me, this book was a wake-up call to embrace life even more fiercely than before, and to live for what really and truly matters and that we define in our own ways."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"I read The Death of Ivan Ilych for High School English a few years ago, and just recently revisited it.

It is only by degrees that we can measure our lives as being different from that of Ivan Ilyich. None of us can make the statement that \\"This is not I!\\" without a great deal of denial and repression. Do we take our professional lives to the point of them becoming the base of our personalities? Do we embrace and appreciate those around us or do we forcefully nudge them to the side because they do not meet our unrealistic expectations? Are we truly the gregarious person we think we are or are we, too, merely an animate facade which laughs/laments/cajoles only when socially appropriate? Is altruism the core of our souls or is it actually a much less kinder word; like narcissism or simple selfishness? Do we see a wholeness in the inner spirit of our lives, learning like we will live forever but living like we will die tomorrow or do we, like Ivan Ilyich, feel that life itself is purposeless and we are left abandoned when it is time for it to conclude?Ponder these and greater thoughts as you read this classic tale and, by doing so, you will not only come to know yourself better for who you really are but will come to identify what the actual meaning of life could possibly be...."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"The death of Ivan Ilyich is a tour de force in the realm of literature. It is a literary masterpiece. It is written by one of the greatest writers the world has witnessed namely Leo Tolstoy. It is a story written during the relentlessly worldly and materialistic age of Czarist Russia. The story is a flashback of the life of a worldly careerist judge who dies. It is the morbid story of a successful judge who is spiraled downwards into the inescapable jaws of death. The protagonist is hurled into the throes of death in a quick space of time. It shows how difficult it is to acknowledge death for a man who has never ever given the thought of death even a fleeting thought. The book documents the trauma faced by the judge when he comes to terms with his ill fate. Tolstoy is a well renowned authority on the subject of death. Through the agonies of Ivan Ilyich, Tolstoy portrays death as a terrible irreversible phenomenon, which humans find it difficult to grapple with. The book is a thorough and horrific glimpse into the abyss that is death. The story depicts death also as an unknown mystery that is viewed as an unavoidable and macabre absolute. The story was the culmination of a nine-year spiritual crisis in Tolstoy's life. It reflects Tolstoy's obsession and fear of death and his inability to come to terms with it.The judge is a worldly careerist who is fascinated with his work. His work keeps him engrossed and diverts his mind from distractions and problems in his life. He is endowed with arbitrary power. He has position, prestige and status in his society. He is bestowed with the trappings of power. He is very conscious of his status, power and position in society. He has inclinations toward materialistic and worldly pursuits. He socializes with people of high social stature and does not interact with people whom he deems to be below his status. He had strained relations with his wife but did not divorce her due to fear of negative social reactions. His life is divorced from spirituality. He never prayed to God and never attended churches. He led a life exactly opposite of a simple earthly existence.Suddenly he falls ill and his life is turned upside down. He contracts a fatal disease and is terminally ill for the rest of his days. The disease and his realization of his imminent death brings out the worst in him. The fear and trepidation of death completely devastates him. He loses focus on work. His concentration is ripped apart. His personality is metamorphosed. He starts throwing temper tantrums at his wife and children. He hates the world around him. He thinks his wife and children and friends are not showing genuine affection, empathy and sympathy with him. His pride and ego is hurt. He feels people are lying to him and are deceiving him. He finds only a simple boy called Gerasim comforting and sympathizing with him. He feels only Gerasim understands him. He finally dies.Through this story Tolstoy tries to express a few of his ideas. Tolstoy believes people fear death. Tolstoy feels people can never acknowledge their own death. He also feels people should lead spiritual lives and believe and pray in God. He feels leading simple, spiritual and austere lives would reduce the fear and suffering associated with death. He also feels people think of dying men as liabilities."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"This book is a raw glimpse at a man's life and his death. It covers the actions of others too and gives us a glimpse of the variances in which people in general view death and the inner mechanisms of the man who is dying in the book. I would say this would be an awesome book for anyone dealing with death and dying in their professions or daily life. This book is extremely insightful into the entire process and although it seems to frame the worst of human nature-it is an honest look. It is also cheap enough that if you feel despair over having bought it and not liking it-you can easily recoup your losses via any amazon or other auction seller."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"This novella is a poignant meditation on death. I can't imagine a tougher subject to think about, let alone write about. With his characteristic humanistic style, Tolstoy depicts the stages of man's death, from cognizance to acceptance. It may not be a completely accurate blanket account of death, but it sure seems to come close to what death might be like. Mortality is always difficult to come to grips with, and Tolstoy handles the subject beautifully, giving us, as he did with War and Peace, not answers but what he feels is the inevitable."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"This shattering double novel on the awakening of the soul amidst the decay of the body is one of the rare summits of the world literature.It is, along with a few short novels of Dostoevsky, Melville, Faulkner or Conrad, life altering reading experience of this particular genre. Suffused with what one might term as the Christian spirit, the novelette is astonishingly free from any suffocating dogma or orthodoxy. The parable on mediocre sufferer Ivan Everyman could have been written in Sumer, Iran, China or Greece. It could have been dated 2000 B.C. or 2000 A.D. Wherever human 'pneuma' is thrown against void within &amp; without, wherever shrieking fear of extinction is submerged by terrible cognizance of life lived respectably and meaninglessly- Tolstoy will be there."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"This edition, published by the Waking Lion Press, is filled with typos.

Admittedly, when I opened the pages of this book I expected the experience of reading this story to be mostly academic, never imaging the story of the death of a 19th century Russian lawyer written by an author from 19th century czarist Russia could have much relevance to life in a 21st century western civilization. I figured Tolstoy's perspectives would likely have reflected the beliefs, thoughts and cultural norms of his day and his country. I couldn't have been more wrong.The story begins with the friends of Ivan Ilyich visiting his family and paying him his final respects after his painful and slow death. As they expressed their sorrow outwardly and demonstrated the appropriate display of grief, Tolstoy describes how inwardly they were thinking that such pain and death could never happen to them and how it is relatively inconvenient to have to deal with such an event, wondering if they'd be able to make the obligatory evening card game after the funeral. The story then steps back in time and relates how Ivan Ilyich's life was cruising along just as he had hoped it would, comfortably and without too much personal upheaval, other than learning to cope with the inconveniences of a less-than-comfortable marriage and trying to overcome debt acquired by living above his means. His idea of success in life came primarily through professional accomplishments and feeding his ego by garnering the approval of 'high society'.Then the story turns to his illness and the process of dying a painful and slow death. Tolstoy writes of the thoughts of a man who begins to re-evaluate his life as he lies on his death bed, realizing his end is imminent and not too far off. Ivan Ilyich attempts to reconcile with his soul the decisions he's made in his life, where he's placed his priorities, how he's treated his family and whether he's accomplished anything of lasting significance. It is in these writings that Tolstoy bridges the gaps of time and culture. Whether from old Russia or modern day western civilization, each and every individual in this world might potentially find themselves querying their soul with the same questions and introspection as Tolstoy presents through the death bed of Ivan Ilyich. The theme of his writings as he presents them in this story are not bound by culture, beliefs, geography or time.I also think this story is the type of story that is read and related to with very different perspectives by each reader according to the individual reader's experiences in life (as are so many other great stories). What this story says or means to one person will be much different from what another person will take from it. Speaking personally, I read this book after having just experienced the death of an infant relative, the 2 month old daughter of a brother. Such an experience in and of itself causes great personal reflection and definitely influenced how I related to the words of Tolstoy and the Death of Ivan Ilyich.It's a short and relatively easy read. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"I read this book in college at the pressing of a college professor- for philosophy.

Tolstoy is the greatest story-teller, and his characterization of Ivan Ilych makes you want to change your life."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"To be blunt, this is a book about death. As a consequence, this is far from an uplifting book. Yet when put in the perspective of social class and society, the book makes sense.In his dying, Ivan Ilych comes to realize the worthlessness of his own life. His family will go on without him. Those beneath him will compete for his position in society. In his mysterious illness and suffering, the proud man is humbled. All that was important in this life is exposed as a mirage. Ilych is set apart from mortal man in his dramatic suffering that may mirror the suffering he caused to others.Like the cold reality of many Eastern European writers, Tolstoy manages to chill the soul of the reader with this story of death. While this is not the best work of Tolstoy, fans will certainly enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"There is a point near the very end of this story that made me stop in my tracks. I almost couldn't continue, just from wanting to re-read it over and over. It was a sublime moment and I wanted to really savor it.Prior to reading this very accessible short story by Tolstoy, my (mistaken) perception of Ivan Ilych was that he was somehow a \\"bad\\" character...I was prepared to NOT be sympathetic to him.Turns out Ivan Ilych is, as someone else pointed out - your basic \\"everyman\\".Moreover, every character appearing in this story has a \\"familiar\\" feeling to him/her, which transcends cultures and time periods. This is a testament to Tolstoy's amazing ability to turn humanity inside out - and we can't help but recognize aspects of ourselves which are disturbing, banal, inspirational, and sometimes absolutely incredible. Certainly one can't finish the story and sit in judgment of any of the characters.There's a reason why people refer to Tolstoy as a Master Storyteller.It's because he is.The Death of Ivan Ilych And Other Stories"},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"What happens when an ordinary man begins to die?That is the question asked by Leo Tolstoy's brilliant short story, \\"The Death of Ivan Ilych\\". Mr. Ilych is depicted in the very beginning as an ordinary sort of man - he has an ordinary (albeit relatively affluent) lifestyle, an ordinary job, an ordinary wife, ordinary children, an ordinary home, and profoundly ordinary interests. Even his name, Ivan Ilych, is rather ordinary by Russian standards.It isn't until he begins to die that Ivan Ilych starts to seem alive. The tranquility of his mind and soul thereby disturbed, Ilych develops more humanity in dying than he ever did while living - and this reflection is only one of the many thoughts that occurs to a reader while experiencing \\"The Death of Ivan Ilych\\". Even more fascinating is how it avoids the trite and tidy explorations of death that bombard us from all corners these days. There are no grand revelations, no tear-swelling moments of acceptance, no moments of catharsis that fit nicely into a set of pre-determined religious convictions ... none of that. Ivan Ilych doesn't want or even need to die, and Tolstoy doesn't insult the intelligence of his audience by contriving a way to get around that and to a happy ending, or even to one that leaves us with a sense of closure or resolution. He shows us what he thinks would happen to Ivan Ilych, or anyone else, when they realized that death was lurking around the corner, and by not flinching in his telling of the tale, Tolstoy paints a disturbing image that even the strongest reader will probably be unable to shake off."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"This is one of Leo Tolstoy's most brilliant statements on the relationship between life and death. In a way, it has strong autobiographical elements: his own deep concerns about death, the conflicts with his wife, Sonja, and his even deeper conflicts over the worldly, sensual life and the spiritual one. I found the translation excellent."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"&quot;He went to his study, lay down, and once again was left alone with It. Face to face with It. Unable to do anything with It. Simply look at It and grow numb with horror.&quot;Death is eating away at the core of Ivan Ilyich and it horrifies him. But even more horrifying than death itself is the fact that Ilyich, despite prominence and prosperity as a Russian high court judge, has done nothing to make his life worth saving.The Death of Ivan Ilyich begins at the end, as his family and friends receive the news of his demise. Unable to fully comprehend the enormity of death, Ilyich's friends tend to dismiss it instead and seem more concerned with their game of whist. Even Ilyich's widow, while comporting herself with the utmost propriety, secretly tallies the ways in which she will profit from her husband's demise. Except for Ilyich's grief-stricken son, for whom we feel much sympathy, those who knew Ivan Ilyich in life, now seem to dismiss him in death, considering him little more than an inconvenient corpse, something to be disposed of as soon as possible and with a minimum of fuss.The story next flashes back and Tolstoy begins to develop the character of Ilyich as a living human being. At first glance, he seems to be a man much like his contemporaries...empty and superficial, but socially correct, much admired and possessing tremendous personal charm. On closer examination, however, we learn that it is propriety, not morality, that rules Ilyich's life. He takes glory in power and seems to be an individual devoid of understanding and empathy.A bump on the hip provides the first crack in Ilyich's polished veneer. Instead of healing, the bump develops into something more insidious and Ilyich is plagued by a mysterious degenerative disease that causes him great pain and terrible mental anguish. His family and friends show little more than indifference at his sufferings, an indifference that drives Ilyich to both anger and despair.Finally, exhausted with pain, Ilyich makes a last desperate assessment of his life and comes to conclusions that both shock him and serve as catalysts in healing his broken soul.In Ivan Ilyich, Tolstoy shows us his genius for characterization. Ilyich's illness is so degrading (the pain, the injections of morphine, the assisted bowel movements) that we come to feel extreme sympathy for (and empathy with) Ilyich. His death comes as a relief for all: Ilyich is relieved from the pain of dying and living a lie, his family and friends are relieved of an obligation and the reader is relieved of a harrowing emotional journey.Tolstoy presented himself with a formidable challenge when he created Ivan Ilyich. Reader identification and sympathy is not easily aroused with a shallow and superficial protagonist. However, as Ilyich examines his own life, we not only witness his transformation into a fully-functioning (albeit dying) human being, we come to understand Ilyich and know why he chose the life he did and why he is now so dissatisfied with it.Ilyich's epiphany in the hours preceding his death provide the moments of greatest pathos. We feel his suffering and degradation, his denial and fear, his misery and loss. And, like Ilyich, we come to the inevitable conclusion that a life not lived authentically is really no life at all."},{"Title":"The Cossacks: The death of Ivan Ilyich; Happy Ever After (The Penguin classics L109)","review":"The book was one which challenged my previous view of death, and the stages of it. The need for care among the sick is exacerbated by reading this book. Although written during an era much before the one in which we now live, the material is pertinent to present day conditions.

There are many many epiphanies made concrete, and her very simple but shattering verse actually takes you to them.This is a marvelously fluent poem. Yes, there are allusions, but they are simple and bonus, rather than essential.It is one of those poems that is quite clear immediately, yet repays reading after reading.It's a pity so few current poets write with such depth and breadth--to say nothing of such passion."},{"Title":"Trilogy: The Walls Do Not Fall, Tribute to the Angels, The Flowering of the Rod","review":"Poems of angels and gems and fragrance and stars, all written on the downward slope of WWII. H.D. praises the life that survives, the mythic returns of Amen-Ra and Christ, which is also the first budding of spring. London joins in these poems with Karnak and St. John's second city, Paradise--a resurrection of &quot;our earth before Adam,&quot; that &quot;grain or seed/opened like a flower.&quot; Angels and Magi bring their usual good news, but the last word belongs to Mary Magdalene and the goddesses behind her, shifting from Isis to Venus to H.D. herself. The thick web of allusions reads at times like a parody of Modernist excess, but the impulse behind them (and these were written quickly, after a long dry spell) is more inspired than erudite. H.D. improvised a religion of her own that enfolded the War like a shell, tranforming its destruction to a promise of new life. &quot;Trilogy&quot; is a quiet testament to her faith in writing as redemption, the poet as witness and priest."},{"Title":"Trilogy: The Walls Do Not Fall, Tribute to the Angels, The Flowering of the Rod","review":"It is unfortunate that H. D.'s Trilogy is not better known. As the title suggests, it is a set of three related works; there are three long poems, each 43 sections long, each emphasizing different but interrelated themes. The first, \\"The Walls Do Not Fall,\\" explores and evokes Hermetic images and interweaves them with Christian symbols in what seems to be an attempt to synthesize a fresh metanarrative. The second, \\"Tribute to the Angels,\\" is woven around the names of seven angels, each of which suggests a different aspect of divinity, as well as of the human soul. The third, \\"The Flowering of the Rod,\\" is largely taken up with an imagined encounter between Mary Magdalene and Kaspar (one of the Magi), from whom Mary receives the perfume with which she anoints Jesus.Trilogy builds a new worldview in which binary concepts (time/eternity, concrete/abstract, male/female) interact positively rather than violently, and as one might expect, poetry is at the center of the project. H. D. is eclectic in her use of images and symbols, drawing from Christian, Greek, and Egyptian sources primarily. (Her use of Christian imagery is bracingly unorthodox, but without being aggressively anti-Christian.) She loves wordplay, and her stanzas are full of evocative images. Despite its being a war poem, Trilogy is remarkably affirmative in its aspirations to goodness, beauty, and meaning.The style will not appeal to everyone. The whole poem is written in 2-line, unrhymed stanzas of varying length (generally 4-8 syllables), with lots of puns and some internal rhyme. The poem employs many allusions, but most will be understood by anyone familiar with the Bible and Greek mythology. One of the great strengths of this poem is its layered meanings. It may be legitimately read on a number of different levels: as a spiritual/religious work, as a feminist document, as a war poem, as a psychoanalytic project, and as an ars poetica, to name a few. This poem will appeal to anyone who has a taste for Modernist poetry along the lines of Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot, although H. D. is not quite so obscure as some of her contemporaries. Like all long poems, Trilogy has its dry passages, but overall the poetry is sound.This edition is well-edited by Aliki Barnstone, who provides a responsible, accessible introduction to the work as well as illuminating end-notes that explain many of H. D.'s allusions. In her introduction, Barnstone states that she has tried not to be too \\"interpretive\\" in her notes, and in that she succeeds. Once or twice I found myself wishing she would be a little more interpretive, but she is to be congratulated for not forcing the reader to see the poem only through the editor's eyes."},{"Title":"Trilogy: The Walls Do Not Fall, Tribute to the Angels, The Flowering of the Rod","review":"This is one of the classics of the 20th century; it is her most beautiful and mature work."},{"Title":"Battle Gods: Warriors of the Chaak","review":"The artwork is great!

Thanks, Patzi Raven, for taking me on a trip down memory lane."},{"Title":"Behind the Stained-glass Window","review":"This book really fascinated me since my mom went to Catholic schools during the same era. It is well written and interesting. I kept wondering what was going to happen next. A nice mix of suspense and humor, I was sorry to see it end."},{"Title":"Same Place, Same Time (Harlequin Intrigue Series)","review":"C.J. Carmichael has demonstrated her diversity of talent with this murder mystery. Her previous effort was a pure romance novel. This novel revolves around the murders of two men who are cheating on their wives. From the very begininning the suspense starts to build and reaches a very unexpected climax. What makes this a 'must read'is the combination of a mystery with a tender love story. The main characters grow and develop as the story unfolds. The tragedy which they experienced is one which every parent fears. Devotees of either 'mystery' or 'romance' novels will enchanted with this one."},{"Title":"Same Place, Same Time (Harlequin Intrigue Series)","review":"C.J. Carmichael's Intrigue debut, &quot;Same Place, Same Time,&quot; is an expert blend of romance and mystery, new and old, danger and passion. Therapist Trista Emerson doesn't know which is worse. One of her patients has turned up dead, and her ex-husband, Detective Morgan Forester, is back in her life. Pain and misunderstandings broke them apart. Now Trista needs him. Morgan insists she is in danger, and it isn't long before Trista knows he is right. She can trust him to keep her safe. Can she trust herself enough to let him back into her heart?Carmichael's tale is one readers will not want to miss. The murderer's identity is sure to keep readers guessing, and Carmichael ultimately offers a fresh take on a classic premise. The mystery has a similar feel to the older, much missed stories Intrigue used to tell. At the same time, Trista and Morgan's relationship is complex and moving in the way some of the more recent titles have become. Many authors spell out everything about their characters right away. Carmichael has a way of slowly revealing information about the characters' back story that feels strange early on. In the end, it pays off big time. We are slowly discovering who these people are as they rediscover each other, so we are experiencing what they are in a way few books achieve. Throw in an original title, an excellent use of setting in the city of Toronto, and a nail-biter finale, and &quot;Same Place, Same Time&quot; is a New Year's treat."},{"Title":"Same Place, Same Time (Harlequin Intrigue Series)","review":"It's been three years since Trisha left Morgan and two years since their divorce, but the wounds have not healed. After the death of their child Trisha felt she could no longer go on as Morgan's wife, so she left him. Although Morgan pleaded and begged Trisha to come back, she refused.Now years after their divroce Trisha and Morgan are once again thrown together. When one of Trisha's clients are murdered and Morgan is assigned the case, they resign themselves to put their differences behind them and work to find the killer.Although Morgan tells himself he hates Trisha and Trisha tells herself she does not love Morgan any longer, they are unable to deny the strong feelings that they have for eachother.C.J. Carmichael has written an wonderful book about love and forgiveness, along with a little mystery. This is one book that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Same Place, Same Time (Harlequin Intrigue Series)","review":"C.J. Carmichael's book is great. There's a lot of mystery and a wonderful love story about a divorced couple getting back together. I got choked up when they finally broke down and shared their secrets. There are a lot of surprises all the way through, so it's a shame that some reviewers want to spill all the secrets. DON'T READ THE REVIEW DATED FEBRUARY 5! C.J. doesn't tell the reason for Trista and Morgan's divorce for a long time. It's as much a mystery as the murder part but this reviewer gives it all away! Plus, the heroine's name is Trista, not Trisha. You can't go wrong getting this great love story and murder mystery. It's a lot better if you don't have secrets ruined for you before though."},{"Title":"Kiss The Cook (Zebra Bouquet)","review":"I just loved this book!

She is having a terrible day and to top it all off, her delivery driver has called in sick. This forces her to make her final delivery herself. According to her own slogan if it's not there on time it's free. With 5 minutes to spare she double parks to make her &quot;quick&quot; delivery. That is how the fun begins. Melanie's bad day intrudes upon Chris Bishop's (owner of the blocked in car)day and he'll never quite recover from it.This story is strung together with one liners which makes the story move swiftly. We have a quirky heroine, all she wants is a delivery van. We also have a handsome hero who happens to be a paradox, he's an accountant with a harley. Neither has the time nor the inclination to date, let alone fall in love. But as they soon find out it just takes a moment to fall in love.

The order has been canceled, though she doesn't know it. When no one answers her knock, she brings it back to her car, which won't start. She had double-parked when making the delivery, blocking in Christopher Bishop's car. The handsome accountant is steamed but tries to help her out. While trying to start her car, his pants are ripped by a spring in her seat. He ends up driving her home in exchange for a chicken dinner... and this is just the beginning of a wacky courtship, in which one article of clothing is ruined in each encounter! This 4 star story works on so many levels. Melanie and Chris are believable, multidimensional characters. Melanie's spry, wisecracking Nana and Chris' matchmaking mama add humorous color to the tale, which snaps along at a breakneck pace. And humorous and dramatic moments are handled equally well. Bon appetit!"},{"Title":"Kiss The Cook (Zebra Bouquet)","review":"I laughed (a lot), I cried and I enjoyed. This is a light, fast romp of a story. From the first chapter where Murphy's Law takes over to the HEA the characters touch the emotions. Mel Gibson's hormones literally talk/sing to her and are a pip. I even enjoyed the fact that the hero, Chris, was an accountant. A nice change from the usual hero image.The dialogue was a hoot. Sample (no spoilers):&quot;Don't worry. You're in good hands. We'll have a lot of fun.&quot; She eyed him with clear suspicion. &quot;Define fun.&quot; He laughed. &quot;Trust me on this.&quot;I don't know about you, but I'd have been running in the other direction. Mel is braver than me.Nana, Mel's grandma, is a card. She says whatever she wants, whenever she wants. It only adds to the humor. She is, also, people smart. She helps when emotions are out of control and manages to make the most profound statements seem obvious. I really enjoyed her.If you're looking for a laugh, characters that have values shining through, and a fast, fun read, go out and get &quot;Kiss the Cook&quot;. You won't regret it, I don't.

The story opens with the heroine, Mel, in a situation that anyone who's ever driven an old car will recognize. The hero and heroine are believable and completely endearing (just as endearing is Mel's grandmother Nana). Without giving away any plot, I have to say that this book has one of the funniest marriage proposals I've read.

This book is full of sexual tension, good humor and great characters. Oh Chris where are you? Hot, sexy, sweet, all of my favorite qualities. And Melanie is sweet, insecure, smart and has great comebacks. I loved these two characters together. This book oozes sexual tension (and it's done at it's best). I loved the list that Melanie spouts off to keep Chris at a distance and then he proceeds to do everything on that list for her. Chris was a great hero - heres a man that wants to stay a bachelor but the minute he see and spends time with Melanie he seems to realize the inevitable. This book was perfect I could not rate it any better, if you have not yet had a chance to read - Run out and get it.The only complaint - not nearly long enough.

White (1915-1986) always wrote with great eloquence, but never more so than in this superbly moving autobiography. White begins by describing his impoverished boyhood in Boston's Jewish ghetto and his undergrad days (on scholarship) at Harvard in the 1930's. He then writes with great passion about his years as a correspondent in war-torn China (1938-1945), which included working for Time Magazine, reporting on China's Nationalist government (and insurgent communists), and helping to curb a disastrous famine in Honan (Henan) province. The author's attachment to the Middle Kingdom (China) has doubtless inspired several readers (including myself) to visit that enchanting yet oft-tragic nation. White also describes reporting from post-war Europe 1948-1952, and his days as a returned U.S. journalist during the prosperous 1950's and beyond. Readers get a first-hand look such notables as Dwight Eisenhower, Mao Zedong, Chou En Lai, Douglas McArthur, Chiang Kai-Shek, Joe Stillwell, Konrad Adenauer, etc. We also get an intimate look at John F. Kennedy from his 1960 run for the White House through his tragic death in November, 1963. White concludes with a bittersweet account of returning to his once-tranquil boyhood home in 1976 - now deep in the troubled ghetto of violence and poverty.Theodore H. White was one of the top journalists of the 20th Century, and perhaps best known for his MAKING OF THE PRESIDENT series (1960-1972). Very few writers have ever matched his eloquent prose, which is abundant in this superbly moving 1978 memoir."},{"Title":"In search of history: A personal adventure","review":"White witnessed China in the late 30's and early 40's, the Marshal plan implementation in Europe in the 50's and the Kennedy presidential years.

Never hopefully...T.White is also a great writer and journalist."},{"Title":"In search of history: A personal adventure","review":"In Search of History, by Theodore H. White is an excellent and well written book chronicling not only the life of this astounding reporter and writer, but also giving you an inside view into the U.S. from his birth in 1915 to the publishing of the book in 1963. In his early years (1915-1938) he details to a full extent the Boston in which he grew up, as well as going into a small extent about New England and the rest of the U.S. In these few fascinating chapters, he details the history of immigration to the U.S., and how the various ethnicities and neighborhoods functioned. For me in particular, who was only born in the last decade, this view of an America long gone and far removed was both fascinating and informative.In the next section, after completion of his education and after receiving employment as a reporter from Harry Luce at Time, White travels to Asia (1938-1945) to detail the three way struggle between the Japanese, Chiang K'ai-Shek (and his Nationalist forces), and Mao Tse-tung (and his Communist forces), with the U.S. supporting K'ai-Shek. While this era in China is all common knowledge and part of history, to see it the way that White writes it is to see it in an entirely new light. An example of this is when White takes the reader into the party conference (Communist), and reveals many details of Communist thinking that are rather unknown in the West. Also, here, as in almost any situation, White managed to ease his way into the confidence of these men of power, and therefore many parts of what he reveals in this book are not well known, such as how close the U.S. actually came to acieving harmony between the Nationalist and Communist forces. However, White's views on the matter of China differed sharply from those of his employer, Harry Luce (then owner of the Time-Life conglomerate), and so shortly after he left Asia he quit.He next found employment from a variety of small papers and went to Europe (1948-1953) to detail the demilitarization of Germany and the reconstruction of the occupied countries. This section provides an excellent look at an era in history that has been forgotten by the majority of Americans. Take, for example, the European Joint Defense Force. This was a proposal under which all of the armies of the European nations would be joined as one. Long forgotten, this book sheds some new light on this fascinating proposal.Next, White returns home to America (1954-1963), where he publishes several books. He next follows Senator John F. Kennedy through his campaign for president up to his assassination. He was an intimate of Kennedy's, and this section of his book provides an excellent look at that era. He tells of the tear-filled meeting between himself and Jacqueline Kennedy shortly after President Kennedy's death in which he wrote the story that was to label the Kennedy years as the &quot;Camelot&quot; era of American history.This book provides an excellent and in depth look at the world from 1915-1963, from White's (a liberal's) point of view. I recommend this book to the casual, interested, or scholarly reader."},{"Title":"In search of history: A personal adventure","review":"An incredibly broad overview of one man's very exciting career in journalism, Theodore White's \\"In Search Of History\\" puts us at his shoulder as he explores war-torn China and reconstructed Europe, does battle with leftist zealots and right-wing hoods, and apotheosizes the ephemerality of the world and the fleeting cast populating it. Any journalist, or one thinking of a career in journalism, owes it to him- or herself to read this.One might subtitle this: \\"Enough About Those Presidents, Let's Talk About Me.\\" By 1978, he had ceased producing his widely-read and respected \\"Making Of The President\\" books, deciding he needed to figure out what it had been all about. Such a scenario would bode ill except White lived an interesting life he shares here with passion and candor, focusing always on what it meant for him to be a journalist, lighting on telling moments in time and raising questions about his own possible shortcomings and oversights that help lift this above most journalist autobiographies.Starting out a poor Jewish boy in Boston during World War I, White was a Horatio Alger story who made his way to Harvard with a gritty combination of hard work and belief in himself and the country that produced him. Though best-known today for \\"The Making Of\\" series, White had been a reporter for more than 20 years before that, cutting his teeth at Henry Luce's Time/Life, where the focus was always on individual \\"makers of history.\\" Though he fell out with Luce, he held fast to that \\"compelling personality\\" concept throughout his career, latching on to various figures he met with a curiosity so immersive it bordered on idolatry.\\"What frightened me then, and frightens me still, is how very few men it takes at the head of any state to give it its character of good or evil, of freedom, tyranny, torture, butchery or benevolence,\\" he writes, reflecting on postwar Germany but taking in the world.For those disposed to accept this viewpoint, White offers vivid profiles of such unique and complex characters as Luce, Chou En-Lai, Chaing K'ai-Chek, Averell Harriman, and especially John F. Kennedy, of whom White says: \\"Those who knew him well loved him too much...The man I followed wrapped me in such affection that I have never been able completely to escape.\\" Those who note this was part of White's problem have to acknowledge the fact that they, like so many in the last 40 or so years, are drawing on White's own reportage in making their conclusions.What makes White great to read is the apparent absence of anything else interesting going on in his life. He writes a little about women, his first sexual experience and an early wife who kept him working by spending his money. But you get the feeling he was more devoted to us his readers than anyone he knew in his own life. No detail is too small or too squalid for White to bore in on, and stick with long enough to make come alive in our hands, whether it is poverty-stricken children being worked to death in a Shanghai filature or the quality of napery on a French dinner table.Reading him is like having a curtain pulled back on episodes that come off stiff and square in history books, discovering not only the pulsing, bleeding life behind them but something of the poverty of journalism today, at least where imaginative reconstruction and non-doctrinaire analysis are concerned.He also gets into the stories behind the stories, of his fights to get Luce and other editors to publish his view of the world rather than theirs, of the logistical challenges of being at the scene of great events, of helping Jackie Kennedy craft the enduring myth of her husband's Camelot, and his lasting belief in the importance of his work. Jayson Blair and Jared Paul Stern, take note: \\"Contacts are the only bankable capital on which a journalist can ever draw.\\"I wish I could write this review with something other than a ponderous ministerial tone, give some hint of the joy and humor to be found, the marvelous turns of phrase sprinkled throughout this large book like sand on a beach, and properly credit \\"In Search Of History's\\" Dickens-like method of drawing you into the world he inhabits, until you feel like you know as well as he ever did his fellows and his surroundings.Suffice to say this is White's most enjoyable and readable book despite its length, and next to \\"Making Of The President 1968,\\" his best. Along with that other White's book, \\"The Elements Of Style,\\" this is something no writer of worldly affairs can be without."},{"Title":"In search of history: A personal adventure","review":"Theodore H.

TIME magazine once called him the &quot;godfather of modern political reporting&quot;, and he is best known for his classic &quot;Making of the President&quot; series of books. From 1960 to 1980 White covered every presidential campaign and observed the political leaders who participated in them. He became so well-known that candidates from John Kennedy to Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan gave him unprecedented access to the inner workings of their campaigns. White's first book in the series - the bestselling &quot;Making of the President 1960&quot; (which covered the Kennedy-Nixon contest) earned him the pulitzer prize. Yet White was far more than just a political reporter, as this marvelous memoir proves. By 1976 White had grown both tired and bored of covering presidential politics, and so instead of doing another book on the '76 campaign, he decided to write his autobiography. In &quot;In Search of History&quot; White offers a superb chronicle of his remarkable life and career. Born and raised in a poor Jewish slum in Boston, White came from a family of intellectual Jewish immigrants who nonetheless experienced grinding poverty. In his youth White was in many ways a child prodigy - he was both brilliant and energetic. He sold newspapers to help his family pay the bills, attended Harvard University on a scholarship and became fluent in Chinese. In 1938 White, only 23, flew to China to cover that nation's heroic resistance to the Japanese invasion. He was soon hired by Henry Luce's powerful TIME-LIFE magazines to be their Asia correspondent, and for awhile he was Luce's star reporter. White vividly describes his experiences in China and Asia during World War Two, from a devastating famine to his meetings with legendary Chinese leaders such as General Chiang Kai-shek (whom he despised) and Communist leaders Chou En-lai and Mao Tse-tung (with whom he formed a wary respect). He also met the great American generals of the Asian theater of the war, such as Douglas MacArthur and Joseph Stilwell. White seems to have been present at a vast number of great historic events, and among his best descriptions is that of the Japanese surrender aboard the USS Missouri in 1945. After the war White moved to Europe, where he covered that continent's attempts to rebuild and unite and America's efforts to help. In the fifties White began covering American politics, and then in the sixties he both covered and became a close friend of the Kennedy family - thus becoming (as he reluctantly admits) emotionally closer to his subject than he should have been. White's closeness to the Kennedys was dramatically revealed in late November 1963, when Jackie Kennedy personally chose him to discuss the intimate details of the assassination in Dallas and to write a &quot;final word&quot; about JFK. It was White's &quot;Epilogue&quot; (published in LIFE), that created the legend that Kennedy's Presidency was &quot;Camelot&quot; - a word which Jacqueline Kennedy insisted be used in describing her husband's administration. It is apparent from &quot;In Search of History&quot; that White led an extraordinary life and had many adventures (and misadventures) along the way. He is an engrossing writer, and despite the book's length I never grew bored or restless. Among the thousands of journalists of the twentieth century, White almost certainly belongs among the top ten, and this autobiography proves why. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"In search of history: A personal adventure","review":"This is a wonderful tour of the 20C, to about 1970, by a reporter who followed stories as they emerged in the most important places and with the most powerful people. White was entirely self-made, an energetic and talented man who had some luck but mostly worked very hard.Although many journalists came to scorn White for his nostalgic style late in life - rightfully in my opinion - there is no doubt that early on he was a great reporter of courage and idealism. You see him begin reporting for Luce (and Time) while on a fellowship in China, fresh out of Harvard, when he got into the innermost circle of communist leaders after becoming disillusioned with Chiang Kai Shek. There he met Mao, Zhou EnLai, and scores of others who would go on to great power - the reader feels like he gets to know them personally. He then wrote a bestseller on the experience.In a typical move that showed his nose for a great story and a pioneer of in-depth investigations, White then moved to Paris, where he chronicled the post-war reconstruction under the Marchall Plan. He then returned to the US and started his outstanding series on US elections, the Making of the President. After losing a job at Colliers, and at great financial risk, he made his living almost entirely from books.This is a amazing and trailblazing career, thick with historical detail, but this book is also a memoir that lets you in on what made him tick: he witnessed his father beaten down by the Depression, but heard from him that China would have a revolution that would change the world. This was the source of his original inspiration for China. There are many asides that are both charming and fascinating, such as the time he lost his virginity in China, but also about how he works and what he remembers of certain scenes, such as the moment Zhou EnLai got him to eat pork.Warmly recommended, in particular for aspiring writers (like myself when I read it!)."},{"Title":"In search of history: A personal adventure","review":"This is one of those rare authors that can make an exciting history jump off the pages at you. And White was lucky: he saw some of the most interesting events of the 20th century, up close and with access to the principal players. The latter part of the book, where he describes the inner circle of the Kennedy camp on election night, 1960, is one of the best passages I have ever read."},{"Title":"In search of history: A personal adventure","review":"This book reviews the authors life from grade school on and details his collision with some of history's greatest personalities. From Mao to Kennedy, Mr. White's travels brought him to the crossroads of history in the bloodiest century. I read the book in virtually one setting and found it hard to put down and treasure the experience to this day, almost ten years later."},{"Title":"In search of history: A personal adventure","review":"One of the themes of this book is White's belief that history has heroes, individuals who make a real difference, and change things for good. White does not speak or think of himself as a hero, but I believe that many readers of this book will come to the conclusion that White himself was a kind of hero, a hero in serving the American public through first- rate eye-witness imaginative Journalism.In this fast- paced and often exciting recollection White tells of his boyhood on Erie Street in Boston. His father an unemployed lawyer dies when he is sixteen, and the family lives in great poverty. He works hard and goes from Boston Latin School to Harvard. He tells the story of remarkable people he meets along the way including his great mentor in Chinese Studies at Harvard John Fairbanks. White is a person who deeply appreciates other human beings, and one of the best features of this book is his portraits of many remarkable human beings. Among these are those he will meet in his first real journalistic assignment in the Far EAst , General Stillwell, Claire Chenault , General Douglas MacArthur.White has great sympathy for the Chinese people and tells the story of the inept war conducted against the Japanese by Chiang- Kai-Shek, a villian in White's eyes. One of the stories within the stories, and one which alone justifies calling White as hero, relates to the great famine in Hunan province. Singlehandedly White went to investigate this , and it was his reports to Time Magazine and a chilling conversation he had with Chiang - Kai- Shek which led to massive supplies being sent to the province, and the famine ending. White also tells of his visits to Mao, and in retrospect it can be said that he treats him far too gently. Mao has emerged as one of the most evil mass- murderers in human history and White does not even begin to hint at anything wrong with him.White's reporting on China, especially his criticism of the Nationalists leads him into conflict with his boss Henry Luce. White leaves off writing for 'Time' and eventually comes to write the four 'Making the President ' volumes which is what he will be most known for. Towards the close of the book he tells of his special relationship with President Kennedy who he deeply admired, and tells too of the famous interview the President's widow summoned White to , shortly after the President's death when she was deeply worried about his place in history.There are many extraordinarily well- written and moving passages in the book. One of the best is White's description of the Japanese surrender to General MacArthur and how at the very moment of the surrender there suddenly appears in the sky squadrons and squadrons of American planes, a signal of the great American power that won the war.White talks quite a bit about the craft of writing, and distinguishes the journalist limited in vision by being so involved in the factual realities as they are happening, and the historian who can through time and distance order and see things the journalist cannot. Clearly White himself combines both these capacities in this work."},{"Title":"In search of history: A personal adventure","review":"Theodore H. White (1915-1986) published this 538 page memoir in 1978. I just happened to check a discussion group on autobiographies recently, on Amazon, and someone recommended this book. I'm so glad I ordered it! I plan to read several other of his books - he writes that well and I've learned so much.In part one, White discusses his early childhood, schooling, and life in Boston, 1915-1938. Each part is prefaced by a short unique \\"thoughtful\\" discussion. Part two introduces the reader to Asia, 1938-1945. White was there thru the Chinese revolution as a reporter. This is amazing. Part three is Europe - 1948-1953. Now I know what the Marshall Plan was all about. What insights this man had!In part four White returns to America, 1954-1963. I remember this period but White offers the reader a behind the scenes look at politics and America in transition as Kennedy is elected, assassinated, and Johnson becomes president. In 1960 White won a Pulitzer prize for his book on the making of a president. He wrote for Colliers and Life magazines, Reader's Digest, and others. He knew all the presidents, many generals and world leaders personally, and wrote about them from his perspective.I enjoyed this book so much I couldn't wait for \\"reading time\\" every evening - it is riveting and so easy to understand. Thirty-three years ago when \\"Teddy\\" White published this brilliant memoir of his action-packed life as a reporter, journalist, author and world traveller, he was on his way to being a major historian and player in the political process. He is relevant today. I urge anyone interested in great autobiographies to tackle this lively, honest book as well as Theodore H. White's essays and other books. Some were even made into movies. I'm impressed! Find a hardback copy somewhere and be surprised!"},{"Title":"In search of history: A personal adventure","review":"In Search of History is best thought of as Part I of Theodore White's memoirs with Part II coming shortly after with In Search of America. The latter deals much more heavily with presidential campaigns though this book discusses White's aborted effort at The Making of the President 1956 and gives pretty full treatment to the 1960 book that eventually kicked off the series. But it starts long before that, on the poor streets of Boston where White first got into the news, as a newsboy. From there, White made it to good schools and eventually Asia where some fast talk and talent got him some freelancing assignments. He spent a good chunk of his post-college career in China reporting on the civil war there and then the Japanese invasion and World War II. White really exposes how there really was never much of a peace between the nationalist and communist while they fought the Chinese and in many ways it was a three way war. After World War II, White went to Europe where he watched US generals and diplomats enact the Marshall Plan which he views as an unbridled American success. From there it was back to magazine and novel writing in America and then his immersion into presidential politics. The book ends shortly after Kennedy is killed and White has propagated the term Camelot.There are lots of great tidbits in here. One is the decline of major magazines due to television, a phenomenon we are experiencing again with the Internet. Another is an observation White makes in Tennessee about World War II vets breaking the local party boss and demanding fair elections. Although not every election is fair, we do pretty good at this in America and White suggests that part of the reason is that these vets who fought for freedom and democracy abroad came home and demanded the same thing, breaking the backs of many party bosses. It is just a few pages in the book and not deeply explored, but it was interesting. The book also demonstrates some of White's incredible bias in favor of Kennedy, somewhat striking given my own view that White basically becomes a moderate Nixon Republican over his years reporting on politics. This comes out in a few places, though none more so than White basically taking a story Jackie Kennedy has told him and dictating it to his magazine under his byline.White calls himself a storyteller and he is just that. But he is also a fact and theme miner, someone who manages to pull the bigger picture and story out of little events. As with his Making of the President books, White tells a lot about the American story here, while sharing his own."},{"Title":"In search of history: A personal adventure","review":".......how a young man's decision to add Chinese to his college curriculum changed forever his life, placing him at all the pivotal points of history in his time....meeting the men with the visionary ideas........and writing of this journey so exceptionally we all experience the intimacies of every moment."},{"Title":"Socialist Idea: A Reappraisal","review":"This book is a collection of papers, by various authors of a socialist persuasion, presented at a conference in 1973. It is, unsurprisingly, a hugely dated work. The theme of the conference was a critical examination of the prospects for socialism at that time, when the experience of its application - especially, but not only, in eastern Europe - had hardly accorded with the hopes of its adherents.Nearly 30 years later, it is striking just how little relevance to modern politics the authors' ruminations have. None of them foresaw the breakdown of the Keynesian consensus on the rock of high inflation, or dealt with the information problem inherent in the allocation of scarce resources. Some of the essays are almost comical in their social scientific jargon: an essay on 'Socialism and the Nation', by Peter Ludz, concludes portentously, &quot;In contrast to SED [the East German Communists] internationalism, however, the SPD [the West German Social Democrats] inter-state concept does not derive its internationalism from class theory.&quot; It's tempting to attribute this deadly bureaucratic prose to a simple failure to foresee that the only really important historical question that applies to these two parties is that one, the SED, was a totalitarian monstrosity running a police state, while the other, the SPD, is a democratic party adhering to liberal values. Tempting, but too generous to the author: there were many heroic souls throughout the Cold War and across the democratic political spectrum who saw these issues clearly enough, including left-wingers like George Orwell and Sidney Hook.So far, so turgid. But the real importance of this book, and what makes it well worth pursuing in second-hand bookshops, is an outstanding essay (&quot;The Myth of Human Self-Identity&quot;) by the book's co-editor, Leszek Kolakowski, a Polish philosopher who at that time still considered himself a Marxist. Kolakowski calmly and with a complete absence of polemical tone manages to isolate a crucial reason why the Marxist project has always and everywhere turned bloody when it has had the opportunity to wield power. His argument - which is not an easy read, but then it is a complex point - is that Marxism is rendered totalitarian by its notion of 'the perfect unity of social life'. It is not possible to have more freedom, more equality and more justice (the pronounced ideals of socialism) if at the same time one aims at a unified human society.Kolakowski's insight, while wholly original, was also wholly consistent with the liberalism of a thinker such as Isaiah Berlin (who made a similar point in his very last essay, published as &quot;The First and the Last&quot;) and the conservatism of Michael Oakeshott. Socialism in the sense meant traditionally by the British Labour Party, the Israeli Labour Party or the German Social Democrats is not totalitarian precisely because it values liberty more than it values socialising production (though such economic and social policies have had real costs, as the more orthodox policies pursued by Tony Blair would indicate), but then it is not socialist either. Real socialism of the type advocated by the Marxist left *is* an essentially totalitarian project because of this fundamental flaw.The principal reason I myself abandoned socialism was because the force of Kolakowski's point was too great to ignore. His point has never been answered, though he has been met with much abuse and accusations of bad faith (notably by the late E.P.Thompson, whom some mistakenly believe to have been an honourable man). It is well worth searching for this essay, as a prelude to Kolakowski's great trilogy &quot;Main Currents of Marxism&quot;."},{"Title":"Crux Ansata: An Indictment of the Roman Catholic Church","review":"Herbert George Wells (1866-1946) was an English author who is now best known for his science fiction books; however, he wrote in many other areas, such as a famous popular history,The outline of history: being a plain history of life and mankind. Crux Ansata was one of his last works (1943, with later additions), and (as the subtitle indicates) is highly critical of the Catholic Church.Here are some quotations from the book:\\"And it is very manifest that in much of the history of Christianity at this time the spirit of Constantine the Great is as evident as, or more evident than, the spirit of Jesus.\\" (Ch. I)\\"It must be understood that it was from within the body of the Catholic Church that the destruction of its own unity came. It was men in holy orders striving to be good Christians who began to question the methods and disciplines of the Church. The Reformation came out of the heart of the Church.\\" (Ch. XIII)\\"Almost every country in Europe except England had at one time or another been provoked to expel the Jesuits, and, as we shall show presently, their obdurate persistence in evil-doing continues to this day.\\" (Ch. XVI)\\"I am deriding organised High Church and Catholic Christianity, and I would like to make it plain that in doing so I am not disregarding what I might call the necessity of many minds, perhaps most young minds, feel for something one can express by such phrases as 'the Fatherhood of God' and 'the kingdom of heaven within us.'

Beneath a fetching opener (\\"Ratso, Big Bob, and Bungo sheared sheep in Shaggy Gully\\"), the first spread shows introduces three sheep shearers (Ratso, Big Bob, and Bungo), three sheep dogs (Brute, Tiny, and Fang) and a herd of unnamed fluffy sheep. That's a lot of characters to comprehend at once; furthermore, some won't understand the job of \\"sheep shearer,\\" and the illustrations is too crowded--you have to work a little to find the dogs among the sheep. That's surprising, because these watercolor and ink illustrations are otherwise uncluttered and clear. The rest of the story is silly/sophisticated humor that neatly shish-kabobs traditional notions about how men should act.The new shearer on the block (Shaun), employs a sheep-sheep (Pete), instead of a sheep dog. You may need to point out Pete; he's the sheep with the natty hat. \\"Baa!\\" said Pete politely, which in sheep talk means, \`Delighted to meet you gentlemen. Madam, please follow me, and Shaun will attend to you shortly.\\" Predictably, the traditional sheep shearers protest:\\"You can't have a sheep-sheep!\\" cried Big Bob.\\"You need a proper sheep dog,\\" yelled Ratso.\\"Strewth,\\" muttered Bungo, who never said much.IN his thematic response, Shaun replies, \\"Pete's as good as any sheep dog...We just do things...differently.\\" For starters, Shaun doesn't merely shear sheep, he COIFS them, giving them haute couture clips. Pete, for his part, is unfailingly polite and attentive to their customers, who love Shaun's work so much that they ignore the sheep dogs' herding. As in an old Western, the three men sense trouble, and kick out Pete and Shaun. Undaunted, Shaun gives Pete a new shaved look; the other sheep are so impressed that Pete has an idea, and so \\"Shaun's Sheep Salon\\" is born. A very funny series of sheep customers with nouveau wool- follows, and in the coup de grace, even the sheep dogs desert their owners for trims from Shaun! The last few pages complete the transformation, as the herders become professional-level stylists, and Pete's latest idea (\\"Baa Baaaa!\\") which means \\"Everyone can look gorgeous) opens the door to a veritable zoo of new animal clients. The renamed \\"Shaun's Animal Salon\\" now serves all animals, great and small, and the newly groomed animals include a panda with a checkerboard top, a rhino with a curly-cue tail, a giraffe with a row of tufted and tied hair running up his neck, and even three human animals--the traditional sheep herders, opening their minds and redesigning their hair. Somehow, Jackie French pulls the whole thing together; her originality doesn't get in the way of the basic goal of telling an entertaining and engaging story."},{"Title":"Pete the Sheep-Sheep","review":"This is a wonderful, quirky story with some great characters.

That was what I enjoyed most about it.Keith Hearne is a scientist, but the science in the book is not that strong; in fact its factual content is sometimes questionable and usually a bit superficial and naive. For example, at one point the authors discuss an ancient Hindu belief that the last dream of a series in one night should be the one you interpret when predicting the future and comment that this presumably had been arrived at by a long process of observation. This shows extreme naivite about ancient processes of thought. It is much more likely that the rule was arrived at by some process of \\"logic\\" such as \\"The last dream is closest to the future event in time, so it will be the best one to use.\\"Their survey of ancient thinking about dreams is very much once over lightly and perpetuates some myths, such as the idea that the Aboriginal \\"dreamtime\\" was like the western Golden Age or paradisal creation period - a mythical period at the beginning of time. My understanding is that in fact Aboriginals consider the dreamtime to be still continuing today, as a kind of alternate reality (I may have it wrong too, but I'm not writing a book on dreams; if I was I'd talk to an Aboriginal before committing myself).Their survey of modern thinking and research is not much more in depth, despite the fact the Hearne is himself a dream research scientist. I found it an interesting sidelight that Hearne claims to have originated the idea of signalling with one's eyes from inside a lucid dream, something that Stephen LaBerge also claims to have thought of rather than (as Hearne implies) getting the idea from Hearne. This is probably one of those heated scientific priority controversies, and Hearne may well be in the right; LaBerge's book (Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming) is still much better than his, and so is Healing Dreams: Exploring the Dreams That Can Transform Your Life by Marc Ian Barasch, if you want a broader overview.Cool pictures though."},{"Title":"Small Stream Bass: A Complete Angler's Guide to Bass Fishing off the Beaten Path: Tackle, Tactics, Timing, and Tricks","review":"Small Stream Bass: A Complete Angler's Guide To Bass Fishing Off The Beaten Path by stream, river, and lake fishing expert John Gifford is an easy-to-follow, &quot;user friendly&quot; guide to tackle, tactics, timing, and techniques to fishing for bass in overlooked freshwater streams.

It's totally cliche, yet completely honest, and at times you really will laught outloud reading it... which I think Fairbanks would have appreciated."},{"Title":"Laugh and Live","review":"This is truly the most worthwhile book I've ever read, and anyone who thinks more deeply about things or who has had to struggle in life to overcome obstacles will understand what I mean. And anyone who fully understands what Dr Phil is all about will also appreciate this book.Get to know yourself - then change your weak or problem areas and become a positive, self-confident and self-reliant individual! That's the message Douglas Fairbanks was giving to everyone nearly a century before Dr Phil and other counsellors began saying the same thing only in more cliched and psychological terminology. This book, in contrast to self-analysis books, gets right to the point in plain language that you will immediately understand if you've ever done any soul-searching yourself. I personally have had to do so due to a congenital heart problem and various other trials and tribulations in my life, and I came to exactly the same conclusions as Fairbanks did, and I fully agree with his opening words that everyone can CHOOSE to be happy, regardless of their circumstances.The language of this book is pleasant and easy to read, but also hard-hitting to get the most important points across. I didn't find anything humorous in it, as another reviewer stated, but rather felt it was all most serious and written sincerely from the heart. In turn, I took it all to heart as well and found more strength and inspiration to continue my own pursuit of happiness.One slight downside to the book is that it feels more like a photocopy than a re-print, especially seeing the dozen or so photos (some from Fairbanks's early films, others private) throughout the book which are very unclear. However, I'm giving it the full 5 stars because it's the words and message in the book that count here!"},{"Title":"The Secrets of Photographing Women","review":"I don't have the opportunity to do figure photography at this point in my life. However, this book is my primary guide for portraiture; it has been for over 20 years. Peter Gowland did a fantastic job of organizing and explaining lighting techniques and composition. The lighting guide is comprehensive, well organized, and clear. It was written prior to the advent of digital photography. Lighting and composition have transcended the switch to digital (medium and large format slide printed w/ Ilfochrome still looks better than digital). Finally, the images are just nice to look at. After all, they where by Peter Gowland."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Photographing Women","review":"The techniques presented are timeless.Lighting for both indoor and outdoor shoots are presented and each photo is referenced against a basic diagram showing positions of lights, diffusers and reflectors.You will need at least a minimum of equipment to achieve good lighting, you can't usually get by just with a camera and built in flash. You'll have to have at least a decent reflector, and the author shows how these can often be improvised on site. And you'll need some way to hold the reflector in position -- a light stand, improvised support, or helper.Practicing the setups shown here will make you a better portrait photographer.The only thing that would have improved the book would have been photos showing the overall studio/site setup for each shoot instead of just the reference drawings. But that would have doubled the size of the book and probably tripled the cost. But that criticism has spurred me to take photos of my setups for future reference."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Photographing Women","review":"i have read the other books of peter gowland and i might say that his books are practical compared with the other photo booksthat are too technical and impractical. his books might be dated because they are not digital but the principles he givesare still applicable especially with his lighting techniques both indoor and outdoor. gowland presents his tips in easyto understand and shows diagrams where to place the lightings. he is indeed an expert in glamour and boudoir photography."},{"Title":"The Virgin Encyclopedia of Heavy Rock (Virgin Encyclopedia Series)","review":"This book's editor's idea of &quot;Heavy Rock&quot; seems to be somewhat hazy.The book covers mostly Heavy Metal Bands,but expands to other genre music as well.It covers a lot of Punk/Indie bands &amp; some sixties rock/psychedelic bands that don't fit under the Heavy Rock banner.That said,this volume is as informative as the rest of the series &amp; worth buying,unless you are a H.Metal purist"},{"Title":"Brother Blue: A Narrative Portrait of Brother Blue A.K.A. Dr. Hugh Morgan Hill (Portrait Series)","review":"I know Brother Blue well, and must say, this book captures him. The layout of the language (wandering over the page, exuberant, lyrical) echoes his words, rhythms, and movement far more eloquently than I ever thought a written genre could. I am very impressed with this work, and recommend it to anyone interested in modern poetry, storytelling, and sheer passion for an artform. Be prepared to be challenged. Parents should review some of the content before sharing it with younger kids."},{"Title":"Brother Blue: A Narrative Portrait of Brother Blue A.K.A. Dr. Hugh Morgan Hill (Portrait Series)","review":"Anyone and everyone will come away from this story-telling masterpiece with a bit of wisdom to keep and share... &quot;The second chance,&quot; for instance, is a mordant narrative of a downtrodden black family and its caring but hopeless father-figure who is willing to do the ultimate sacrifice to see his family pull through the Great Depression. More importantly it is the crucial point in a young boy's life: Brother Blue's life as an eight year old boy forced to become his &quot;father's father&quot; in a life-and-death situation... Equally beautiful is the artistry that Warren Lehrer has put to work in crafting a book that is itself an aesthetic and typographical work of art...In conjunction with a powerful and moving 80+minutes cassette reading of the book by Brother Blue himself, this book is a gem. Wonderful , packed with hope and wisdom!"},{"Title":"Brother Blue: A Narrative Portrait of Brother Blue A.K.A.

A streetwise professional story teller who had a PhD from Harvard. He told his stories in the streets, parks, in prisons, before royalty, Everywhere! I first saw/met him while he was mezmerizing a crowd of people of all ages in the streets of Cambridge, MA (Harvard Square), which he did often. Unlike the many other street performers who worked there daily, Blue never asked for donations/money. I met him in 1977 and had the honor of recording with him during that year, improvising piano music while he told 4 stories. These were broadcast from time to time on WBUR FM in Boston. I am fortunate to have these master tapes in my possession. I also was blessed and honored to sit with him and his lovely wife Ruth at the New England premiere of George A. Romero's \\"Knightriders\\", in which Blue co-starred. This book is perfect, as it combines part of Blue's own words, his autobiography, with beautiful diverse, expressive printing, and excellent photos of Blue. His story is fascinating, he grew up amongst poverty and prejudice, yet managed on his own to graduate from Harvard. One of the greatest books that I have ever read !

About 85% of the book was a simple tabulation of community statistics with no 'insider' comments. The book did nothing more than tell me specific statistical information and some contact info. I had no better idea about neighborhoods than before. The small 'mini-chapters' in the beginning of the book were so sketchy it was embarrassing to read! There were absolutely NO maps in the book which was very disappointing. This book kept referring to The Thomas Guide which I assume must be a better resource than this was.

It may have some good points. But honestly, I do not have to make my husband the undisputed king of the household to show I love him. There are limits. If I've been saving up to buy my children needed clothing, and he finds the stash and buys a boat, I am not going to thank the Lord that we now have a nice new boat-even though my kids don't have shoes. Actual advice from the book. Or-no matter how bad a day you have had, make sure to put on your high heels and makeup to meet him at the door when he gets home, no man wants to come home to a drudge. Probably not. But how many women who have been busting their butt all day want a husband who comes home expecting a sexpot wife who is instantly ready to do his bidding? Yes being a homemaker is an important job. I like to spoil my hubby a bit too. But this is too much. Where are the books instructing men to be kind to their wives? To understand that she works hard at keeping the house? Don't see 'um. Unless there have been some serious revisions in the last many years, I have say No thank you."},{"Title":"The total woman","review":"I'm really surprised at how many women are apalled by this book.I have always been a strong-willed, opinionated, outspoken, independent woman. I am well-educated and well-spoken. I make twice the income that my husband does, and I work longer hours. I am 26 years old.I have been married for 15 months, and the two weeks since I finished reading this book have been the best 2 weeks of our marriage... (the first 14.5 months weren't too shabby tough.)I suggest to people reading this book, instead getting so defensive over the items which do not fit into your relationship, your idea of a woman's place in the home, etc, just look at the bigger picture, sure you may not have the time to be in full makeup and heels before your husband leaves home in the morning, but maybe you COULD at least brush your teeth and take 20 seconds to give him a passionate kiss before he's out the door. Seriously... the women in his office probably aren't running around in their sweats with fuzz still on their teeth.By adjusting MY attitude, and MY willingness to serve in our home, it has totally transformed both of our attitudes and the way our home is run. I've totally quit nagging, and the things I used to have to nag my husband to do automatically get done, and he does it with a smile. I don't grumble anymore when I load BOTH of our dishes into the dishwasher, and I've noticed that he's made a HUGE effort to clean the table himself too!We are more intimate now than we even were on our honeymoon... not because I'm faking a desire to be with him, (nor am I dressing up in naughty costumes), but because we have totally rewired our attitudes and we sincerely DESIRE one another more because we are happier with ourselves and each other, and feel like we are working more as a team. The first few days, I did feel like I had to WORK on my attitude... My old temper or grumbling ways would start to surface and I would choke them back down... it felt unnatural and 'fake.' That was, until about the third day, when I noticd I wasn't having to choke back my complaints and nagging, and the smile on my face was genuine, not intentional.I really believe the reason so many women get so uptight about some of the ideas and suggestions in this book are because they hit too close to home... Because you choose to focus on yur husband's good points doesn't make you a door-mat, it makes you a happier person, and in turn makes him a happier person (and you may just notice some of those bad qualities drifting away). Have an open mind when you read this, and give it a try... We didn't think our marriage could get any better, and now we can't imagine ever going back.The most valuable piece of advice the author offered for me, (paraphrased) \\"Try looking at your husband and seeing him the way a lady at his office, or a lonely female neighbor might see him.\\" I think about this daily and it helps me see my wonderful husband for the glorious man I fell in love with."},{"Title":"The total woman","review":"In trying to understand Marabel Morgan, I took into consideration that the book was written almost 30 years ago.

No, I just believe that women should be taken as seriously as men are.Am I \\"man-hating radical feminist\\"? Nope. I adore my husband and he reciprocates. My sons-in-law are pretty cool, too.And because he also believes in equal pay for equal work, equal opportunity in the workplace, and respectful treatment for all women, not just for me and his daughters but for all women, he's a feminist, too.But this book, written as it was decades ago for a small segment of the population, seeks to not only turn back all the gains women have made in the past 40 years, but also to shift the basis of marriage to manipulation and dishonesty.My very successful marriage is based on the love, admiration, and respect my husband and I have for one another. Our relationship is based on those feelings, not on my fear that another woman will grab him or that he'll punch me out, or his fear that I may make more money than he does or usurp his \\"role\\" - whatever that is - in our household.It goes without saying that if you love someone, you treat them the best way possible and try to create a harmonious home. You don't need to disturb him at work - especially if you're at work yourself - to give him phone sex. You don't forbid him from ever seeing you at less than your perfect best. (If that's what your marriage depends on, what happens when you age and lose your sex-kitten looks?) You don't automatically surrender your brain and defer to his \\"greater authority\\" when you disagree, but instead engage him in respectful discussion to try to understand his perspective and clarify your own. You don't hide your strength and treat him like a stupid, easily manipulated dog. You don't disrespect him by assuming that he can be deceived by stupid dishonesty.All of the above is what Ms. Morgan recommends in this book.If I did most of what Ms. Morgan advocates, my husband would be out the door. He appreciates me with all my flaws, my intelligence, my strength, my willingness to let him see the negatives as well as the positives about myself, and my honesty. This book is about deception, manipulation, and dishonesty.This is Christian? I think not.

Mrs. Morgan is in no way encouraging women to be &quot;doormats&quot; or to put up with any type of abuse from their spouses. Instead, she shares how women can truly be treated as queen of the castle if they make their husbands the king. Her ideas are based on Biblical principles and outline the God-ordained sanctity of marriage and family. She offers practical, fun, sexy, ideas for keeping the fire burning in a marriage. Although the book is nearly 3 decades old, her ideas are still sound. I plan on buying a copy to give to my cousin's fiancee as a wedding gift.

I had a difficult marriage, a new baby, and was lonely living in a new city. I turned on the Phil Donahue Show and saw Marabel. The words she was speaking gave me a glimmer of hope. I bundled up my infant and headed out in a snowstorm to purchase the book. I read it and did all the activities without getting any positive response from my husband. However, just the fact that it gave me something to do empowered me and helped me out of the depression into which I was quickly sliding. The Scriptures in the book were unfamiliar to me since I am Jewish so I didn't pay them any attention. Three years later I met and fell in love with Jesus Christ. I realized that the Scriptures I was now reading had been in The Total Woman. I got it off the shelf, looked for Marabel's address, and wrote her a letter. She wrote back to me, on her personal stationary, in her own hand, the most gracious note. I am so glad I made the trek in the snow to buy the book.

Most of the advice is just as useful as it was when the book was written. I doubt that husbands today don't care anymore if their wives are poorly groomed, for example. And men and women still believe that great sex for both of them is important in marriage, right?What I found most interesting is that the book stressed organization. If your life is organized, it is less stressful, and your if life is less stressful, you are a lot nicer to be around and your home is a lot nicer place to be. All that is good for a marriage! I recommend this book in addition to The Surrendered Wife."},{"Title":"The total woman","review":"First, let's remember a few things. This book was written thirty years ago, when the idea of women being \\"liberated\\" was in its infancy, and also was considered pretty darned threatening. Witness some of the movies and books that were popular in those days -- The Stepford Wives, for example. Those books were written from a place of male fear. Fear of what might happen if women were TOO liberated.So along comes Marabel Morgan, a former beauty queen, now the wife of an attorney. She had blonde hair and blue eyes. In short, the perfect cheerleader for feminine submissiveness and traditional marriage. Men loved her philosophy, but women weren't so sure.Before stating my own opinion, I should interject that I am a never-married late thirties female. I have had a live-in relationship once in my life that lasted five years. During those five years I did try the Marabel Morgan approach to force a commitment and a marriage. All I did was make myself miserable and confused and the live-in arrangement ended. It's fine to want to take care of your family, but everyone needs more than just being a hausfrau to be fulfilled.That isn't to say that some housewives don't make a success of it -- but those women tend to have extensive interests outside the home, even though they don't work for pay. They have hobbies or other things that occupy their time; they're not having a relationship with their washing machines.Marabel Morgan's book is targeted at comfortable middle-class housewives. They weren't as rare a breed in 1973 as they are today. Her counsel will be of little use to women who work outside the home, which is the rule today rather than the exception. The only thing that she advocates that I find reasonable is that you treat your husband with respect and consideration. That should go without saying, for both partners in a marriage.As for the rest -- donning Saran Wrap, calling his office with sexy chitchat, buttering him up, etc. -- well, if that's what it takes to keep a man interested, I guess I know why I'm single after all these years.

My son is 26 now and at the time he was only 2..the book is really good and if you use the guidelines (based on the Bible) you not only are a total woman but you make your man feel like a TOTAL Man! I try to buy every copy I can find to give to younger friends or newly wed friends! Really good book!

If you, like Mrs. Morgan, operate on the assumption that men need to be constantly flattered, wined, dined and seduced, and women (who obviously have neither the brains or the inclination to seek a career) require the dominance and intellectual superiority of their husbands, this book is for you. If you condone physical abuse, by all means, buy this book (in one touching paragraph, Mrs. Morgan tells women not to nag because their husbands would get fed up, lift them six inches off the floor, draw back their fists...you get the idea). And if you approve of the way Mrs. Morgan backs up her idiotic theories with the Bible, tell her how much The Total Woman changed your life. It certainly changed mine - before I read it, I wouldn't have said more than 'hi' if I'd seen Mrs. Morgan.

I strongly, strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The total woman","review":"My wife bought this book just before we were married, and we read it together. On the whole, I'd say it has some useful suggestions. However, before reading this book, please consider the following:This book ISN'T FOR EVERYONE. Why? Well, consider this:One of the biggest lies I've ever heard is that \\"We're all the same deep down inside; we just have different ways of expressing ourselves.\\"Well, that's not true at all. I've found that different people are very much looking for different things in life, in love, etc. A relationship that might be very satisfying to some might be hell for others.It really comes down to your own hardwiring. Some people are cut out to be drawn to certain things, some aren't, and that's the bottom line. There's nothing wrong loving a book like \\"The Total Woman\\"; conversely, there's nothing wrong with saying \\"This book just isn't for me, and that's that!\\"Having said that, allow me to offer a few points:1) First and foremost, if you are of the feminine persuasion, and find that you firmly believe that the man should be the Head of the household, King of the castle, President of the family, etc., then this book is definately for you. You'll find a lot that's useful here. If you aren't, then you won't.It's that simple.If you are \\"the man is the boss\\" type, then just accept that as being what's in your heart. Read this book (along with \\"The Surrendered Wife\\", \\"The Joy of Sex\\", and \\"Fascinating Womanhood\\") to find out more about creating the marriage you want.[Please take note: If you don't buy into \\"the man is the boss\\" belief system, you might still benefit from reading this. You still might be able to cherry-pick a few good ideas. First amoungst those good ideas is that men (like most people) generally respond very well to being treated with kindness and consideration.]2) Mrs. Morgan informs her readers about something quite specific to the masculine gender: Respect and admiration, especially when coming from a woman he loves, can oftentimes be valued by a man more highly than even true love itself. This, along with a genuine willingness on his wife's part, to respect his opinion regarding issues that he really does know more about than some other people (you, for example), really do go a LONG WAY towards fostering love in a man's heart. Far more so, anyway, than do belittling, insulting, controlling, incessant nagging, and cold-hearted, condescending behavior.Having said that ...3) PLEASE BE WARNED: Nothing in \\"The Total Woman\\", nor in the books just mentioned above, will change the heart of a violent, abusive, and controlling husband. If he is hitting you, verbally abusing you, or elsewise engaging in demeaning, hurtful, derogatory actions, then move out, and move out now. He has no right to treat you as though you are his own personal dumping ground. He is the one with the problem, not you. Get counceling, get help, and make it clear to him that you aren't going to take it anymore. Just be very clear: \\"The Total Woman\\" CANNOT solve such marriage/relationship problems as violence, verbal and sexual abuse, etc.Now that that's out of the way ...4) Even if you are a woman who believes that the man is the President/King/Head of the family, there are a few ideas here that one should be cautious about.For example, while it's a great idea to be alluring and seductive (most husbands adore seeing their wives in stiletto heels, sexy hairdos and lovely lingerie), many of the suggestions here might not be specific to what your husband likes. Some men love a woman in a sexy evening gown; others like tight jeans, high heels, and a revealing halter top; some very much love both, some like neither, and the list just goes on. I'd recommend looking at the big picture on this one. Find out what seems to \\"do it\\" for your man, and then ... do that!Simply put, Mrs. Morgan's suggestion to greet one's husband wearing nothing but saran wrap may delight him ... and it may not. You know best what will work for you and your husband. If you don't, you may just need to experiment a little. You'll find out what works as you go along.Please keep in mind here that finding attractive attire is as much about how you feel as it is about how you look. Remember that you wear the clothes, they don't wear you. The key is to find the alluring attire that expresses your unique feminine beauty, and lights your husband's fire too. That's what it's all about.5) A word about following his leadership: This book recommends that your husband shall make the final decisions about things; this advice is supported by a conservative interpretation of relevant Biblical text.Even if you completely agree with that conservative interpretation, please be advised: I DON'T recommend biting your tongue. Your insight as a woman, specifically your woman's intution, is of ENORMOUS VALUE to your husband. The value of women's intuition simply cannot be over-stated. Any man would be foolish to ignore the insight that his wife has to offer, not just to their marriage, but also to his life. This is where the Biblical concept of \\"Two are better than one\\" very much comes in.Please keep in mind, ladies, that a man who loves you WANTS to hear what you think, and he wants to know what you feel. Please don't interpret anything you read in this book as \\"just don't ever disagree with him, and he'll be crazy in love with you ...\\"... Because that just doesn't work.What does work, especially in a Bible-based marriage, is finding a respectful, tactful way of expressing your views when you two don't agree. Is it possible to pay a compliment even as you're expressing dissent? For example: \\"You are very intelligent, and I'm always seeking your insight and advice regarding issues that confront me, both at home and at work. Still, it seems that this time, I'm just seeing things very differently than you are. I'm not trying to win this argument at all costs, mind you: I just need to know that you've heard my differing views, and that we can agree to disagree if that turns out to be what's best. I just need to know that you respect the way I feel, even if you don't agree. I know that you always have good reason to decide things the way you do; it's just that I do, at least in this particular instance, feel very differently about this than you do.\\"Granted, that's a bit long-winded, but it does lay a foundation for keeping the intimacy in your relationship healthy, even when there are disagreements. Marabel is very correct about one thing: Men very much need to know that their wives have a great deal of respect for them, and don't look down upon them. Nothing is more repulsive to a man than a condescending, controlling woman; this is exponentially true in his homelife.If your husband responds to the above by trying, at all costs no less, to convince you that his views are the right ones, listen to him, and give him the space to say what he needs to say. However, when he's done, be as lovingly fiesty as you need to be to get him to recognize that now, it's YOUR turn to express to him how you feel about things.Be clear that you don't demand that he agree with you, and that you're not so much trying to convince him, as you are simply expressing your need to be heard, and your freedom to be yourself, and have your own views. Didn't he fall in love with the woman that you are, even if the two of you don't always agree?If hubby can't handle that, then that's his problem, not yours. Gently remind him that as much as you truly, deeply respect him, your heart is just in a different place regarding this issue at hand. Saying \\"It's not that I don't love you, of course I do. I just need you to recognize my right to be distinct from you, even as we are united in marriage as one. We are two different personalities, and you are a man, while I am a woman. There will be times when we just can't agree. I deeply respect you, and I need to know that you respect me, too.\\"It might be a tough concept for him to accept at first. Sadly, men can be slow to see the wisdom of the above; a man tends to think it's all about winning the argument and bringing you around to HIS way of thinking. However, eventually, if you are gentle-yet-adorably-fiesty in your application of the above, you'll see good results.PLEASE TAKE NOTE: Even if you do incline towards the man-is-the-boss persuasion, don't tell him you agree with him if you really don't. \\"Thou shalt not give false witness to thy neighbor\\" very much comes into play here. God doesn't want you to misrepresent yourself, and you won't be doing the man you love any favors if you do. Just tell him the truth about how you feel. Be respectful and tactful ... and completely truthful.The rest of the book contains a few pearls of wisdom here and there. Learn what you can, and move on to other books.Well, this review has turned out to be longer than I intended; it seems I had a lot to say. Suffice it to sum up that, while \\"The Total Woman\\" has its uses, and can be quite helpful, your marriage is ultimately yours to figure out. While that's no easy task, this book help you along your way. Just remember to pick and choose only the things that you believe will work for you, and experiment a little to see what works best."},{"Title":"The total woman","review":"Marabel Morgan wrote this advice book in 1972, around the time when one wave of the women's movement was cresting. There's a light smattering of quotes from biblical scripture, then it goes on to four parts. Organization Woman (Part I) takes the Charles M Schwab's $25,000 plan (prioritize your tasks) and lays out a plan for any women to get things done on time. Man Alive (Part II) looks at the delicate male ego and what a wife can do to restore it. Sex 201 (Part III) is about keeping the spice alive. Building Bridges (Part IV) shows how interaction within the family unit can influence children.Books like this will always garner the venom and knee-jerk reactions from a particular segment of women. Even before they read the book, these same people will drag out economic inequality, oppression of women as homemakers, doormat policies all leading inevitably up to domestic violence. NOWHERE in this book does the author promote ANY of these ideas. What the book does do is to advise women who have ended up - either by choice or by circumstances - in the home on how to make the best of it. To excel in homemaking; to provide a nice place to return to; to look after and support your husband; to realize that in marriage, giving in is as important as taking; to show love to your children. Is all this really that bad?Sure, there's the danger of the marriage going south and a wife ending up in the shoes of Terry Hekker. But that's a danger in any marriage. So why not start making lemonade?I'm willing to bet that if the roles were reversed and all the advice was written for husbands...and the wife became the recipient of the attentive husband, this book would immediately be hailed as a must-read for all men.Any advice book should be approached the way we treat high fashion: Take what you can use, water it down a little, and keep the rest in the back of the closet. No one can be expected to walk around in Saran Wrap to keep the hubby sexually enchanted, but rotating sexual turn-ons and outfits to keep the spark alive is a definite keeper.I know this book experienced some raised eyebrows from the religious community when it came out, particularly the chapters concerning sex. Because we women having forgotten how to blush, we've had to rely on some unsubstantiated myth to hold on to our men. Miss Morgan shows that we need to put solid hard work into it. A marriage can stay together on conceptual ties like mutual respect, joint returns, and prenups, but heavens how boring it would all be! Still you could apply all that in addition to the advice given in this book. I would think any woman would want to have all the tools at her disposal.Like Helen Andelin's book Fascinating Womanhood, the focus on men's fragile ego is a priceless piece of advice. I want to say if one were a fly-on-the-wall in a room where men are talking alone... but then I remembered, men rarely talk about their feelings. But compliment and admire any man, and you immediately see the gratitude in their eyes.In this day and age when so many of us are complaining about how men are no longer men....Miss Morgan gives you the keys here. If men are no longer men, it's because WE are no longer women."},{"Title":"The total woman","review":"Marabel Morgan's advice was like a breath of fresh air. Feeling completely suffocated by a new marriage, a new baby, and no living mother to draw advice from, I needed to hear the message of this book. It doesn't advise women to be doormats. In fact, one of the most impowering section of the book spoke of being as organized as a multi-million dollar company. Stay-at-home moms and wives have tremendous responsibilties that often our society ignores. Accountant, housekeeper, cook, childcare worker, errand runner...a complete balancing act. And yes, your husband does want to come home to a loving wife and a sexy partner. Okay, you don't have to be a greeting Playboy bunny at the door and the Bible does not promote breast augmentation, but the idea of pleasing your mate is a privilage. Because you're organized and stay at home during the day to take care of business there, your family will have time in the evening to bond. Skip the idea of manipulating. Mrs. Morgan doesn't teach that. She simply shares that you will reap benefits naturally because you're more pleasant to live with. Read the book. I loved its basic principles."},{"Title":"The total woman","review":"I read this book when I was a teenager. At the time I liked it. Even though I never believed that women should be doormats or act helpless, I figured that it would be fun for a woman to do sweet things for the man she loved.But as an adult I realize how much this book plays to the affluent middle class and not the rest of us. The working-class man can read this book and find out that while his wife is out working at her job to help make ends meet (or making everything they need from scratch so they can live on one income), his boss's wife is at home moisturizing her elbows and putting on slave-girl costumes. While his trips to the water cooler and bathroom breaks are being monitored by his supervisor, his boss is in his office having phone sex (I know MY husband isn't allowed to take personal calls at work unless it's an emergency!). At the end of the day, he'll come home to a woman who is just as tired as he is, while his boss is being entertained by his own personal Playboy bunny.There are plenty of other books around that tell you to cherish your spouse and your marriage. You don't need this one."},{"Title":"The total woman","review":"I thought this book was fun and inspiring when I read it, probably close to 30 years ago. I've been the happy wife of a good man for 37 years, and I credit this book as part of the reason for our happiness. Thanks, Marabel!"},{"Title":"The total woman","review":"I read this book a few weeks before my marriage and decided to apply these principles. In a matter of years I went from being a very self-confident young woman who everyone admired to a broken woman who had lost most of her self esteem. The advice in this book was detrimental to my marriage because my husband had extremely low self esteem and took advantage of my niceness. He didn't appreciate and value me, and by being so submissive, he felt free to treat me like dirt. He gradually became more and more verbally and emotionally abusive toward me than he would have been if I would have stood up for myself from the beginning. I have been divorced for 20 years, and haven't remarried, as I am afraid of being treated this way again. I don't even trust myself anymore. I recently started seeing a therapist to deal with my insecurities and how they invite certain people to be abusive toward me. I'm learning a lot and getting back to being me, the person I used to be before my marriage."},{"Title":"The total woman","review":"Marabel Morgan assumes that a marriage can be \\"turned around\\" with the effort of only one person-this is false. No relationship relies of the efforts of just one person-two people must be actively involved. The fact that Mrs. Morgan portrays this book as Christian is false as well. Since when did Jesus ever tell a person to reduce themselves to mere sex kittens (not to mention lying to your husband about his sex appeal!). Mrs. Morgan reduces men to helpless, pathetic victims who should be manipulted. I wasn't aware that manipulation and lying are Christian virtues. Mrs. Morgan needs to give a little more credit to both genders and more importantly to the institution of marriage itself."},{"Title":"The total woman","review":"To me, the Total Woman is nothing but an insulting conflation of Playboy and Paul's Epistles. Modern evangelicals who buy into this tripe seem to believe it is perfectly acceptable for women to tart up, play sexy and act like Salomes, all in the name of being submissive to their husbands. Sex in marriage should be equal and mutual. It is perfectly fine for women to want sex as much as men want it. It is not, however, the responsiblity of a wife to keep her husband from committing adultery; each partner is in control of their own fidelity. And the concept of a wife giving her husband a little action so he will accompany her church is nothing but abject bribery. What a sick commentary on evangelical men and the poor women who are stuck with them. Just another ignorant example of the two thousand year old version of misogynistic Christianity, as best expressed by Augustine, that states women's bodies are bad, they are only good for sex, procreation and raising children. I am as afraid of this sick mentality almost as much as I am of racism and homophobia."},{"Title":"The total woman","review":"If your marriage is dull or in trouble read this book with an open mind.It will work if you are willing to try it.I gave one to my neighbor who's marriage was heading for the big Dand they have never been happier her only complaint was, she wished I would have given it to her sooner."},{"Title":"The total woman","review":"This book is absolutely amazing!

I find Mrs. Morgan's advice quite balanced and not at all suggestive of a doormat mentality. I think our generation of women need to know that being feminine and womanly is a wonderful thing, that being a wife who loves, honors and respects her husband doesn't take away from her own dignity. As a Generation Xer wife of 5 years, I can appreciate Mrs. Morgan's affirmation of being a wife, mother, and a woman. I'm tired of the man-hating radical feminist agenda that doesn't include career-minded Christian women like myself who still want to BE women.Mrs. Morgan's book was also very revolutionary for her time, because Christians were only beginning to talk publicly about sex as something pleasurable to be enjoyed by husband and wife rather than a chore to be performed.

On our trip in Florida visiting them, and on the way book, this book has provided comedic fodder for my husband, sister-in-law, and myself. It is hysterically funny to read outloud and we are going to be sending it as a gag gift to several brides to be. While some of Ms. Morgan's advice should be heeded by any woman wishing to communicate with her husband, we have all agreed that while trying to make women seem inferior and submissive, we have taken the view that Ms. Morgan has simply helped women to realize that men are inferior, incapable of change and stupid.

Don't complain. Don't contradict. There is a pages upon pages on how not to expect your husband to be a decent lay. This book is full of material, if you're looking for ridiculous comedy. I opened to a random page just now, and saw \\"Let him know he's your special project in life.\\" Who can top that? It reads like an absurd sitcom, Edith Bunker comes to mind, but the fact that she is utterly serious makes it entertaining.The section entitled \\"Adapt to him\\" reads:\\"adapt to his way of life wholeheartedly, even if he doesn't come home for weeks. When he is home, make life so attractive he won't want to leave. Don't make him feel guilty and don't complain.

More than a first hand account, the author provides information based on interviews and archival research. He provides insight into the military and political dimensions of the project, as well as some satisfying operational stories and character sketches (Rickover, Satchel). The quality of writing makes for smooth easy reading. Though I found myself wanting to know details, like whether the wheels on the NR-1 are steerable, the author maintains a responsible balance between maintaining secrecy and recounting a small but important piece of recent naval history."},{"Title":"Dark Waters: An Insider's Account of the NR-1, the Cold War's Undercover Nuclear Sub","review":"I love books about submarines and how they are used so of course I was excited to read this book. The dust jacket lead me to believe that the book was going to detail out mission after mission that was top secret, good old cold war espionage fun. I should have known better, these types of missions are filed away as top secret and it will be years before they see the light of day. Any book that claims to have the details are usually a little more puffed up in the description then the actual details. So I dug into this book and for the most part really enjoyed it. It starts with a review of how the sub was created and the crew trained. Somewhat interesting, but to be fair I was looking for the under water fun and games.The book did move into the subs exploits, but due to the top-secret nature the stories that were told were not all that new or exciting. And that would not have been all that bad if the authors would have kept telling me about the non secret items like finding other wrecks at the bottom of the sea and weird fish they came upon. Instead they spent just a little too much time of live outside of the sub. Ok I know these guys have wife's and families, but to be fair I do not care. I want exciting submarine stories, not issues about home life. Overall the book was mostly interesting and well written. I could have done with more detail, but there is nothing I can do about that."},{"Title":"Dark Waters: An Insider's Account of the NR-1, the Cold War's Undercover Nuclear Sub","review":"This was a fun little book to read about the NR-1. After reading it, I could not understand why more deep sea submersibles were not nuclear powered. The idea that all these others staying down for only 6 to 8 hours while the NR-1 could stay down a month should have told all deep sea submersible builders that nuclear power was the way to go.You don't get to read about all the missions and it doesn't really explain why there are not more NR-1s. The only reason seems to be the initial cost. It's hard to believe that after how sucessful this one was that they did not build a fleet of them.They never explain how deep it can go which I was curious about because I would like to know if it could have visited the Titanic. I am surprised that there was never anything about this on the History channel now that it is out of the bag with this book hopefully they will do something about that.It was a good real life adventure story."},{"Title":"Dark Waters: An Insider's Account of the NR-1, the Cold War's Undercover Nuclear Sub","review":"I did enjoy this book. It was good to get some stories of the classified NR1. It would be nice to have another edition that carries it from when this book stops."},{"Title":"Dark Waters: An Insider's Account of the NR-1, the Cold War's Undercover Nuclear Sub","review":"Wow, what a story of technological achievement, courage, leadership and creativity..... all accomplished far out of sight of the general public. The book benefits from the knowledge of someone who was there, both in the little boat and within the culture of the Cold War submarine service. In addition it is well written and edited.The stories of just developing the technology and operating the vessel are incredibly interesting. It's much the same level of accomplishment as was the SR-71, far beyond the state of the art. But \\"flying\\" at only 5 knots, 1/400th of the speed of the SR-71 and out of sight below the seas it required the same courage and excellence to operate. However the NR-1 missions lasted for weeks, not hours.It does not take much imagination to understand that there's lots that has most certainly been left out of the book in the interest of national security. Yet what's there is a collection of stories from several cruises. Some are told from a first hand viewpoint and others from direct contact with those who were there.I'm far from an expert in the subject but the technical details in the book had a far greater ring of truth than those in some of the other \\"popular\\" submarine intelligence related books on the market.The story of the attempt to raise the F-14 was great. It highlights the huge gap between those who think they know and those who have to deal with reality in real time. The snooping around the Russian SOSUS installations was also really interesting.There's also a lot of oceanography in the stories. This was the first manned vessel to cover significant distances at great depths and thus that saw and experienced many new things including the mysterious sea bottom waves while searching for the F-14.The author does a great job of describing constant struggles with the experimental and highly advanced technology on the boat. From the near loss of the boat due to an electrical failure that dumped the nuclear plant in the middle of a huge storm to the challenges of even minor components used in a most challenging environment.Throughout their missions was the background thought that they were operating in a world as remote as the backside of the moon. Like Apollo 13 there was no rescue vehicle and no survival outside the sub at great depths. Yet, the sub was able to attract some of the best officers and em from the Navy.What does the book lack? Thankfully it lacks the artificial drama of too many military books written by those who have no knowledge of the culture. It's not written to play well in the local theater, but rather to take the reader on the cruises of a lifetime. It's also a great tribute to those who served our national interests, far from the spotlights and cloaked in a veil of secrecy that prevented the participants from receiving the thanks of a grateful nation.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dark Waters: An Insider's Account of the NR-1, the Cold War's Undercover Nuclear Sub","review":"iT HAPPENED WHERE YOU WORK AND PLAY.

Obviously a lot was left out due to security requirements, but still very interesting and engaging reading."},{"Title":"Dark Waters: An Insider's Account of the NR-1, the Cold War's Undercover Nuclear Sub","review":"Dark Waters tells the story of the design, construction and early (late 1960s to late 1970s) operations of the U.S. Navy&#8217;s smallest and most classified nuclear submarine, NR-1. Co-written by &#8220;plankowner&#8221; crewmember, Lee Vyborny, and a professional journalist, Dark Waters tells the inside story of the delayed, far-over-budget initial construction, the crew&#8217;s selection and torment by the infamous Admiral Rickover and the difficulties of putting a totally unique vessel into operational service. NR-1, which is still in service, has a tiny 130 horsepower nuclear power plant, displaces a mere 409 tons (compared to 6,900 tons for the Navy&#8217;s Los Angeles Class SSNs), and operates with a crew of 12 or fewer. Its most unique aspect is an ability to operate and maneuver indefinitely at depths up to 3,000&#8217; and search out and recover lost objects (e.g., a top secret missile from a sunken aircraft) or pry open our adversaries' military secrets (e.g., a Soviet underwater detection system in the Mediterranean).During the ten year operational period Vyborny writes about, NR-1 suffered many &#8220;near-death&#8221; experiences due to equipment failures and the inherent hazards of operating a tiny submarine &#8220;on the edge&#8221; for extended periods. Several tales of the crew&#8217;s ability to get themselves out of tight jams (there was no way anyone on the surface could help them) are riveting, inspiring examples of men living up to the highest traditions of Naval service. These sailors&#8217; little known &#8220;inner space&#8221; explorations are as intriguing and inspiring as many of NASA&#8217;s outer space exploits of the same era.Unfortunately NR-1&#8217;s post-1970s operations are barely mentioned in Dark Waters. Likewise, reference is made to increased Navy-civilian NR-1 science operations, but few concrete examples are provided. Unfortunately the book contains some factual errors. For example, Vyborny asserts NR-1 &#8220;has become the oldest operational boat in the Navy.&#8221; Even assuming, which is not clear from the context, that by &#8220;boat&#8221; Vyborny means submarine, that is not a correct statement. USS Dolphin (AGSS 555) went into commission in 1968, several months before NR-1 was launched; despite a fire and near-sinking last year, the Navy so far has kept Dolphin in commission (DBF!).As a former Navy Spook I sometimes cringe when books like Dark Waters, Blind Man&#8217;s Bluff, etc. disclosure formerly classified Cold War capabilities and operations. At the same time I&#8217;m proud of the heroic and inspired efforts, as well as willingness to endure danger and discomfort, that lead to our Cold War victory, and believe these stories need to be told. I recommend Dark Waters to anyone interested in submarine technology, deepwater exploration, nautical adventure and Cold War history."},{"Title":"Dark Waters: An Insider's Account of the NR-1, the Cold War's Undercover Nuclear Sub","review":"As the Cold War has receded into history, we are learning more about the incredible feats of technology and human achievement that went on in that period. Joining the ranks of books (e.g., Sontag &amp; Drew's &quot;Blind Man's Bluff&quot;, Craven's &quot;Silent War&quot; and Tyler's &quot;Running Critical&quot;) that deal with the role of the US Naval submarine force is &quot;Dark Waters&quot; by Vyborny &amp; Davis. This book combines the story of the development and exploits of the NR-1 with the story of Vyborny's service aboard this submarine. As one of the &quot;plank owners&quot;, Vyborny takes us through the long gestation period and the immense technical challenges of building a small, nuclear powered submarine capable of diving far deeper than its' larger sister SSNs. The unique abilities of this submarine to literally drive (on Goodyear truck tires!) along the ocean floor, and the varied uses it is put to during the time period described are fascinating. Vyborny's description of a &quot;routine&quot; short voyage by NR-1 out of Groton that turns into a seafarer's nightmare is vivid and chilling. Along the way we also get further insight into the driving force behind NR-1's development, one of the most fascinating and controversial characters in modern US Naval history, Adm. Rickover. The NR-1 is truly a national resource, and it is a delight to finally have an authoritative insight into the role it has played over the past thirty plus years. Although the book states on its' final page that the NR-1 has become the oldest operational boat in the Navy, I believe the correct statement is that it is the oldest operational submarine in the US Navy (carriers such as CVN 65, Enterprise, predate the NR-1)I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in either submarine history and operations or the Cold War in general. My only reservation is that I wish the book were longer and had even more fascinating stories about this unique submarine and its' crew!"},{"Title":"Dark Waters: An Insider's Account of the NR-1, the Cold War's Undercover Nuclear Sub","review":"Groton Connecticut, 1966: The keel was laid for a radically new U.S. Navy nuclear submarine. She was to be small, dive deeper than any other, and roll along on the very bottom of the ocean using large tandem sand tires. Propelled by the world's smallest naval nuclear reactor, she would have extraordinary mission duration. She was to be built and to be operated in great secrecy. This was \\"Submarine NR-1\\". When she began her sea-trials in 1969, NR-1 was manned by a crew of 12 hand-selected officers and men of the U.S. Navy, joined by three highly trained civilian engineers.The authors reveal that for the following 33 years, continuing to this day, NR-1 has carried out operations that were at times so secret, even many of the Navy's senior officers were only dimly aware of her existence and capabilities. Vyborny and Davis provide a fast-paced and compelling narrative. We really get to know the \\"Right Stuff\\" men who executed those hazardous yet crucially important missions.\\"Dark Waters\\" is peopled with legendary characters like Admiral Hyman G. Rickover and Robert Ballard, the undersea explorer who found the gravesites of Titanic, Bismarck and PT-109. The book does a fine job of capturing the excitement and intrigue, the challenges and dangers of the Cold War as fought aboard NR-1. Reading the book was an engrossing, educational and nail-biting experience.I recommend Dark Waters to anyone interested in 20th century military history, naval adventure, oceanography, archaeology, scuba diving, military intelligence, defense technology or even the U.S. Space Program."},{"Title":"Dark Waters: An Insider's Account of the NR-1, the Cold War's Undercover Nuclear Sub","review":"Dark Waters (by Lee Vyborny and Don Davis) recounts the first ten years of the security-shrouded career of Submarine NR-1. While I don't know the author personally, I am well acquainted with the &quot;star&quot; of the story because I worked as a design engineer at the Electric Boat yard in the mid-1970's and was involved with NR-1 on a daily basis. I can say without hesitation that the authors have this story nailed.One exciting chapter describes the perils faced by the crew during a reactor casualty and when a severed tow line fouled the screws -- all occurring amid a North Atlantic winter gale. I remember the time vividly, as we were back in the yard formulating contingency procedures in case they had to abandon the ship. Fortunately, the NR-1 crew overcame the problems.This story is replete with great characters, both famous -- like the legendary Adm. Hyman Rickover -- and unknown to the general public but well remembered by we who were there. The latter include officers and men of the NR-1's crews, clearly the Navy's best and brightest, and managers and engineers from Electric Boat and Sperry whose unflagging efforts were essential to the creation and operation of this national asset.I unhesitatingly recommend this book, not only to those interested in submarines, but to any reader with an interest in the long history of men, ships and the sea."},{"Title":"Dark Waters: An Insider's Account of the NR-1, the Cold War's Undercover Nuclear Sub","review":"\\"An Insider's Account of the NR-1, the Cold-War's Undercover Nuclear Sub\\"By Lee Vyborny and Don DavisPublished 2003 by New Amerian Library-243 pages/35 PhotosLee Vyborny was an enlisted IC Nuke trained plank owner on this boat and tells an excellent story of the history of the boat, it's early financial appropriation problems and the construction of this very secret boat that was to become Rickover's \\"toy.\\" It also tells of the training that he received prior to the very long design and construction of this boat that is a legend in the Submarine Service.From the very first chapter right out of Blind Man's Bluff,Lee tells the reader stories of the danger posed by the North Atlantic on this small wave swept boat and the harrowing recovery of a bomb from an F-14 and even mentions the nuclear warhead recovery and the search for Israel's lost boat Dakar in the Mediterranean. The terror of being trapped and stuck in the mud at great depths makes me wonder why they had any crew who stayed with the boat for any length of time/From the first commanding officer, LCDR Dwaine Griffith to LCDR Toby Warson, who I served with in the 60's on the Patrick Henry, to the CO who bravely broached Rickover's reactor start-up procedures. He did this to save their lives. Right through to the design considerations for the NR-2, I found the book very well written. Someone mentioned the book was candy to veteran submariners and I concur.Maybe it was because the book was written by an enlisted person is the reason I found the book really was aimed at my level and so exciting. I was thoroughly disappointed when I neared the end, in that I wanted more and more of this fabulous story.I rate it a ***** of 5. The first \\"submarine\\" book I have ever rated this high. The book is chronologically right, militarily correct and contains stories of Admiral Rickover that are new to me.BZ Lee and Don."},{"Title":"Dark Waters: An Insider's Account of the NR-1, the Cold War's Undercover Nuclear Sub","review":"No one is quite sure when Admiral Rickover decided the Navy needed a small nuclear-powered submarine that could drive along the deepest depths of the ocean and be used for a variety of missions. The civilian world had been using deep-sea submersibles for some time, but it was not until the Thresher accident that everyone realized the need for a vessel that could remain underwater at the deepest depths for very long periods of time. It was developed and built under conditions of extreme secrecy and was never even designated a warship. It had a variety of bizarre features, including tires on the bottom of the hull that would literally permit it to drive along the bottom, and sideways thrusters fore and aft that allowed it to hover in one exact position.Lee Vyborny was one of the original crew members on the tiny NR-1, a sub that contained a midget nuclear reactor, which developed a mere 130 horsepower, of which only 60 could be used for propulsion. The crew quarters were tiny, and there was no stateroom for the commander, who would usually sleep on the floor next to the control panel. The reactor was designed so it could be operated by one man because the crew never exceeded eight people, usually only four on duty at any given time.In an uncharacteristic mistake, Rickover tried to keep the cost of development and building down and required that as many of the ship's components as possible be purchased off-the-shelf. He was under the mistaken impression that the commercial deep sea industry was well developed and the parts standardized. At the same time, he insisted on testing these parts under the most extreme conditions. They had never been designed for the role he intended, and the result was costly failures and time spent to develop alternatives. The early computer they used was a midget and capable of only fourteen simultaneous operations, in contrast to the original PC, which could do many thousands at once.Rickover's presence was ubiquitous. Everyone was suitably cowed, but he knew the bureaucracy well and how to manipulate them. The story of the two dead mice is illustrative. A habitability team was due for an inspection. Their job was to verify that a new ship was liveable. The NR-1 had so many discomforts for the crew, Rickover knew he might be in trouble, so he sent out an aide to find two dead mice and to hide them in the boat. The habitability team was delighted to find a dead mouse, thinking they would be able to reprimand the famous admiral. Instead, they were the ones on the receiving end. He told them they had done a terrible job and didn't belong in the Navy. &quot;I know there were two dead mice on that boat,&quot; he shouted, &quot;I bought them! You only found one! Get out of here!&quot;When lambasted by the General Accounting Office for the NR-1's cost overruns and asked to explain the excess, Rickover replied with a sarcastic letter, reprinted in full in the book, suggesting their analysis was similar to a review of Lady Chatterly's Lover by Field and Stream magazine. The letter concluded, &quot;A cursory review of the subject report leads me to conclude that its authors, likewise, lack comprehension in the manner of accomplishing research and development. Therefore, I believe no useful purpose would be served by detailed comments on my part.&quot;In order to withstand the enormous pressures at depths to which the little sub was expected to go, the hull had to be perfectly round. The twelve-and-a-half-foot diameter hull could be out of round by no more than 1/16th of an inch. That required special manufacturing processes. The crew had to undergo special psychological tests to see whether they could stand being cooped up in tiny spaces for long periods. Submariners who had been successful at resisting the stresses of a regular submarine wound up in fistfights after just a few days when tested under the conditions expected on the NR-1.The boat was expected to remain under water indefinitely, but practical considerations limited the length of the voyages: food and waste. The ship had no galley, so the crew subsisted on TV dinners purchased in large quantities and kept frozen until they were needed, and when the waste tank was full, they had to surface.Ironically, the NR-1 has outlasted larger and more famous mega-submarines. According to the author, it continues to conduct classified missions in addition to being a valuable resource for many universities and research institutes for tamer exploratory searches of the ocean's depths."},{"Title":"Dark Waters: An Insider's Account of the NR-1, the Cold War's Undercover Nuclear Sub","review":"Lots of details in this page-turner, half of which is a first-hand account from the author and the rest retold through others.

This is an excellent book on the SF earthquake and fire in almost all respects. The photos and drawings are probably the best one can find anywhere and the work is well researched. I would not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone even remotely interested in the subject.The reason I gave the book four stars instead of five is that it is written very mechanically. The authors spend much of the book telling us about the fate of individual buildings and so fail to tell the story of the disaster fully. At times it reads like an engineering report on San Francisco buildings. But this is a small flaw that should not deter anyone from getting the book."},{"Title":"Denial of Disaster: The Untold Story and Photographs of the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906","review":"Ten years ago, I discovered Denial of Disaster and was floored by what I read. This is the definitive historical work on the greatest natural disaster in U.S. History. The research by Gladys Hansen and her team, former Fire Chief Emmett Condon and the superb journalist David Fowler, forever destroys the official lies that have lasted nearly a century. The official death toll is 478: Gladys has proven that more than 3,500 died. The death toll is easily over 6,000. The photographs are superb, the text strong and inviting, the eyewitness accounts are breath taking. Yes, I may be biased: my novel, 1906, is a fictional account of the last, great days of the city of San Francisco as it once was. But my response to this book was immediate and dramatic, long before it inspired me to write my novel. Periodically, I revisit it like an old friend. There is nothing quite like it in the entire book world. It makes history come alive. James Dalessandro"},{"Title":"Denial of Disaster: The Untold Story and Photographs of the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906","review":"I got this book because it was so highly recommended, after I had finished reading the fiction, 1906. That book gave a lot of information that was new to me, even though I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, and my father worked in SF. This book is simply incredible. The amount of photographs of all kinds, including panoramic scenes meant for stereotopic viewers that were popular at that time, and postcards that were 'colored' made this book an incredible find. Not only have I been through it several times, but also I brought it back to my father and mother who were in awe of the detail and the photography provided by the author of this book. Her information concerning individuals, concerning the inability of the fire companies to successfully fight any of the fires (water pipes were broken as were roads made inaccessible)...intrigued me and my father who was a civil engineer.Then my nephew who is studying at a nearby college came and went through the book, as he is studying urban planning. He was very interested in the modern day SF and the author's explanations of why SF is in an even more precarious position should another quake as strong as the 1906 quake happen, due to continued ignoring of the need for quake proof buildings and water lines, breaks between houses, the fact that SF actually has less fire departments now then in 1906 and other major problems.I love San Francisco as a city and where I grew up, but quite frankly, I would never dream of moving back there, partly because of this book. Yet there are other cities equally at risk over poor urban planning (new Orleans for one), and this book would be a good required reading for those going into urban planning and environmental impact on human populations.A truly great book...Karen Sadler"},{"Title":"Denial of Disaster: The Untold Story and Photographs of the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906","review":"This book is the must have for anyone interested in this history of San Francisco.

Yet they might overlook it for years, as I did, and I'm in that group. We might pass it by because it is so brilliantly written and beautifully illustrated, but there aren't any graphs or partial differential equations or whatever.Interestingly, it is published by Cameron and Co., whose \\"Over London\\" etc. books have those astounding aerial photos. Well, I thought the new photos in this book must be by Cameron, they're so good. No, they're by Richard Hansen, Gladys Hansen's son, who also researched the old photos, and is a top-notch professional photographer, obviously.So this is a top quality coffee-table book. But it is much, much more. It's the result of Hansen's many years of meticulous research and awesome scholarship on the subject, still going on, tracking the growing number of casualties (currently over 4000). It is an expose' of disgusting corruption, of arson and military looting. It describes the shaking, maps the areas of bad ground, the route of the fires, describes the misery of the refugees, and, finally, almost when one can stand no more bad stuff, true gut-level heroism. All is told in restrained, elegant prose, somehow making the catastrophe more profound.

You'll learn how to pick the right film speed (you'll learn what the different numbers mean, 100, 200, 400 ect.), pick color or black and white film, how to pick a good photo finisher, the different kinds of flash most cameras come with and how to use them, why always using flash isn't a bad idea, moving with your subject, changing the angle from which you shoot, making those breath taking landscapes you stumble across look just as stunning on film, and that's just the tip of iceberg. If you've been waiting to buy that new camera, this book will help you pick which one is best for you. There are so many options now a little guidance will go far.

The only thing a rational person would do, buy a &quot;how-to-book&quot;. Now I've had some experience with &quot;For Dummies&quot; books, and for some of them, I found them very insulting, however, for a total newbie to the photography field this was my saviour.I read the book from cover to back. It taught me in laymens terms, how to use a point and shoot camera to shoot like the pros. Explained photographic techniques, tips and tricks, even down to how to choose a good mini-lab to process your pictues.Well, within a month I was spouting the glories of this book to my co-workers and friends, as well as my customers, many of whom later thanked me for recomending this book. My sales were through the roof and customers would love to come in to get ME, ME, the novice, to critique thier photos based on the concepts I learned from this book.I must say Russell did a bang up job, and is probablly in large part responsible for the success of my career with that chain, not to mention my current pasion for photography.The text is easy to understand, well indexed, acts as a tremendous reference to readers who wish to come back to it, and the examples are visually stunning. The only issue I had with the book is that they pushed Kodak products, these being the ties of corporate sponsorship I suppose.The one thing Russell did leave out was information on how to select a film and paper combination. He did cover how to select the proper film speed, but any photographer worth thier salt will tell you that shooting on Kodak film and printing on Fuji paper vs printing on Kodak paper will give you diffrent results. Other then that, very comprehensive, very smart, and very easy to use.I love how the book destroys the myths and fears of the novice user and takes the power from the pro and puts it into the average users hands. No longer do you feel incapable of producing awe inspiring works, and feel guilty for trying to learn. I like how Russell pushes the learning aspect of photography, encourageing users to burn through a few rolls to learn thier camera, to learn how light works, learn how colours and flash and focus become tools to enhance as opposed to destroy photographic art. It's a very inspiring and empowering book, very well done.As for the information on how to choose the right paper/film combination, I'd be more then willing to assist anyone that e-mailed me. Other than that I would stake my reputation as a &quot;photography expert&quot; and photographer on the quality and invaluable advice contained within this book,Good job Russell!"},{"Title":"Photography For Dummies, Second Edition","review":"After first reading Russell's book I admit I was not happy. I left the store not realizing this book was geared toward's point and shoot cameras...a fault totally my own since it is pretty clear after examining the cover. I'm glad I didn't return the book though. After mildly bashing Russell's book in my review here of the Idiot's Guide to Photography...I realized something. I had overlooked that, these two books work quite well together for the beginning SLR enthusiast like myself. The Idiot's guide goes the serious hobbyist/semi professional route by focusing on 35mm SLR cameras. Russell's book, while for point and shoots...really doesn't spend tons of time talking about equipment and accessories. Russell's book is heavy on &quot;how to take darn good pictures.&quot; The Idiot's guide certainly has lots of good advice as well...but I think Russell's book actually exceeds Mr. Woodson's when it comes to explaining good techniques. I rarely recommend both an Idiot's guide and a Dummies book, but in this case I think it's appropriate. For learning about my new Minolta's features and how to buy, upgrade and understand my equipment, I'll refer to the Idiot's guide. For tips on taking great pictures, I'll refer to Photography for Dummies. Thanks to both authors for their efforts."},{"Title":"Photography For Dummies, Second Edition","review":"Forget it folks... keep looking for another book.While this book is written for the novice/amateur photographer, there are MUCH better ones. In a nutshell, this book is filled with VERY logn chapters that never seem to end, not enough photos (there are about 8 pages in the center of the book that have some color pics - but that is it!!), and some explanations that are too confusing.Two books that Amazon carries that I recommend highly are: 1) 101 Essential Tips : Photography (a great little compendium of helpful facts and tips) and 2) KOdak: How to Take Good Pictures (a superb book!).Again, skip this one. (I bought it and shortly thereafter returned it to Amazon.)"},{"Title":"Photography For Dummies, Second Edition","review":"Regardless of the type of camera used - and I use SLRs to point-and-shoots (for the most part now, including the Advantix system)Photography for Dummies is remarkable, whether you're a complete novice or one who has spent a lifetime taking photos. Yes, indeed, it's instructive even to the point of showing how to load film, to the real &quot;meat&quot; of personal photography, and that is instructing us as to how to &quot;compose&quot; - the most challenging aspect of photography, and for those of us who choose to document our life experiences through a camera, usually the most frustrating. Mr. Hart's book brilliantly illustrates, in language we can all understand, how to evolve from the &quot;snapshot&quot; stage of photography to shooting images that are truly memorable and capture the essence of the moment. Beyond that, having purchased several &quot;Dummies&quot; titles, all of which have proved to be useful, instructive, and occasionally amusing, Photography for Du! mmies is far and away the most ambitious - and beautiful - of the Dummies books I own or have perused. It is an outstanding reference book, one that I will refer to for years to come."},{"Title":"Photography For Dummies, Second Edition","review":"This book, while doing a great job with point and click cameras, does not address SLR photogrpahy well at all.

I am a casual photographer looking to pursue photography as a hobby, and this book was a great place to start.

But as with the first edition, I've made it my business to simplify the often intimidating processes involved in taking and printing pictures without film. That said, the book contains all you need to know to shoot with film, as the majority of amateur photographers still do. I've tried to weave together the digital and \\"analog\\" approaches so that whichever type of camera you're using, Photography For Dummies can serve as a complete guide to easy picture-taking. The book also contains an entirely new section of color illustrations, many if not most of them shot with digital cameras. But its basic premise is that whether you're shooting digitally or with film, many of the same simple tips and techniques can dramatically improve your photography.

Allows a novice photographer to put all those intimidating buttons on his camera to work like a pro. in no time. Teaches how to create photos people actually want to see."},{"Title":"Photography For Dummies, Second Edition","review":"Unlike many of my colleagues in the computer industry, I happen to like the Dummies books. My colleagues object to the term &quot;Dummies&quot;, and they consider the books simplistic and silly. Well, philosophers from Socrates to Will Rogers have praised the virtue of knowing what it is we don't know, and Dummies books are written for those of us who know we're ignorant on the subject and just need a good, uncomplicated, non-threatening place to start.So, when I realized that I had both a camera and no real idea what I was doing with it, I checked to see if there was such a thing as Photography for Dummies. There is, of course, and Russell Hart is the perfect man to write it. He obviously knows and enjoys his subject, and while he's not as silly in his writing as, say, Dan Gookin, he is direct yet manages a light tone. He starts the reader with basics like choosing film, loading it into the camera, pressing the shutter release (more complicated than you might expect on many of today's cameras), how and where to get your film developed, and what to do if your camera isn't taking pictures.From there Hart goes on to the real meat of the book -- how to use the artistic elements of photography (such as light and composition) to create memorable photographs. He even explains why you should take pictures. Hart is very big on photographs as history, not just of memorable events like the Transcontinental Railroad or Neil Armstrong on the moon, but of our lives and families. He advocates taking pictures of anything and everything from weddings and graduations to the way the light changes the look of one's house throughout the year. There's also a chapter devoted to digital photography -- very important as digital cameras become cheaper, better and more widespread.Unfortunately, this book's biggest strength is also its biggest weakness. Hart assumes that the reader is using a point-and-shoot camera (the kind they sell at Kmart for $100 or so), or if you're using something else like a single-lens reflex or single-use camera, that you're using it like a point-and-shoot. Granted, this is the way most people use their cameras and the best approach for a Dummies book, but it would be nice to have some &quot;transitional&quot; material or at least a glossary for those who want to move on to more challenging formats. I looked in vain, for instance, for a definition of &quot;f-stop,&quot; probably because point-and-shoot cameras don't have user-changeable f-stop settings. I knew I didn't need it for my particular camera, but I'd heard of it and I still wanted to know what it was. I would also like to have seen more &quot;technical&quot; sidebars, like what happens inside the camera when a picture is taken or what process film goes through as it's developed. (To offset this somewhat, in the Dummies-mandatory Part of Tens Hart includes a list of World Wide Web photography resources that the aspiring Steichen or Adams can use to learn more. That's where I found the information on f-stops.)I can hardly complain about the lack of advanced information in a beginners' book, though. I got some of what I wanted to know, but more important, I got what I needed to know -- the basics of taking decent pictures. Now if I had only bought this before I shot 20 rolls of film at Disneyland . . ."},{"Title":"Photography For Dummies, Second Edition","review":"I recommend this book as a good introduction for those who are just learning the basic concepts of photography. The book is geared to those who are planning to use a \\"point and shoot\\" digital or film camera. If this is the type of camera you are planning to use, this book is an ideal introduction to photography. If you possess a camera which has more features built in than a \\"point and shoot\\" camera you might find this book lacking on how to use these features.

Although many books have appeared in recent times about him, few stay in print for an extended amount of time. Forthcoming publications include John Tyrrell's biography of a composer he has written about more than any other academic (published by Faber in 2004) and this spring a new volume from Yale, called \`Janacek and his World' edited by Michael Beckerman. Mirka Zemanova, a native-Czech, now living in London and regular contributor to many opera programmes, has pipped them to the post with the publication of her Janacek bibliography.Many rightly raved about Mirka Zemanova's previous contribution to the Janacek bibliography, her edition of the composer's uncollected essays on musicology. The volume included many previously unseen, or at least untranslated pieces of writing by Janacek. Various reviews of performances in Brno for the local journals and newspapers were enlightening when considering the many influences on Janacek's own writing, the Brno premieres of Cavalleria Rusticana or Tchaikovsky's Queen of Spades influencing Janacek's Jenufa, for example. Many passages have seeped their way into recent writing about the composer's life and works with the same regularity as quotes from John Tyrrell's many documentary translations, the letters to Kamila Stosslova particularly.Zemanova has decided to eschew use of Tyrrell's great translations of the letters and various documents, and returned to the original sources, itself not a bad idea. For the English speaking Janacek fan though, perhaps more cross references to those masterly volumes wouldn't have been too bad a thing, and her dismissal of some of Tyrrell's work is misplaced. Zemanova has great command of her material at best, but occasionally she is rather prosaic on a life that was so lacking in humdrum. Her outlining of details of the Vienna premiere of Jenufa, rather than dwelling on the Prague premiere (itself very important, but perhaps a little too glorified in recent literature) is to be commended. Her scatty musical analysis is a disappointment. Although she outlines her concern with focussing less on the \`works' and more on the \`life', her style is not always up to the dramatics of Janacek's life. I would recommend a reading of the composer's wife's memoirs for some of the real drama.It is a mixed book, fitting for such a mixed man, filled with facts that weren't available to previous biographers, but lacking in the grasp of some other regular contributors to Janacek literature. Hopefully, however, it will be the first of a stream of issues about this fascinating composer in the year leading up to the 150th anniversary of his birth, and the 100th anniversary of the premiere of his first great opera Jenufa."},{"Title":"Janacek: A Composer's Life","review":"This work sheds all sorts of new light on what by now might be thought of as a well-known story. The author's intuitive familiarity with the Czech sources is most helpful to non-Czech readers and her musicological comments on the composer's works often enlightening. I enjoyed the rigorous discipline with which, as a Czech writer with total facility in English, she stuck to her purpose with crisp and specific phraseology, and resolutely focussed on the facts of the subject's life in a coherent sequence. Thus she puts his life in a context less reverential, bemused or tentative than much of what has hitherto been written for English readers.Essential reading for all students of Janacek."},{"Title":"Janacek: A Composer's Life","review":"I have recently given a copy of Mirka Zemanova's new biography of Janacek to my mother, who has a serious interest in classical music. She was delighted with the book. She felt the author was illuminating on the background (so important to have the history of Janacek's native Czechoslovakia explained!) and very perceptive about Janacek's influences as well as his style (especially since much of Janacek's music is rooted in the type of folk music which is not familiar to those outside Central and Eastern Europe). My mother was particularly impressed with the author's vivid description of Janacek's personality. What a delight to have a book whose author obviously has a deep sympathy for her subject, but does not clog her account of his life by conjectures!A perfect Christmas present for any classical music lover."},{"Title":"Janacek: A Composer's Life","review":"With the 150th anniversary of Janacek's birth approaching next year, maybe now is the time for a reinvigoration of a bibliography about this composer.

She also offers just the right amount of analysis so that she provides an insight into Janacek's music without losing attention of her lay readers.

As with any book-spells it's \\"personal preference\\" you can take them or leave them so my review is not based on the spells portion but on the rest of the book.The information in this book is priceless based on my \\"personal preference\\" which is to learn/know about what draws fairies such as flowers, foods, crystals, creating fairy rings, etc. and different kinds of fairies such as brownies, bogies, nyphms, grey elves, etc. and what animals they like along with some short-stories about them and their origins. Every chapter begins with a short-story such as the one you see when you \\"search inside\\" and \\"personally\\" I find it inspiring because you are given a visual, a setting, and it gives you the advantage of knowing what you need to be surrounded by and what frame of mind you should be in.Some may see it as basic info, but in my opinion it's vital info! Books with such information are difficult to find and I know because I've searched for them.Based on the poor reviews given I did not buy this book until I was able to see it in the store, where I paid full price for it because I was not going to put it back down. I disagree with the poor reviews on it. If you are looking for picture books with fancy illustrations then sure, buy Froud's books or better yet rent a Jim Henson film. But if you are into the craft and spell magic and actually want to have the fairies come and feel welcome to your home then I highly recommend this book. I am not at all disappointed.The poor reviews on this book cost me time, gas and full price for the book but at least I'm happy and I have it right NOW. \\"Personally\\" I'm very happy with this book.I also read books by authors such as DJ Conway and again, \\"personal preference.\\" I can't imagine finding a book on the craft/occult where I would agree with EVERY SINGLE word.

It's about 200 pages. Much of the information (types of faeries, crystal and flower correspondences etc.) in this book can be found in other sources (ie. Internet, other books etc.) so there is nothing particularly new or interesting. Even the spells are not very new as you can easily construct your own, equally or more effective than Sirona's. I have found that many of the spells require items that are not easily attainable. I would not depend on this book to guide you into the faery realm. It does not teach you how to connect with the faeries, rather just how to ask them for help in spells. There are a few spelling mistakes here and there, but barely noticeable. The font is a little annoying because it looks as if it were all italicized, but it does add to the 'faery theme.' I do not think that the book is priced reasonably, considering much information can be found in other places.

However i must say, that this book is much better written and helped me more than all the others. I highly reccomend this to anyone who would want to develope faery vision, or connect with nature, or befriend the fae kin. This book contains alot of spells and potions.

The positive and the negatives of the book are all listed but really with a little thought, all the negatives are really not negative if you use your imagination: Like for instance: What are you supposed to do with the information on the animals in the book? How about search for a fallen branch and make a walking stick? What nicer way to commune with the faery's then to make a walking stick in their honor. You can carve the proper animals, or flowers or the name of the wood you wish you could use, if you can't find what you want - you can wood-burn too, or hang charms of the animals found in the book - charms can be located at local craft stores or bead stores or even online stores) you can purchase faery tattoos and place them on the walking stick and hang feathers - sure you can't use an owl feather (for obvious reasons, at least I hope it's obvious that it's an endangers species) however, you can find feathers that resemble the bird and with a little magick the feathers can imbue the animal energy, hang a charm of an owl off of a feather that looks like an owl - besides I think the faery's would be more pleased that you took the time to honor both them and the animals and trees listed, then to harm one to find the proper feather. As for finding the right stick from the list of trees, not all of us live in nature, true enough - so take the time to take a drive into nature - use a field guide if you have to - search for a fallen branch, the leaves attached will let you know what kind of tree it is (after storms is a great time to search), if you still see the glass as half empty you can always resort to ebay and buy a stick with the proper property's... Even still, you can use a stick you find not knowing the origins of the tree and carve the meaning you desire into the stick - with a little magick trust me this works... Animal Speak is a great book that gives a little more insight into walking sticks and animals that are great for connecting with the faery's... Either way, look for the positive in life and the positive is easier to find... As for spelling errors, show me a book without half a dozen errors and I'd be surprised - who cares if there are a few errors if the information is good - try to see the good instead of the bad. This is just one area of the book (what are you supposed to do with the list of animals) that I've supplied an answer to, but with your own imagination every other question has the same answer as this - and there are other things you can do with the animals listed but again, it's all in your imagination and coming up with the ideas and working them 'through asking' the aid of the faerys in the process is half the fun in getting to know them...

Magickal guidelines for working with Fae are described, including gardening and offerings. The rituals are positive and beautiful, incorporating nature such as flowers, fruits or other treats. There are special sections devoted to hearth and home magick, love and romance, healing, prosperity, and empowerment. Sometimes you even get to cook and eat or create a beauty treatment.

This is one book I don't loan out to anyone because I refer to it so much the pages are already worn. If you are totally into the fae, then this is a book you will use often. Everything Knight describes is easy to do and follow, with powerful results. I especially like the practical, down to earth, tone of her writing, and the fae stories."},{"Title":"Faery Magick: Spells, Potions, and Lore from the Earth Spirits","review":"Sirona Knight's book is a terrific book all about the Faery. There is so much that is great about this book, with a bunch of spells, charms, potions, and meditations. Faery Magick far outshines anything by E. McCoy. Knight's book is clear, accurate, and I found the spells particularly helpful. I love the outdoors and Knight makes a point of suggesting we all go outside in nature more and experience it's beauty firsthand. Right on! This book and Knight's new book, \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Elves and Fairies\\" are really the best books on the market about actually going outdoors and getting to know the Faery. R.J. Stewart writes the forward in her new book which shows that he really likes her books too! And RJ is the most famous Faery author beside Brian Froud. I would definitely suggest everyone that connects to the Fae read Knight's Faery Magick. It really is a terrific book!"},{"Title":"Faery Magick: Spells, Potions, and Lore from the Earth Spirits","review":"Sirona Knight has crafted a rare and marvelous resource book for getting in touch with the fae. She uses lots of rituals, spells, and charms to access the fae and her writing shows that she really knows what she is writing about! This is a well-written, interesting, and fantastic book is you are interested in the fae like I am. Everyone with fae heritage will appreciate Sirona Knight's compassionate writing and her deep understanding and love of nature spirits and elementals.There is a history of faeries in the book, and then modern examples of faeries. The best part of the book is the stories at the beginning of each chapter--I wish the author would have included about 10 more of these. Then the other best part of the book is the rituals, spells, and charms that get you going in the right direction. I live in the suburbs and did several of the spells in my backyard by my oak trees and rose bushes and they were very successful. I like this book because it is truly fabulous, marvelous and fantastic. Blessed be the fae."},{"Title":"Faery Magick: Spells, Potions, and Lore from the Earth Spirits","review":"I've enjoyed some of this author's work in the past (especially the shapeshifter tarot) but this book seemed to be just thrown together.There are a lot of problems and contradictions in this book. Knight writes that Europe and Asian are rich in faery lore and Africa and America are not. (which is untrue--the Cherokee people have an expecially strong faery traditon) And because of this all her information on faery comes from Europe. The problem with this, is that the author lives in the u.s.a.--so if she only knows about european faeries than its highly unlikely that she has any experience with faeries at all.She says that you have to go outside in nature to find these faeries--but if you go by her list of faeries you won't find many of them if you live in the u.s.a.. She also says you can make a doorway in your circle in spot the doorway is in your room--this after saying you have to work outside-does that make any sense?The author provides lists of faery flowers, stones, trees, etc. presumably you are to use these in faery spell work. But what about the section on faery animals and insects--how are we to use this information? She doesn't say.The spells this book do not have much to do with faeries--you can use them with or without faery influence--and to be honest most faeries won't be interested in helping you make money. She also gives some bad advice--like telling you to apply essential oils directly to your skin. None of the spells in this book seem like they have been performed by the author--like most spell books, they seem to be created specifically to fill the book without ever being tested first.This book does have some faery lore in it but not much. i am not saying that if you are in america you can't work with european faeries--a lot of irish faeries for instance came over with the irish immegrants during the potato famine. but most faeries do not owe allegence to a specific country, or people, rather they are of the earth and you will find more faeries in america that are not from europe--they originate here.Another problem i found with this book is that the author will tell you to merge with a tree or merge with a faery but she doesn't tell you how--if you aren't familiar with energy work you won't know what to do. But she provides basic information on wiccan tools--which she calls faery tools. So in some ways this book is really basic and in others it assumes prior knowledge.There are also love spells included in this book--which isn't a bad thing, but there are no warnings about the consequences of casting a love spell that manipulates another's free will.if you want to work with faeries my advice is to contact them and let them teach you about what you should do. I also reccomend Brian Froud's Faery Oracle--if you don't know how to get started. if you want to learn about traditional european faery lore, check out books by the late british folklorist Katherine Briggs.A word of caution about books that claim to help you work with faeries--most faery beings are very secretive so you won't find very good information on them in books. They usually forbid you to share information with others--so either the authors don't know what they are talking about or they will soon be taking into faerieland for good (and so far that hasn't happened to too many authors--Rev. Kirk being the exception that proves the rule)"},{"Title":"Faery Magick: Spells, Potions, and Lore from the Earth Spirits","review":"This is one of the most positive and uplifting books I have read.

The first chapter summarizes the history, folklore, and mythology of the fey. Chapter two discuses the types of faeries. Chapters' three, four, and five covers the times for faery magic, the magical ways of the fae, and faery romance and love. The last four chapters give spells for home, romance, wealth, and empowerment. This book contains a Bibliography and an index.Chapter 1 has an extensive history, which was very informative. In the second chapter Ms. Knight discusses the types of fae. I found this to be very well written. Chapter four gives again excellent correspondences for plants, animals, stones and metals.From chapter five on, Ms. Knight deals heavily with the traditional aspect of this craft. Although Ms. Knight feels this is the correct way to do it, most of us do not have the time in today's nine to five world. In addition, I found the spells to be somewhat problematical considering the majority of us live in cities or suburbs. It would be wonderful if we all could go out to a hillside at twilight, and give our offerings to the fae, in reality; most of us leave gifts for them where and when we can.After reading this book, I felt I gained a lot of knowledge about who the fae are and Ms. Knight does give excellent correspondences. But the ritualistic aspect leaves much to be desired for most of us."},{"Title":"Faery Magick: Spells, Potions, and Lore from the Earth Spirits","review":"Faery Magick is a truly enchanting book!

It is easy to understand. The words are small enough for him that he can sound them out and it gives him answers to questions that I sometimes can't find the words for. The only problem he has had with the Bible was the translation of the scripture. He goes to a christian school and they learn a scripture every week. Last week he had to read and memorize the 23rd Psalm. He knew most of it, but we could not use his bible we had to use mine. When in church I have him follow along in my bible and he uses his at home or when he wants to read a scripture but he wants to do it by himself. Overall the Kid's Bible is excellent.

These all come before the main portion of the book where the reader is presented various questions designed to help them understand the various facets of the lesson.Each lesson is laid out pretty much the same way.

I especially recommend David Oedel's essay on Macon, where after desegregation the city wrecked its small bus system by investing heavily in suburban areas without bus service. The result: in a city where 14% of the households (mostly African-Americans) don't have cars, bus service stops running at 6ish. After reading this I couldn't help wondering: &quot;have they [the governing elites in places like Macon] no shame?&quot;"},{"Title":"Love, Power, and Justice","review":"This preeminent 20th century Christian theologian argues in this small book that love, power and justice all imply an ontology and must be understood in aspects of being itself. It is in this book that he famously defines love as \\"the drive toward the unity of the separated\\" (25). He also refers to love as the moving power of life and believes all love includes qualities of eros and agape.Tillich does not believe that one can speak of self-love in anything more than a metaphorical sense. After all, if love is the drive toward the reunion of the separated, it is difficult to speak meaningfully of self-love.In his exposition of the nature of power Tillich notes that love is the foundation, not the negation, of power. Love is the ultimate principle of justice, although justice preserves what love unites. \\"The basic assertion about the relation of God to love, power and justice is made, if one says that God is Being-itself\\" (109). However, everything that one says about Being-itself, must be said symbolically."},{"Title":"Love, Power, and Justice","review":"Calvin O. Schrag (emeritus, Purdue University), while a graduate student at Harvard in the 1950s, was Paul Tillich's assistant. He humorously observed that Tillich was considered by some narrow-minded academics to be a &quot;thinker, not a philosopher.&quot; _Love, Power, and Justice_, now celebrating its 50th birthday from original publication, is a short volume that integrates Tillich's passions in philosophy, especially existential thought, and Christian theology. The result is in an exciting synthesis of strands of 20th century thought.I had long desired to do a careful read of this text, so I assigned it to my Ethics class. We went through it, chapter by chapter, and discussed the relevance of each of the volume's three major concepts to our core course concepts: philosophy, critical thinking, freedom, responsibility, and political justice. I believe that the text served its purpose quite well, and would use it again in a course. Teaching it gave me a deeper insight into the mind of Tillich as well as the important ethical concepts of love, power, and justice."},{"Title":"Love, Power, and Justice","review":"I came across this book while searching for an answer to the question of how--if power comes from God--it can so often be used to destroy works of love and justice. Tillich shows that when power is separated from its ontological oneness with love and justice, it's another example of our alienation from God--of our free will at work in the worst way.\\"Ontological\\" means \\"the study of being.\\" Tillich says love, power and justice are united in the structure of being(using philosophical terms)or united in the heart of God (paraphrasing from his Systematic Theology--Tillich doesn't say much about God in this book).When love, power and justice are separated in a situation, it becomes unstable. \\"Being\\" (or God) is the power that drives the situation toward stability--that is, toward a situation where love, power and justice are in balance.In life, the attempt to achieve this balance is dynamic, ever-changing, shifting--sometimes creating a worsening situation, sometimes one that's improving. A Hitler may gain immense power (divorced from justice) in the short-term. Eventually, forces of resistance emerge to stop him.(Tillich doesn't try to explain why it takes so long to stop abusive situations or why so many people are hurt in the process: he was a philosopher/theologian, not God himself).There are times when love, power and justice come together in moments of transcendence. In his Systematic Theology, Tillich says that at times we experience the realm of God in a way that is \\"preliminary and in anticipation.\\"Because _Love, Power and Justice_ is based on lectures Tillich gave, it packs an incredible amount of insight into six small chapters. It is one of my all-time favorite books, highly recommended, and worth every penny."},{"Title":"Love, Power, and Justice","review":"This classic text should be required reading for all seminary students, especially given the fact that so many Christians are uncomfortable with the notion of power. Tillich makes the point that love without power is mere sentiment, and power without justice and love is tyranny. Love, power, and justice are irreducible, indissoluble dimensions of God's own character. Thus, if we are beings created in the image and likeness of God, then love, power, and justice are intimately connected to the life we are called to lead."},{"Title":"Love, Power, and Justice","review":"Professor Tillich uses ontology to discover the root meanings of love, power and justice. Ontology attempts to discover the common structure of everything that is. Nothing can be known without ontology because to know something is recognize it exists. Love, power and justice have an ontological dignity in that they are often used to describe the ontology of other things yet they can not be described ontologically by anything more basic.The emotional aspect of love can not be defined or commanded but is an expression of the total involvement of the being. Love is the drive to reunite with that witch has been separated. I think what Tillich means is that to love another person is to teardown the boundaries that separate us and treat the other as if it where part of the self.Love brings pleasure and happiness when fulfilled and pain and suffering when it is not fulfilled but to be motivated by the pain or pleasure is to live a corrupted life. Eros and agape are not two different types of love but two characteristics of the only one type of love. Without eros love of God becomes mere obedience of God. Phili requires familiarity with and therefore is only possible between equals. Self-love is only meaningful metaphorically for love requires separation of the subject that loves from the object of that love.Being can not be defined because every possible definition of being presupposes existence but being can be stated metaphorically as the power of being. The power of being is the power over nonbeing. Nonbeing is therefore not foreign to being. Being that contains nonbeing is finite. The self-affirmation of a being is proportional to its power of being. The power of being of an individual becomes apparent in its interactions with nature, other individuals and groups. The more centered a being is the more power of being it posses. Love is the foundation of power and \\"compulsion is the strange work of love.\\" The strange work of love is to destroy that which opposes love.An object grows by transcending itself. But in transcending itself a being risk losing itself. Justice is expressed in the form of laws. Power is expressed in the making of laws. Love is the highest principle of all justice. The law given by God is consistent with man's essential nature.The concept of God as all-powerful does not mean that God can do whatever He wants but that God is the power of being in all that is. In God love, justice and power are one."},{"Title":"Love, Power, and Justice","review":"This book is a must for ethics and theology. Tillich's view on love is very well laid out and this is a powerful work."},{"Title":"Love, Power, and Justice","review":"This book is excellent.

Speaking with understanding and power, he makes a basic analysis of love, power, and justice, all concepts fundamental in the mutual relations of human beings, of social groups, and of man and God. His concern is to penetrate to the essential, or ontological, foundation of the meaning of each of these words and thus to save them from the vague talk, idealism, cynicism, and sentimentality with which they are usually treated. The basic unity of love, power, and justice is affirmed and described in terms that are fresh and compelling. \\"It is one of the most thoughtful analyses of a basic problem of Christian ethics which we have had in our day.\\" -- Reinhold Niebuhr"},{"Title":"Critical Theory Since Plato","review":"In Critical Theory Since Plato, Hazard Adams surveys the history of criticsm from Plato through the post-structuralists. Considering the exhaustive nature of his topic, Adams does a good job of presenting a balanced view of the subject. The essays are arranged chronologically, allowing the reader to survey not only a particular author, but the development of critical theory as well. Each essay is prefaced by an introduction by Adams. These introductions are helpful to a newcomer to the subject. A student with no experience working with critical theory, though, may also find it helpful to purchase a critical theory handbook, such as those available by Eagleton. Still, there is no substitute for the original sources, and Adams has compiled a useful, lively textbook. See also Critical Theory Since 1965 by the same author."},{"Title":"Critical Theory Since Plato","review":"The title says it all. Hazard Adams has compiled a collection of essays, dialogs, excerpts, etc. from Plato to Postmodernism. The selections made could be called the critical pieces of Critical Theory.I purchased this book to accompany a college level course on Literary Theory, and it served excellently in that capacity. This book is not, however, self-explanatory. You should have some kind of background in theory before diving into this book. The introductions to the book, and to the beginning of each selection are generally enlightening, but still require some basic knowledge of the field. If you haven't had a formal introduction to theory, you may want to purchase a guide, or take a course on it before beginning this book.However, if you have a good grasp of basic theory, this is an excellent book to help guide you deeper into the field."},{"Title":"Critical Theory Since Plato","review":"The more recent editions are too expensive, pricing close to $200.

The first two chapters introduce the reader to the characteristics of light through the presentation of ray optics and wave optics. The three subsequent chapters (chapters 3 to 5) discuss the interaction of light with matter. Although Chapter 6 focuses on optics, it sets up a nice transition from optics to lasers by discussing radiation, inversion and optical gain.Chapters 7-8 provide a concise overview of the different types of lasers and some of their main applications. These two chapters along with Chapter 9 on semiconductor lasers, provide an excellent summary of the current state of the art in lasers and basic laser theory. The next two chapters cover light sensors and spectroscopy.Chapters 12-13 briefly introduce nonlinear optics; Appendix A tries to give physical meaning to some of the terms mathematical used in optics relationships; and Appendix B scratches the surface of quantum mechanics. One could skip these sections without detracting from the subject matter or straying too far from the text.Meschede has liberally scattered the text with sections titled \\"example\\" and \\"excursion.\\" The main difference is that \\"example\\" typically presents a special case of the phenomenon discussed, while \\"excursion\\" shows a practical example utilizing the theory.These diversions provide an opportunity to better understand the material. However, in some cases, this reviewer did not see the relevance of some of the excursions.Optics, Light and Lasers has been translated from German, (Optik, Licht und Laser, Tenbner, 1999). Possibly, because of translation, some of the sentences require more than one reading. The Bibliography has a good references, sparingly referenced in the text. These would be more useful if relevant ones were at the end of each chapter, or were categorized by subject.The book assumes the reader is familiar with electrodynamics, basic quantum mechanics, and multivariable calculus. It provides a good overview of classical optics with relevant examples from recent applications.Armchair Interviews says: This is an excellent overview of lasers and basic laser theory."},{"Title":"1001 Hints & Tips for Your Garden : An Indispensable Guide to Easier and More Effective Gardening","review":"I Loved this book!!!

Which means I have to clear out my book collection.I thought this book would sell for so much more. It seems so underated. It's my \\"bible\\". I guess I'm going to keep it and hope I'll get another chance to use it down the road. For you.. No matter the condition, if you're even slightly interested in trying something new, don't pass this up.I can't explain it well enough. If you are thinking of changing a few things in your garden but don't know where to start, try it out. Some information is common sense that you never thought would apply in your situation. I found myself thinking \\"Why didn't I think of that?\\" on several occasions.This book explains many things very clearly. If you are a beginner and scared to try any type of yard work- start here. Once you start gardening, chances are it will change you. It helped motivate me. I mean, instead of being scared to hurt a plant badly enough to have neighbors talking or maybe even damage your yard completely, this will help build enough confidence to try something new because now you know.I hope you find yourself getting excited to get outside, enjoy the hard work. Don't worry about getting dirty or having to move 1 or 2 plants around. Just wait. You'll be amazed when you see what YOU accomplished.Who knows? Maybe you'll find yourself waking up at sunrise for the first time. That's how much it changed me-all because of this book. I would love to hear the book changed other gardeners. (Beginners or Master)I got a little dramatic there. I'm sorry about that. I want to say that I'm a teenager. I never thought something like gardening could change my life in so many ways.

We are looking forward to having a chance to read the entire book in its original context."},{"Title":"The shiralee","review":"This 1955 Australian literary classic is hardly known at all in the US. And for a good reason: no publisher has seen fit to publish an annotated edition that would put translations of the copious \\"Strine\\" expressions (Australian slang) at the bottom of each page. Some geographical and cultural annotations would be a big help too. As it is, the reader is obligated to have an Australian dictionary at hand at all times to get through the story.Why bother to publish an annotated edition? Here's why. Out of hundreds of novels dealing with the important topic of parental kidnapping (\\"PK\\"), this is the finest (in English at least). Not only is this a masterpiece of the PK sub-genre, it is a profound and poetic evocation of parenthood, fatherhood in particular. It's the sort of book that one might choose as required reading for high-school and college students if the topic of fatherhood ever overcame educators' lack of interest in fatherhood.Like Joyce's \\"Ulysses,\\" \\"The Shiralee\\" is inspired by an ancient epic, \\"The Odyssey.\\" Unlike Joyce, Niland is spare with words and wears his learning so lightly you might not even realize you are reading an epic studded with symbols Melvillesque in scale. Like the Homer's hero, Niland's is a physical, not merely mental, wanderer.Niland's hero is an Everyman who evokes another precursor as well, the voyager of Pilgrim's Progress. The Shiralee's pilgrimage is, however, the progress of the soul of fatherhood itself.There is so much to be read \\"between the lines\\" (the place from which the story's real power emanates) that the book virtually demands a prompt second reading.How many copies can sell in the US market? Just count the number of fathers in this country and add all their coming-of-age sons and you'll have that figure."},{"Title":"The shiralee","review":"The story of a reluctant scalawag father and his four-year-old daughter (his shiralee--Australian for &quot;burden&quot;) who walk around Australia, this moving novel was once a Masterpiece Theatre presentation many years ago.

It's an interesting tour of algebra, calculus, trig, and statistics all told from a problem solving viewpoint. For example, instead of introducing you to Lagrange multipliers in an abstract sense the authors instead paint a problem that needs a solution. They introduce the Lagrangian as means to solve the problem and the approach makes much better sense.There is an assumption that the reader is familiar with college math and there's not a lot of teaching of basics here - it's more of an applied refresher course.

Woodbury is a fascinating book that gives an in depth look into both the telescope and its creator, George Ellery Hale.It chronicles Dr. Hales' life and discusses several of the observatories that he founded. As the title indicates however, the prime focus is on the technological and engineering marvel that crowned his career; the Mt. Palomar Observatory and the 200 in. telescope.The conception and design of the carriage and body of the telescope alone pushed the technology of the period, but the primary mirror was a real dilemma. A detailed account is found within these pages. Reading this book gives one a new appreciation for this instrument that unveiled the universe in ways even its designers could not dream.This book is excellent for astronomy buffs and I both greatly enjoyed it and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Glass Giant of Palomar","review":"The original account of the building of the 200-inch telescope, predating Florence's &quot;Perfect Machine&quot; by over 50 years. Woodbury's account has the advantage of proximity in time - he interviewed and walked among the men who were responsible for the construction of this instrument, and gained the confidence of many. The book is perfect mix of exquisite technical detail (e.g, his account of the development and construction of the R.A. and declination drives quotes from one of the original engineers and is delightfully incomprehensible) and poetic admiration for the vision that drove the project. He captured the very human spirit of the scientists, workman, technicians, and even janitors who worked on the project. His accounts of the fabrication of the glass by Corning are fraught with anxiety, the cross country trip of the mirror on rail are sprinkled with details of the difficulties of moving such an awkward object as the huge glass disk.Both this book and Florence's Perfect Machine are worth reading, and while they cover much the same ground, each is unique - Florence focuses more on Hale and his drive for &quot;more light,&quot; while Woodbury focuses more on the majesty of the project.

As a matter of fact, I found it at one of the very first Target stores and I begged my dad to buy it for me. A lot has happened over the last 40 years, and the reference material in this book seems archaic by today's standards. But what I love about this book is the flag illustrations by Jack and Enid Hayes! Most flag books of today show computer generated flag illustrations that are mainly flat rectangles. Flags of the World is full of good old-fashioned hand-made painted illustrations with incredible detail and dimension! When I found my original copy of this book in my mother's attic, I noticed the cover and several pages were missing. Most pages were severely dog-eared, taped together, and extremely yellowed from age. I wanted to search online for a \\"new\\" copy to rekindle the excitement that I experienced when I was a kid.

The writing is exquisite, but more importantly, Kohler makes us ask ourselves the hard questions--which is how I define moral fiction. I can't imagine it was Kohler's intention to put the seduction of Deirdre on a scale with the tragedy of the children of Pithiviers, but rather, to make us look at the nature of corruption and compliance, to force us to look in the scary places--and this she has done brilliantly."},{"Title":"Children of Pithiviers","review":"The writing is merely superb but the thinking is more than that. A short novel with a long agenda and complicated acting out. This novel is entirely finest kind and full enough of itself that satisfaction is at least as complicated. This is a book I will be giving to my friends."},{"Title":"Children of Pithiviers","review":"This is a book for people who don't need to be spoonfed lessons in morality. Rather than drawing comparisons between Diedre's summer in Pithiviers and the horrors of the Holocaust, I thought the author's point was that the children imprisoned and gassed by the Nazi's clearly are the more tragic victims. And I admire the fact that she didn't think she needed to explain that to me. While Diedre almost willingly participates in her own exploitation at the hands of her hosts, the children who came before her had no options at all. Yet by showing us Diedre's more contemporary story, Kohler is able to lead us to the more horrific history of this region of France and suggest that while the two horrors are not equal, they exist on an unfortunate spectrum of abuse that continues to exist to this day. This is really quite brave and daring, and the writing is exquisite."},{"Title":"Children of Pithiviers","review":"There's a weird schizophrenia about this book, which sometimes feels like an eerie Gothic romance and at other times feels like the Diary of Anne Frank. The title suggests that the book will tell the horrifying story of the children of Pithiviers, those French Jewish children wrested from their families and warehoused in Pithiviers before being turned over to the Germans for extermination. The primary focus of the book, and the vehicle through which the Pithiviers story is revealed, however, is the character of Deidre, a pliable, uncritical, 17-year-old Sorbonne student from the Transvaal, sent to Pithiviers in the French countryside for the summer of 1959, following her &quot;disgrace&quot; in Paris and her subsequent abortion.Deidre quickly discovers that life at the dilapidated mill with Madame and the Baron is more a form of bizarre sexual education than the elevating cultural experience she had expected. Madame massages, bathes, and caresses her, has her walk around nude, and even dresses her, at one point. The sixtyish Baron fondles her under the table at her 18th birthday party, excites her, and later has an affair with her. Deidre retreats, at times, to the attic, where she has discovered a series of notes written in the margins of some old magazines by two young girls. They are obviously children who have hidden there during the war, bright girls of twelve and fifteen who miss their Maman desperately, but who continue to believe that &quot;Nothing seriously wrong can happen in France: is it not the country of the Rights of Man?&quot;Although one of the critics felt that intertwining these stories increased their emotional impact, I strongly disagree. The story of the children of Pithiviers is so horrific and their betrayal by French collaborators so vile that no other story could possibly make the reality more powerful. The author, however, creates obvious parallels between Deidre's &quot;imprisonment&quot; by Madame and the Baron, and the earlier, similar imprisonment of Lea and Anna, the two Jewish girls. Since the scale of their problems is so dissimilar, however, the comparisons between them made me cringe--the parallels diminished the story of the children of Pithiviers by making that story part of a less monstrous context. No matter how remote and isolated Deirdre may have felt from her family, or how helpless she may have been to resist the corruption to which she was exposed by her hosts, she nevertheless had choices absolutely unavailable to Lea and Anna in Pithiviers during World War II.Because the narrative here speeds along and has many surprises and psychological insights, other readers may become caught up in the problems of Deidre with their considerable suspense. I found her unrealistic and much too pliable, however, even for 1959, and I was offended by the obvious attempts to make me view the Pithiviers horrors in connection with her lesser problems."},{"Title":"Children of Pithiviers","review":"I read this after Cracks, Kohler's earlier novel, and felt a similar disappointment with each. Kohler is good with creating an atmosphere where a hidden, horrible truth seems to lurk just outside the field of vision. Unfortunately, the truth here is predictable and lacks impact. Dodo, the 18 year old protagonist, floats passively and naively through the events of the novel, while the reader can see the other characters' machinations a mile away. I actually found the hidden-children plot auxilliary. The real story is Dodo's relationship with the de C's and their seductive duplicity. The Vichy France revelation was just one more example of this, not the central event of the book, in my opinion. Ultimately, I felt Kohler had all the elements of an evocative novel, including skilled prose, but that they didn't add up to much. I finished it quickly, unmoved and unsatisfied."},{"Title":"Children of Pithiviers","review":"A previous reviewer pointed to the main disappointment with this book - you expect from the title that it will center around Jewish children in France during WWII. Instead, it centers around &quot;Dodo's&quot; sexual awakening - at the hands of a sixty something pedophile. I found the story inconsistent, at best, as Deidre vacillated between admiring her hosts and feeling victimized by them. Unfortunately, because the character of Deidre was so underdeveloped, we saw no evidence that this vacillation was part of her coming of age, a reaction to what happened in Paris, or that it related at all to her character. Deidre is a flat, lifeless character who is unworthy of her main character status. I just could not take the leap of faith Kohler asked me to take, and believe that Deidre would discover the sexual abuse that the Monsieur was committing with Anna and Lea, and then still sleep with him again.I could go on and on about my disappointments with this book. In a nutshell, I found the characters to be poorly developed and inconsistent. The story is simply not compelling. I regret taking the time to read it."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"This great book establishes a solid link between what you always suspected about the artworld and its true &quot;behaviour&quot; .

He's introduced a whole new style to very serious fiction, making it light and engaging. Very clever. And in this book, he's true to himself, as always giving us a light, engaging, fun read. Pity it's outdated, which I why I can't give it 5 stars. It really is incomplete and there are many aspects of contemporary art that are not properly taken into consideration. The fundamental variance between Picasso and Duchamp is missing, body art is not included as are many other current forms of contemporary art. Perhaps this is not so surprising considering he wrote this essay back in the 1970s...And it still manages to be highly relevant which is why it fully deserves its 4 stars!"},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"This book will humorously inform the reader what painting is not.

In fact, my father was a dead ringer for Archie Bunker's ideas. Still, from an early age of about 5, I discovered Abstract Expressionism in the 50s and fell in LOVE with it. Just because Wolfe doesn't understand it and it doesn't speak to him does not make it bad art. It speaks to my soul and I am thrilled that artists created art that became known as Abstract Expressionism -- and indeed that abstract art still is being created in 2012!"},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"I make my living as a writer, and was a painting major in college in the 70s/80s (doing it, not studying it). I had enjoyed Wolfe's work up until this book. But this was a piece of junk. Tom Wolfe demonstrated the old truism that is a lot easier to make fun of something than it is to actually create something new yourself. All the gotchas and exclamation points in this \\"new journalism\\" book are simply silly. His premise is that modern art is nothing more than illustration of the written word, and therefor not deserving of any real appreciation. Duh. All art through the ages has been illustration of ideas and words. That's what art is. Whether it is a European painter in the fourteenth century illustrating bible scenes, or an Egyptian painter illustrating the gods and the afterlife, that's what artists do. Wolfe's ego-centric writer's bias shows through: the writer is superior to the artist and all the artist is doing is copying the writer's ideas. Hogwash. He is a better writer when he realizes that his subjects are worthy of praise (as in The Right Stuff) than he is when playing the writer/bully."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"Everything was great....except I didn't recieve the book until about a month after I ordered it. I'm not sure what happened there and I was slightly disappointed."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"Mr. Wolfe makes some notable errors:1. He indicts not just contemporary art, but all art that is not realistic or pictorial alone. This includes the great now-populist movements of Impressionism (based on optical color theory), and Surrealism (based on psychoanalytic theory). Wolfe's desire for strict realism would appear to date back to the era of Gustave Courbet, who created starkly realistic work--but to the disgust of the general public and critics, who were used to the idyllic romanticizing in the art of that time. Before you judge Mr. Wolfe's argument, check your own tastes and see if they fit his narrow, classicist, literalist criteria. Van Gogh--there's emotional representation informing his colors and brushwork. Too theoretical!2. Mr. Wolfe conveniently forgets that art in the 1960's became theoretical in an effort to eradicate the artist's dependence on a gallery system that rejected ideas in favor of watered-down decoration (the type of work that sells the best). Installations, performances, conceptualism were started by the artists themselves, not by critics or tastemakers, as a reaction to art strictly as a decorative commodity. When no one would or could show this type of work, they exhibited/performed in their own studios, far from the eyes of critics and curators.3. Mr. Wolfe assumes that no part of the public is interested in non-realistic art. How many people visit the Maya Lin Vietnam memorial versus the Frederick Hart Vietnam Memorial (created because the former was too theoretical?) As with much art, what initially seems challenging and controversial (remember how many paintings Van Gogh sold in his lifetime) becomes accepted, even loved, over time.Ultimately, this is an intellectually lazy book destined to preach to the (un)converted."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"In this short book, Wolfe purports to tell us that the entire American art scene (ie ALL abstract art) of the post-WWII years is nothing but verbiage, a creation of a bunch of second-rater critics. I find this kind of generalization absolutely breathtaking in its arrogance and facile dismissiveness. By what criterion does Wolfe make this judgment? By the fact that there were a bunch of high-falutin' critics who explained it to those who wanted to be taken by fashion. While this is a common enough phenomenon in a nationalistic sense (pride in the output of one's country), I think it only applies to individuals rather than an entire scene. Afterall, the astract artists like Pollack belonged to a continuous milieu, which runs the gamut from Bob Dylan and John Coltrane right through the Beat Generation writers and Pollack and his cohorts and even TV like the Outer Limits and Twilight Zone. Were all of them and all they did first rate? Perhaps not, but I wd argue that there area a lot of wonderful things there as well, reflections of a time even if they don't quite measure up to the earlier generation of modernists like Picasso and Matisse. I wd not dismiss them so cavalierely, so cynically, as if you can emcompass all they stood for in a single argument. This book is for those who want to appear as glib smartas*es."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"While this book is not without its moments of humor, it is obvious to art lovers that Wolfe has little idea what he is talking about. He lumps any kind of art he doesn't like into a single category of &quot;modern&quot; and thus bad--no matter that Abstract Expressionism and Pop Art are nearly absolute opposites; to him they are the same because they differ from what he considers the historic Western tradition of realism. Wolfe's contempt for any kind of innovation in the visual arts leaps off the page. He has no ability to appreciate what the artists he bashes are trying to express--the storms and fury of the Expressionists, the playfullness of the Pop Artists or the cold, elegant purity of the Minimalists. They deserve better critics than this."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"Art theory, literary modernism and every other pretense that dangeles in front of the contemporary art scene is laughed upon in sincere honesty by Wolfe. He stripps bare the forerunners of the abstract expressionist movement along with others, and disects each in a brilliant new light. Lirerary art is merely an excuse for lack of classical ability and wolf delivers this theory in a hilarious and compelling manner. This book is a must for any artist, and a bible for all critics."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"A Review of Tom Wolfe's \\"The Painted Word\\"Tom Wolfe's rhetoric is at times overpowering but like beautifully complicated music (Bach?) it is a symphony for both the brain and the heart. Wolfe is saying that as art loses its goal to communicate it becomes lousy art, if art at all. He implies that \\"art for art's sake\\" is a false concept, and I agree with him. He attacks pretentiousness in both artist and art lover and correctly labels it a game.Wolfe's title is a word play in two respects. (1) The modernists invent their genres and make them more important that the art itself. (2) Art must have a subject, just as a sentence must have a subject.The phrase \\"Art for art's sake\\" can be used in an adjectival way meaning devotion, obsession, degree of love for the activity of art, and that's fine with me. But there must be more to art than excited devotees. Otherwise, every fanatic, let alone every hard working man who loves his job, would be a creator of art in some form or another. And the crudeness of our world, albeit with beauty scattered about here and there, tells us that is not the case. Of course, beauty and tenderness can exist and not be art. For art does not become art simply because someone says it is.Much modern art is good and beautiful and meaningful in its dealings with color and form. And a painting might indeed deal solely with color and form, and not with reality. For they are legitimate subjects. On the other hand, an artist's desire to bamboozle is not enough. I love some modern art, and some not, the same as with the other genres. So when is modern art a thing I can accept? When it communicates a subject, even form and color alone; and when it is honest and makes no claims that are not there.There is a difference between paint-artists and writers in how they perceive their own art juxtaposed others, and how they assign value. Most writers move about, back and forth, and are influenced by all forms, all styles, all of history, and they are capable of learning from the past. They might read Proust one day and Joyce the next, Emily Dickinson and then Virginia Woolf, Goethe and then Vonnegut, Rushdie and then Shakespeare. Take a look at James Joyce's great novel \\"Ulysses.\\" It depends on the Greek myths, a vastly different kind of writing than his own, but without Homer Joyce's novel would be less than we have now. At the very least, it would be a different novel with a different message.An exaggeration, even if grotesque, might be characterization, and might be art. James Joyce was aware of that.On the other hand, more than a few paint artists are bitter in their historical perceptions, hating the art outside their own genre. The Impressionists (whom I especially love) had a vigorous abhorrence for what came before them, and the abstractionists hate everything and everybody but themselves, even denying that their art has to have a subject. \\"Flatness\\" is not a subject, it is a technique. A question - why can't I pour paint onto a canvas drip by drip, like Jackson Pollock, and make art out of it? What skill, artistic or otherwise, is involved in that? And what would my spills and splashes communicate?And then there is the world of hanger-oners and art critics who speak and write in an insane insiders' language, pretentious wanna-be-nabobs living in intellectual temples, wobbly dirty white towers, who feel compelled to tell us what to think, what to love, what to read, what to look at, what to marvel at. And if we disagree they tell us we are bourgeoisie philistines, poor brain and heart limited creatures, incapable.Tom Wolfe has written a wonderful and humorous look at the sometimes ridiculous world of modern art. Agree with him or not, you will be entertained.Like Tom Wolfe, I am bemused and irritated by the art reviews in The New York Times. A review of rusted pipes and broken fixtures on display at an art show pushed me over the edge. So I wrote a review of my own and sent it to them. They completely ignored me as I knew they would. My review was of my cat's litter box. Here it is -**********A Review of Menace in Simple ThingsMy love of art and my disdain for the many tortured reviews of art that I stumble across more often than is good for my mental health has led me to write a review of my own. The subject of my analysis is - to say the least - as profound as elephant dung on a Madonna, twisted plumbing, rusting scrap metal, empty white canvasses, or a crucifix inserted into a jar of human urine, objects that are taken quite seriously on the daily art pages of our great American newspapers and in their Sunday supplements. But please, do not take my subject too seriously, for my cat does enough of that for all of us.A few days ago I happened upon my cat just as he was leaving his litter box after taking a poop. A friend was with me and as he observed my interest in the affair he asked, \\"You act as though you know what this is all about. I don't get it.\\" Sensing a crisis I suggested that a search through Britannica or The New York Times Arts and Leisure Section might be helpful.\\"I can do that.\\" he said, and abruptly left me to my musings. It seemed threatening that I found myself alone with my cat's poop.The poop seemed to be arranged in a stripped-down manner that made it appear to be on a lighted stage that integrated its various themes into an art form - if you will - that has its roots in Minimalism, and that merged the entire piece into a distinct theatricality. It seemed to have its sources in childhood, a numinous presence having the effect of a domestic twilight zone. Ordinary chunky things were combined in weird ways.The result was a spooky, dead narrative, perhaps even an autobiographical content. Domesticity - poisoned, entrapped disrupted - was its main theme. And no artist better captured a sense of Foucault's romance with oppression than my cat. At the same time, there was room in the poop for humor, however sardonic, and a strain of poetry that would become more evident with time.All these morphological riffs loosened up the obtuse, adamant solidity of the poop and suggested a wealth of associations - baptism, slaking thirst, warming, cooling, healing, and of precious things gone down the drain and lost.It is important to understand the metaphorical dimensions of my cat's poop. But it is not always easy to do that. As time goes on, and the cultural climate that produced this poop moves backward, a new and grand brew of pessimism and nostalgia delivers a shock. But can it be - will it be - a heavy-handed emphasis on a more flexible medium?Perhaps baby poop next time.**********I think I'll go to Macy's and buy me a white suit.Joseph A.

Wolf is ahead of his time-- and even ahead of himself-- with this book. It could have been, of course, and deserved to be, a lengthy, dry, scholarly theoretical text-- but only Tom Wolf coulda make it a 100 page, easily accessable, and yet undeniably brilliant work of social fashion-crit. Smashing!"},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"As another reviewer pointed out, this long essay (\\"The Painted Word\\") can't really be called satire, simply because it contains no fiction. It is another demonstration of Tom Wolfe's unique ability to catch real people acting like buffoons and simply record what took place. The other outstanding example I can think of is \\"Radical Chic,\\" which describes a fund-raising party hosted by Leonard Bernstein and his wife --- to raise money for the Black Panthers!There is a common denominator in these acid, hilarious portraits: the all-too-human desire to be \\"cooler,\\" \\"more with-it\\" than your knuckle-dragging, ignorant fellow citizens. Such opportunities for making a fool of yourself go back to the mists of prehistory, or at least back to Moliere and \\"Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme.\\" I don't think Tom Wolfe ever got around to describing another person driven berserk by his desire to be \\"cool:\\" Norman Mailer and his support for the convicted murderer, who was released because of Mailer's pleading (\\"He's an artist!\\") --- and who went right out and killed again. I would guess that Wolfe thought about this project, but turned it down, refusing to get a laugh out of a real, live killing.Of course, Tom Wolfe does not \\"simply record\\" what took place, as I said above. On the contrary, he is a master of idiomatic English. Who else could write, of a frustrated Art Groupie, \\"but what ina namea Christ were we supposed to SEE?\\" That's a very sharp ear for American speech: a lesser talent would simply have written \\"in the name of Christ.\\"The book does raise a few fears. Sometime in the radiant future, when the full foolishness of \\"The Painted Word\\" has been seen by everyone, a lot of Very Valuable Paintings are going to plummet in price. If you are heavily invested in Flatness and all that, you might consider \\"lightening your portfolio.\\""},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"Tom Wolfe turns his caustic wit and pen to the world of art in this social essay. Specifically here he deals with the New York Schools of Pop Art and Abstract Expressionism. He reviews the scholarly dissertations and criticism.. the deep and passionate evocation of the intended meanings by painters and their champions.. the social context and views of the public.. and has come to the conclusion.. that it's all about.. promotion.. SELF Promotion. There is always a lot of tongue in cheek truth in a Tom Wolfe work. A nod and a wink that these guys set themselves up for it. But it's easy to lampoon a collection of hard drinking painters who have come to the profound revelation that the guiding principle to all art is that it should be FLAT. The Flatter the better, judged as to its achievement of Flatness. Or a now famous article (in the art world) in which a scholar decided that objects you found on your supermarket shelf were in fact the cultures noblest expression of itself, igniting a fierce struggle for supremacy with its predecessor. I like Pollock, Johns, Liechtenstein and Warhol.. I don't try to understand them. Their aesthetic qualities speak for themselves. But when the hangers on and speculators on 'trends' start lauding ugliness as being a virtue, or as a characteristic perceived only by the untrained eye, things start to get a bit absurd. This funny little (art) treasure.. usually found in some garage these days.. is Totally Charming."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"This outrageously funny book gives a brief overview of the slippery slope known as theory-based art.Wolfe basically tracks his own thoughts and comments on various art movements.

He is merely a satirist, who is not trying to offer an overly grandiose philosophical attack on 20th century art movements."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"This book made me laugh from start to finish. Wolfe's nuanced, insightful prose tears into a topic with a bland innocence that explodes into discovery of the absurd behind every corner. And here he picks a topic many of us are too afraid to explore, lest we be seen as uneducated peons.If you've ever thought that our art community has become a bunch of stuffed shirts, who blather on about nonsense of little importance, here's a great skewer. Wolfe tracks the history of art going from \\"meaningful, interesting\\" to \\"obscure, theoretical.\\" The title refers to the fact that art of the latter half of the 20th century left behind imitating reality and inspiring people for a basis in pure theory, or \\"the word.\\" As a result, the art becomes like a painting about its own theory, and requires knowing its theory to appreciate.Wolfe mocks all of the pointless and self-aggrandizing aspects of these movements in, and also gives you insight into the people getting involved in this stuff. He does so without taking a direct polemic stance. Instead, he explores details and tracks them from idea to completion to consequence, and in doing so, shows the Emperor wearing no clothes. Once he's got you onboard with his vision, he really lets fly and the comedy commences all over again!\\"The Painted Word\\" forced me to re-evaluate my opinions about art, since I liked at least one artist he skewered, but even more gave me the ability to laugh at a much-needed mockery of one of life's ludicrous detours. As Wolfe says early in the book, we're afraid to speak up and say the Emperor has no clothes because opposing theory sounds ignorant and backward. But after reading this volume, it's hard to think that art itself has fallen into its own hype, and that it would be ignorant and backward to keep rubber-stamping it for the sake of seeming edumacated."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"Ah the Modern Art - Alas! the common man is so incapable of perceiving depths.

It was a riot."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"Until I come across something that fundamentally invalidates this marvelous essay by Tom Wolfe, I'm going to think it is the most admirable, brilliant, and ironically effective expose of phony b.s. that I have ever read. Wolfe had the anatomical spheroids(testicular fortitude, to some) as well as the journalistic competence to reveal what most of us have suspected all along. The true meaning behind those incomprehensible works of abstract expressionism is ----zilch, nada, nothing!Modern art of the mid 20th century was created and fostered by a small group of wealthy cognoscenti who gloried in being knowledgeable about so-called art which was inaccessible to the average person, and who reveled in being groupies of the bohemian artists. Self-interested \\"critics\\" added to the goofiness by continually refining the rules so they could discover ever newer and more abstract styles, which redounded to their personal fame and influence.In this short book, Wolfe gives a concise history of this downward spiral in twentieth century painting, naming the critics who were the most prominent in bringing it about. The book brims over with honesty, wicked satire and (Oh my God! How square!)- COMMON SENSE. Whether it was deliberate chicanery or self-delusion aggravated by competitiveness, it seems the authorities of the art world allowed their chosen field to degenerate to a state of utter pretense.Tom Wolfe, with the very sharp pin of his wit, has let a lot of hot air out of this particular balloon. Of course, there is the danger that Wolfe's criticisms will be over-applied to include all experimental types of art. The aversion of modern artists and critics to \\"literary\\" paintings - paintings which depict a recognizable meaning - finally led to mostly blank canvases with a few stripes, concentric circles, or letters of the alphabet. These were the sorts of artworks which resulted from the snobbish race toward nihilism, and they are what Wolfe nails so convincingly."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"A short, quick, delightful read (what else from this author) through the development of \\"modern art\\" - if you've ever wondered how we got from Monet and Turner to where we are now, you'll see the clear development, get the jargon, and see better and with more understanding than ever before. So glad I happened upon this!"},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"This is an unpersuasive essay about the failure of modern art and about how we are all caught up in the falsity and ugliness of modern art. In my opinion, I think Wolfe is writing without much knowledge of modern art. He sounds like an uneducated critic in this book."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"This short tract of a book sets out a single, streamlined argument: that twentieth-century art is really a series of art theories (such as Abstract Expressionism or Pop Art) as illustrated by certain works responsive to these theories: the theory, crucially, preceded and influenced - rather than reacted to - artistic experminent. Wolfe singles out Clement Greenberg, Harold Rosenberg and Leo Steinberg - critics rather artists themselves - who in this way exerted the real shaping influence on the development of art in the last century. How? Simply by determining the tastes of the purveying 'culturati' and thus the activites of the artists they patronized. The simplicity of the argument is both its strength and weakness. Strength because it facilitates a brisk, exclamatory, copious prose style capable of persuasive-seeming overviews. Weakness because potential objections and qualifications are skimmed over in silence. However, this is a popular polemic, not an academic treatise, and in this capacity it works extremely well: its basic premise is strong enough in itself not to look shaky and it is delivered with wit, panache and infectious enthusiasm. Successfully provocative."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"In his own inimitable style Wolfe offers, to the uninitiated, a Modern American Art World primer. He traces the progress from Realism to Minimalism, with stops along the way. He focuses on the relationship between the theorists ( Greenberg, Rosenberg, Scull, et al. ) and the painters themselves. His wit, his irony, and his keen insights make for an amusing read; but, for me, starting from ground zero, it was a learning experience."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"This book is Tom Wolfe pointing and shouting &quot;The Emperor has no clothes!!&quot; He explains how splattered canvases by Jackson Pollock and Frank Stella could be called works of genius. It's the history of how people can be suckered into believing anything if it adds to their level of status in the world. Wolfe wrote a book like this about the world of architecture titled FROM BAUHAUS TO OUR HOUSE. It is equally great, and you should not read one without reading the other. You'll understand your world a lot better after reading both of them."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"Finally, an explaination of Modern Art I could understand. Suddenly, it all made sense.

From what I know of art history and theory, much of Wolfe's versions of theory matches those of 'serious' art theorists.Enjoy this fun and fast read!

Few of us, however, have Wolfe's command of language to explain the complete vapidity of the work produced during the period that he covers, nor the ability, nearly unique to Wolfe, of allowing artists, critics, and theorists' own words to expose that vapidity.This is indeed a refreshing work, and written with Wolfe's usual mastery."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"This book provides a humorous, easy to read look at the world of modern art.

It shows how the titillation by the &#34;new&#34; and the &#34;now&#34; supplanted, knowledge, craft, training, and connoisseurship for trendiness, a nonsense that continues to this day. And as the title foretells, if the art couldn't sell itself, then &#34;artspeak&#34; was employed to tell the public &#34;what&#34; the art was and &#34;why&#34; they should like it even when they hated it.

Caveats: you have to like art theory, or at leas have a need to read it (e.g., class). You have to tolerate Wolfe's verbose style and his self admiration. He's good and knows it, but over-rates himself. Having said that. One would be hard pressed to find a better primer on the art world since the '50's, though it ends in the '80's. It's not an exhaustive review of all the schools of art theory, just the most prevalent, but between the lines it's all there. In this sense, this book is a good adjunct to another introduction to art theory that might be dry and hard to grasp. Wolfe's book will help contextualize the material. It's a good read that could be shorter (as could all of Wolfe's books), but then it would be just another book on theory."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"I found The Painted Word coyly sitting in a used book store looking like it needed a home. I actually neglected reading it for several weeks because I knew that once I started reading it, it'd go fast. Indeed I was right. I read it in one sitting smiling the entire way. It was delightfully amusing and at the same time it was also pretty down to earth. I've since passed my copy onto a friend and am still recommending it for a little evening pick-me-up even for people completely oblivious to the art world like myself. It did strike me as exuberant but I think that added life to it. Not only that but it was also historically interesting."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"I was talking to an artist friend of mine about selling art versus creating art and she let me know about this little gem of a book. Tom Wolfe is a master at puncturing the pretentions of society and he clearly enjoyed himself immensely here. Given my lack of art background, I also learned something about the small community of artists and critics that dominate the fine arts sceen. Art of the expression of theory was a new idea to me. If you've ever seen a modern work and thought to yourself, &quot;Huh!&quot; this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"Th is book skewers the mavens of the American artistic establishment, particularly during the 1960s and early 70s. Wolfe is devastating in his criticism of the trendiness and ugliness masquerading as ersatz social rebellion which has largely (and sadly) come to replace authentic American art based on esthetic beauty. My only major complaint against this work is that I do very much wish Wolfe would release an updated version of it! The multicultural, politically correct &quot;art&quot; of the 1980s, for example, does not deserve to evade Wolfe's witty pastings merely by virtue of having been produced too late"},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"Can I start by saying that this book \\"saved my art life\\"? Let me explain. In 1977 I started art school as a not so impressionable 21 year-old with a few years as a US Navy sailor under my belt. But in the world of art, there's a lot of moulding and impressions being made by a very galvanized world. And although I was a few years older than most in my class... I was probably as ready as any to swallow the whole line and sinker that the \\"modern art world\\" floats out there.Then I read this book - it was given to me by Jacob Lawrence, a great painter and a great teacher --- although I didn't get along with him too well at the time. I read it (almost by accident and against my will --- it was a get-a-way \\"love weekend\\" with my then-girlfriend - it went sour. And this book OPENED my EYES!!! It was as if all of a sudden a \\"fog\\" had been listed about all the manure and fog that covers the whole art world.I used it as a weapon.I used it to defend how I wanted to paint and feel and write. And it allowed me to survive art school.And then in 1991 - as I prepared to look around to start my own gallery - I found it again, in a gallery (of all places) in Alexandria, VA. I read it again, and to my surprise Wolfe was as topical and effervescent and eye-opening as ever!Wolfe has a lot of bones to pick with the art world -- 25 years ago!!! He destroys the proliferation of art theory, and puts \\"art gods\\" like Harold Rosenberg, Clement Greenberg, and Leo Steinberg (who have ruined art criticism for all ages - by making critics think that they \\"lead\\" the arts rather than \\"follow the artists\\") into their proper place and perspective. He has a lot of fun, especially with Greenberg and the Washington Color School and their common stupidity about the flatness of the picture plane.Here's my recommendation: If you are a young art student or a practicing artist: SAVE YOUR LIFE! Read this book!"},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"That would require some element of fiction. This is simply a straight telling (well, almost straight) of the taste-makers and -breakers in the New York art scene of the 1950s to mid-70s. It's already so ludicrous, so filled with poker-faced parodies of sane discussion, that fiction wouldn't be nearly as strange. It's the complete domination of analysis over analyte.This short book (100 pages, including some amusing cartoons) lampoons the whole theory of art theory as it arose in the salons and saloons of that era. It briefly traces the never-ending search for the new, a Red Queen's race since whatever we have today isn't new enough. In a bizarrely involuted turn, he even describes the rise and fall of different tastes in taste-makers.If you've ever groaned at the solemn silliness of the intellectoid analyses or nihilist (lazy?) \\"Conceptual\\" artists, you'll laugh out loud at Wolfe's descriptions. He runs through the artsy buzz-wording like a buzz-saw.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"I read both this book and Linda Weintraub's &quot;Art on the Edge&quot; at the same time. I liked both very much and highly recommend both of them to get a full picture of the modern art world.Weintraub clearly explains the concepts and theories behind the avante garde art of the 70s-90s, including Jeff Koons, Serrano's (in)famous Piss Christ, etc. Tom Wolfe cries that art theory has taken over art (which necessitates people like Weintraub to explain what's going on), that art is controlled by a clique, that some artists just want to shock the masses and to please the clique, and that the masses need not apply. I think these are very valid points, after all, Vanessa Beecroft posed 20 nude or bikini-clad babes in the Guggenheim and Heilman-C showed actual people having sex (See the 1998 review article in the ArtNet website).But Tom does not discuss the larger issues: &quot;Is this art? What is art?&quot; That, combined with the fact that Wolfe wrote the book more as an opinion piece rather than the more journalistic approach he took in Electric Kool-Aid, forced me to take a star off.It should be noted that Tom criticizes the art world's need for something new, where he was the &quot;new&quot; thing in the journalistic world in the 50s and 60s, in the nonfiction world in the 60s and 70s, and in the fiction world in the 80s and 90s. It's like the pot calling the kettle black.It should also be noted that Tom was part of the art world himself, as he has exhibited his caricatures in NYC galleries. Caricatures, of course, are downplayed in the fine arts world. Keep this possible bias in mind as you read this book.Nonetheless, the Painted Word is a fun, quick read that should make even the most-hardened boho artist think."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"Well, here we go - time to criticize a culture critic. Try saying that three times fast.Anyone who knows anything about Tom Wolfe will know exactly what to expect from this 1975 exploration of the 1950-1970 Art World. Considering that he's always on the lookout for something funny to say, he does quite a good job, probably because the Art World is apparently a pretty funny place. Then again, that's always true of any insular group that develops its own vocabulary and learns to take itself too seriously.According to Wolfe, that judgment applies equally to the artists, their critics, and the small world of collectors that support them both. He uses as an example the following cycle: Jackson Pollack and Willem de Kooning paint a few pictures using mere blobs of paint. At about the same time, Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg conclude in their columns that painting must naturally go in the direction of increased &quot;flatness&quot; to fulfill its destiny (and they do, in fact, write in such semi-apocalyptic terms). To illustrate their point, Greenberg and Rosenberg talk up Pollack and de Kooning. Art patrons in Milan, Rome, Paris and New York read the columns and get interested in Pollack and de Kooning. Thus encouraged, these artists paint even flatter paintings, Greenberg and Rosenberg chat them up even more in their columns, the Art World gets more excited, and round and round we go until a guy named Leo Steinberg smashes into the cycle. He declares that they've got it all wrong, the true &quot;flatness&quot; exists in the Pop Art of Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg, and the whole thing starts all over again. Only with even more feverish declarations of theoretical orthodoxy this time.Eventually, of course, the theory becomes far more important in the Art World than the paintings. This gives rise to Op Art, Happenings, Conceptual Art, and the world we live in today wherein the answer to the question &quot;What is Art?&quot; is &quot;That which we find in Art Museums.&quot;Wolfe splashes all this high comedy around in a truly scrumptious style, full of exclamation points. Behind the rhetoric, I suspect, is a man who thinks very highly of himself, but what else can we expect from a culture critic? Fortunately, what with all those exclamation points, it's fairly clear that Wolfe doesn't really take himself all that seriously, so his work is much easier to enjoy than it otherwise would be.Even more interesting than the language, however, is the odd feeling one gets from The Painted Word that Wolfe doesn't think of the mid-century Art Follies as necessarily a bad thing, or even bad art. And indeed, who says that Art Theory is anything other than Art itself? Why criticize this development? Why not just enjoy it?So in his last few pages, Wolfe predicts a retrospective in the year 2000. Instead of the paintings, this retrospective presents the true Art of the 1950's-1970's - the columns of Greenberg, Rosenberg, Steinberg, and whatever other Bergs in enormous reproduction, with tiny illustrations of the paintings in question next to them. As I write this, such an exhibit is nowhere yet to be seen, but that may only mean that Wolfe is smarter than the average museum curator (a supposition I can neither confirm nor deny). Be that as it may, Wolfe's craft is undeniable - sarcastic, informed, bitchy, and overwhelmingly funny. If the Word is Art, then the hyper-serious Greenberg, Rosenberg and Steinberg are mere wannabes. Wolfe, like Groucho Marx, is an Artist.Benshlomo says, in the words of William Shakespeare, better a witty fool than a foolish wit."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"If you were to stop a random person on the street and ask him what his favorite painting was, chances are it wouldn't be anything newer than Picasso. These days, art seems historically detached from what it once was, led by the esoteric mumblings of \`in-the-know' art professionals. Enter Tom Wolfe, who in this installment levels his satiric pen at the world of modern American art.Wolfe really helps explain what the actual intention of modern art is these days. Whereas in the past art was meant to please God, or to portray great moments in history, or to push the boundaries of perception, the goal of today's art is to be the perpetual rebel, the anti-bourgeois. Also targets of this satiric salvo are leading art personalities like Harold Rosenberg and Leo Steinberg. It's a short and enjoyable read.For me, perhaps the most damning indictment of modern art came not from this book (although the themes were echoed), but from a recent episode of 20/20 (March 11, 2005). In it the reporters show off a series of abstract-looking paintings to several upper-East Side art critics. Unbeknownst to them, these works were the finger painting products of four year-old children. The critics largely praise the works, but my how they scramble when they learn of the \`artists' behind these creations. Add to that the quote one of them says - that \`The purpose of art is to make rich people feel important' - leaves me feeling that modern art is but a soulless, hypocritical, contrarian fraud."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"I've always had a fascination with highly creative people, enjoyed jazz that was ahead of its time, the things that broke the earlier bounds. But I never could understand fashionable contemporary art. Wolfe has explained to why this is so. It turns out that I'm not supposed to understand it; it's intended for an exclusive audience, and my lack of understanding is what validates it to the people for whom it is intended. Suddenly, it all makes perfect sense to me, and as I think about acquaintances who do immerse themselves in the contemporary art scene, my observations correlate directly with Wolfe's.Where the book falls short is that it fails to recognize that this remains art. It might be odiously exclusive, but it's still a communication between the artist and the intended audience. In fact, Wolfe has probably helped me understand this communication better than I ever did.A good thought-provoking read; I take some glee in the fact that art world snobs thought he was skewering them (and perhaps Wolfe thought he was, too), but really, he's just explaining the mechanisms at work. And of course, it has some classic Wolfe lines, especially a laugh-out-loud description of young female admirers doing &quot;Culture pouts through their Little Egypt eyes.&quot; Worth it for that line alone."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"The Painted Word is part of a pleasant little triptych of social commentary produced by Tom Wolfe in the 70s (more or less) of which Radical Chic and From Bauhaus to Our House make up the other titles. Even with lots of pictures, whitespace and margin, Painted Word only runs to 99 pages. I bought all three and read them over the course of a weekend, what with travel time and all.Tom Wolfe very devastatingly takes a prominent Modern Art critic's unwittingly accurate sentence and elaborates it into a social, cultural and intellectual critique of the prentensions and foibles of this tiny self-referntial world.This is a send-up, a satire, and a de-bunking. And a field for which such a come-uppance, if not long overdue, was at the least fully due for just this particular sort of biting insightful up-comeance.Wolfe takes us through the motives and psychological drama of the three actors in this story - the Artist, the Patron, and the Critic.The Artist has undergone a change as his role evolved from the glorification of the royals in the Old World to the affliction of the middle class in the New:\\"The modern picture of The Artist began to form: the poor but free spirit, plebian but aspiring only to be classless, to cut himself forever free from the bonds of the greedy and hypocritical bourgeoisie, to be whatever the fat burghers feared most, to cross the line wherever they drew it, to look at the world in a way they couldn't see, to be high, live low, stay young forever - in short, to be the bohemian.\\"It is ultimately up to Warhol, of course, to perfect this stance Warholicly:\\"Warhol learned fast, however, and he soon knew how to take whatever he wanted. The bohemian, by definition, was one who did things the bourgeois didn't dare do. True enough, said Warhol, and he added an inspired refinement: nothing is more bourgeois than to be afraid to look bourgeois. True to his theory, he now goes about in button-down shirts, striped ties, and ill-cut tweed jackets, like a 1952 Holy Cross pre-med student.\\"In the meantime, the idle, inherited rich have to cleanse their money:\\"That is why collecting contemporary art, the leading edge, the latest thing, warm and wet from the Loft, appeals specifically to those who feel most uneasy about their own commercial wealth.\\"Yet they nonetheless, being humans and not theory processing machines, do find themselves drawn to things they can actually understand:\\"We may it as a principle at this point that collectors of contemporary art do not want to buy highly abstract art unless it's the only game in town. They will always prefer realistic art instead - as long as someone in authority assures them that it is (a) new, and (b) not realistic\\"This is Wolfe, not at his finest, for there is a certain sort of botanist's plodding categorization of the ecosystem at work here, but nonetheless at his sparkling-intermittent-burst best. The art \`warm and wet from the Loft' is a delicious turn of phrase in so many ways and will be my favorite keepsake from this work.As for the Critic, that is Wolfe's primary topic in this piece, and, being a short piece, I won't ruin or summarize it for you. He does end with a bold prediction for the Year 2000, so you do have something to look forward to.This book is a good buy for Tom Wolfe lovers, modern art skeptics and free-thinkers, and the social and cultural commentariat. It's a bit less broad in its appeal than Wolfe's other works, including Radical Chic, so peruse the \\"Look Inside\\" pages first to make sure you like the style."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"A classmate lent me The Painted Word by Tom Wolfe, published in 1975, and boy, if you ever want some actually intelligent criticism and questioning of the establishment of modern art, this is it!The beauty of this book is that Wolfe doesn't usually attack the art - though occasionally he does accuse artists of allowing themselves to be too influenced by popular theory - he really attacks the establishment.And he does so in a hilarious way. For instance, Wolfe starts out explaining the \\"mating ritual\\" between the bohemian artists, \\"boho\\", and high society that can financially back and establish the artist, the \\"monde\\". He talks about how to be successful, an artist must first be an honest boho, live amongst the other bohemians and adopt true anti-bourgeois values. This is called the \\"boho dance\\". But once an artist has attracted the monde with his dance, he must \\"doubletrack\\", which means learn to gleefully hobnob with the elite and enjoy his success, despite being a hypocrite.And this mating metaphor is just the beginning. This book oozes sarcasm of the best and most vicious sort. Just check out this passage, about how pop art, according to the theorists, was supposed to be about \\"flatness\\", rather than how the subject matter related to real life:\\"In short... the culturati were secretly enjoying the realism! -plain old bourgeois mass-culture high-school goober-squeezing whitehead-hunting can-I-pop-it-for-you-Billy realism! They looked at a Roy Lichtenstein blowup of a love-comic panel showing a young blond couple with their lips parted in the moment before a profound, tongue-probing, post-teen, American soul kiss, plus the legend \`We rose up slowly...as if we didn't belong to the outside world any longer...like swimmers in a shadowy dream...who didn't need to breath...' and--the hell with the sign systems--they just loved the dopey campy picture of these two vapid blond sex buds having their love-comic romance bigger than life, six feet by eight feet, in fact, up on the walls in an art gallery.\\"How can you not love writing like that?This book rocks."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"Wolfe was surprised reading the New York Times to learn from Hilton Kramer in 1974 that realism lacked a persuasive theory. He had been looking at pictures and professed to not understand why a theory is needed. Indeed, how could modern art be literary? Literary is a code word for retrograde. The opposite is a sort of arts for arts sake mode. Artists helped to make theory--consider the cases of Georges Braque and Frank Stella.Most modern movements began before World War I. By 1900 the success game of the art world was set. Art supplies are available everywhere, but artists move to New York. The artist has to keep his edge and focus on new developments. An art mating ritual takes place between artists and theorists and collectors. Collectors enjoy being considered separated from bourgeois society.Modern art enjoyed a boom in Europe in the twenties. By the thirties it was so chic the Dole Pineapple Company sent Georgia O'Keefe to Hawaii. Theory did not come into its own until after World War II. The theories were beautiful even if the Abstract Expressionist paintings are no longer hanging in the museums and in people's houses on Long Island.After World War II New York replaced Paris as an art center. Hans Hofmann was in Greenwich Village with Ad Reinhardt, Joef Albers, Lee Krasner. There were other circles--cenacles. They met at the Club on Eighth Street and at the Cedar Tavern. The great theorists were Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg. Hans Hofmann emphasized purity and there was a lot of concern for flatness. Rosenberg described the canvas as an arena.Alfred Barr and James Sweeney Johnson had a huge function in art promotion, selecting artists and works. Morris Louis used unprimed canvas. Jackson Pollock was an artist stuck in the dance. He had another problem in that his reputation was huge but his work did not sell. Earlier modern art had been only partly abstract. Robert Scull once said that Abstract Expressionism was a little club on Tenth Street.Art that is new and not too abstract and not realistic would necessarily be a hit--hence Pop Art. Leo Steinberg and William Rubin were theorists of Pop Art, finding merit in the works of Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg. Jasper Johns's flags were wonderfully flat. Greenberg and Rosenberg denounced Pop Art.Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein created famous images. They used commonplace sign systems of American culture. Pop Art rejuvenated the art scene. Op Art like Pop Art was enjoyed for literary reasons. (Wolfe's title for his collection is derived from this observation.) Theory started to move toward reductionism. Conceptual Art was of two kinds. Photo Realism appears in the chapter 'Epilogue'.Wow! This is a good book. There are illustrations."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"Tom Wolfe is the master of cunning expose.

Read this book."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"This send-up of contemporary art is one sided, unfair, perceptive, and entirely funny. Tom Wolfe exposes the art worlds' tangled intersections of irony and criticism, politics and painting, ego and eccentricity. Specifically, Wolfe's satire covers the dawn of Picasso and Modernism through the rise of Conceptual Art. This is a fascinating little satire, and Tom Wolfe at his best.Art critic Clement Greenberg is identified as the leading critic and theorist; the center of a coloful cast of characters. \\"The Painted Word\\" peers into the inscrutiable relationships between artists, critics, patrons, fashionistas and curators. Wolfe sees contemporary art as an outgrowth of this cloistered social system.If you are interested in contemporary art, read Wolfe's book along with \\"But Is It Art?\\" by Cynthia Freeland. Consider reading Freeland's book first, for it is a sympathetic history of art theory. Both books are incisive and enjoyable, and they make nice bookends for each other. An explicit theme of \\" But Is It Art?\\" and implicit criticism in \\"The Painted Word\\" is that the guiding theory for contemporary art is \\"criticism of life.\\" This conception of art as a form a criticism is a source of Wolfe's satire, and some believe this meme has led art to a dead end.As someone who enjoys, produces and collects conceptual art, I appreciate Wolfe's satire and agknowledge the problems he identifies. \\"Art for arts' sake,\\" new for the sake of new, art as criticism, academic art, and the root-bound nature of the artworld are creating a chasm between art and viewers. And in a double irony, while contemporary art lampoons the conventions of conservative society, the art world itself is resistant to critical introspection.There are exceptions. The Walker Art Center in my own back yard frequently explores new ground. There are fresh advances in the digital domain. Takashi Murakami is creating popular new aesthetic sensibilities and Matthew Barney is extending conceptual art into surreal mythic narrative. There is also a profusion of excelent new artwork in the world today. In fact, supply of new art far exceeds demand.An underlying problem Wolfe circles around is that there are few compelling new theories for the role of contemporary art as a cultural force. A key question is: \\"What purpose and meaning does contemporary art offer?\\"Professor E.O. Wislon offers some ideas in his book, Concilience. Wislon believes that all knowledge disciplines need more cross-disciplinary collaboration -- that the humanities need to feed science, and science needs to feed the humanities. Of course, this utilitarian viewpoint is open to rebuke as well.Perhaps Wolfe has the last laugh in any event. Once the bonds between art and representation were severed, art became open to interpretation -- and criticism. Now, according to Wolfe, art itself has become a form of criticism, or \\"The Painted Word.\\"Consilience: The Unity of KnowledgeBut Is It Art?: An Introduction to Art Theory"},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"This is a good book and good product.

It argues that elitist critics determined the avant-garde aesthetic that the elite group of bored wealthy art patrons subscribed to, thus driving movements such as abstract expressionism and op art. Art patrons were reluctant to admit to liking works of realism because it was not fashionable to do so, awaiting the endorsement of a critic--something to the effect that works of realism were something other than such, ie photo realism is not realism because the works are derived from a secondary representation. The ironic lifestyle of bohemian artists who are torn between a life style intentionally not acceptable to the middle class and a dream of stardom, is not spared.Overall, I found The Painted Word very funny and informative. I do not bear the art world any special ill will, and rather think that the right sort of mind could write a similar satire about virtually any of our institutions because hypocrisy is an integral part of the human condition.I bought the ebook version, and I thought that it was overpriced considering the essay is very short--I'd guesstimate about 30 pages in a printed version, so this would be something to consider before making the purchase."},{"Title":"The painted word","review":"This is still the cutting edge for today's art criticism.

Lawrence and Italy: Twilight in Italy; Sea and Sardinia; Etruscan Places (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","review":"D.H. LAWRENCE AND ITALY is composed of three stories: 'Twilight in Italy', 'Sea and Sardinia' and 'Etruscan Places'. The first two &quot;books&quot; seem to be based on journals he wrote while traveling with his German born lover then wife Frieda, whom he refers to as q-b for queen bee, through various villages on the mainland of Italy and the island of Sardinia. Lawrence does not record his experience of &quot;famous&quot; sights in these two books, in fact he says he is not interested in historical places, museums etc. but rather he wishes to see the people and the places in the out-of-the way areas of Italy. He and Frieda travel by bus, train, and boat--close to the ground.Those who have read Lawrence's fiction will recognize his writing. He describes what he encounters with a visceral language--people, clothing, food, establishments. Some of the places are stunning and some so filthy you wonder how he could have stayed overnight. He visits lemon and olive groves and various high places along the coast and in the interior valleys. His writing is graphic--the reader will be as appalled and enchanted. He reflects Italy just before and after WWI.In the third book, 'Etruscan Places', Lawrence describes his visits to various Etruscan sites, including the painted tombs of Tarquinia. His writing is less descriptive than that of the first two books. He is concerned with nothing less than the meaing of life, and the conflict between religion and truth (he died a few short years later at age 44 so his reflections seem almost prescient). He muses that societies are organized around death or life. He speaks of the use of fertility symbols such as fish and lambs for Christians and dolphins and eggs for Etruscans; the significance of the color vermillion -- male body painting by warrior classes where red paint connotes power contrasted with the the red skin coloring of the Etruscan tomb portraits which seems to have connoted the blood of life. He says the Etuscans loved life and the Romans who subdued them loved power.Lawrence's book provides good background for those who would know more about Italy. Many of the places he describes have changed since the 1920s--some for the better. The people have changed--their clothing, homes, etc. are less unique and colorful, but they are better fed, warmer in winter, and cleaner. Hopefully their lives are better, but I don't think Lawrence would agree."},{"Title":"D. H.

Etruscan Places almost single-handedly revived \\"modern\\" interest in the Etruscans and was essential to the preservation and study of their tombs and paintings.

Maybe it doesn't translate well. Lawrence, as young man, describes a thread running through his life as he starts the journey by heading south toward Italy on foot from Bavaria with Frida, a way of travel that many Germans still understand very well. Descriptions of people are attractive, like the one-legged Italian who tried to seduce the cold, northern women at a dance. I liked best his description of his own Alp&uuml;berquerung, his description therein of the hurried English hiker, the way that Italins have ruined the alpine valleys with industrialization. And I felt loss at his growing distance from Frida.

She deftly navigates through Henry's court and his notorioulsy fickle love life. We hear something of Elizabeth and her youthful hardships (exiled to a summer estate, a toothache at the age of three, a dearth of nice dresses) only as asides in this grand drama of Henry and his struggles with wives and Popes.Ms. Sitwell is an extremely talented writer, and there is no doubt that the book was well researched. Why then, was I so disappointed with it? Because the book is not about Elizabeth I, Queen of England. It's about her father.Fanfare for Elizabeth is a lovely, lightweight account of Henry's adult life. The book is charming in it's style and comes across as rather quaint (Katherine Howard's teenage indiscretions are never directly addressed, nor are Henry's adult ones). The book ends with a vignette of Elizabeth in her early teens, still oblivious of the grandeur that awaits her. Fanfare for Elizabeth is not a bad book - it's just not what you think it should be."},{"Title":"Summertree","review":"This story/Play is outstanding. Your heart breaks.

The personalities and struggles, failures and victories of all of her characters become real for the reader.She is writing earlier in the 20th century, when people were starting to buy radios and automobiles -- she saw a lot of the south, and north, rapidly transform into the beginnings of the consumer culture we know today.When I read Hurston, it is like I feel an anxiety to preserve. I sense a underlying insight, that she probably had, that within a couple of generations, the rhythm of life would radically change.I think she saw that a lot of the folk traditions and rituals in North America would disappear, so she did what she could to demonstrate a vibrant african american cultural life, as she knew it, and interpreted it.The two collections of Hurston's work show the span of her writing, over her lifetime. These pieces reveal how many of her imagination and many of her themes and character-types evolve over the years.I recommend the two volumes."},{"Title":"Zora Neale Hurston : Folklore, Memoirs, and Other Writings : Mules and Men, Tell My Horse, Dust Tracks on a Road, Selected Articles (The Library of America, 75)","review":"The debate of whether Ms Hurston was a true Harlem Renaissance writer is does so little justice to her contributions to that scene that I spent an entire semester debating it. Of course she was and she was one of the writers who helped give it its significance. Just the scene in Jonah's Gourd where she is talking about the physical features of the male protagonist is important enough. Her &quot;peope&quot; are real and you wonder if she had interacted with them in real life because they are your neighbors, relatives and friends...they are just that touchable. Her pain in life comes through all her books but you are so busy savoring her prose that you only wonder about it after you are done.

I sometimes teach seminars on death and dying and this book will be the one I most recommend to my students to have on hand. It is as timely now as it was decades ago."},{"Title":"Death the Final Stage of Growth","review":"One of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross's books, 'On Death and Dying', is a classic work in the field, still used to educate and inform medical, counseling, and pastoral professionals since its original publication in the 1960s. Kubler-Ross did extensive research in the field by actually talking to those in the process of dying, something that had hitherto been considered taboo and an unthinkable, uncaring thing to do. Kubler-Ross asked for volunteers, and never pressured people to do or say anything they didn't want to. One of her unexpected discoveries was that the medical professionals were more reluctant to participate than were the patients, who quite often felt gratitude and relief at being able to be heard.This book, 'Death: The Final Stage of Growth' continued that research; Kubler-Ross is the editor here rather than an author, and the text is primarily in others' words. This includes other doctors and psychiatrists, patients, and family members. Kubler-Ross in her research spoke to families, and followed people through their ailments, sometimes to recovery, but most often to their death. She let the people guide her in her research; here she lets them speak for themselves for the most part.This caring approach was often an aggravation for Kubler-Ross and her staff, because they would know what the patient had been told but was not yet ready to face. Kubler-Ross recounts stories of attempts to deal with death in different ways; denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance -- in fact, the various stages of grief were first recognised in Kubler-Ross's research. There are those who dislike the 'stages; theory of grief, but it is important to know (as the quote above indicates) that these are not set-in-stone processes, but rather dialectical and perichoretic in nature, ebbing and flowing like the tide, so that where a person was 'stage-wise' would vary from meeting to meeting.Kubler-Ross drew together a diverse collection of views for this book, finding meaning both in life and death. This book provides insights for health-care professionals and clergy, as well as the families, friends, and companions of those who are dying. There are insights here to help cope and find meaning and resolution in death.Death is a difficult subject to comprehend, and even more difficult to deal with. Kubler-Ross includes an anonymous letter from a student nurse who discovered she was dying, and wrote a letter to fellow hospital workers giving a first-person account of what it is like to be on the receiving end of the treatment - something which, like it or not, most of us will eventually face. This is part of our common humanity.It is important not to approach this subject merely as an intellectual or theoretical subject -- it is not sufficient to subscribe to a 'pie-in-the-sky' kind of theology about afterlife the denies the emotions in this world. Even those with firm belief and faith will still experience the loss in this world.This book is lovingly written, well-researched and full of insight. While some of Kubler-Ross's ideas have over time become oversimplified, and some research has been superseded, her example of bringing a difficult subject to the area of regular conversation and consideration cannot be underestimated, and this book is part of that legacy."},{"Title":"Death the Final Stage of Growth","review":"Death: The Final Stage of Growth is an especially enlightening work not simply because of the varied and knowledgeable contributed views to this particular volume, but because it approaches death and dying not from a scientific or psychological standpoint, but rather, from a cultural, sociological and mixed religious context. The essays that focus on the Eskimo, Jewish, Hindu and Buddhist approach to death and dying are deeply taken into account, as are their rituals, their cultural approaches and their belief systems. But though all the faith approaches differ in one way or another, the unifying human elements are-for the most part-a consistent grief, fear, faith of a higher authority and the oncoming trials and tribulations that dying can and will entail, all of which unites us. Dignity should begin at the conception of life, and it does not cease until the last breath is taken and arrangements for what follows are respectfully set up. But in many cases, as illustrated in the section entitled: \\"The Organizational Context of Dying\\" by Hans O. Mauksch, once a person is diagnosed as having a terminal illness and thus becomes a full-time patient, (s)he, after stripping and handing over their possessions, is banded like a piece of property They then are quickly yet efficiently-like in the military or in religious life-slowly deloused of their sense of autonomy; they are gradually assilimated to the institution. And their physical and mental definitions are not fully acknowledged. It is not done out of spiteful cruelty, just ignorant insensitivity. But through psychological studies-as done by Kubler-Ross as well as others in the field-and radical restructuring in pallative care, hospitals are really no longer deemed as the menacing sick houses of olden times. Rather, the patient as a whole is acknowledged, not merely the physical self. The soul, the intelligence, the humor and wisdom. The \\"all\\" of the person is taken into account, and as that is so, the hospital environment in its own right changes for the better. But it stems from communication and compassion and facing what for almost all of us is the ultimate and insurmountable phobia. All in all, Death: The Final Stage of Growth is another excellent and necessary Kubler-Ross offering."},{"Title":"Death the Final Stage of Growth","review":"Kubler-Ross shares with us her life's work experiences with death and dying persons and how dealing with our own death parallels with our everyday life choices. Death comes to us in small ways everyday. There are many things in life that we have to die to, inner growth depends on this. Dying to small things prepares us for the moment of bodily death. Our ego for one thing is the hardest to die to, how we love to be right and not give in to someone else's opinion, how we love to be recognized for our work, our successes, our education, our money, our home, cars etc. To let go of our ego takes a lifetime but it is well worth the effort and gives you acceptance and peace of soul. The practice of letting go in small things prepares you for the bigger decisions of life. Your life becomes less petty and more human, less superficial and more realized, less important and more compassionate. It is not an easy lesson but one worth working through the stages of death and dying. Victor Frankl in his book \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" also show how finite is our existence. Anthony DeMello in his bookSadhana, a Way to God: Christian Exercises in Eastern Formreveals how important it is to detach ourselves from desire and also the Dalai Lama lives a life full of compassion although he has been exiled from his own country for over 35 years. To be or not to be that is the question."},{"Title":"Death the Final Stage of Growth","review":"'On Death and Dying' Author Dies at 78Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, a psychiatrist who revolutionized the way the world looks at terminally ill patients with her book \\"On Death and Dying\\" and later as a pioneer for hospice care, has died.

In another passage, she wrote: \\"Dying is nothing to fear. It can be the most wonderful experience of your life.

In 1999, Time magazine named Kubler-Ross as one of the \\"100 Most Important Thinkers\\" of the past century.Born in Zurich, Switzerland, Kubler-Ross graduated from medical school at the University of Zurich in 1957. She came to New York the following year and was appalled by hospital treatment of dying patients.Whoever has seen the horrifying appearance of the postwar European concentration camps would be similarly preoccupied,\\" she said.She began her work with the terminally ill at the University of Colorado Medical Center in Denver, and was a clinical professor of behavioral medicine and psychiatry at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.Kubler-Ross began giving lectures featuring terminally ill patients, who talked about what they were going through. That led to her 1969 book.\\"Dying becomes lonely and impersonal because the patient is often taken out of his familiar environment and rushed to an emergency room,\\" she wrote.\\"He may cry for rest, peace and dignity, but he will get infusions, transfusions, a heart machine, or tracheostomy. ... He will get a dozen people around the clock, all busily preoccupied with his heart rate, pulse, electrocardiogram or pulmonary functions, his secretions or excretions - but not with him as a human being.\\"The most important thing Kubler-Ross did was bring death out of the dark for the medical community, said Carol Baldwin, a research associate professor of medicine at the University of Arizona and who worked as a nurse in one of the nation's first hospices in 1979.\\"She really set the standards for how to communicate with the dying and their loved ones,\\" Baldwin said recently. \\"Families learned that it's not a scary thing to watch someone die.\\"Kubler-Ross is survived her two children, Kenneth Ross and Barbara Lee Ross, and two granddaughters."},{"Title":"Death the Final Stage of Growth","review":"This book should be read by anyone whatever the personal situation is.

He doesn't understand his uncle who spends all his days reading and talking on the phone, nor does he want to. Struggling with his strange new home he goes out into the fields to think and be alone. That's when he spots a strange man running from a pack of wolves. Helping the man to safety the strange man tells Eric he owes him one. A few weeks later Eric goes to the same place to eat when skin heads come and attack him, the strange man appears out of thin air and saves him.The next thing Eric knows he's waking up in a strange place. His wounds healed, and he's surrounded by rock people. He soon finds out he's in Aesir, Asgard. There he meets all the Norse Gods and their great enemies the Frost Giants. Eric also makes a number of friends and becomes almost a family towards everyone he meets including Rock Dwarfs, Gods such as Odin, Thor, and Loki, and the Valkyries. As Eric is discovering this other world he learns that the Frost Giants are preparing for a war with Aesir that could not only destroy all the inhabitants of Asgard but they also hope to gain control of Earth. The Frost Giants are using skin heads to spread the hate across Eric's home, and when Eric's family and friends become jeopardized he must learn how to fight like the young warrior that he truly is to save them, and the new friends he has come to love.Will Eric save Earth and the people of Aesir? Or will the Frost Giants prevail in enslaving all of humanity? With both otherworldly and human technologies coming together to create all all out war who will prevail in the end? This novel is kick butt, the only problem I had was the long parts of description. Other than that Eric as well as the other characters were amazing to read about. Jack Hillman truly created an amazing world full of magic, technology, and even some humor. Hope you go get your copy!"},{"Title":"There Are Giants In This Valley","review":"There is nothing more tempting to a young boy than an adventure full of giants, gods, dwarfs, and mystery. When Eric runs into Thor, a god of Norse legend, he knew an adventure would follow.Add any type of mythology to a story and you have captured my attention. Norse mythology is not one that I would consider myself familiar with, but after reading this story I would love to learn even more. The author did a great job of collaborating mythology with reality, which created a dynamic story. The added twist and turns including other mythical creatures like giants and dwarfs and I couldn't put the book down.Eric is a character I can see in any boy. His life hasn't been perfect, but he still has the innocence and compulsive personality. It's what leads him to want to learn more about Thor and the others, as well as aid them in any way possible. I couldn't help but think of my son, brother, cousins when reading this story, because I saw similar traits in them as well. These traits also made for a interesting read, because as with any young boy, Eric didn't always do what was best for himself, but instead did what he felt needed to be done.This story encompassed some great characters above and beyond just the main character. I got to meet some regular humans as well as other creatures who had personalities that came to life on the pages. They added depth at times, and humor at others. This is truly a story the whole family can enjoy.Originally posted at LAS YA reviews"},{"Title":"There Are Giants In This Valley","review":"I love a good YA novel, Hillman's book is one of the best I have read in a long time, a completely natural and logical combination of Norse mythology and science fiction. The action is fast-paced, the characters likable. These people have substance, and they break the mold of so many YA books. The young hero has his problems (adjusting to a new home after the death of his parents) but he is a capable and strong individual who rises to the challenge of a sudden emergency and everything that stems from it. His aunt and uncle are wise, able in both adventure and mundane situations, and loving, not the usual stereotypes (cold or else clueless). The mythological characters are marvelously well portrayed. Altogether a most enjoyable read."},{"Title":"There Are Giants In This Valley","review":"At first, I thought this was going to be just another book that my mom thought I would like. When I first started reading it, it sounded just like every other book I read: the kid's parents die in a car crash and the kid is sent off to a relative's place to stay. But when I got into it I realized that I lived about 3 miles from the plot! It was really neat to be able to follow where the plot was, but the plot was just as interesting! Norse mythology was something I had heard of, but it never really interested me until I read this book. It is so detailed that even if you know nothing on the subject, you could become a Norse mythology expert. This is only Jack Hillman's first book (I think) but he has the potential to become a well accomplished writer."},{"Title":"Remember Who You Are: Life Stories That Inspire the Heart and Mind","review":"The stories are beautifully written, artfully presented, and painstakingly edited and polished. Some of them could win Best Personal Essay contests were they to be presented as such. They are eminently readable; in fact it was a delight to read them.Let me put it this way: If you have a young person interested in a business career or a thirty-something loved one climbing up the corporate ladder, slip this little gem of a book into their unread copy of the Wall Street Journal and they'll have it read before morning and wake up with amazement in their eyes.Reading this book is a little like going to the Harvard School of Business. Daisy Wademan has selected fifteen life-changing stories told by business professors at Harvard. She has guided these stories into a form very much like that of the 15-minute personal-experience lecture that typically signals the close of a class before the final exam and before the applause. They are story/lectures from the heart and from the mind, told by people who know what they are talking about. They have excellent ideas and the commitment of true teachers who want to help and to guide.The first story, &quot;A Fall Before Rising&quot; by Jai Jaikumar is about mountain climbing and the day his foot went through the snow in the Himalayas at close to 24,000 feet, and of the consequent 60-mile-per-hour ride down part of the side of the mountain, and then a 24-hour trek through snow and ice apparently on a broken hip until he fell into the arms of a peasant woman who fed him and then carried him--literally carried him--for three days to a doctor.The second story by Jeffrey F. Rayport is about a stuffed bird only partially displayed that served as an unusual final exam for a zoology course that taught him to be prepared to expect strange challenges; indeed the bird symbolized the nature of what we can only partially see, making us realize that what we need to know to succeed in business may be characterized by &quot;extreme uncertainty and accelerating change.&quot;The third story is unusually striking in its advice: &quot;be like yourself,&quot; with the emphasis on the word &quot;like.&quot; Professor Richard S. Tedlow advises his students to assume a public personality that is neither too remote from who they are nor too familiar. He relates how we might seek &quot;a balanced identity.&quot; Just as we balance time between our personal and profession lives, so too might we balance who we are at home and at work while keeping a &quot;porous boundary&quot; between the two personae.The fourth story is about understanding who you are, &quot;your background...and your prejudices, and [that] you must understand how each element from your past shaped your thinking...&quot; Thomas K. McCraw recalls Kierkegaard, who said that &quot;we understand ourselves only in retrospect.&quot; How truth that is, and yet (McCraw adds) &quot;we must live...[our lives] going forward&quot;--always going forward in a partial ignorance that is only dispelled after the fact, sometimes long after the fact.Notice how the power of these thoughts comes from a broad understanding of history and ideas, from the application of an academic understanding to the practice of life. These stories can be seen as examples of how education works to improve out lives and to help us understand how to live.If I had to pick one story that stood out for me personally it would be Stephen P. Kaufman's &quot;A Bad Meal, and the Truth.&quot; What he learned when he became a CEO is that you are still the same person but everyone around you sees you differently and treats you in ways that can isolate you and make you ineffective if you are not careful to devise ways of getting around their insulating and frankly sycophantic behavior. A fellow CEO summed up the situation by saying, &quot;Steve, there are two things you'll never get again--a bad meal, and the truth.&quot; I would like to add that this is a danger that can threaten heads of state as well.I could go on--and I will. One more. This is from Thomas DeLong (story #12). He took his 11-year-old daughter on a bike trip to Mount Rushmore and she asked him what he calls &quot;The Mount Rushmore Question.&quot; He had told her that the men on Mount Rushmore &quot;were courageous&quot; and &quot;had made a difference in people's lives.&quot; She asked, &quot;Do YOU make a difference?&quot; One can see the little girl comparing her father to the men on the mountain. DeLong felt this powerfully and it lead him to formulate two questions he employs to teach others the lesson that he had learned. The first question is, &quot;How do people experience you?&quot; and the second is, &quot;How do people experience themselves when they are with you?&quot;Try those two out. You might surprise yourself.The keynote story is the final one in the book, &quot;Remember Who You Are.&quot; I think we can imagine how these words from a proud mother guided and inspired Harvard Business School Dean Kim Clark over the years.Wademan provides an Introduction about the genesis and the nature of the book, and she introduces each of the stories with a short biographical note.This is no ordinary book of inspiration and reading it will make you feel very good about the state of business in America, and make you realize that what happened at Enron and ImClone are aberrations."},{"Title":"Remember Who You Are: Life Stories That Inspire the Heart and Mind","review":"This book was inspired by the Harvard Business School tradition of sharing life lessons with students in the final class. Ms. Daisy Wademan, a recent graduate in 2002, collected a number of these stories as shared in final classes and in many cases rewrote them to fit into this wise volume. In other cases, the professors wrote and polished the stories themselves.At its best, the essays in this book are among the most compelling that I have ever read. At its weakest, Remember Who You Are's essays remind me of the most boring moments I have spent in a classroom. With stronger editing, this could have been a knock-out of a book. As it is, the book is very valuable . . . and will be a five-star offering for any Harvard Business School graduate who wants a quick course in key life lessons. I graded the book down one star as being less relevant for those who did not attend Harvard Business School. To have met that standard, the book's stories would have had to have been geared for those involved in less exalted roles than Harvard Business School professors and alumni. As a side note, I took two courses there in marketing while studying law at Harvard Law School so I have a foot inside the camp as well as one outside of it.Each essay describes a defining moment in a professor's life, and the epiphany that resulted from that defining moment. Unfortunately, the defining moments sometimes had a little too much to do with being a good student . . . and becoming a good professor rather than focusing on how to become an effective person in a business career.The most universal business story in the book is &quot;A Bad Meal, and the Truth&quot; by Stephen P. Kaufman a professor since 2001 who is the former long-time CEO of Arrow Electronics. He describes the way that organizations form around their leaders to shelter the leaders from difficulties and bad news (or even the truth). He provides excellent advice on how to overcome those tendencies. This idea and its development are worth being the subject of a whole book.There are two stories that are so compelling that I defy anyone to forget them. The first, &quot;A Fall before Rising,&quot; opens the book and recounts a life-threatening fall during a climb in the Himalayas by the late professor Ramchandran &quot;Jai&quot; Jaikumar. He has a beautiful reaction in terms of the karmic debt involved in all of our lives which should echo forward into future generations. Ms. Wademan has given us a great gift by capturing this story.The second remarkably compelling story is &quot;The Mount Rushmore Question&quot; by Thomas J. DeLong. On a motorcycle journey to Mount Rushmore with his young daughter, she asks him if he makes a difference in people's lives. The essay goes on to encourage you to ask two questions for becoming more effective in these dimensions. One, &quot;how do people experience you?&quot; Two, &quot;how do people experience themselves with they are with you?&quot; I thought that those three questions are among the most perceptive ones that I have ever run into. I wish I had heard them many years ago. Please pass them along.One of the most intriguing sections is &quot;The Oath&quot; by Nitin Nohria in which he expresses the moral and ethical responsibilities of the manager. This essay should receive much wider dissemination as well. I am always struck by how many people see business leadership as solely a personal opportunity rather than as a social responsibility to create positive results for all stakeholders. The management oath in the essay is a good step in the right direction of redressing this fault. Peter Drucker has often said to me that management has few problems that becoming like a profession wouldn't solve. He points out the many differences between how physicians advance medicine and medical practices versus how business managers perform. I hope that this thought process will receive more attention in the future.Many of the other essays reminded me of those dreams we all have about impossible tests that we cannot complete. Some of the more memorable ones include &quot;The Stuffed Bird&quot; by Jeffrey F. Rayport, &quot;Katharine Hepburn and Me&quot; by Rosabeth Moss Kanter and &quot;The Race&quot; by Henry B. Reiling.With due nostalgia for my two courses at Harvard Business School, I remembered that two of my biggest career lessons came from brief moments in class that were not the final class. In one, Professor Marty Marshall told us about friends of his who ran a small video company in New Hampshire that had a great life style . . . while providing New York quality work at New York prices. In another, I heard a McKinsey partner describe a consulting assignment in which he solved the problem by moving beyond the charter the client had given him. I have drawn on both stories successfully many times in my career to become the head of my own strategy and financial consulting firm in suburban Boston.The lesson that I learned from this book is that it would be a good idea to ask people who have more experience than you what the defining moments in their lives have been . . . and what they learned from those experiences. I hope that Ms. Wademan will consider writing other books using this format that focus on thoughtful, ethical business leaders.Nice job!"},{"Title":"Remember Who You Are: Life Stories That Inspire the Heart and Mind","review":"At Harvard Business School one of the traditions has been to spend some time on the last day of classes delivering a talk to your students about how to create a good life as a leader. Often these speeches leave the students encouraged and with a deeper understanding of their role in business and in life. Author Daisy Wademan, a graduate of Harvard Business School, has collected some of these talks into her new book &quot;Remember Who You Are&quot;. It is a collection of fifteen of what she considers the most influential speeches from her professors. For each one there is a short vignette about the professor followed by the actual speech. Each speech is only a few pages long and takes only a couple of minutes to read but could influence your leadership skills for years. &quot;Remember Who You Are&quot; is a recommended read for anyone in a leadership position or who hopes to be there."},{"Title":"Remember Who You Are: Life Stories That Inspire the Heart and Mind","review":"Is this book destined for the best seller's list? Probably not...but anyone who reads it will read it again.This is a solid piece of work, an amazing collection of stories wherein the reader can reflect on their own life and career and be inspired.Beyond inspiration, the stories are also a very telling of the professors who have spent decades training the world's current and next generation of leaders at Harvard Business School. You can just imagine Wademan talking with these professors, soaking in their every word as they talk about what is important to them, what they make sure every student hears of them. And a relief: when exposed to these professors, the money-greedy stereotype of the the MBA goes out the window.A perfect book for anyone thinking about their career, in school or in transition, or those looking to be better leaders in whatever they do."},{"Title":"Remember Who You Are: Life Stories That Inspire the Heart and Mind","review":"I picked up this book to give as a gift but started to read it myself and could not put it down. I ended up buying a second copy to give as the gift. Many of the stories were truly inspiring and gave wonderful reminders about making decisions to live a better life. I am not a business person, yet I found something personally touching in most to the essays. I would recommend this book to anyone. It is a great quick up-lifting read."},{"Title":"Remember Who You Are: Life Stories That Inspire the Heart and Mind","review":"I have had the opportunity over the past few years to participate in an executive and professional non-denominational fellowship facilitated by the former (1980's and 1990's) Chaplain of the San Francisco 49ers. The focus of our meetings is leadership and &quot;doing the right thing.&quot; We have used books by Maxwell, Lencioni, and others to draw on for discussion. Daisy Wademan's book will fit right into our program. She has, through her professors, provided us with much to think about and to discuss.For those want to improve their lives as leaders, form a small group of 6-8 people with peers (but not from the same organization), meet once a week for one hour, and use books like this to center your discussion. This one works well as it is well organized (one professor per session) and very well written. Hopefully, Ms. Wademan will follow in the footsteps of Maxwell, and Lencioni providing us with a stream of books to work with. She is off to a grand start!"},{"Title":"Remember Who You Are: Life Stories That Inspire the Heart and Mind","review":"I think a book is great if it gives me at least one kernel of truth - one piece of advice that I can carry with me, perhaps for decades to come. Few books actually do that. But this one does. It, in fact, gives a couple of them. And here is the thing: you are almost guranteed to find at least a couple of kernels yourself.

Read the messages which every HBS professor transmits to their students during the last day of class.

I would definitely recommend it for people to have an copy in their home"},{"Title":"Remember Who You Are: Life Stories That Inspire the Heart and Mind","review":"This is a great book, I would recommend this book to anybody. I enjoyed reading this book, cause I didn't have to wait anxiously to get to the end. You didn't have to read through boring parts of the book to get to the exciting part cause, it was more than one story, and it was told from people just like you. I am so happy my language arts teacher assigned me this type of book cause I had a really good time reading it. What was an even better part was that you could understand the stories more, coming from somebody your age. One time I caught myself doing the motions they were doing in one of the stories because I was getting so involved.I liked how the stories had a ton of different varieties because, if you didn't like a certain type of book, you can still have the kind of story you are looking for to read. However there is other reasons why you should like this book cause, you are getting told so much information, that you are so interested in what is coming next. Coming from me, I thought this book was great. It is also a great lesson cause, you have to remember to always be yourself, and not to follow others that are not good for your life. This book was very interesting. The book is at a level that I would say fifth graders and older, would understand. If this book sounds even a little bit good to you, then try reading it, test it out."},{"Title":"Remember Who You Are: Life Stories That Inspire the Heart and Mind","review":"Do not underestimate the effect stories may have on you.Whether young or old, one of the ways we learn and change is through stories. Humans are story tellers, we always have been, and we always will be.By the time we are teens we have acquired most of what we will be using the rest of our lives. The majority of our learning afterwards will be by rote, except for life experiences and stories (life experiences of others).In one of my seminars someone surprised me with their answer to my question \\"Why can't old dogs learn new tricks?\\" Their answer was, \\"dogs can't talk.\\"Get this book and enjoy its stories."},{"Title":"Remember Who You Are: Life Stories That Inspire the Heart and Mind","review":"I was deeply touched by the personal stories expressed in \\"Remember Who You Are\\".

It is also very funny, even giving us a parody of a poetry review as well as wry and witty observations and laugh-out-loud punch lines:Hermione: The lilac grants the inch worm/asylum in its leaves./The thorny rose invites the peaceful/pollinating bees./Were we wiser than we are/we would live as these.1st Attendant: Don't listen!

I always plan for our trips by buying and studying 2 guidebooks, one with lots of pictures, and the other, invariably, the Blue Guide to the site in question. Blue Guide England was the first of these, purchased more than 10 years ago. We used that edition as guide book, historical and geographical reference, and atlas. It became so dogeared and highlighted that we were happy when the next edition was published, purchasing it immediately even though we had no immediate plans to return to England. We are independent travellers, almost always booking flights, cars, and reservations on our own on the web. We also enjoy delving into places off the beaten track and the top-ten lists. The detail in any Blue Guide is much more encompassing than that in any other guide we have used. The driving directions are usually right on the money. Its literary, architectural, and historical information is particularly helpful. We have discovered many little known gems because of these guides. Highly recommended, without reservation."},{"Title":"Long Way to Texas (Thorndike Western II)","review":"Lt.

This is Book 1 of 6, and I loved them all as a kid. Much better than the Hardy Boys, and at least as good as The Three Investigators. I stumbled onto these used, and enjoyed them very much. Laughs, clever detective work, and the feeling of a simpler time, before PDAs, cell phones, and the like."},{"Title":"The case of the missing message (A Brains Benton mystery)","review":"I generally credit the Brains Benton books with jolting me into the life-long habit of reading. It was the early 1970s and I was perhaps nine or ten years old; they were just the right length and style for my reading skills and I inhaled all six titles in the series with a single, mighty breath. Three decades and then some later, I still have them on my shelf, and from time to time I take one down for nostalgia's sake.Published in 1959, THE CASE OF THE MISSING MESSAGE is the first in the series. Written by Charles Spain Verral, an author who specialized in pulp-style adventure stories, the book introduces to the characters that will continue throughout the series: Jimmy Carson, an average \\"All American\\" boy with a paper route, and Barclay \\"Brains\\" Benton, whose bright red hair and extraordinary intelligence sets him apart from the crowd.Together they are the Benton and Carson International Detective Agency, and when Jimmy tries to sell a newspaper subscription at an isolated and delapidated house he plunges both of them into mystery up to their eyeballs. In this instance, the mystery concerns a child who has been cheated of his inheritance: a carnival! Needless to say, the circumstance allows for plenty of colorful characterizations that range from a clown and a fortune teller to a wacky parrot and a stampeding elephant.Brains has rigged up a crime lab over the family garage: press a nail in the board of alley fence and the wall slides back and a staircase slides down. They refer to each other as \\"X\\" and \\"Operative Three.\\" Jimmy is fond of Cherry Fizz, his mother is always dieting, and his father likes a game of golf; Brains' parents teach at the local college. Details such as these make the books tremendous fun, and the author handles them very skillfully; unlike the Nancy Drew or Hardy Boys books, the Brains Benton books never feel as if they have been written by a committee to a very specific formula.All of this said, I very much doubt that the books would appeal to a modern child plugged into the multi-media experience of our computer age. But adult fans of children's literature will find them a great deal of fun--and if you remember Jimmy and Brains from your own childhood, it will be a nostalgic treat.

The many quotes used in the book have been said over and over in my mind a thousand times. It covers topics that no other books I have found does like dating, personal and family stresses, and many of the guilts we place on ourself and how other place their guilt onto us to ease their own. If you are not a widow or widower it is still a wonderful book to help you understand us and how we think.This book is a must for any young person who has lost a spouse or someone who is close to them. If you know of someone buy it for them Don't make them find it on their own like I had to. It is noted in this book and I must agree that it is not for the newly widowed...wait a couple months before giving it to them."},{"Title":"I'm Grieving as Fast as I Can: How Young Widows and Widowers Can Cope and Heal","review":"This book made me feel a lot better about being able to smile and have a good time after my 29 year old husband of a year died. I thought there was something wrong with me because I COULD have fun and laugh. In this book there was a part about when a spouse dies and the couple has nothing between them(no lies, arguements, unresolved things) that the surviving spouse has an easier time going on. Not that it has been easy for me but I know that my husband and I had nothing at all that we regretted during our time together, only that we didn't meet sooner. My husband &amp; I had a once in a billion kind of love; we never fought, we liked all of the same things, we loved just talking and spending time together. We never got tired of each other's company. Thanks to this book now I realize WHY I am able to go out, have a good time &amp; laugh. I miss him more than words could ever say but I know I'm going to be okay now."},{"Title":"I'm Grieving as Fast as I Can: How Young Widows and Widowers Can Cope and Heal","review":"This book was the best thing that I ever bought. My partner was murdered in an anti-gay hate crime. I was 27 and he was 30. Read it cover to cover at least 7 times immediately following the murder and then used it as a reference book throughout the 5 year trial. It was great as it was written with the focus on the young widow, most books are targeted more for elderly folks. It has a great section called \\"It matters how the person died\\" with a homocide section which was spot on to the feelings that I was experiencing. I was also worried that I would need to \\"translate\\" through a hetrosexual taxonomy and bias, but I was pleasantly surprized. This type of experience is incredibly painful, gay or straight, and the entire book was written sensitively so that it would work for both audiences. There also is a nice section on \\"loss of a lover\\" which was most helpful to me. It covered loosing a lover or fiancee. If you or someone you know is dealing with loss this book can be a life-saver."},{"Title":"I'm Grieving as Fast as I Can: How Young Widows and Widowers Can Cope and Heal","review":"Losing my wife to Breast Cancer at 31 and having to raise a 1 1/2 year old girl in a small mid southern town I was never at a loss for advice, judgment, or rumors. I was trapped in a group of well meaning people who had no idea what it was like to be a young widower. I felt guilt from people judging me, yet they had never walked in my shoes. I went to grief meetings and had nothing in common with the 60, 70, 80 year olds that were grieving their past. I was grieving my lost future and nobody could understand it. I wanted to start dating and people thought I was callous and snubbed me. I read books that were written for old widows with maybe a chapter on widowers and maybe a sentence about people under 50. A lot were spiritualy based and being in the spot I was my spiritual beliefs were a little ragged. Then I found this book and it truly CHANGED MY LIFE. I underlined half the book, nodded in agreement, cried, and even smiled. Perhaps other books have been written since but I never found another book that spoke to all of the issues that a young widow/er faces. I have given this book to others who have suffered a similar loss and they felt the same. The Author doesn't judge and the book is not a template. It gives you the permission to grieve any way you want to and lets you know that there are a select group of people that are in the same position as you and feel the same way you do. Four years after my wifes death I still cherish this book. If you are grieving and nobody seems to understand you or know someone in this horrible position this is THE book."},{"Title":"I'm Grieving as Fast as I Can: How Young Widows and Widowers Can Cope and Heal","review":"Even as my wife was dying with cancer, I could not accept she was dying. After she died, I was torn apart with emotions that I could not understand nor that I could come to grips with. I had difficult time with groups because I was not &quot;old&quot; and did not have 30-40 years of with my wife, but we did spend half our adult lives together, and this is significant. I started to read this book and felt as if the author knew not only how I was feeling but how I was trying to deal with my loss. This book helps validate the feelings, explain why I am feeling this way, and what I can do to try to move on without being spiritual or condensending. In fact, the author even recognizes that a widower's experience is different from a widows and seems to consider that throughout the book.If you are under 50 and have been widowed, buy this book, read it, then reread it again. It may provide as much help as a therapist!!"},{"Title":"I'm Grieving as Fast as I Can: How Young Widows and Widowers Can Cope and Heal","review":"I lost my husband when I was 33. It was 6 months after our wedding. I scanned several grief books, attended support groups, etc. All seemed geared to the &quot;older&quot; widow/widower. This book hits home. I found myself nodding in agreement on almost every page... about feelings, other people, etc. I felt this book was written directly for me. It also made me realize that there are other &quot;young&quot; people out there going through the same things I am.

I have been lost and I felt like I was spinning my wheels in my life with no direction. This book was hard to put down once i started reading it. It touches on all aspects of my emotions right now. I believe this will be a book I reread. All of the other books I have read up to this point were more geared for woman that have lost their husbands later in life. This was a book that I was able to take things from it and use them in my life. Thank you."},{"Title":"I'm Grieving as Fast as I Can: How Young Widows and Widowers Can Cope and Heal","review":"My wife died of cancer in 2001. One thing I realized when reading this book was how lucky I have been to have missed most of the incredibly callous behavior and remarks that young widows and widowers often seem to be treated to (the most shocking example I found in the book was that of a young man who lost his wife and child in childbirth and was told by a well-meaning person how &quot;lucky&quot; he was not to have gotten &quot;stuck&quot; with the kid). With the exception of my in-laws, everyone I know has been very supportive and tactful, and reading this book taught me to be thankful for that.Of course, everyone's experience is different, but I found a number of things in this book that I could identify with, and suspect that all young widows and widowers would too. One thing I'd like the author to consider adding if she writes a revised edition of this book at some point is a more extensive treatment of the problems that widows and widowers experience in new relationships. The book is primarily about coping with the early stages of grief, about how to get to the point at which one is ready for a new relationship. But it does not go beyond this point. There is a passing reference to the fears young widows and widowers have as a result of &quot;gloom-and-doom&quot; statistics about failed second marriages, but it would be very helpful to have some analysis of why these relationships so often fail. Understanding these problems would probably help many readers - both widows/widowers and their partners - deal with them more effectively.Finally, a recommendation for further reading is Elisabeth Kubler-Ross's On Death and Dying. While this classic book is certainly more useful before than after a death, I think it may help many who have already suffered a bereavement to understand their own feelings as well as what spouses who died after a long illness went through."},{"Title":"I'm Grieving as Fast as I Can: How Young Widows and Widowers Can Cope and Heal","review":"This has been the best book I have read on all the emotions young Widows and widowers go through.

She often reads self-help type books on various subjects, so I knew she would be interested in a book like this at some point. I did not know when, however, so I just left it out. Surprisingly, she read it the evening after the funeral. The next morning, she said it was a great help to find out that not only were many of her feelings shared by others going through the same thing but also to have some sense of what issues might come up in the near future. Of course, everyone is different. But it did seem to be quite useful for my sister. That was important, so it gets five stars from me."},{"Title":"I'm Grieving as Fast as I Can: How Young Widows and Widowers Can Cope and Heal","review":"So many of the quotes from this book matched my thoughts or actions. It validates that you are not going crazy, and are not the only one thinking in that way.The book is aimed at people under 50, but I think the majority of the themes in the first half of the book would apply to any age.The second half of the book had sections that applied to different groups (with children, gay, etc) and so was less useful for me, but I would definitely recommend this book, based on the first half alone."},{"Title":"I'm Grieving as Fast as I Can: How Young Widows and Widowers Can Cope and Heal","review":"This book has helped change my life - I didn't realize that what I was feeling is the same as others....It answered so many questions for me and has made me feel so much better."},{"Title":"I'm Grieving as Fast as I Can: How Young Widows and Widowers Can Cope and Heal","review":"My husband died just over a year ago leaving me with 2 young children.

But I could not believe the wording in the book and how many times SHE is used (what about us guys who have lost a wife) and she says it is for widowers but the language throughout is for women, and says nothing about the unique ways that men grieve. I think if you are a woman - buy this book it is a great book but if you are a guy you will be very disappointed as I was. It identifies with women. Did it talk about any of the things men experience after the death of their spouse - usually their ONLY FRIEND IN THE WORLD? did it deal with betrayal?? Did it deal with MALE SEXUALITY? The entire book is from the FEMALE PERSPECTIVE ONLY. Not a bit for men. It was a waste for me.

My friend just finished the book and was grateful for it taking her through so many of the emotions she is dealing with after the tragic loss of her husband.

I wanted to like it, wanted to get something from it. It's simplistic in many ways, using sweeping generalizations to address huge issues, but for some new widows, this might be helpful. Who has time to read pages and pages of text when you just lost your spouse?But the gross homophobia in the book actually made me physically ill. On the 3 whole pages the author devotes to same sex spouses, she1. Ignores the fact that same sex widows die from anything other than HIV/AIDS2. Implies that gay men who die of AIDS are not supported by the community.3. Says the following \\"the only positive thing that has come out of the AIDS epidemic is that it has matured and united the gay community. AIDS has taught gays the meaning of commitment to a cause and to relationships.\\" Really? Really?We weren't committed to our relationships before that? Really? Of course, it's the exact opposite of the truth: which is that LGBT are very committed to relationships, a gay relationship is not something you just \\"fall into.\\"Anyway, as a lesbian who has lost not one but two partners (no, not to AIDS) looking for a book that would speak to my experience as a young widow, I had high hopes for this book. I tried to give it a chance, but I found everything within it suspect after reading this section. The author needs to watch some of the ACTUP Oral history series and really learn about the history of AIDS and the history of the LGBT community before she makes such sweeping (and weird) generalizations. I feel so badly for the same sex partners in her grief support groups. It seems almost malpractice level ignorance to me."},{"Title":"I'm Grieving as Fast as I Can: How Young Widows and Widowers Can Cope and Heal","review":"The second part of the title, \\"How Young Widows And Widowers Cope and Heal\\" is in small type on the cover of the book and I didn't see it before I bought the book.Although this book has several suggestions on how to deal with the death of a spouse or partner, it is definately for younger people who have very different problems and solutions in order to recover from the loss of a loved one.I also thought the book was shallow. For the most part it merely reiterates conversations from recovery groups. Actually going to a recovery group will do much more for you than reading this book.\\"How To Deal With The Loss Of A Love\\" and \\"Bad Things Happen To Good People\\" are much better."},{"Title":"I'm Grieving as Fast as I Can: How Young Widows and Widowers Can Cope and Heal","review":"If you have been recently widowed, this is a must read.

The only word that seems close is \\"shallow\\". The author covers a massive scope, treating all sorts of potential sources of grief, in all sorts of conditions.Most of the material is drawn from the anecdotal histories obtained from group therapy sessions. And while genuine, the routine reliance on brief quotes from grieving people gives the book a disjointed feel. This is heightened by the necessity to skip large sections that are not relevant to the reader.My primary complaint, however, is that this is not a book for widowers, but only for widows. Despite a grafted chapter on \\"Is it different for men\\" and a few hamhanded attempts to bring in male anecdotes, the tone, language and overall bearing of this book make it clear that the widower is just an afterthought. This is a book for women. It may be a very good book for women, (I suspect it is).And ultimately, I did not find this to be a comforting book. Despite the title, the tone of the book seemed to be pushing the reader to \\"get on with it\\", rather than to recognize and absorb one's grief. The very secular tone of the book was not particularly welcome; hope seemed most often to be exemplified in secular pursuits.Perhaps I've been spoiled by better books, or perhaps my experience of grief as a young widower is just too different to resonate with this author.

It is hard enough to find singularly gathered amounts of Mahayana scriptues in one place and this title puts them in one book readily accessable in practice and study. Mahayana has had a problem in the past of their scriptures being accessable in one place and/or translated in English. Chang grants an easily open translations which can appeal to any level of Mahayanist and Buddhist in general.The sectioning of the scriptures into topcis such as emptiness, consciousness, pure land, etc. is an incredibly friendly and helpful approach to systemizing the scriptures by their inner topics of teaching focus. None have done this yet in translations of Mahayana.Anyone interested in the detailed and well expounded Mahayana scriptures should have this title as their key source for you wil not find such a gathering in any current publications but this one. Another key point, many Buddhist find it difficult to find/join a local sangha but this title grants any level of Buddhist an entrance into the mystery and wonder of Buddhism when locality doesn't permit. These translations cover many of the diffcult and yet foundational philosophies, so all levels of practitioners can use this title as a key practice manual on learning about the Buddhist Path.I highly recommend this to every level of Buddhist practitioner. I myself am a Buddhist priest of the Order of the Red Lotus and this title is one of our key practice manuals because of its depths and width of English sutras."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Mahayana Sutras: Selections from the Maharatnakuta Sutra","review":"This is a collection of valuable Mahayana Sutras translated from the Chinese edited by Garma Chang.

Many of these are early and interesting Mahayana sutras, and good reading for Buddhists as well as scholars. The translation style is pretty good, and there are footnotes explaining translation decisions and any points that might be confusing. From what I understand, originally all 120 fascicles were translated, but then the project was scaled back and they only published a selection. If that's true, then it's really a tragedy that so much work was done, only to publish 500+ pages of the total collection (which would be probably 3000+ pages in total). This is a pretty big selection of texts from this collection, though, and it contains a lot of interesting material. At over 500 pages of early Mahayana sutras, this is really a steal for the price, and it has a wide range of interesting texts in it.

Notable among them are the Kashyapa-parivarta, certainly one of the oldest Mahayana sutras, the Saptashatika-prajnaparamita, the Perfection of Wisdom in 700 lines, the Srimaladevi-simhananda and the large Sukhavati-vyuha describing the Pure Land of Amitabha.One criticism is that the titles of the Sutras are given in Chinese and English only, and not in Sanskrit. This can make titles difficult to recognise; for example the Vimaladatta-pariprccha (= Questions of Vimaladatta) is called \\"A Discourse on Ready Eloquence\\". The review in Middle Way v55/1 May 1984 gives a list of Sanskrit titles for the whole volume. These are below, with the eight group headings, which give some idea of the large range of topics covered.I Maya and Miracles'1 Bhadra-mayakara-vyakaranaThe Bhadramayakaravyakarana (Introd., Tibetan text, Tr.

The book is very interesting and sometimes even amusing to read. For instance, Karl Lashley, one of the outstanding neuropsychologists of this century, reports in a chapter that his own migraine attack brought about blind spots, elementary visual hallucinations that included scintillating scotoma. Bryan Kolb, a well-known neuropsychologist and author of a standard textbook of neuropsychology describes in another self-report the consequences of his visual field defect due to a stroke as following: I still miss capital letters when reading text ... and I am puzzled by the odd spellings or messages. For example a sign stating \`women' can be misread as \`men' or one saying \`telephone' may be misread as \`lephone'(...) I also decided to try skiing that week. I was able to ski without difficulty, although I tended to overcompensate for my field defect and actually ran into a tree in my good field whilst trying to avoid a bush several meters away on the left!&quot; In another book-chapter, Prof. Harold Klawans tells us about his colleague, a general surgeon, who suffered from an attack of transient global amnesia during a resection of a gallbladder. Again and again the surgeon asked the nurse: Did I take out the gallbladder?&quot; In contrast to this severe memory deficits he was able to continue in his work without any problems. But, by the time he successfully had finished the operation, he added another fundamental question: Where am I?&quot;. Lawrence Freedman, professor of medicine, suffered a cerebral concussion due to a bicycle accident. He tells us about his anxiety to leave his home and go for a simple walk around the block with his little daughter. Halfway around the block he tried to turn into the wrong direction. He was so absolutely sure to be right, that he bets a million dollar: He still owes this money to his daughter. Stories like this lead the reader to see not only the cognitive deficits, but also the difficulties in activities of daily living and the emotional problems of patients after brain damage. Injured Brains of Medical Minds&quot; is not a simple case book. An introduction to each section of the book provides background information to the topic of concern. A commentary accompanying each of the personal accounts puts the papers into the context of current theory and clinical practice, thereby making Narinder Kapur's book a highly recommendable textbook introducing the field of neuropsychology to specialists as well as to non-specialist readers. It is important for everybody who would like to understand not only the theory of a brain lesions but to get an additional touch of the feeling&quot; how it is to be a brain damaged patient."},{"Title":"Economic and Social History of Medieval Europe / Histoire du Moyen Age","review":"This wonderfully readable book provides, in a little more than 200 pages no less, a concise summary of economic development and social history during the much derided, abused and forgotten Middle Ages and also summarizes Pirenne's radical views about the real cause of the Dark Ages (he proposes that the Arab Conquest of the Mediterranean basin and Spain and not the Germanic invasions caused the collapse of European Civilization). He also explores, in outline, the general economic rise of Europe after the year 1000, culminating in medieval high point of the mid-Fourteenth Century and the sort of stability that lasted from that period (1350) until the Age of Exploration began and radically altered everything again. It was in the Low Countries and Italy that \\"capitalism\\" and the first industrial revolution really began and Pirenne shows how and why this occurred.In this day and age where most people's image of the Middle Ages, if they have one, is based on movies like Kevin Costner's godawful &quot;Robin Hood&quot; and the fun, but totally make-believe, &quot;A Knight's Tale&quot; this book sets forth, concisely, the fascinating complexity of the age that established Christianity as the faith of Europe and the political-social system that ruled 3/4s of the Earth's surface until 1918 and whose vestiges we can still see in the UK, Belgium and the Netherlands, et al.Educated people have taken Gibbon's dismissive derision of the Middle Ages as a period of nothing but violence, superstition and stagnation. Pirenne demolishes Gibbon's amazingly shallow view with a wealth of detail and vivid, easily readable narrative. Although not the masterpiece of literature that Gibbon produced, this volume avoids the joyful boredom that so many writers of economic history seem to delight in inflicting upon their readers.The translation from the French by I.E. Clegg is smooth and idiomatic. Pirenne, who apparently spoke English fluently, helped to prepare the translation.The only irritating part of the book is the presence of several large blocks of untranslated Latin and Old French. Given the general ignorance of Latin (and I am one of the ignorant, I am ashamed to say), Clegg or Pirenne should have translated it for the benefit of the Latinless. Although I read French with some ability, the Old French (pre-1300) uses spellings and some words that I simply can't understand. Modern French dictionaries are useless. Harcourt-Brace should find some present-day academic to &quot;edit&quot; a new edition and translate these passages! A smoother typeface than the ancient &quot;Times-Roman&quot; would also be nice.All in all, if you have any interest in medieval history (especially if you are of European descent) or wish to understand how the market system of economics took form, I highly, highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Economic and Social History of Medieval Europe / Histoire du Moyen Age","review":"Pirenne's book first appeared in print in 1933, so I have to admit I was a little leery about reading it even though I have an interest in feudal economics.

To my surprise, this book is an extraordinarily good read, most interesting, and very informative. And unlike many books on this subject, a casual reader can be assured that a master's level background on the subject is not necessary to read this book.Picking up at the end of the Roman Empire and running through approximately the middle 1500s, Pirenne tackles the full spectrum of economic and sociological issues as they evolved throughout the Middle Ages in Europe. Specifically, he relates how commerce was revived after the break-up of the economic and cultural stability that existed in the ancient world. Concepts such as the re-issuance of a currency, the rebirth of a money economy, rediscovery of credit, and how urban industry developed are covered and explained in detail. This is a very complete picture of economic and sociological circumstances that existed during the middle ages, as you are likely to see.Pirenne takes the reader on a journey that attempts to plug the Medieval Period knowledge gap with a detailed explanation of economic development. Geographically (and culturally) he is able to discuss developments throughout all of Europe, from the Mediterranean to the North Sea.

The population is a fraction of what it is today and yet people can't grow enough food to feed themselves. Kings are caught up in endless fighting among themselves, and the clergy, as with the serfs, are merely trying to survive. Europe is poor, ignorant, divided, and easy prey for the next band of barbarians who happen along.Jump ahead three-hundred years, and Europe is the most prosperous place on Earth, with abundant food, a wealth of luxuries, universities, soaring cathedrals, incredible art, and no longer prey but a predator looking to colonize distant lands.What happened?Commerce. The rise of trade -- the import and export of not just goods, but ideas. For example, algebra was an import, and the writing of Plato and the Greek philosophers and playwrights. It was commerce that dramatically increased the production and variety of food, raised the standard of living, fostered reading, writing and arithmatic, financed the Renaissance, built the gothic cathedrals, eliminated slavery in Europe, created the middle class, created cities, and brought some semblance of peace. The merchant class, the men of trade, of money and banking, in going about their business, invented the corporation, created capitalism, fostered a spirit of tolerance and pluralism, and ruled democratically. Kings ruled the country, but the merchant class ran the cities. If you were a runaway serf, you found refuge--and a better job--in the city. The expression \\"the air breathes freer in the cities\\" is from this time.Kings and clergy did nothing to bring this about. They never do. If anything, they tried to stop it. So the merchants bought them off. They paid them with gold and jewels and fine silks and art and spices and all the things they were importing from the east. Mind you, the castles and churches were cold, stark places until the merchants filled them with tapestries and art and gold to prevent kings and clergy from meddling in their affairs. It was a bargain, too.Henri Pirenne's wonderful book is what they don't teach you in Econ 101. It aught to be part of the basic curriculum if for no other reason than to offset the fuzzy socialism that was all the rage when I was in college. Also highly recommended -- Robert S. Lopez's equally important book \\"The Commercial Revolution of the Middle Ages, 950-1350.\\""},{"Title":"Economic and Social History of Medieval Europe / Histoire du Moyen Age","review":"A book printed from an OCR rendering.

Basically, nursing students sharing their clinical experiences: the good, bad, and the ugly, and how they got through nursing school. I wanted validation, encouragement, things like that. I wanted to say, \\"that happened to me\\" and to be reminded of my own experiences.But it's a nursing instructor telling stories about students and staff from her point of view as instructor. It wasn't quite what I expected, and it isn't as interesting as I thought it would be. It isn't horrible, but it isn't wonderful either.I expected a good read, a book that I couldn't put down.

If you are disenchanted with a prescriptive curriculum that bores you and your students, read this book. If you want to find out how to get into your students' minds (using tools such as concept maps), read this book. I have found this book to be full of interesting and useful ideas that can act as a spark to ignite a period of critical reflection. If science teaching is to drag itself away from a 19th Century perspective that bores the pants off our students, it is thinkers such as Mintzes, Wandersee and Novak that will light the path."},{"Title":"Star Trek Nemesis 2004 Wall Calendar","review":"Yet another brilliant piece of marketing by Paramount.

This book lacks the redeeming trait of those tomes: new material. This is a collection of classics, but the selections from the modern authors- Coonts, Brown, and Peters- are all republished works, too. Granted, they are from wonderful novels themselves, but this collection would be that much better if there was some new material in it... pity.If you do like the selection from &quot;The War in 2020,&quot; buy some more of Ralph Peters' works; he is one of the most unappreciated thriller authors out there."},{"Title":"On Glorious Wings: The Best Flying Stories of the Century","review":"I have many books written by Stephen Coonts.

I just started to book and am only a few chapters in, however like other books by Stephen Coonts , I am hooked again. If you love avation this book is a must buy. Enjoy."},{"Title":"On Glorious Wings: The Best Flying Stories of the Century","review":"It's clear Coonts has a passion for flight, which can be appreciated by all those who love the genre. Some of the most entertaining parts of the book occur when he introduces the next excerpt; he speaks wonderfully and weaves fantastic images to express a longing for flight. Overall, though, I have to say this book was really only so-so.It's made up of several excerpts from books Coonts has decided are the most intriguing regarding flight (written in the past 100-150 years or so). They cover a wide range of concepts (reflecting the time period they were written in), ranging from hot air ballooning across oceans to a dogfight in outer space with the Soviet Union (obviously, techno-thriller 80s stuff). You're likely to recognize a few of the authors, such as Poe and Dale Brown.In many ways, this book can be seen as a demo disc. I ended up reading it less like a collection, and more like a sampler for other books/authors I'd like to read. Personally, I found some of the excerpts to be rather boring. I did, however, especially enjoy \\"The War in 2020,\\" even as short as it was. And that brings up another point- the excerpts can be rather short. Of course, I understand Coonts was merely looking for the best parts of great novels. However, I still feel that some excerpts could have gone on a little longer, or have been replaced completely by other more flight-indulging ones. I have looked over all the excerpts, but have really only been interested in three or so. All others have more or less failed to capture my imagination.In the end, this truly is only a so-so book. If you are interested in collecting books of the flight genre, I recommend you buy the actual novels then this brief preview of them. I must say, I'm partial to \\"The War in 2020.\\" If you're interested in near-future air tech I highly suggest you look into that book! But back to Coonts. If you're trying to decide between this or something else, I'd say to pass this one up for now."},{"Title":"The Rough Guide to Drum 'n' Bass","review":"I think this book is good, since there are few other books about the subject of drum and bass, there are some glaring mistakes. For some reason they put Air (the French duo) in the drum and bass section and not the Trip-hop, Lounge, Big Beat area. Air clearly falls into the downtempo catagory. Second, in one review they noted that the Exploited wrote the song &quot;City Baby Attacked by Rats&quot; (it's an old hardcore punk rock tune) but it was GBH who did that tune. Bad mistake for a music historian. It also mimics Simon Reynolds book &quot;Ecstasy Generation&quot; too much. The opinions seem to be the same and the way Rough Guide is written also shadows Reynold's book. In addition, there aren't any keys to the symbols for CD or vinyl. I had to figure it out myself. And...some of the recommendations aren't the best samples of the artists' work. Kinda poor way to guide someone through a genre many find confusing. But, like I said, there aren't many more books about D&amp;B out there."},{"Title":"The Rough Guide to Drum 'n' Bass","review":"The Rough Guide to Drum and Bass is a fairly decent book. Flipping through the pages you see a lot of leading names in the scene. In it, you can find some of the people who started the genere. The only thing I was disappointed about in this book was the fact that it's so new and it left out major names like Bad Company, Calyx, Dieselboy, and more. Hopefully there will be another book covering these names and more. Overall, this book was quite informative."},{"Title":"The Rough Guide to Drum 'n' Bass","review":"Good reading, especially if you're a junglist, and got some spare time on your hands. Contains good info on the biggest names in the scene (the british ones). Does include downtempo and trip hop etc. however, so dont be surprised to run into names such as Dj Shadow and Thievery Corporation, towards the end. Also the book names almost each artists' biggest anthems, so why not use these highlighted tracks for your next burned compilation?"},{"Title":"The Rough Guide to Drum 'n' Bass","review":"It was 1999 and I was a freshman in high school. \\"Endtroducing\\" opened up my ears three years prior, the debut UNKLE record was what I was hype about at that time, and the first DJ Krush album mellowed me out. An appreciation and admiration for electronic and sample based music ensued. The only problem was that I was completely unaware of what else to listen to or what to look for next besides the offerings of the Mo' Wax label.On a random trip to Atlantic City with a relative, I browsed through a book store at the Pier Mall and found this book for sale on clearance as the store was going out of business. I was drawn to the title and size. Upon opening, I found pages upon pages of electronic artists, their discography information, and other notes of interest. This thing was like a dossier. In these pages I learned about DJ Vadim, DJ Cam, Double Dee & Steinski, Coldcut, LTJ Bukem, Tricky, Roni Size..pretty much the whole electronic scene at that time. You can imagine how my head was spinning. So many artists to investigate and so many albums to explore!!Although it does have a small share of wrong information (titling Dog Sled Camel Race for DJ Q-Bert's Camel Bobsled Race, haha!), it proved to be a worthwhile investment for me. It was like a textbook and it went everywhere I did. I consider this book as one of my building blocks as it ignited quite a passion for electronic music and its production. It also improved my DJ sets!!I can't find my copy these days but would purchase it again for nostalgic value. It's quite interesting to see how the landscape of electronic music has evolved since I first purchased it."},{"Title":"The Rough Guide to Drum 'n' Bass","review":"Despite the not always perfect genre listings for the artists in this book, it still porvides most all the biographical info that any normal person would want for Drum N Bass and Breakbeat artists and groups, worth the small price."},{"Title":"It Takes a Lot More Than Attitude... To Lead a Stellar Organization","review":"I purchased this book after having read several of Stever Robbins' columns on leadership in a Harvard Business School newsletter. His approach had struck me as practical and on the mark for his audience of (aspiring) effective company leaders.The book is an extension of the newsletters, synthesizing Robbins' learnings from his years of executive counseling into a well-organized and comprehensive how-to approach. Robbins draws on his experiences in a variety of industries and contexts to illustrate his points with real life examples. The book is a good resource for either young managers who aspire to become leaders, newly promoted execs, or those who have been at the top for awhile but feel they could be doing a much better job at it.One caveat is that the book includes quite a lot of material. I think managers should focus on one chapter at a time, incorporating the recommended approaches into one's work week before taking on another chapter. For most readers, this means proceeding in a linear fashion starting with \\"The Rights and Responsibilities of Being at the Top,\\" then tackling the action steps contained in \\"Leading with Vision - Getting Things Done through Other People,\\" and in \\"Staying Organized, Focused and Sane.\\""},{"Title":"It Takes a Lot More Than Attitude... To Lead a Stellar Organization","review":"This book reads very much like an advice column, which is refreshing because the other leadership books I've bought read like science journals. What I liked most was that Stever left the boring case studies out and provided a lot of short but enlightening examples from his experiences as a start-up entrepreneur, technologist, and executive coach. You can pretty much skim this book and learn something about leading people you didn't know before. As someone who makes a living helping people stay organized and focused, I particularly liked the part of the book where Stever offered tips for keeping your head cool and clear when faced with a million deadlines (and Post-it notes). I recommend this book for anyone who runs a company, or plans on running a company in the near future."},{"Title":"It Takes a Lot More Than Attitude... To Lead a Stellar Organization","review":"This approachable book by leadership consultant Stever Robbins is packed with real world examples and practical tips about the people side of leadership. Written in chatty sound bites, it's like having a conversation over coffee with Stever to tap into his insights about how CEO's can do a better job at leading.Each of Stever's stories illustrates an important lesson about how (and how not to) lead. He reveals how one CEO went on vacation while her staff was working overtime on a product launch, while another kept his staff on full pay after a fire leveled the business. His examples communicate essential leadership principles like accepting responsibility, sharing your vision, and creating a culture of mutual respect.As a business coach myself, I found this book filled with valuable material for working with my executive clients. I recognized many of their management faux pas in Stever's pithy stories, and have been able to pass along much of his sage advice to people who badly needed it."},{"Title":"It Takes a Lot More Than Attitude... To Lead a Stellar Organization","review":"Written in a crisp, clear and straightforward style, this book pulls no punches when it comes to defining the moral and ethical responsibilities of leaders.Amongst other things, Stever is an executive coach, President of Leadership Decision Works Inc, entrepreneur and executive trainer at Harvard Business School. He's therefore well qualified to comment on what makes a good or not-so-good leader. He uses real life examples throughout to illustrate key points and to drive home the messages.While other leadership books often give only conceptual information about leadership, this book goes much further and deeper by identifying specific, practical steps you can take to become a better leader. In addition there are thought provoking questions to challenge your current paradigms and down-to-earth recommendations for improving how you lead so that you can get the best out of yourself and your team.I particularly enjoyed Stever's conversational and humourous style of writing. It flows well and his focus on total leadership responsibility means there's no place to hide if things go wrong. The buck stops firmly with you.Stever's holistic approach to both organisational and individual development and learning is like a breath of fresh air to those of us who believe that helping people to stay healthy is a key to organisational wellness.I believe the book will be equally useful to developing leaders as well as those in unofficial leadership roles. Applying the recommendations to how you might \\"lead\\" your life or any community or sporting body is also valid.With 3 parts, 30 short chapters and 163 pages, it's easy to find your way back to those things you've decided to work on first. And no doubt you'll dip into the book regularly to support your journey to leadership excellence."},{"Title":"Reading Assessment and Instruction for All Learners (Solving Problems in the Teaching of Literacy)","review":"This was a mediocre text at best.

I highly recommend this to anyone who finds literacy and instruction of reading a priority."},{"Title":"The case of the lame canary","review":"Background: The stylistic heritage of the Perry Mason mysteries is the American pulp magazines of the 1920s. In the early Mason mysteries, Perry - a good-looking, broad-shouldered, two-fisted, man of action - is constantly stiff-arming sultry beauties on his way to an explosive encounter that precipitates the book's climactic action sequence. In the opening chapters of these stories, Gardner subjects the reader to assertive passages that Mason is a crusader for justice, a man so action-oriented he is constitutionally incapable of sitting in his office and waiting for a case to come to him or to develop on its own once it has - he has to be out on the street, in the midst of the action, making things happen, always on the offensive, never standing pat or accepting being put on the defensive. These narrative passages - nave, embarrassingly crude \\"character\\" development - pop up throughout the early books, stopping the narrative dead in its tracks, and putting on full display a non-writer's worst characteristic: telling the reader a character's traits instead of showing them through action, dialogue, and use of other of the writer's tools.Rating \\"Ground Rules\\": These flaws, and others so staggeringly obvious that enumerating them is akin to using cannons to take out a flea, occur throughout the Gardner books, and can easily be used (with justification) to trash his work. But for this reader they are a \\"given\\", part of the literary terrain, and are not relevant to my assessment of the Gardner books. In other words, my assessments of the Perry Mason mysteries turn a blind eye to Erle Stanley Gardner's wooden, style-less writing, inept descriptive passages, unrealistic dialogue, and weak characterizations. As I've just noted, as examples of literary style all of Gardner's books, including the Perry Mason series, are all pretty bad. Nonetheless, the Mason stories are a lot of fun, offering intriguing puzzles, nifty legal gymnastics, courtroom pyrotechnics, and lots of action and close calls for Perry and crew. Basically, you have to turn off the literary sensibilities and enjoy the \\"guilty\\" pleasure of a fun read of bad writing. So, my 1-5 star ratings (A, B, C, D, and F) are relative to other books in the Gardner canon, not to other mysteries, and certainly not to literature or general fiction.\\"The Case of the Lame Canary\\": A-One of Perry Mason's best early mysteries, \\"The Case of the Lame Canary\\" starts in typical fashion: a visitor to Mason's law office simply wants some advice on a peculiar situation that seems to make him or, more often, her legally vulnerable, but along the way introduces a puzzle that intrigues Mason and serves as the entry point to his involvement in a convoluted murder case. In this instance, Mason is drawn in by the relatively simple puzzle of determining why the canary his client is carrying appears to be lame. And the case that unfolds from this point forward is certainly satisfyingly convoluted.In the \\"Lame Canary\\", Gardner is at his most adept in keeping the story moving and the reader fascinated by an \\"onion skin\\" narrative approach: A puzzling situation is introduced, Perry Mason probes the possibilities, plays a hunch, and pieces together a solution, peeling away one puzzling layer of the mystery - only to introduce another puzzling layer that conceals yet another puzzler that conceals.... Gardner is very adept at peeling away one layer at a time, carefully leading the reader through the logic that Perry Mason uses to get at the truth. And at the same time, preserving through each revelation the one tangled fabric of suspicion, of condemning evidence, that, as the story progresses, seems to be forming a tight noose that is a perfect fit for the neck of Perry's client.Gardner uses this narrative approach a number of times in the early books, when his fertile imagination was generating innumerable puzzles and clues to their solutions. In \\"The Lame Canary\\", many little mysteries are cleared up as the evidence gets uncovered, holding the reader's interest and at the same time seeming to leave the final solution tantalizingly close at hand.A solid mystery, from simple beginning through complex situations and conspiracies to the surprising yet plausible conclusion. A must-read for Gardner's Perry Mason fans who want to see their protagonist in top form."},{"Title":"The case of the lame canary","review":"This case opens with a potential client in Mason's office with a canary suffering from a sore foot. The story is so odd that Mason agrees to take the case, even though it a divorce case, something he has pledged to avoid. This begins a very convoluted tale of deception, murder, snoops and the usual Mason actions on the edge of the law. There is also a continuing subplot involving Mason and his confidential secretary Della Street planning for an around the world romantic cruise. While Mason concentrates on his case, Della works on the cruise, occasionally reminding him that they are booked and the joys of the places they will visit.It comes down to Mason must either resolve the case quickly or give up the cruise and fail in his promise to Della. In true Mason fashion, he \\"unmasks\\" the culprit in a dramatic courtroom scene and he and Della dash madly to the dock, arriving only a few minutes before departure. In true Street fashion, Della has already provided for their luggage to be on board the ship. Once they are safely aboard and out at sea, Mason proposes to Della. Her answer is true Della and to learn what it was, you must read the ending."},{"Title":"The case of the lame canary","review":"The Case of the Lame CanaryA woman has urgent business with Perry Mason. Rita Swaine brought along a caged canary with a sore foot. She tells Perry about the problem her twin sister has with her new husband Walter Prescott, and the money he has taken from her sister Rosalind. Rosalind has been seeing her old boyfriend Jimmy Driscoll, and Rosalind's husband has threatened her. Rita explains the problem that happened that morning. The case intrigues Perry, so he agrees to take the case. Rita tells of an accident that happened around noon. Perry calls Paul Drake to investigate Walter Prescott, his business associate, the snoopy neighbors, and the man injured in that accident. Perry learns of trouble at the Prescott home (Chapter Three). Perry and Paul question the neighbors about the accident, and learn the homicide squad was at the Prescott house. The dialogue is an interesting as some trial scenes (Chapter Four).The man injured in the accident has left the hospital, and can't be located. Perry and Paul visit Harry Trader, who drove the truck that was in that accident. Trader will tell them little, except it was the other driver's fault (Chapter Five). Perry and Della Street fly to Reno to locate Rita Swaine. They also find Rosalind Prescott and Jimmy Driscoll. Perry gets the complete story from Rosalind. Della calls to warn about the police, so Perry can call the telephone operator to report their presence. Perry gives good advice to his clients (Chapter Seven). Paul Drake tracks down \\"Carl Packard\\", who was injured in that accident; he can't be found. Perry learns he was an insurance detective who investigated fire-bugs connected with an arson ring (Chapter Eight)!The Coroner holds an inquest and establishes that Walter Prescott was murdered with a pistol, the bullets came from Jimmy Driscoll's gun that was left with Rosalind Prescott (Chapter Ten). This makes Rita Swaine the last person in the house when Walter Prescott was alive. Now Rita tells Perry more about what happened that day. She found Walter Prescott dead when she arrived after Rosalind and Jimmy had left the house! Perry will have a difficult job defending Rita; she withheld evidence from the police. Perry gives her good advice as to her conduct in jail. Paul Drake calls Perry to tell him \\"Carl Packard\\" has been found, but will never testify in court.In Chapter Fourteen Perry tries to imagine what could have happened. Paul Drake drops in to tell that Rita has confessed to what she found when she arrived at the Prescott house. When Perry learns that Walter Prescott's secretary is moving to Reno he comes up with an idea involving the shipping of luggage from Rita Swaine's apartment! This brings out Sergeant Holcomb to investigate. The Coroner holds another inquest into Jason Braun's death. One witness says he wants to leave because he was injured. Perry makes a suggestion, so Dr. Wallace examines a witness on the stand. A commotion breaks out, and a shocking surprise results. Perry's client will be released (Chapter Fifteen). Perry explains it all to Della Street while driving to the harbor for a well-deserved vacation. [The solution reminds me of Graham Greene's \\"The Third Man\\".]"},{"Title":"Amplitude: New and Selected Poems","review":"She has a voice I've never heard before that I've needed to hear for a long, long time.

Paul decides to step in to protect his secret family from a chain of events which would threaten the peace and security of all of them.One would have to have read all of the preceding books in this series to fully appreciate this one and, as it flowed well, enough was filled in to understand where the characters were coming from.

They overlapped a bit but each was a great story and then I found that a concluding book to the series was still out there and Amazon was able to get me a copy of Harvest which is really out of print. Each one was wonderful because Belva Plain is a good story teller. I know you would enjoy the whole series. They can all still be bought. That is the nice thing about Amazon because they have contacts to get so much that you couldn't get by going into a book shop."},{"Title":"Harvest","review":"I have been an Amazon customer for years. I LOVE THE REVIEWS from ordinary people. I used to read the 5-stars most. NOW, I look to the lesser star reviews. Why ? Because so many times I would read a thumbs down review, and think: \\" Surely it can't be that bad, I KNOW this author's work \\".I would then purchase it, (more times than not), and would totally or partially agree with them. So I said that to preface my critique of the beloved Belva Plain's last novel HARVEST.Belva is one of my favorite authors, and in ways, I believe that good authors were prevalent more in Belva's time writing, than in this time (2012) . I do think though, that she, because of her age and illness, had a ghost writer, or publicist/friend who aided her in this last little novel.I began with Evergreen ( my all time favorite novel ...ever ), and was delighted to have her bring loose ends together with remaining family members of the original story. I thought the book was, to be kind, hurried. But then I am used to Belva novels, that were GIANT SAGA'S that you jumped in to, covered up with an afghan, sipped your coffee (with cream), while your dog rested his head on your legs..and lived inside the book with Belva's characters. Oh the fun ! With every book, you could not wait for the next in line !! And HARVEST was a surprise and a welcome one. For THAT reason, I am so glad I have it in my library. I thought the last part was classic Belva, and I read it several times at the end. BUT.................Oh how I wish from the ending...she would have continued on, because she could have.Don't hesitate to order this book !!! It is a lovely story even if you aren't familiar with the beginning of the saga. If you have read them, you will enjoy the completion like I did, and be grateful for author's like Belva Plain.GO TO THE RIGHT HAND COLUMN AND ORDER FROM THE USED BOOK STORES, EVERGREEN, AND THE FOLLOWING BOOKS OF THE SAGA. Those book stores have books in beautiful shape, for pennies/shipping ! I am ordering EVERGREEN from one of them just to have it in my library and I will force my granddaughter's to read it and give me a book report !!! LOL !MY 3 stars are only because I judged it against the early books of Belva's in this family saga."},{"Title":"Harvest","review":"I received this book in the promised delivery time however the book was in very poor condition.

At the time, I remember thinking that probably the librarian had never read it, otherwise she would have removed it from the children's section of the library! It was definitely nothing like anything else I had ever read, and I still remember it clearly. You know it has to be memorable, since I am now 61 and just happened to be thinking about it again. I decided to Google it, which came up with this Amazon listing."},{"Title":"Jexium Island","review":"Back in the early 60's, this book, translated from French, was totally unlike any of the other kids' books ... with the possible exception of \\"The Horse Without a Head,\\" which was also originally in French. The typical book for the 8 to 12 or 10 to 14-year-old reader in those days was about middle-class kids in a family, who usually had adventures after moving to an old house in the country (as in \\"The Four-Story Mistake\\" or \\"Gone-Away Lake\\" or \\"Magic By the Lake\\" even \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\"). These were terrific books. But \\"Jexium Island\\" was something else again. Serge Micar, the protagonist, is a foundling alone, in a part of France far from the glamour of Paris, and there's no cosy ending where we find out his parentage. He smokes cigarettes! He stows away on a cargo ship and ends up getting involved with secret agents! and gangsters! and guns!Most significantly, this is the earliest kids' book that I know of, long before the advent of the Holocoaust novel genre, that actually involves a concentration camp. In this camp, you are killed when you reach puberty. Scary scary stuff, especially as the intended reader is just that age. The camp actually seems charming - a society of kids without adults - until you realize what is going on.This book deserves to be back in print, and to be included in middle-school reading curricula. (The cigarette smoking is a little bit of a problem ...)Also - the frontispiece by the great William Pene du Bois (of \\"Lion\\" fame) is magnificent. I realized after finding biographical information about the artist (the son of French artist Guy Pene du Bois) that this is actually a portrait of the illustrator's sister."},{"Title":"Jexium Island","review":"I first read this book in elementary school and was completely fascinated by the topic. Its one of the books I always wanted to find for my own children to read, and tho they are grown now, I hope they will find it as interesting as I did, and hand it down to their children someday.The story takes place in France with our young hero, Serge, who is searching for his lost sister. He falls in with a young man who helps him get to Jexium Island where his sister is being held captive, altho she has no memory of him or home. The story goes on to tell of her rescue and that of the other children on the island."},{"Title":"Jexium Island","review":"I am 63 and was recently thinking what was my favorite childhood book.

I can see I was not alone in loving this book. I remember being haunted by it as a child and thinking even back then that it was the best book I had ever read.I am going to order it for old time sakes and pass it on to my grandchildren."},{"Title":"Jexium Island","review":"Like the other reviewers, I first read this book about 50 years ago and have never forgotten it. My Mom brought it home from the library when I was about 12 (smart lady). It was so different from Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys books (that I filched from my brother). I was lucky enough to find a copy of this book when I was in my 20's so I have read it often, as I have grown up. And it never seems to lose its charm, danger, romance, excitement and above all, mystery. One thing I do not understand, the plot twists and revelations at the end do seem to indicate that there might have been room for at least one sequel, but I have never been able to find one. That's too bad, as I would, even today, be very interested in reading one if it exists. This was one of those books that took the reader away to a completely new world in its pages. I hope young readers will always be able to lose themselves in the worlds of their authors' creations for ages to come."},{"Title":"Jexium Island","review":"Published (only once, as far as I can tell) in 1957, this children's \\"chapter book\\" rocked my world as a young reader used to (and growing bored with) Trixie Belden, the Hardy Boys, Freddy the Pig, et al. Here, suddenly, were kids kidnapped en mass, a mysterious fog-shrouded island, a bizarre world of kids on their own and yet tethered to what amounted to slave labor, a concentration camp featuring starvation and disease, precursors to the modern-day super spies, a genuine sense of peril (though the only deaths are ultimately suffered by bad guys, albeit at the hands of gun-toting kids!), chemically-induced amnesia, and, at the center of it all, a worthy hero in the form of a young boy whom one could easily identify with. I read this book from our local library back in Salinas, California when about 10 years old or so and never forgot it, though I did forget the title. I would describe the plot from time to time to friends, but never found another person who had read it. Finally, a librarian at our local library where we now lived undertook the challenge and came back to me weeks later with the title, \\"Jexium Island.\\" We couldn't find a library that (a) had this book and (b) was willing to loan it long distance, but I found it here via Amazon.

First, it is very rare and unique--a must for comic collectors and afficiandos. Second, it is a prime example of Nixon propaganda. Third, but most important, it was illustrated by the great Geo Wildman!Wildman, a lifelong resident of Connecticut, studied advertising at what is now the Paire College of Art. During the 1950s, he was a successful commercial artist, first working for an ad agency, and then becoming a freelance artist. During this time, he began producing freelance comic book art for Charlton Press in Derby, Connecticut.When King Comics ceased publication of their POPEYE title, Charlton acquired the rights. Longtime writer-artist Bud Sagendorf was busy with the daily and Sunday newspaper comics, and declined the job of continuing. George Wildman was offered a contract to produce the POPEYE illustrations, with prolific Joe Gill writing scripts. The first Charlton issue of POPEYE appears in 1969, the final one in 1977. Wildman was hired as assistant editor to Sal Gentile, and in 1971 was promoted to managing editor, and eventually executive editor. Assistant editor Nicola Cuti wrote several of the later POPEYE scripts for Charlton.Wildman's tenure as editor continued through 1985, while Western Publishing picked up POPEYE under their Gold Key and/or Whitman trademarks. Bill Pearson, by then assistant editor at Charlton, began writing scripts, and Wildman produced illustrations while off-duty from Charlton. Their crowning achievement was the epic 50th anniversary special published in 1979.Thanks to the Robert Altman POPEYE movie, a demand for Popeye-related merchandise led to Wildman's working for Random House, illustrating a classic \\"Pop-Up Book\\" which became a best-seller and later a display at the Smithsonian Institution. Wildman was also invited to produce a painted wooden Easter egg for the White House Easter event, his egg also now housed in the Smithsonian. Around this time, the National Cartoonists Society awarded him \\"Best Cartoonist, Humor Division.\\"Western Publishing ceased its comics line in the early 1980s, and Wildman retired from Charlton Comics in 1985, moving into a freelance comic book and children's book illustration career. His pencils, inks and paints graced publications featuring Disney, Hanna-Barbara, Harvey and Warner Brothers characters along with countless designs for various businesses.In 1994, George and wife Trudy Wildman were honored in a gala festival in Chester, Illinois, celebrating the 100th birthday of the creator of Popeye, Elzie Crisler Segar. Wildman received the Popeye Fan Club's Lifetime Achievement Award and performed a sketching show to a standing-room-only crowd. A return visit to Chester in 2004, to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Popeye, found Wildman teamed with Hy Eisman, the writer-artist of the Sunday POPEYE newspaper strip since 1994.Today, Wildman and son Karl operate their own advertising agency, producing computer animation, greeting cards, and a wide variety of products. Wildman's work is seen regularly in the \\"Hidden Pictures\\" publications of HIGHLIGHTS FOR CHILDREN. He celebrated his 80th birthday in 2007 and continues to receive mail from Popeye fans around the world."},{"Title":"Moksha Smith: Agni's Warrior-Sage: An Epic of the Immortal Fire New Edition","review":"There is, as the title suggests, a fire within, a fire without, and it is also within this book. It is written in a simple and self-effacing style that does not point the way for others, but simply shares something of life lived with a great desire for the Whole of things. The rhythm of the prose poetry is not self-conscious, but rather invites us to be more deeply a participant in our own personal living. We too have had such desires to be part of a great wholeness; maybe we have forgotten them. A book like this can awaken such desires even long buried since our childhood. Professor Antonio di Nicolas writes so that the shift between personal and universal abolishes the distinction between the two. Transcendence is found in quite ordinary life where even amongst our chores we can find the love that moves the stars.For those in search of a book which does not preach but simply shares what is probably already our own, it can be a book with light on our sometimes darkened footsteps. You can take from this book what you need without being offended."},{"Title":"Moksha Smith: Agni's Warrior-Sage: An Epic of the Immortal Fire New Edition","review":"Antonio de Nicolas, the philosopher and poet, has written a very original epic based on his own life experience.

The authors, both with distinguished writing credits, have exercised a great deal of self-control and produced a swift-paced, always-interesting tale that, in addition to revealing crimes old and new, conveys a handsome sense of place--central Pennsylvania not far from John O'Hara country--and contains absolutely superb ethnic dialog. There can be no question about one thing--the authors have the art of listening down pat. They know how human beings sound when they speak--but they also understand how to convey that speech on the page, which is not quite the same thing. Well-paced and neatly-structured, the book qualifies as first-rate entertainment...but there's a bit more to it, as well. The hero of this book is a gifted craftsman--and the authors are gifted craftsmen, as well. I look forward to future novels by these two veterans."},{"Title":"Coals of Fire","review":"Reading Coals of Fire was exhilarating entertainment. In fact, the book ended too quickly, not because the plot was incomplete (it was consummately Aristotelian in that regard), but rather because I missed not having the next evening's installment to look forward to.I was particularly impressed with the authors' skill in the mechanics of deploying dialogue. The dialogue cues in Coals of Fire are entirely natural, so that spoken words blend in unobtrusively, giving the reader the impression that he or she is eavesdropping on actual conversations. This feat is easy to describe but devilishly difficult to accomplish in practice.This is a fine suspenseful yarn, told by two pros who are very good at what they are doing. The shuffled-deck plot construction, whereby chapter topics leap around with regard to time, place, character, and circumstance, works beautifully. At first it appears that the shifts occur willy-nilly, but it soon becomes evident that the disparate strands are interwoven according to a deliberate narrative design that sustains suspense even as it gradually converges on a shocking conclusion.Coals of Fire is set among the Pennsylvania Dutch Mennonite community. The result is a tale with all the suspense of a conventional thriller, enriched by the edifying overtones of Holocaust angst and the ambivalencies of a Mennonite society confronting the barbarities of modern secular culture. To reveal the conclusion would spoil the story, but we can note that it culminates the search by a contemporary Nazi-hunter who, having finally cornered an aging agent of the Holocaust, is forced to take his revenge in a way that neither he nor the readers could anticipate.Strongly recommended for those who like their suspense fiction with a lagniappe of contemplation."},{"Title":"Coals of Fire","review":"I enjoyed this fast-paced mystery.

The author keeps you guessing at every page and delivers an intense ending that ties together a diverse group of characters.My favorite aspect of this book was how it made me feel about the characters. Some were clearly good, and some clearly bad. How these characters interacted with more 'conflicted' characters made the book quite interesting to me."},{"Title":"Coals of Fire","review":"Into a community in the Pennsylvania valleys that set itself apart from this world by religion, customs, and language, the world intrudes. It enters with frightening echoes of the great horror of the century, the Holocaust. A rich texture of folklore, imagery, and language marks the lively dialogue and description. The seed of mystery, authentic and powerful, growa and makes for a tale full of surprises right to the last page. For goodness sake don't peek!"},{"Title":"White Boys & River Girls","review":"I knew the author and her family well. This lovely book abounds with the sensitivity and acute perception which has doubtless been the cause of some personal anguish over the years. These stories are exquisitely crafted, their perfectly chosen words and phrasing serving to pull the reader intimately into the characters. Paula has a way of striking a resonant emotional chord within her readers. These stories are well worth reading...and rereading."},{"Title":"White Boys & River Girls","review":"Paula K.

I appreciate his enthusiasm for this subject and the thrilling, and occasionally tantalizing, antecdotes of spice history.

The book enriched my travels there and helped me identify the nuances in the cuisines."},{"Title":"Spice: The History of a Temptation","review":"The day I picked this book was the day I was really very happy. And spices, over the years, have made lot of people very happy indeed. Partly due to the business opportunities they brought, partly to the change of lifestyle for millions of people worldwide for thousands of years. Off course, Europe lagged far behind in the spice race early on due to non-availability and later, due to high costs of the spices in the continent.On the other side of the globe, in India and East Asia, spices have remained a staple diet for thousands of years. No wonder then that Asians have known the secrets of these spices more than any other nation. And, by virtue of being conquerors, Arabs soon became the middle men and the main traders of spices from India and East Asia to Italian provinces. The magnificent buildings you see today in Venice and nearby areas are primarily due to the wealth these spice traders earned during Middle ages.This book charts the decline of Arabs as middleman and the rise of Portuguese, Spanish and English as leaders in spice trading from India via sea route. I consider this book as very balanced and very thorough. A more important book on spice trade and importance is hard to imagine. Also, the production of the book is of very high quality."},{"Title":"Spice: The History of a Temptation","review":"It took a bit longer to finish because the print is so small, but I think it's because his writing is jam-packed with anecdotes that will make you laugh aloud! So many little tidbits, and I love how he has so much about the ancient world and early middle ages. Fascinating! His writing, while a bit on the wordy side, is great, witty, and fun.I can't wait for his next book, whatever the topic may be."},{"Title":"Spice: The History of a Temptation","review":"One of my favorite things to read is the history of something coupled with great story telling. This book achieves that in a more comprehensive way than most schlocky templated airport books and more entertainingly than a dry books written by true academic experts on a given subject.The author will drop lines like \\"So this voyage around the world was paid for by some cloves\\"...I'm paraphrasing, but that line sticks out as one that reflects how the author will recount a holistic angle of some historical occurrences, and then boil it down to such a satisfying line.I definitely recommend this book for night reading or an airplane read. Some parts of the book are less interesting depending on what parts of history you like best."},{"Title":"Spice: The History of a Temptation","review":"This book was bought as a gift for a family member.

Much of the book deals with the spice races of the 1400s and 1500s and the impact on the world and on Europe's rising power. Other sections deal with spices and their roles in history, cooking, romance, politics, religion, and war. The book is not arranged chronologically but instead in broad categories devoted to spices' various uses.Turner is scholarly but also witty and informal in his writing. You will learn a lot and also have a lot of fun while reading his book."},{"Title":"Spice: The History of a Temptation","review":"Three thousand years after one of the greatest of Egypt's pharaohs, Ramses II, was embalmed and put into his tomb, he was discovered to have a couple of peppercorns up his nose. This was in some ways unsurprising. The Egyptians used all sorts of spices to preserve the body so that the soul might wander back into it. But regarded historically, this is an astonishing use of pepper; the peppercorns were not any African species, not anything Ramses's lands had grown. The only source at the time was the tropical south of India; there must have been a previously unsuspected direct or circuitous trade route between the regions. No details about the route can now be known, except that it was part of the lucrative spice trade that for centuries powered economies and exploration. In _Spice: The History of a Temptation_ (Knopf), Jack Turner includes the story of the first known consumer of pepper along with hundreds of other facts as a way of looking at a part of human history that was vital and has been influential into our own times, but is now merely curious. Spices are high on the list of goods that have made the modern world.Spices were costly and mysterious, and people thought that they came from Paradise itself, the place in the East from which Adam and Eve had been banished. It was to gain spices that Columbus sailed, and spices he did bring back, but they were disappointments; that did not stop the continued search for them, and the resultant expansion of the world. Turner shows that spices were not really used to help make old meat palatable; fresh meat was cheaper than spices. But they were used to improve wine, a use that became unnecessary after bottle and cork technology came in the sixteenth century. Though spices were not really responsible for warding off decomposition, they were thought vital for warding off disease. In medieval medical logic, sweet fragrances might drive off the bad vapors, and spices (most thought of as hot and dry) might drive off a cold (thought of as a disease of cold and wet). Millions of spam e-mails every day are sent to tell how to enlarge male sexual equipment; those who believe in such cures would do well to invest in the simpler, cheaper, and just as effective formulas given here from the chapter of the ancient treatise, _The Perfumed Garden_, \\"Prescriptions for Increasing the Dimension of Small Members and Making Them Splendid\\" The priapic value of spices is just one reason the church has had wildly ambivalent notions about them. There is scriptural documentation that the God of the Bible likes to be sent good smells, as have many gods before him, but Turner's quotations from theologians indignant over the eagerness of their parishioners (and, gasp, their clerics) to partake in spicy foods are among the most amusing parts of the book.Ministers just don't care anymore about the theological implications of spicy food. The reduction of their interest in such things parallels the reduction in importance of spice as a focus of world economic effort. It became easier to import spices, and more importantly, it was possible to transplant them to places where it was easy to turn them into simple cash crops on farms. In medieval times, the rich showed off by giving feasts that had every course heavily spiced, but jewelry and houses (for instance) eventually filled the role of ostentatious consumption. When spices became cheap, it became a virtue to use just a little of them, and that to bring out inherent flavors in the main ingredients. When anyone could purchase them, spices lost not only economic cachet, but also the sort of mystical qualities that, say, Columbus sailed for. While it lasted, the fuss about spices made history and created our world as it is now; Turner's book is splendid at explaining what all the centuries of fuss were about."},{"Title":"Spice: The History of a Temptation","review":"There are already several very detailed reviews here about this book, so I'll avoid repeating what they said. I'll just add my four-star rating by saying that this is a surprisingly interesting and easy to read book, given the fact that the main topic is not something one might expect to be particularly captivating. But Turner's excellent writing style, combined with an amazing amount of research spanning several topics from history to religion, makes this a thoroughly enjoyable book from front to back. The only reason I didn't give it a full five stars was that, if anything, it's a bit too long and spends too much time going into excrutiating detail on minor points. I think the author could have shortened this book by nearly a hundred pages and still achieved the full effect he intended. However, he certainly does present an exhaustive discussion of this topic and I am amazed at how much I learned. One final note: Perusing through the bibliography after I finished, I was utterly astonished at the volume of research the author did for this book. I cannot imagine how much time he spent putting together this delightful book, though I'm certainly thankful for his efforts."},{"Title":"Spice: The History of a Temptation","review":"Spice, The History of a Temptation by Jack Turner is a very well written history of the spice trade, written in the popular history mode. A tremendous amount of research must have gone into this work as it is absolutely filled with little gems of detail and wonderful small side stories. There are a number of other books out there that deal with this subject. A recent one, Dangerous Tastes by Andrew Dalby comes to mind, but the work being reviewed here, unlike so many of the others, including the aforementioned, is not an imposing tome which reads more like a doctorial dissertation, than a readable story. If I want sleep, I can always increase my exercise or simply take some sort of pill. I read books such as this for information and to be entertained. They go hand in hand. With Spice I got just what I wanted.With this work the author has given us a very readable history of spices and the spice trade, starting from the beginning dating back to ancient Egypt and beyond. Of course the majority of the book is rather Eurocentric, but hey, that is where the author was educated, did his research and wrote the book. I suppose if you want a history such as this that is not Eurocentric, then you should probably find a non European author! Anyway, the author has discussed at length the impact spice has had upon world civilization. It was the prime motivator during the Age of Discovery and of course an undeniable pillar of Western Civilization along with quite a number of other civilizations throughout history. Today we have oil; in days gone by we had spice!The author's organization of the book is different, but once you get use to it, it does make sense. At times he will bounce around just a bit, from country to country; from civilization to civilization. This is good though as it allows the reader to grasp the magnitude of both time and distance in the saga of the spice trade and just what it means to us.This book does a very nice job of covering the various uses of spice throughout the ages, some of which include being used as currency, embalming, food, in religious ceremonies, sexual aids and as excuses to start some very nasty little wars. He does address the culinary uses of spices by various peoples from around the world and at different times at length and in particular dwells in the Middle Ages which is an era of special interest to me. I found his comments and observation of the diets of various people quite fascinating and he has done well to dispel some of the myths that have grown up around this area. This is something that is long over due.All in all, a delightful read. If I have one complaint, and it is a very minor complaint, I did not that in some of the chapters the author was a bit repetitious. This is not a major problem, as of course I am not the sharpest knife in the drawer, so perhaps the repetition was good for me. I very much recommend this one for a good and very informative read."},{"Title":"Spice: The History of a Temptation","review":"About half way into this book, the tsunami of December 2004 hit the Indian ocean region bringing destruction to many of the places I had been reading of. Jack Turner has taken on a big topic, not merely a culinary treatise, but an overview of colonialism, folklore, religious dogma and cultural evolution. This is a feast of a book, rich with quotes from obscure (and not so obscure) sources.Turner's ability to follow the path of spices from their earliest known beginnings to today's trendy eating is apparent from the first pages to the last.Turner also writes with a sense of humor, something not always included in scholarly works.For any cook, any lover of history, student of colonial power and politics and anyone just interested in the evolving perceptions of culture, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"Spice: The History of a Temptation","review":"\`Spice - The History of a Temptation' by historian Jack Turner is a work of cultural and culinary history which is \`culinary' in much the same sense as the writings of M.F.K. Fisher are not about cooking, but about hunger or desire for food. History of food is not as useful to the average amateur cook as food science, but ignorance of food history can lead to misstatements about food as easily as ignorance of food science can lead to misstatements about how cooking works. One of my most fascinating observations in my reading of several books on Medieval and Renaissance cooking was the pervasive appearance of spices in recipes from the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries. And, this prevalence was not only in the Mediterranean, but also as far north as England and Scandinavia. Conventional wisdom regarding modern cuisine says that the cookie spices (cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and ginger) are common in savory dishes of the southernmost reaches of Europe such as Sicily, Crete, and Greece plus the great Renaissance trading ports such as Venice. Yet, here we have French kings and nobles in Paris using as much of these spices as the merchant kings of Venice and Genoa.Our author and scholar answers this question and a lot more in this delightfully written and thoroughly researched book. Mr. Turner's writing may not be up to the level of M.F.K. Fisher, but it is every bit as good as the quality of writing in the typical journalism in depth pieces which appear regularly in The New Yorker. We can thank the wisdom of the editors at Knopf for giving us an excellent work of popular history on a subject which turns up now and then on food shows such as \`Molto Mario' and Alton Brown's \`Good Eats'.One piece of conventional wisdom that the author dispels is the claim that spices were used to mask the bad taste and odor of spoiling food. In fact, it is much more logical to believe that food preservation by drying and salting was far advanced by 1200 CE The problem was not with spoiled food as with dull, salty, dry food in the winter. And, this problem was primarily a problem of the rich. Before 1600, the diet of the wealthy landowner was based almost exclusively on meat, preferably game. Fruits were avoided except as themselves a type of spice, since they were thought to be the source of undesirable humors. Vegetables were avoided as being the food for the common folk. This happens to be an eminent confirmation of the description of modern European cuisine, especially Italian cuisine, which is heavily vegetarian, as the cuisine of poverty.So, the oriental spices were commonly used widely throughout Europe to liven food. And, my reading of aforementioned Medieval and Renaissance cookbooks with recipes from England and France confirms that these spices were used in virtually every dish. While much of the use was done to enliven salty, dry meats, an equal attraction of these spices, including pepper and citrus fruits was simply because they were rare and expensive. This situation is almost identical to the great interest in tulips in the 17th and 18th centuries, when people would pay the price of a comfortable house simply to own a single unusual tulip bulb. And, spices were expensive because they were almost all available from a very few south Asian islands, appropriately named the \`Spice Islands'. And, as we all know, this was one of the major forces behind the Age of Discovery which opened with the voyages of Italian Christopher Columbus to the West and Portuguese Vasco da Gama to the South and East. Turner covers the relative success of these two explorers in some detail, but this book is about the spices, not about the explorers.While my interest is primarily culinary, the book devotes two sizable chapters to spices used as perfumes and medicines as, for example, aphrodisiacs, and spices used as aids to spiritual rituals, as spices in incense censors. Both of these chapters maintain the high level of scholarship and readability. The author also covers in detail the roles of the Portuguese, the Dutch, the French, and the English in the struggle to control the spice trade. That the Dutch won this explains the tact that much of Indonesia was once a Dutch colony.So, if, as the author thoroughly explains, spices have been transplanted around the world and are now much cheaper than they once were, why are they not even more commonly used than they were 500 years ago? Two reasons for the drop in spice interest are evident in their original attraction. If spices are much less rare, they are less interesting as a medium of conspicuous consumption. This interest, along with the interests of merchants, moved on to gold, jewels, furs, tea, and coffee. Also, the rise of better methods of food preservation lowered the need for spices to perk up dull meats. This was joined by a rising interest in the nobility for vegetables in their diets, prompted by Renaissance cooking writers (see \`The Art of Cooking' by Martino of Como). But, the most interesting reason for the disappearance of the infatuation in the rich with Asian spices was the arrival of foods from the New World, most especially coffee, chocolate, tobacco, and the capsicum peppers or chiles. I was immensely pleased by the author's statement that the strength of heat from these little New World lovelies simply blew Asian black, white, and green peppers clear out of the water. Their cultivation spread so fast that some Europeans even thought they originated in Asia, since they grew so well in any reasonably hospitable climate.If you are keen on having a good understanding of culinary history, you must read this book. If you just happen to like history, you will enjoy every page and wish there were more. I look forward to scholar Turner's next book!"},{"Title":"Spice: The History of a Temptation","review":"I found this book while writing a term paper on the impact of spices. Spice: THoaT stands out among both popular and academic style books on spices with its colourful diction, its intense focus and most of all with its exhaustive research. Turner's bibliography was just as helpful as his other content. For the majority of readers, those who aren't doing research, I still recommend it heartily. Spices are absolutely fascinating, and Turner chows down on their history without using phrases like I have in the title of this review. Another strong work in the same vein is Nathaniel's Nutmeg by Giles Milton. Unlike THoaT, NN has a central story and a narrow focus, but it covers similar ground and is also a good read. I got an A on my paper, and Spice: The History of a Temptation gets an A+. Turner is thorough in his research, and deft in his presentation."},{"Title":"Spice: The History of a Temptation","review":"\\"Salt and Ground Pepper to taste.\\" Opening cookbooks at random it isn't hard to find such variations on that theme in dozens of recipes. But in the not too distant past ground pepper and other spices were used in quantities far greater than our pinch today. Jack Turner writes in, Spice: The History Of A Temptation, an intriguing history of something that is now almost pass&eacute;. Though the word, \\"spice\\" is still used to described something exotic or foreign it has more often retained its erotic overtones. Spices once represented more than mere culinary enhancers. The history of their trade and uses has been the topic of other books. But Turner brings to the table a fun and informative look at the world when spice could be found in the bedroom, the physicians medicine cabinet, the counting house, and the pantry. His sense of humor is evident even in his chapter headings - \\"The Regicidal Lamprey and the Deadly Beaver\\" and \\"Afterward; or, How to Make a Small Penis Splendid.\\"Open up nearly anyone's pantry, or cabinets, and they are likely to have at least black pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger - perhaps even cardamom and clove. It is hard to imagine that even the small quantities in the bottles sold at the typical grocery store represent year's worth of earnings to the common laborer just a few hundred years ago. Turner's book gives a sense of the hold that spices held on the imagination of ancient and medieval minds. Indeed, it was to find a new route to the Indies that Columbus and Magellan set sail - it isn't too far-fetched to suggest that the spice trade to some degree fueled the Age of Discovery. That until recently clove grew on only five volcanic islands in the Far East in some measure gives us a sense of just how exotic and foreign it once was. The journey to Europe could take as much a year, with the spices passing through many hands - Indian, Arab, Italian, etc. Clove and nutmeg inspired many myths and legends about their cultivation in fantastic lands. But even their rarity doesn't entirely explain the covetousness they inspired in many. Sometimes at odds with this rarity - the consequence being that most could never hope to afford even small quantities - is the ubiquity with which they appear in medicine, religion, sex, and cookery. Even Turner admits that it is difficult to understand all of this looking back from a distance of several hundred years, and the vast cultural divide that has opened between us and our forebears.The value of spices to the medieval world is evident in their laws and even in the methods used to deceive buyers. Merchants adulterating their stock of spice could be executed. More revealing is that some merchants bloated their spices by adding shavings of silver. Perhaps most revealing of all is that many were willing to risk life and limb in the long dangerous trek to purchase spices at their source. Spices were even used as diplomatic incentives when suing for peace or bargaining for favors.Though spices were used in greater quantities than at present, Turner largely dispels the myth that they were used to mask the taste of rancid food: \\"Anyone willing to believe that medieval Europe lived on a diet of spiced and rancid meat has never tried to cover the taste of advanced decomposition with spices\\" - whether from experience or research he doesn't say. Besides, spices were vastly more expensive than cheap meat. Still, there is some truth to the matter. The preservation of meat was largely accomplished by using salt, resulting in dry chewy meat that often required soaking and prolonged cooking before being eaten. Spices helped make preserved meat more edible. Wine deteriorated rapidly once the cask had been opened. Between the freshness of a just opened cask and the acidity of one opened a few days before the taste of the wine could be \\"refreshed\\" with spices. In time spiced wine was in demand no matter the freshness.Though you wont find detailed statistics and maps of trade routes throughout history you will find an engaging look at how pervasive spices once were. Turner's history is fun to read and for those who want more information the obligatory list of sources can be found at the end of the book. He is the type of historian I wish I had been introduced to earlier in life. I'll be on the look-out for more books by this author."},{"Title":"Spice: The History of a Temptation","review":"Jack Turner's book has been showered with unusual advance praise ('a brilliant, original history of the spice trade'), but its content is of rather mixed quality. The Introduction alone contains numerous errors, beginning with a reference to cloves in Syria 3,700 years (briefly published 20 years ago, but never substantiated) and an incorrect description of a nutmeg (the author failed to notice that nutmeg is not 'surrounded' by the mace, but sits inside a shell). For all the hard work the author put into this, too often he falls for the spectacular and exaggerated in a 'sex-sells' history of spices. While it makes for entertaining reading, it cannot be relied on as a balanced or scholarly piece of work. In contrast, I would recommend Andrew Dalby's 'Dangerous Tastes - The history of spices' - maybe a trifle less thrilling, but written with far greater competence."},{"Title":"Spice: The History of a Temptation","review":"This is a good intro book, but it could certainly be better. The main problems with this book is that it is completely and totally Euro-centric. We have absolutely no idea what people outside of Europe did with spices or with the goods we traded them for the spices. Spices were, however, a major engine of world trade and economic growth in the 'Age of Exploration', something the author uses as a justification to study spices in general. But then the study narrows into the uses of spices in Europe, and leaves the 'big picture' of world history, except to mention the trade being responsible for the Black Death.Towards the end, the book also becomes a little repetitive. For example, first we learn that the Romans used spices to embalm the dead, then we learn that medieval Europeans also used spices to embalm the dead. This covers two chapters, which could easily be covered in one. There are other examples of this. So, in general, it's a good book, but it could be shorter and better."},{"Title":"Spice: The History of a Temptation","review":"This book contains a tremendous amount of interesting information...but I think it's poorly organized and thus repetitive.

As a collector of books, and a reader, one must thank Jack Turner for spending a significant portion of his life and time to research and write this book.While purchased quite a while ago, as I am wont to purchase books and then husbandry them until my sensibilities say, \\"Open, open, open me!\\", I've now found that Spices has become one of my top ten books of all time. The reviews for this book should be more glowing than they are, even though they are quite good.We, who open our cupboards and cabinets, and unleash a torrent of spices onto our pork roast or \\"spice\\" cookies, give rarely a thought to the route which lands them in little jars in our cupboards. But after reading Mr. Turner's books, that casualness has now escaped me and my appreciation for my spice cabinet is forever embellished.To meld the history of the spice trade, with a knowledge of the spices themselves, and eruditely combine these aspects into a 352 page book, is a task that the ebook world (with its slopped out pages of damned-to-hell ignoramuses calling themselves \\"writers\\"), might take note of. We do not know exactly how long Mr. Turner spent researching and writing Spices, but he alludes to a lengthy period of time, during which he (as many authors do when creating a book of value) suffered the proverbial slings and arrows of family and friends, as all who create something great, a vision which only they can see, and see the end to, suffer the path.It would behoove Random House/Knopf to present this book once more to the public, reinvigorate it with fresh publicity and an author tour. I find no second book by Mr. Turner, although the net has an allusion to the time he spent in the Causcaus as his \\"next\\" book...perhaps we are lucky and he is sturdily at work on it...I so look forward to seeing his future work.What we might ask, makes an author our friend, a true guide to the new world we find with them? Honor of endeavor. Research that dwells and mellows where others skim the surface. An assuredness that we are in the hands of an expert, who darts and weaves the story as assuredly as the Navajo rug maker might. Again, one hopes that Random House/Knopf remembers its great heritage of nurturing, sustaining, and bringing to fruition writers that bring us more than the next bing, bang, and buck. It is the heritage of the great publishing houses that they be more than the next so-called book of vampire love or sado-masochistic idiocracy. Remember your heritage Random House!In closing, I note that I do not know Mr. Turner, nor am affiliated with Random House/Knopf in any way."},{"Title":"Spice: The History of a Temptation","review":"now admittedly i collect these \\"history of a food\\" books.. i love them, i always do... so when considering my review please do consider that this is EXACTLY the kind of book i adore.spices have been an obsession since ancient days in the West, and this book attempts to cover the incredible demand for (and consequences of that demand) from Ancient Rome to the mega rush of the Dutch East Indies company. this is, in fact, a LOT of ground to cover. nutmeg, cloves, pepper, not just \\"a spice\\" but \\"spices\\"in fact this is something of the weak point in the book. it HAS to focus more on one bit of history, but what it is covering is such a HUGE story, and such a large number of spices, that a lot of really interesting stuff gets shorted a bit.i still recommend it highlyfor further reading on specific spices and similar items i suggest:VanillaorSaltorfor something LIKE this book in style tryA History of the World in 6 Glasses"},{"Title":"Spice: The History of a Temptation","review":"This is a marvellous book.

Turner does for spices what Mark Kurlanksy did for cod and salt."},{"Title":"Spice: The History of a Temptation","review":"The author offers a lively and detailed account of the role spices have played throughout history, with particular focus on medieval times. I find myself picking it up and reading whole chapters or sections at a time, as it does not require one to sit down and read straight through. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Spice: The History of a Temptation","review":"There are many interesting tidbits in this book but unfortunately it is poorly organized. Rather than recounting history chronologically or geographically or even by spice, the author chose to go by use (culinary, medicinal, etc.). Thus it is very hard to remember what you've just read because the story jumps around so much. Unless you plan to take notes, I would highly recommendSalt: A World Historyinstead for those interested in tales of another highly sought after ingredient."},{"Title":"Spice: The History of a Temptation","review":"This is an extremely well-researched book and is brimming with all sorts of interesting anecdotes and historical analysis. It's obvious an enormous amount of work went into this. But... it would have been better if it was about 80-100 pages shorter. Not because I prefer short books (the longer the better if it's great), but because 1) the author seems to keep making the same points over and over, and 2) it seems there's not a source he found that he's not going to quote from. These two things feed off each other until the book bogs down in repetition and runs out of steam about 2/3 the way through--I kept thinking, \\"Wait a minute, didn't the author already make this point in a previous chapter?\\" I had to push myself through the last third of the book until the last chapter (Epilogue), which finished nicely."},{"Title":"Spice: The History of a Temptation","review":"I loved this book. Jack Turner's prose style is irresistible, and his subject endlessly fascinating: the central place occupied by spices, not just in the diet, but in many of the great set-pieces of European history. I have never read a book that caused me to rush to the kitchen, empty out the pepper grinder and figure out which peppercorns are real, and which are fakes introduced for color. (You can taste the difference.) Nor was I aware of the persistently strong associations between spices and corpses - extending far beyond fankincense and myrrh - or some of the more hilarious sources of erotic stimulation that evidently inspired spice-consumers in many cultures and eras. A brilliant debut, and a hugely satisfying read."},{"Title":"Spice: The History of a Temptation","review":"Spice: The History of a TemptationBy Jack TurnerThe Spice TradeSince the cultures of the Egyptians and Greeks, men have hunted spices. The quest for spices brought Columbus to the New World (by accident); fueled the Dutch and British East Indies Corporations and created a demand that spread to other commodities like sugar, tobacco and cotton.In his excellent book \\"Spice: The History of a Temptation\\", Jack Turner examines the rise of the spice trade and the players in the story with generous and intensively- researched literary allusions from Pliny and Plato to Dryden and Donne. Turner doesn't sacrifice historical accuracy for accessibility, a frequent flaw in popular history.Turner divides his work into three major sections: Palate, Body and Spirit. The role of spices (Frankincense and Myrrh) in religious ceremony; the supposed aphrodisiac power of some spices; and of course their effect on food are examined:\\"Yet if the aphrodisiac reputation of spices long had the status of medical fact,\\" he writes, \\"it is equally true that their appeal also relied on a heavy dose of pure superstition. For a magical reputation an outr&eacute; quality is often recommendation enough, and like other aphrodisiac staples such as rhino horn and tiger penis, spices long carried the freight of Eastern mystery, rarity and a high price.\\" (Spice: P. 198)It's interesting to note how popular belief changed over the years. From an almost mystical obsession in the middle Ages, spices became synonymous with wealth and excess, and fell out of favor in more recent years.Jack Turner has taken the history of the spice trade and incorporated it into the cultural history of those involved in it, which is the best kind of history.******"},{"Title":"Spice: The History of a Temptation","review":"This book was not what I thought it would be. I have read a lot of food history books, and I enjoy it when the authors include information about the plant itself- what it is botanically, how it grows, the process of harvesting. But this book lacked that. It was mostly a history of 16th and 17th century Europe. Dont get me wrong, it was well researched, but it wasent what I was looking for. I frequently found myself bored."},{"Title":"Spice: The History of a Temptation","review":"This is not the fastest easiest read, but it is fascinating and informative. It has some very interesting recipes too...I titled this review the way I did because I constantly come up with little facts remembered from this book constantly in the grocery store, watching TV, talking with friends, seeing anything to do with food or history.It's not all inclusive, but it is a big topic and what is there is definitely enlightening. Another reviewer mentioned that the book contained errors...I don't know if this is true, but the highlights of what I picked up appear to be true.It's also a fascinating look at how foods spread throughout the world. For instance I did not know that the potato, tomato, and pepper were all New World foods...that right, no Irish potatoes, Italian tomatoes, or Asian peppers before the 13th century! And did you know that for most of human history nutmeg and cloves came from 2 little islands to be traded across all of Asia, Africa and Europe?The book also does a good job of treating non-culinary roles including in religion, medicine, and social displays. It has led me to try burning cinnamon and I am strongly considering asking that cinnamon be burned at my funeral both for the historical significance, the tribute to immortality (the phoenix's nest), and for the lovely scent.The social aspect of spices and the psychological importance and significance is explored in detail. They are important because for so long they were of the unknown and exotic and this book treats that very well.And hey, it is because of this book that I just had to go find some galengal (turns out that I could not find a single store in Tucson that had it -- though I still need to try the Asian markets -- but that's what the internet is for, right?)I'd definitely recommend for the amateur food historian."},{"Title":"Spice: The History of a Temptation","review":"I highly recommend this book for any foodies who are into the Big Picture. Why *should* spices have been such a big deal that people were willing to spend huge sums of money and/or years of their lives to attain them? This book attempts to answer this question along social, spiritual, and culinary dimensions. Some of what you learn may be surprising - Cloves came, originally, from one place on Earth and had somehow managed to be imported from a tiny Pacific island to Mesopotamia over 3,000 years ago! Some of the arguments seem kind of hand-wavy however - while the argument is made repeatedly that spices were the scent of heaven, the \\"why\\" never really comes across clearly. Nevertheless, the book is an excellent read and *spicy* food for thought."},{"Title":"Spice: The History of a Temptation","review":"Other histories of the spice trade have appeared over the decades, but Jack Turner's Spice: History Of A Temptation is more accessible to non-history buffs than most: it provide a very lively narrative told through the intimate human impulses that drove the search for spices, incorporating medicine, religion and magic in the process. History, myth, literature and archaeology alike creates the structure of the journey, turning Spice into a multi-faceted adventure story as much as a history. Recommended for both college-level collections and for public library browsers alike."},{"Title":"Geometry from a Differentiable Viewpoint","review":"This book is ideal for those with a long time interest in mathematics or the student just becoming interested in advanced topics. It successfully takes the concepts of classic geometry (Euclidean), clearly explains how the parallel postulate interacts with the other postulates and then introduces differential geometry as a natural outgrowth of hyperbolic geometry. McLeary's book succeeds by demonstrating the connection of modern differential geometry to the concepts in which we were educated. This is not a book for the casual reader, but includes many problems and solutions to the more interesting of them"},{"Title":"Geometry from a Differentiable Viewpoint","review":"I'm a master's student in math. I bought the book thinking I'd use it for an independent study. I was wrong.The book has interesting historical tidbits and some classical proofs, including material I hadn't seen elsewhere. However, it takes little time to explain to the novice exactly what's going on. It comes off more as a set of lecture notes than as a text for self-study.For instance, in ch. 8 McCleary breezes through the basics of regular surfaces--coordinate charts, differentiability, implicit/inverse function theorem, the tangent space, orientability, the first fundamental form in about 19 pages. This is the same foundational material that folk like do Carmo or O'Neill rightfully spend 60-70 pages to cover.His treatment of the Gauss map and the second fundamental form is even more schematic.If I hadn't already worked the other books, when I got to McCleary's treatment of surfaces I would've been completely lost.This book is best for people who know basic differential geometry already but are curious about certain historical aspects of it, not for people who are trying to learn differential geometry."},{"Title":"Geometry from a Differentiable Viewpoint","review":"Do not buy this inappropriately titled book if you are seeking an introductory text to learn differential geometry. It's not that the concepts in the book are so advanced, so much as not that much space is actually devoted to the subject. The author's real objective is to trace the development of geometry from Euclid to the (relatively) modern formulation of differential geometry, and as a book on that topic it succeeds admirably.The core theme of the book is that efforts to prove the parallel postulate, or, equivalently, show that non-Euclidean geometries are impossible, inadvertently, through their failure, led to the discovery of many fascinating areas of mathematics, such as hyperbolic and Riemannian geometries, and to the development of philosophical ideas about what actually constitutes mathematics and how it is independent from physical reality. The book culminates with the results of Beltrami and Poincare that showed that hyperbolic and Euclidean geometries are logically equivalent, in the sense that if there is a self-contradiction in one then the other is also impossible, thus putting an end to all attempts to disprove hyperbolic geometry. (Unfortunately, Marilyn vos Savant is unaware of this, or at least she was when she wrote an article some years back criticising Andrew Wiles's proof of Fermat's last theorem because it used hyperbolic geometry.)As an appendix, McCleary adds a translation of Riemann's lecture \\"On the hypothesis which lie at the foundations of geometry,\\" perhaps the most influential single lecture in the history of mathematics (and physics), in which, in the mid-1860s, he presented to a general faculty a talk (involving only a single equation) on the foundations of geometry that anticipated the concepts of a manifold and Riemannian geometry as well as general relativity and even hinted at quantum mechanics.I used this text as a primary reference when conducting an undergraduate seminar on the history of hyperbolic geometry 12 years ago. For this purpose it was suited perfectly, but if you want to learn differential geometry by all means buy one of do Carmo's books or Gallot, Hulin, and LaFontaine."},{"Title":"Geometry from a Differentiable Viewpoint","review":"I agree that this work is bit to terse for those completely uninitiated with the subject. However, for a first semester graduate student (or anyone with about this level of maturity) who has at least a minimal acquaintance with curves/surfaces this is a wonderful book which fulfills a long standing gap. The divide between undergraduate differential geometry and graduate geometry is too great. A beginning graduate student could walk into a course on differentiable manifolds and Riemannian Geometry with no undergraduate diff geometry and be fine (as I did), but it is tough road since much of the intuition and motivation is missing. Furthermore, it can be difficult to see the relevance of the modern approach to more classical geometry. This may not trouble the student at first, but as Spivak notes in his tome: \\"this ignorance of the roots of the subject has its price.\\" Eventually one needs to assimilate the intuition of classical geometry with the technical language of manifolds. This book very elegantly leads the student from his undergraduate education to the doorstep of modern global geometry. As an added bonus, the author also endeavors to bridge the gap between Euclid and differential geometry.The only other successful attempt at this is in Spivak, but unfortunately he goes backwards. Volume 1 is entirely devoted to manifolds. Then in volume 2 he explains the classical point of view and then builds the bridge. While these are beautiful books, this is not efficient for the beginning student. The prospective geometer should read this before a class on manifold theory; I wish I had.I give 4 stars only because the author advertises this as a \\"first exposure\\", and this book is simply not suited for this purpose."},{"Title":"Geometry from a Differentiable Viewpoint","review":"This is a great book.

Ford genre and I look forward to the highly touted \\"Fury\\" and \\"Black River.\\" This novel, \\"A Blind Eye,\\" was fairly magnetic. While I could 'put it down,' I kept picking it up throughout the weekend. It was a very exciting read.Ford is an excellent scene painter and I found myself nodding appreciatively over descriptions of cold, icy roads, soot, smell and the like. If they make a movie out of some of his novels, that's where the organ music would come in. Steve Hamilton does this well in his novels about Michigan and Michigan winters but with Ford it's darker and even a little scary. He has that 'hackles rising on the back of your neck' style of the early King.Corso, the hard guy, and Dougherty, 'The Illustrated Lady,' embark on a mission of investifgation over the accidental discovery of several decade old bones. The bones are accounted for except for one missing girl, Sissy Warwick, a teenager. They identify what is initially the missing corpse and work from there.What happens is that with each successive identity, the anonymous corpse keeps killing more, almost like a series of Stalinist purges, wiping out an entire family. As Corso and Dougherty get closer, they end up turning the heat up on themselves.There are a couple of things that didn't fit 'seamlessly' with the pursuit od Sissy Warwick. There are some scenes that seem to be purposeless. The whole reason why Frank is on the run to begin with and the impact of what happens when the Texas Grand Jury's term expires isn't really explained. While some scenes could have been excised, this was one that needed more information. When they're stuck in O'Hare in a snowstrome and Dougherty is higly irritated, you want to know why in greater detail. The whole thing with Sheriff Trask and her Deputy, unnecessary. None of us mind going off in the wrong direction but misdirection from the author just to fill in pages seems pointless.Then there's the characters Sheriff Trask, Professor Rosen and Warren from the FBI that might have been more significant if time was taken. Either that or ignore them entirely. They become cameo appearances with no script.The plot, the investigation, the macabre villains, and the energy between Corso and Dougherty is all excellent. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury"},{"Title":"A Blind Eye : A Novel (Ford, Gm)","review":"G. M. Ford writes a quirky mystery. His main character, Frank Corso, is a \\"rogue reporter, successful true crime writer and honorable loner with a dangerous edge.\\" Actually Corso doesn't have a whole lot of depth as a character, but his quirkiness kind of makes up for that. He's one of those guys who more or less stumbles into trouble and then spends a few hundred pages getting out of it . . . usually running into a lot more trouble on the way. Lee Child's Jack Reacher is the epitome of such characters and Ford's Corso doesn't come close, but is still enjoyable.Here Corso is stuck at O'Hare Airport desperate to be on his way to someplace remote where he won't be found and arrested. Texas is seeking his arrest as a material witness: Corso, it seems, claimed to have some information that he really didn't have. A thin premise, but enough to move on.He's tricked a former lover / current friend into coming with him. Now they to get out and get out quick. A static weather front has closed O'Hare with heavy snow. So Corso and friend rent a car and take off to Milwaukee. The first of Ford's many inaccuracies soon appear: he has Corso driving more than a hundred miles north and still in Illinos. Cant happen. There are a lot of laughs like this in Ford's book, least among them descriptions of harrowing mountain roads in Wisconsin. Wisconsin has nothing that could be considered a mountain. Such mistakes don't detract from the story, but do add touches of unintended humor.Anyway, the snows soon make driving impossible as does a turned over pickup truck in the road. Corso's vehicle hits it and slides down a slope (fat chance in Wisconsin). Corso's girlfriend rescues him by dragging him into an abandoned homestead. She salvages wood from an outlying building. When Corso recovers conciousness, he goes out to the building for more wood and - surprise - discovers a neatly wrapped package containing three bodies.Thus begins the adventure. Rescued from the snow by a snow removal driver, a small-town sherriff makes a deal with Corso. If he promises to clear up this embarassing murder, she will bluff the two Texas Marshalls who have shown up to take Corso to the slammer.The search is on for a mysterious woman who showed up in this small Wisconsin town (which is difficult to believe exists in Wisconsin), has sex with practically everyone and then suddenly settles down with a homely, reclusive farmer. The trail leads to the mountainfolk of New Jersey and New York. (Bet you didn't know, according to Ford, that these two states have their own strain of truly inbred \\"hillbillies.\\")The factual basis may be weak, but the story is good. Quirky, filled with oddities and many fortunate coincidences, but overall good.Ford writes a good mystery. Oddball, but eminently readable.Jerry"},{"Title":"A Blind Eye : A Novel (Ford, Gm)","review":"A Blind Eye is G.M. Ford's third book featuring Frank Corso, a disgraced New York Times reporter turned best-selling author of true-crime novels. (Maybe that's a career Jayson Blair should consider.)As the book opens, Corso and his assistant (and former lover), Meg Dougherty, are on the lam, hiding from a Texas grand jury that wants to ask Corso questions he doesn't have good answers for. In their effort to escape, the pair winds up in a remote location in snowy Wisconsin, where they stumble upon a grisly crime scene.That discovery leads them onto the trail of a twisted serial killer who preys on entire families, including her own. Don't worry, though; this isn't another lame, exploitive manic-killer book that uses its crimes to titillate. Ford is too classy an author for that. True, the villain is one sick woman, but she's largely in the background while the focus of the story is on Corso.A Blind Eye is an excellent example of a well written crime novel that tells a straightforward, interesting story without pretensions or cliche. At times it goes off in unnecessary directions (like the killing of a deputy that made no sense at all), but that weakness is a minor one. The gripping suspense and stunning climax make this book well worthwhile.Reviewed by David Montgomery, Chicago Sun-Times"},{"Title":"A Blind Eye : A Novel (Ford, Gm)","review":"In an opening sequence as fast-paced and frantic as the prologue to an Indiana Jones movie, true crime writer Frank Corso (trying to avoid appearing before a Grand Jury in Texas as a material witness) and his ex-lover Megan Dougherty drive from snowbound O'Hare airport in the hope of catching a plane from Madison... but they skid on an icy road and take shelter in a long-abandoned farmhouse. Tearing up some floorboards for firewood, they find several buried bodies. The Texans catch up with Corso while he's recovering from the crash in hospital in the small town of Avalon, and Corso makes a deal with the local sheriff: if he solves the murder and helps her win re-election, she'll fight the extradition order for a few days until the Grand Jury case is over.Corso soon becomes intrigued by the case, then horrified, and continues working to solve it even after the sheriff's deputy is found dead and he's accused of the murder.Apart from a rather contrived beginning, A Blind Eye is an excellently crafted fast-paced thriller which builds up to a gripping climax, comparable to Red Dragon or The Silence of the Lambs. Ford makes good use of forensic science (including some rather gruesome details of forensic entomology) as well Corso and Dougherty's knack for extracting the information they need from people and computers, and cunningly weaves in some clues that even Corso misses. There's plenty of action as Corso tries to elude everyone who's trying to catch or kill him, and more than a hint of sexual tension, though most of the sex happens off-stage (if not necessarily off-camera).Ford is also skilled at creating interesting, often surprising, characters in remarkably few words. His good guys have flaws, and it's difficult not to empathise (at least a little) with his killers as well as most of their victims. His dialogue is sharp, but believable. And like Stephen King or Bruce Springsteen, Ford does an excellent job of portraying slowly-dying rust-belt Smalltown USA, where the cemetery is not only all that remains of an area's history but the closest thing it has to a claim on the future.Though grim to the point of being gothic, A Blind Eye is a genuinely gripping read that should appeal to all thriller, mystery and horror enthusiasts."},{"Title":"A Blind Eye : A Novel (Ford, Gm)","review":"First G.M. Ford book I've read. Very entertaining with likable characters. Dialoge reveals quite a sense of humor. Starts out a bit slow but going to the end is worth the trip."},{"Title":"A Blind Eye : A Novel (Ford, Gm)","review":"At the opposite end of the spectrum from lightweight Robert B. Parker type work is author G. M. Ford. First with the Leo Waterman series and now with the Frank Corso series, his novels consistently feature multidimensional characters, complicated plots and intense writing. This is the third novel in the Frank Corso series and is simply an intense spellbinding read that occasionally is highly disturbing in its background themes of death and child abuse. If you haven't read him before, you really need to read FURY and Black River before you read this one as they lay the foundation for the Corso character.As the novel opens, Corso and his good friend Meg Dougherty are stuck at Chicago's O'Hare Airport thanks to a blizzard. The blizzard rages outside while a very frustrated Corso rages within which is not a good thing in this day of terror alerts and increased security concerns at the nation's airports. Being a disgruntled angry passenger has consequences these days and he can't afford them. Corso needs to leave as there is a warrant out for his arrest and his warrant has now caught the attention of the cable news outlets.A Grand Jury in Texas issued the arrest warrant because in his latest true crime book, author Frank Corso claimed to know where a body in Texas was buried. Unfortunately, his source that told him that he knew has now vanished so Corso has nothing to tell the Grand Jury. If the Texas Rangers find and arrest him, he can be held indefinitely on a \\"material witness\\" charge. But if he can remain uncaught for a little more than a week, the Grand Jury will dissolve and with no Grand Jury, the warrant for his arrest will become void and unenforceable. Then he can go back home to Seattle and let his attorney handle it without fear of arrest.In the meantime, with his picture popping up every few minutes on various cable stations on airport televisions, it is past time to leave. Since planes are out of the question, Corso and Dougherty rent an SUV and venture out into the blizzard. That small acts sets in motion a nightmarish discovery of the legacy of a very sick serial killer, a man hunt involving the FBI as well as other law enforcement types, crooked cops, and a string of bodies and destruction in their wake.This novel is extremely intense and occasionally disturbingly graphic in depictions of death and child abuse. More of the Corso character is revealed as well as his good friend Meg Dougherty. However, the author never lets the character development get in the way of the intense, griping story. This is a real page tuner that will get your blood pounding as the book works toward one heck of an ending. While I much prefer the Leo Waterman character, the intense and complex enigma of Frank Corso is fast becoming a realfavorite."},{"Title":"A Blind Eye : A Novel (Ford, Gm)","review":"I don't know how Leo gets so many exciting cases but it's always fun to see howhe and the homeless gang are going to solve the next ."},{"Title":"A Blind Eye : A Novel (Ford, Gm)","review":"Reporter Frank Corso fell from grace when he was accused of making up a crime story. However, Frank is resourceful and easily reinvented himself into a true-crime writer who claims to have insider information on a Texas high-society murder. Rather than face the results of a subpoena demanding he talk, Frank does what comes naturally; he goes on the run. Accompanying Frank into hiding in wintry Wisconsin is his photographer, Meg Dougherty.Following an accident caused by blizzard like weather, Frank and Meg take shelter on an abandoned farm in Avalon. In the shed, they discover the remains of the male members of the Holmes family, whom everyone thought, simply left town fifteen years ago. The local sheriff cuts a deal with Frank that he won't be handed over to Texas if he investigates the murders. Already fascinated by the grisly scene, Frank accepts the terms. He starts his inquiries by looking into the mother of the brood who's not part of the skeletal remains. He soon traces her bloody trail to other homicides, but the culprit has plans to add the writer to the pile of deaths.The suspense is at the usual high level expected in a G.M Ford novel starring the likable antihero Frank who is accompanied by a support cast that adds exaggerated regional eccentricities. Yet with all that the tale seems off slightly because whenever Frank hits a dead end he finds this incredible Ziggy like source that moves him further along on the case. Still fans will continue reading because the rapid pace, the chilling suspense, and the quaint cast make for a strong entertaining read.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Blind Eye : A Novel (Ford, Gm)","review":"Setting your mysteries in Seattle (one of my favourite cities) is not the way to keep me as a reader, but it will certainly help get me started. Thankfully, G.M. Ford has a way with writing that will always keep me around. His Leo Waterman mysteries were first-rate, and his Frank Corso books have kept his string of winning novels alive. A Blind Eye continues this, as Ford creates a page-turner that will keep any hard-boiled detective fan glued to the text.True Crime author and disgraced newspaper reporter Frank Corso is having a bad day. He's stuck in Chicago's O'Hare airport, snowed in and stranded, with an irate Meg Dougherty (former lover and one real friend) along for the ride. Why is Meg irate? Because Frank never bothered to tell her that the reason for the &quot;story&quot; they are pursuing is really because two Texas rangers have a warrant for his arrest. Stuck in an airport, his picture showing up on CNN and security starting to look at him strangely, Corso drags Meg on an ill-considered car ride into Wisconsin, where icy roads send them to the bottom of a ravine. What they discover there will bring more than just Texas law enforcement down on his head. It will involve them in a cross-country trip on the trail of a serial killer uncaught for over 30 years. It also, of course, makes him a target.A Blind Eye takes Corso out of his familiar Seattle, and I think it stretched Ford's writing talent as well. Seattle and western Washington has always been a cozy location for him in which to write, with familiar territory and landmarks making identification easier. This one starts out in Chicago, goes to southern Wisconsin, Iowa, Pennsylvania, and the wilds of the New Jersey mountains. Removed from his familiar environs, Ford has to work a little bit harder, and he does a great job. Some of it is a bit stereotypical (I'm from Iowa, and he captures it decently, but not wonderfully), but overall it shows that he did some research on his locales. Removing Corso and Dougherty from the northwest also allows him to broaden their characters as well. Seeing them on the run presents a different side of them, how they react when desperation hits. Usually, we see our heroes chasing the bad guys, not the other way around.The relationship between Dougherty and Corso crackles with energy. They used to be lovers and have now become the best of friends. Dougherty is extremely annoyed with Corso, but she goes along with him anyway. She obviously still loves him to put up with all that he puts her through. In fact, their relationship goes through an even more pronounced change in A Blind Eye, evolving as they are forced together by circumstances. That's one thing I love about Ford's writing: the characters are always open to change and growth. While it certainly is not necessary to read the books in order, things change enough that you are rewarded for doing so. This makes both of them even deeper characters then most genre detectives.The minor characters are given just enough depth to be believable while not overshadowing the protagonists. The sheriff of the Wisconsin town is predictably overwhelmed by having all of the media attention centered on her, along with a gloryhound deputy who's gunning for her job. This situation actually ends up being important, driving some of the action despite the fact that it's not center-stage. This is a bit distracting from the main plot, but it's not critical. Most of the rest get little, if any, development, but their suitably quirky and/or malevolent to serve their roles. The one exception to this isn't obvious until the end, however. In between some of the chapters are entries from a journal whose author is unrevealed. As the book goes on, it becomes clearer and actually adds to the horror of what is happening, as we realize that the cycle of violence may not be ending like we thought it would.There are only a couple of faults with this book. The first is the fact that there are some superfluous scenes in the book that seem to be included just to show us how tough Corso is. Regular readers already know how tough he is, and subsequent events in the book show this to new readers. Unless Ford is just trying to show us what our rights are during a traffic stop, I see no point to them. While this is forgivable, the second problem is far more damning.The book posits the existence of a super-secret organization that journalists and others can use to get information that is otherwise unobtainable (at least in a timely manner). This organization is so secret that they will not accept any new queries from a phone number they don't have on file, and any such calls require that the phone be disposed of as soon as the call is completed. The presentation of this organization screams PLOT DEVELOPMENT every time Corso uses it, bringing me out of the narrative. It results in a couple of funny scenes (especially when Corso has to use Meg's phone for a question), but overall it's just distracting.Overall, A Blind Eye is a wonderful page-turner. It's not a taxing read, in fact it's perfect for Sunday afternoons or beach reading. If you like your mysteries with great characters who grow and change, the Frank Corso books are definitely for you. You don't even have very many to catch up on. Whatever you do, though, check this one out.David Roy"},{"Title":"A Blind Eye : A Novel (Ford, Gm)","review":"I have all of the Leo Waterman and Frank Corso books. Was Blind Eye one of the best? Doesn't even come close to Black River, but I don't regret having made the purchase and would still recommend. No, it wasn't always believable (hey, it's fiction), but the trip across country and the weaving in of past events kept me interested. Frank and Meg once again make it out alive which for me made up for the rather creepy ending."},{"Title":"A Blind Eye : A Novel (Ford, Gm)","review":"If it says GM Ford on the front cover, I am going to read it and so far have never been disappointed.

But a freak snowstorm strands writer Frank Corso, along with sometime-girlfriend and photographer Meg Dougherty in an airport and Frank decides to brave the blizzard rather than wait to be arrested. Stuck in the blizzard, Frank and Meg discover evidence of a seventeen-year-old murder. As part of a bargain to keep him away from the Rangers, Frank agrees to look into the old murder and Meg reluctantly goes along.What they find is a story of abuse, incest, and a girl's attempts to control her environment at any cost. As they get closer, they wonder whether this girl, now a woman, might kill again--and whether they can stay alive themselves. Of course, getting closer depends on staying ahead of the Rangers, the FBI, and the local Sheriff who has her own issues.Author G. M. Ford writes a page-turning and compelling story. Frank, with his little problem with the truth, makes an intriguing character--bad enough to be sympathetic but heroic enough to make him admirable as well. Ford's writing grabs the reader by the throat and pulls them through an exciting adventure.Readers who enjoy action, a bit of psychological analysis, wise-talking heros, and a quirky bit of romance will definitely want to get their hands on A BLIND EYE."},{"Title":"A Blind Eye : A Novel (Ford, Gm)","review":"G.M.

M. Ford, features the tough and taciturn Frank Corso, a true crime writer who is on the lam. Corso is wanted in Texas as a material witness, and he decides to lie low until the warrant for his arrest expires. Along with his former lover, photojournalist Meg Dougherty, Frank gets into an accident on a Wisconsin highway during a heavy blizzard. When Dougherty and Corso take shelter in an abandoned house, they discover the grisly remains of a murdered family.Corso is manipulated by the local sheriff into investigating this crime, which leads him to several states in his pursuit of a very unusual serial killer. &quot;A Blind Eye&quot; explores the pathological side of human nature, especially the way in which horribly abused children sometimes grow into deeply disturbed and violent adults.Corso is a terrific character. He is strong, courageous, and eerily intuitive, and his girlfriend, Meg Dougherty, is gutsy and tenacious. The secondary characters are also well-drawn. G. M. Ford's plot is intricate and engrossing, and he ratchets up the tension to an agonizing level prior to the hair-raising and electrifying finale. &quot;A Blind Eye&quot; is a powerful and unsettling thriller that may give you nightmares."},{"Title":"A Blind Eye : A Novel (Ford, Gm)","review":"I've read every one of G.M Ford's books. This book covers similar territory to his second book &quot;Cast in Stone&quot;. &quot;A Blind Eye&quot; is more tightly plotted and moves faster than CIS but it feels less inventive to me. There's some ok dialogue and some interesting material on isolated hill communities in the eastern US but there's some incredibly weak dialogue as well, e.g. the banter between Corso and his ex-lover Dougherty at the beginning. After three books, the Frank Corso character just doesn't interest me that much. My response to the grim subject matter tells me that it is time to read more uplifting stuff. Addicts to the genre will be not be too disappointed but for me it's really time to move on, i.e. I'll probably read the next book.

Corso is a fantastic character as usual, the new setting is a nice change of pace (rural and wintry rather than urban and rainy), and the dialogue is spot-on.However, the plot is not nearly as tight and fast-paced as the earlier book. There are a number of segways and subplots that slow it down, and are really unnecessary. Whereas Black River had its moments off the main plot (e.g. the Cambodian man's story), it never seemed to detract from the core story.ABE was still an entertaining read.

Lenin (all perhaps) concerning the role of women in society and within Soviet Russia. It contains parts of \\"Development of Capitalism in Russia\\" regarding women, drafts of the party structure, essays regarding the role of women at home and in the factory, letters, and an article named \\"My Recollections of Lenin\\" by Clara Zetkin, in which Zetkin recollects conversations and meetings she had with Lenin regarding the increase of the role of women in the party and communism across Europe.The writings in general are very clear and have an easy flow to them, which is important for someone who is not very familiar with Lenin's writings. At times however, it seems that some of the material was included in this book simply because the word \\"women\\" appeared in it. Also, there are some writings on women that basically argue the same exact point, and so it is hard to learn anything new on Lenin's view of the matter in these occasions.All in all, this short book covers the role of women very nicely, and one can clearly see what Lenin's stand was on the subject, and so the purpose of this book is carried out successfully."},{"Title":"Ghosts: And Real-Life Ghost Hunters (24/7: Science Behind the Scenes: Mystery Files)","review":"I bought many titles from this series for my middle and high school students.

For those who remember the first 100 issues or so of \\"The Amazing Spider-Man,\\" writer Brian Michael Bendis, penciler Mark Bagley, and inkers Art Thibert and Rodney Ramos have been providing a high intensity retelling of the tale. This time around Mary Jane Watson and Gwen Stacy are fellow high school students of Peter Parker and the fateful encounter with the Green Goblin comes early on. But this is more than a re-imagining of the Spider-Man saga from the very beginning because these stories are informed by our knowledge of what happened in the first decades worth of issues of \\"The Amazing Spider-Man.\\"Volume 3 of the hardback \\"Ultimate Spider-Man\\" collects the issues previous reprinted in the fifth and six tradepaperback collections. \\"Public Scrutiny\\" (issues #28-32) is different from the previous story arcs in that Spider-Man never fights one super villain in the entire book (even though he certainly wants to). This time the main focus is on Peter Parker being Spider-Man, an issue that is addressed on multiple levels, from Peter being distracted at school to Mary (Jane) having a hard time handling being constantly worried about Peter getting hurt (not calling her Mary Jane is the biggest problem I have with these revisions). This latter point comes to a head after Spider-Man has a bad encounter with the police who are gunning for him because he has been robbing banks and killing police officers. Actually, it is somebody impersonating Spider-Man, which is just another part of the growing headache for our hero.Bendis is taking pains to explore what it means to be a superhero when you are sixteen years old and in love with the girl next door, who is ticked off that Gwen Stacy has moved in with the Parkers. Meanwhile, the whole bit with Nick Fury and the rules of superheroes in the brave new Marvel universe continues to present intriguing possibilities for the future. Again, Bendis and artist Mark Bagley are taking there time with this one; 32 issues into \\"The Amazing Spider-Man\\" Peter Parker was a freshman at E.S.U., while here he is only a sophomore in high school. We can only imagine what he is going to go through before he reaches graduation day. \\"Public Scrutiny\\" is as good of a story arc as \\"Ultimate Spider-Man\\" has presented to date, even without the standard knock down, drag out fight with a super bad guy.\\"Venom\\" (#33-39) is a quantum leap beyond the Stan Lee days of the original comic to retell the story of Venom. At this point in the tale Captain Stacy is killed while in pursuit of a burglar who had gone on a crime spree posing as Spider-Man, leaving Aunt May to offer his orphaned daughter Gwen a place to live. Meanwhile, after defeating the burglar who has been posing as Spider-Man, Peter is stunned to find out that Mary Jane, who has not only been his girlfriend but the one person he trusts who knows he is Spider-Man, can no longer stand the pressure and breaks up with him. In the wake of that shock Peter connects with Eddie Brock, now a student at Empire State University. It seems Peter and Eddie's dad worked together at the lab and Peter thinks Eddie would like a copy of a videotape of their families enjoying a picnic. Eddie is touched, and has something to show Peter as well, something he calls their \\"inheritance.\\"Of course, this is the \\"black costume,\\" now no longer and alien parasite but a genetic bodysuit. While experimenting with it, the suit leaps onto Peter who discovers it has one big advantage over his regular Spidey suit: it repairs the damage done to him by bullets. But when Spider-Man catches up with the burglar who killed Uncle Ben, his new suit literally goes in for the kill. Eventually Peter will go to Eddie for help, and then it will be time for the suit to find a new person with whom to play and Venom, Spider-Man's evil twin, is truly born. One of the improvements Bendis and Bagley came up with for their revisionist version of Spider-Man was the idea that it was Peter's father who was the scientific genius who came up with the webbing formula. They build on that foundation again by working in both Eddie Brock and the Venom costume into the fabric of the Parker family saga, not to mention Curt Connors. Knowing Eddie gives the conflict with Venom more depth and Peter gets to be a smart kid without being a genius on the level of Tom Swift.The subplot of Nick Fury being something of a quasi-guardian angel and part-time mentor for Spider-Man is continued, and watching Aunt May and Gwen bond is also going to make things interesting down the road, so be sure to pick up The grand conceit of the \\"Ultimate Spider-Man\\" comics is that they go back to the beginning of the story when the bite of an irradiated spider granted high school student Peter Parker amazing arachnid-like powers.

This volume is slightly smaller than the past collections, but that's due to the smaller arc lengths this time around.Also included is the usual hefty amount of \\"special features\\". As usual, these also prove just how truly INSANE Bill Jemas is. We should all thank every diety available that this man doesn't have full control over Ultimate Spider-man. Tying 'Venom' to Peter's web fluid formula? Can we say contrived, Billy? Thought so.Anyway, Billy Jemas' insanity aside, the two arcs presented here are pretty good. They aren't as fantastic as the past storylines, but these seemed to serve more as prep for what Bendis has cooked up next, ESPECIALLY the Venom arc. Eddie's introduction, the intro to the Venom costume, Peter wearing the black costume, Eddie's transformation, and the fight between Peter/Eddie was compressed into six issues. The whole thing just feels incredibly rushed, especially when it's kept in mind that Bendis took FOUR ENTIRE ISSUES to kill Uncle Ben!The blame for this has to land on Billy boy's shoulders, who limited the arc to six issues, and insisted that Eddie as Venom appear. Doesn't leave much room for Bendis to develop the characters, now does it? An example of this is that Pete's in the black costume for less than one issue, and within a couple pages, he decides the costume's evil. So much potential was wasted due to the rush to see Venom in all his slobbering glory, and I find that sad.Backtracking a little, the arc before Venom was great. 'Public Scrutiny' focuses on what happens when Spider-man's reputation is tarnished by an impersonator, and the repercussions that follow. There where some cringe worthy 'why the hell did you retcon that?!' moments, though. If you were angry as all hell about MJ taking Gwen's place in the Goblin arc, then be warned. Another warning, MJ lovers beware: You WILL want to strangle her. Ranting about her family problems and finding them so important after what happens to poor Gwen...well...I will never look at the Ultimate-verse MJ the same way again. Bendis should have just killed her off in the Goblin arc.Now, for the quality of the hardback..Beautiful, absolutely beautiful. Whoever's in charge of DC's hardback department should take note immediately of how it's done. The eye-catching cover screams to be placed out in the open, and the oversized glossy pages are fantastic. Thick and well put together, this book never feels like it'll fall apart if you don't handle it delicately (unlike DC's first volume of 'Hush').Great addition, though I had to knock a star off the Venom arc's shortcomings."},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man, Vol. 3","review":"Once again Bendis has done it again. I haven't really been that interested in Spiderman since I was a kid. When I was a kid, I loved Spiderman. I grew out of it(well, maybe not, just moved onto different superheros). I have picked up the previous hardcovers of Ultimate Spiderman because of Bendis. He has done what I wish all comic book titles would do. Continuity. It's been the same flowing story since page 1. If Peter is hurt, he is hurt for awhile. When Peter and MJ are fighting, they are fighting for many chapters.What I really like about Bendis is that he \\"writes the way people talk\\". His dialog includes stammering, interuptions, emotions. Almost all comic books and a lot of fiction books read like a script.While I keep going on and on about the writing, let me speak kindly, also, about the art. The artist(sorry, i can't remember off hand) takes what I like about Bendis' writing and gives the razor sharp dialog an even finer point.I am anxiously awaiting book 4, but for know, I think I'll go back and read 1 through 3."},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man, Vol. 3","review":"I have really enjoyed the Ultimate Spider-Man series, and look forward to each hardback volume as it appears. This one I pre-ordered. It is very good, but it pales a little compared to volumes 1 and 2. There is a lack of extra material, something that could not be said about the first two, and we seem to have lost the reproductions of the cover art placed throughout the book.Story-wise this is pretty good. The Venom story is nicely done, I thought, though it does have the familiar: \\"meet bad guy, beat-up bad guy, bad guy gone away\\" which will be followed (I guess) by a \\"Here's the bad guy again!\\".Overall, a good addition to the Ultimate Spider-Man series, though I hope the omissions are a glitch more than the shape of things to come."},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man, Vol. 3","review":"I enjoyed the first 3 books the most.

I'd've preferred if it could have been drawn out longer - Spidey wearing the Venom suit for a while and only gradually realising what it was doing to him would have read better than the rather immediate transformation that we get, but it still works okay.The new backstory for Venom is nice - one of the big advantages of the Ultimate line is the way that, with all the years of experience behind them, they can piece together more tight-knit stories. That works here, bringing Venom in as an essential part of Peter Parker's backstory.The only real problem is that Venom still looks silly. He's an over-the-top, McFarlane-esque thing that looks goofy and out-of-place in the story. Every time I'd start to get into the story, that ridiculous gaping jaw and writhing tongue would take me out of it.If you can get past the distracting character design, though, this is a good read, keeping up the quality we've had in the rest of the series up to this point."},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man, Vol. 3","review":"ultimate spider-man by bendis and bagley is one of the best series out there. not as much action and non-stop bad guy fighting, but a good mix of that and a lot of peter parker being a teenager with problems (girls, bullies, being grounded, etc.) along with his spidey life.the series is great great great. only a few minor things that could be better:1. i don't like how nick fury comes in and tells spider-man he's going to work his whole life for him and shield. the idea of peter being...trapped in a web? haha...well it isn't too cool. superheroes need to fight the good fight because they want to, not because shield will go and take away their superpowers (as fury has threatened) if they don't comply.2. bendis needs to cut down on the tuchas talk. seriously if parker grew up in nyc today he'd more likely speak spanglish than yanglish.3. geldoff."},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man, Vol. 3","review":"I have read all the books so far and I think there awsome!!!!A must have in the series!!!!"},{"Title":"The Roman Martyrology","review":"Priests and monks, in addition to offering the Mass every day, must also pray the Divine Office (also called the Breviary, or Liturgy of the Hours). This involves stopping 6 to 7 times a day to pray: by reciting assigned psalms, a hymn, and some particular prayers of the day. This is the Church's prayer. Anyone who prays these \\"hours\\" is praying with, through and for the Church as part of her official, daily liturgy.Until the late 1960s, part of praying the Office was to pray the morning \\"hour\\" called \\"Prime\\" (meaning the first hour after sunrise). After praying \\"Lauds\\" at dawn, praising nature and the wonder of a new day, \\"Prime\\" then brought one's focus to the day ahead, asking God to sanctify your work for the coming day. In the late 1960s, in an effort to reduce the burden of praying the Office on busy priests (it is a sin for them not to pray the Office very day), the Pope abolished the hour of \\"Prime\\".Part of praying \\"Prime\\" was to recite the day's entry from the \\"Martyrologium Romanum\\" (in Latin, of course!). This book was the Church's official list which, for each day of the year, listed all those Saints and Martyrs who were to be remembered on that day, usually for having died on that day. The Martyrology is therefore (along with the Breviary, the Missal, and the Ritual) one of the traditional liturgical books of the Church.This present volume is the English translation of the Martyrology as it was immediately before the suppression of the hour of Prime. It can therefore serve its original purpose of being used for those who still pray (as is their right) the 1961 version of the Breviary, and therefore the hour of Prime. It can also serve as a wonderful daily meditation on all those holy men and women who have gone before us heroic in their faith, and who do not necessarily have feastdays celebrated in their honour or Churches named after them.Because this version dates form the 1960s, it does not include any of those holy people beatified or canonized by Paul VI or later Popes. Pope John Paul II, in his long reign, is said to have canonized more saints than all his predecessors put together. There was also a general rearrangement of the calendar of saints by the Vatican in the early 1970s, removing the feastdays for some (especially those for whom there is scant historical data), moving them for others. The Vatican always had it on its to-do list to update and republish the Martyrologium - to accommodate the changes in dates for some saints, and to include the explosion of saint-making activity of Pope John Paul II. However, since the Martyrologium was no longer a part of the daily liturgy of the Church, there was no hurry.Rome has now published the updated Martyrologium (in Latin), and an English translation will eventually be forthcoming.In the meantime (and even afterwards) this English version of the pre-Vatican II Martyrology is excellent and nourishing, and a reminder to us all of those who have died for their faith, or who went to their deaths having lived heroic virtuous lives.This book deserves to be in every Catholic household. It deserves to still be part of the morning prayer of every priest and monk in the world!"},{"Title":"El Espejo del Lider (Spanish Edition)","review":"El Espejo del Lider es un excelente libro para todos aquellos que se consideran lideres pero han descuidado aspectos importantes en la vida que van mas alla del &quot;exito&quot; laboral.Con relatos simples nos recuerda el valor de las personas, la familia, la tolerancia y nos ayuda a descubrir lo positivo de cada individuo y cada circunstacia que se presente.Siempre regreso a este libro y descubro algo nuevo cada vez."},{"Title":"Original Jaguar XK","review":"Phillip Porter is a recognized expert on the Jaguar XK series.

The views of Jesus, Paul, and the Gospel of Thomas (spiritual resurrection) are contrasted with the position of the Gospels of John and Luke and Ignatius of Antioch (fleshly resurrection). Chapter One is a must!"},{"Title":"Resurrection Reconsidered","review":"Riley's book portrays the Johanine and Thomas communities in conflict over the doctrine of bodily (\\"fleshly\\") resurrection. Bodily resurrection was a radical idea, strange and even repulsive to people reared in the widely prevailing Greco-Roman tradition, which viewed the soul as separate and distinct from the physical body in which it is held prisoner. Only the liberated soul continues to exist after death, while the body decays away. The Thomas community took that traditional view, which placed it at theological odds with the writer of the Gospel of John and the developing Christian orthodoxy.Why did early Christianity insist on the doctrine of bodily resurrection? (1) Judaic legacy: The idea could be found in some OT Scripture. (2) Justice: The soul should not be judged alone for the sins of the body, especially as sin arises from the desires of the body; reward or torment for the deeds of the body should be experienced by the body. (3) Unity of persons: The resurrection of a person must be, by definition, an embodied resurrection, because a person is a unity of body and soul, not separable into an evil physical body distinct from a good spiritual soul. (4) Humanity of Jesus: It is part of the proof that Jesus was truly of human flesh, before and after crucifixion.Riley analyzes parts of John's Gospel as a polemic aimed at the Thomas community, particularly in the way their spiritual mentor, the disciple Thomas, is portrayed. He is the disciple who never seems to understand and, in particular, he is the faithless doubter who demands to touch the wounds of the resurrected Jesus. When he finds he is able to do so, he capitulates completely, demonstrating to the Thomas community that the risen Jesus had a palpable, physical body. Thus, John's literary Thomas serves to provide the refutation of his own community's beliefs.The book is a bit too narrowly focused, lacking a final chapter to tell us how the dispute proceeded past the 2nd century. Looking at Erickson's 'Christian Theology,' it looks like orthodox Christianity eventually came out somewhere in between, with some version Paul's idea of resurrection into a new \\"spiritual body\\" becoming widely accepted. This is not a disembodied soul, but neither is it a body of ordinary flesh. It is imagined to somehow derive from the physical body, but without being a mere resuscitation. While it retains its identity, it is transformed in composition, perfected, perhaps intangible, and eternal. People might differ about whether that mostly vindicates the community of John, or of Thomas."},{"Title":"Resurrection Reconsidered","review":"This book contains erudite material stated in straightforward terms. Contra William Lane Craig's published contention that the concept of resurrection in first century CE Palestine entailed physicality, Professor Riley demonstrates in no uncertain terms that the cultural milieu was thoroughly Hellenized and that original Christianity was closer to believing spiritual resurrection of the soul than fleshly resurrection. The author carefully traces the pre-Christian spiritual concepts of resurrection and their impact upon canonical and noncanonical literature. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Resurrection Reconsidered","review":"Gregory Riley establishes in \\"Resurrection Reconsidered\\" a chronologic flow of the belief systems from Hellenistic Greek and ancient Hebrew times down to the Christian Gnostic writings of Thomas. Prof. Riley here comes across with more specific references and demonstrated cohesion between one time period's influence on the next than his prior work \\"The River of God\\". He well establishes the Greek Homer/Plato immortal soul concept as the forerunner and influence for the Gnostic Thomas group's position regarding physical resurrection. He also shows the difficulty of lack of hard factual evidence to determine exactly what an everyday ancient Hebrew believed concerning the afterlife and the variety of fates the Hebrew Bible presents: no afterlife in Job, resurrection of the righteous only in Daniel, global resurrection in Isaiah, and then a review of the Christian scriptures which is just as, if not more diverse. He shows Paul's statements like 1Cor. 15:44-52 and 2Cor 5:8 discussing resurrected spiritual bodies at odds with the physical bodily resurrected Jesus of John 20 and Luke at Acts 26:8 as examples among others: \\"why is it considered incredible among you if God does raise the dead?\\" He goes on to demonstrate the John/Thomas follower controversy where the Thomas writings are in direct contrast to John/Luke. As the Book of Thomas declares \\"woe to you who hope in the flesh, in the prison which will perish.\\" Riley also well establishes how this question is \\"far too simplistic to substantiate\\" by viewing it as a mere contest between \\"Jewish belief in a physical resurrection vs. Greek immortal soul doctrine. The controversy continues down to this day. This work has a lot of information and is well researched for it's 180 pages."},{"Title":"Resurrection Reconsidered","review":"Behind the admirably exposed resurrection controversy between John and Thomas, I particularly appreciated how Riley gives evidence that the \\"historical\\" characters found in John serve to defend a doctrinal and community ideology. This is an important point as I consider that the same applies to the Synoptic Gospels. Jesus and the surrounding individuals given by Mark, Matthew and Luke are there to argue on evolving ideology within a community that changes from Essene to Christian. Riley did not consider this point of view in his remarkable book and I am curious to know what his thoughts are concerning the first three Gospels.Even with this lacunae, Riley had enough to debate on, his book is amongst the important publications that I keep on my bookshelves. A must."},{"Title":"Nothing but danger,","review":"I picked out this 1939 book from a batch of used ones because, after all, who can resist a title like \\"Nothing But Danger\\"?This book is a collection of journalists' personal accounts of covering the Spanish Civil War.

That turned out to be wildly optimistic.Far from being a primer on the Spanish Civil War, this books throws you into middle of the action, assuming you already know the characters and factions. I was frequently lost during the first half of this book, as I tried to sort out the events in a war that seemed to have more than two sides -- there were Carlists, Fascists, loyalists, Republicans, Communists, Governmentals, civil guards, \\"Reqetes\\" and more. Who was fighting whom?I finally realized I need some help, so I read the Wikipedia entry on the Spanish Civil War. I probably should have done something like that sooner.With the basics of the war underfoot you can appreciate the stories -- and there are some good ones here. I've always liked reading about war correspondents, and I found in these stories many similarities to reporters working nowadays in Iraq and Afghanistan. Just like reporters covering those modern-day wars, journalists in the Spanish Civil War scrapped together stories from fragments of reports, rumor and occasional first-hand experience. They had to do this through a fog of misinformation and confusion, often working through translators.Getting the story out was a big issue, due to balky telephone lines and government censors. One of the writers, Lawrence A. Fernsworth, discloses that he would sneak onto British warships when they docked in Spain, ride to a port in France, where he could send his story out, then sneak back onto the navy ship and return to Spain. Other reporters would make harrowing drives across the border to send their stories -- and get food -- then race back to the war. Some reporters fed dummy copy to the censors, then filed their stories in other ways.In a collection like this, the writing quality varies. Sometimes it's oddly distant and impersonal, with the writer reporting only events, not people. But on occasion it comes through with revealing insights of war. One reporter, Edmond Taylor, for instance, writes this:\\"It was a shock to me to see a real battlefield: not a picturesque inferno landscape, but an incredible kind of tinny littler, waste and destruction done by the soldiers themselves, like a filthy house, except that people other than soldiers don't smear human excrement all over their floors. I could see that there might be moments of great dignity in war so long as a man was on his feet, but not once he was hit and down. \\"The stories get better as the book goes on, and the best may be the last, \\"Escape from Disaster\\" by Keith Scott-Watson. This is the story of the grim last days of the war with starving, scared people rushing to the border in desperation. In one scene, Scott-Watson describes a crowd in search of bread.\\"The starving crowd was pushing its way towards the high yellow building where they sensed there was food. A tall gray-haired fury of a woman, a dead child in her arms hanging limply like a doll, seized a young conscripts's bayonet. The mob followed her. The troops were swept aside. Screaming women and children went down under the feet of the crowd. More came running down the narrow side streets to fight their way towards the food store. Hunger is uglier than death.\\"In short, there are some good stories here, but I probably would only recommend this book if you have an interest in the Spanish Civil War or the lives of war correspondents."},{"Title":"Language Acquisition: The Growth of Grammar (Bradford Books)","review":"Might be better for someone with a background in linguistics, or someone who at least has the jargon.

It is a book full of great hardship, death, and disappointment for almost all of the characters. I wouldn't recommend it for readers who like Jane Austen."},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"I must admit that I chose this book simply because I was intrigued by the idea of a New Zealand gold rush and wanted to know more. Rose Tremain has told a fantastic story and created a sense of mystic around the unique landscape. Not to mention an understanding of the gold fever afflicting those attracted to the gold rush fields.Although I did enjoy this book I did find it a little unsatisfying. There were some details that just did not make much sense and seemed just to serve to push the story along. I still do not know what was the purpose of including the detail about the spiritual connection between the little boy Edwin and his Maori nurse. Was it only to give the sense of it being a 'Kiwi' book and not some other gold rush country? Also I am still unsure why Joseph, who appeared at the beginning of the book a dependable kind of chap set on making a go of a farm on the other side of the world, would suddenly just abandon it, his wife and mother to hit the goldfields in a case of gold fever. But then again maybe that is the point of the book."},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"From the get-go, this book has two rare literary features going for it: one, it's set in New Zealand (and how many other books are set in New Zealand?), and two, it takes place during the New Zealand gold rush of the 1800's (yes, there was a New Zealand gold rush in the 1800's!). From page one, these two aspects alone, coupled with Tremain's simplistic yet powerful writing style, grab the reader's attention and demand that pages be turned.The story centers around a newlywed couple from England who decide to start their life anew- along with the husband's widowed mother- in the wilds of New Zealand, a country that is in many ways the opposite from that which they come. Unprepared for the extreme seasons and the difficulties of daily living, the husband decides to head to the treacherous west coast of New Zealand to join the gold rush once he discovers traces of gold (the colour of the title) on his own property. As the action follows the husband, and soon thereafter the wife, west towards the dangerous gold fields, several different characters find their way into the drama- fellow Englishmen, gold seekers, New Zealand natives, Chinese merchants- providing a more complete portrait of this hectic time in the history of a country not well documented in popular literature.What starts out as a straightforward yet powerful story of one couple's battle against nature (reminiscent of Knut Hamsen's early 20th century must read novel, \\"Growth of the Soil\\"), starts to get bogged down by the weight of history as Tremain attempts to stay true to the reality of the harsh gold rush. While many of the characters are memorable, at times it seems like there are too many fighting for attention, and what should be the heart of the story- two strangers trying to survive in a strange land- begins to lose out to side plots and minor detours.Rose Tremain is an excellent writer, and the topic and setting alone- New Zealand and its gold rush- are enough to make this novel worth reading. If, however, she had invested more time with her central characters and kept them at the heart of the action, \\"The Colour\\" would have been a great book, instead of merely a really good one."},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"The Colour is, on the surface, the story of a man and woman who flee England for different reasons to New Zealand in order to make their fortune. What could have been an ordinary, but hard life and... perhaps one of satisfaction and eventual comfort is taken away by a smattering of gold dust that appears in a trench that the man begins to build.And so the fever for gold takes root. Joseph and Harriet are married and living with Joseph's mother in \\"The Cob House\\", a rickety, temporary home built by Joseph in a place it should not have been. Joseph is fleeing from his past, and Harriet is fleeing toward a future promise of independence. Joseph hides crippling secrets and Harriet, in her pursuit of her dream, begins to uncover them.There were a few surprises for me in this book; the betrayal of loved ones, superstitions of the native New Zealand people, the love of a mother for her child and the ultimate disappointment it can bring. This wasn't a feel good book, but instead it was a real, gritty but still sensual picture of the Gold Rush taking place in New Zealand during the 1860's.It's very easy to see why this book made it to the 1001 Books to Read Before you Die list as it was an experience that, if I had not been exposed to the list, I probably would have never had. It's fascinating to me the questions and curiosity that can spark from reading a book about an event that you had no previous knowledge of."},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"Rose Tremain is a weaver of stories.

It's got great characters and is a really interesting story.(Sorry, I'm not going to deliver a page-long essay - you'll have to read it yourself!)"},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"The title of Rose Tremain's new novel refers to the glint of gold. Set during the 1860s gold rush in New Zealand, every character in the book is somehow touched by the crazed hunt for gold that eclipses all other possible occupations as the land is overrun by desperate miners and those who cater to them. It's a harsh world, driven by greed and deprivation, and utterly alien to the British newcomers, whose slender dreams are not strong enough to support their lack of knowledge and preparation.Joseph Blackstone tries to outrun a horrible, tragic secret by marrying and moving his new wife, Harriet, and his mother, Lilian, to New Zealand and starting a farm. These three traveling companions are not particularly well-matched: Lilian finds the adjustment from refined Englishwoman to farm work in a foreign country to be very difficult; Harriet is forced to realize that she does not love her new husband enough to make a success of their hard new life; and Joseph just isn't resourceful enough to adapt to the strange demands of his new situation. Mining for gold and making a quick fortune seem like an easy solution to their insurmountable problems. Other settlers have done so, and facing up to failure in the midst of others' successes adds a particularly bitter tone to Joseph's experiences.Joseph abandons his struggling farm and makes his way to the mining fields. This decision informs the fate of all three, and leads to surprising new developments. Joseph plummets to new levels of misery and disappointment in the mines, as success continues to elude him and his dark side reasserts itself. Harriet discovers unsuspected strengths; her bravery and compassion lead to bold choices and adventures. Lilian finds an unlikely, brief peace, but her death requires Harriet to search for Joseph in the mines, just in time for a catastrophic flood that annihilates the entire operation and changes the Blackstones' fortunes again.The symbolism isn't difficult to understand. Gold represents success and the newcomers' ambition to improve their grim, practically hopeless lots. But ambition can be a complex compulsion and Rose Tremain deftly explores what makes these people happy, what they really want, and what they will do to fulfill their dreams. It's interesting that it's never the gold per se that fuels them, but what even a little money will allow them to do. Prosperity, security, a new start, or amends for an old crime --- these things are more precious and require sacrifices.--- Reviewed by Colleen Quinn"},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"All of the characters in this book are believeable although not necessarily likeable. Harriet has a strength about her that was necessary if a woman was to survive during these hard times. Even her mother-in-law Lillian, who at first meeting appears to be weak and self-centered learns to adapt to the hard circumstances of their life. Joseph is a complex, distant, and distrusting man filled with a guilt that he himself does not seem to understand. The setting of New Zealand with its rugged terrain seems to almost become a character. All of the realistic and harsh aspects of this novel pulled me into the story. However, the mysterious &quot;spiritual&quot; world of the Maori nurse and her relationship to young Edwin seems out of place in the story. I was disappointed in this aspect of the book. The contrast between how the Maori reacted to the environment around them and how the English settlers reacted could have better developed. Overall, a really good historical fiction read"},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"The Colour is a well-written, engaging work of historical fiction, set in 1860's New Zealand. It reminded me of Allende's Daughter of Fortune and Smiley's The All-True Travels and Adventures of Lidie Newton, which are set around the same time period (although in different parts of the world) and have some similar characters and situations, but without being so similar as to feel derivative. Like those books, it also has some plotting issues, but is good enough to be worth a read anyway.Newlyweds Joseph and Harriet Blackstone arrive in New Zealand intending to start over; each married the other hoping for a new life, although they're barely acquainted. With Joseph's mother Lilian, they buy some land, build a house out of cob, and intend to start farming, but events don't go as planned. Then a gold rush comes along and changes everything.The Colour is on the more literary end of historical fiction: while it tells an engaging story, the pacing is not especially quick and much time is spent on character development, which is well-done. Joseph is fairly useless, but Tremain does a good job of writing him in such a way that readers can sympathize somewhat (where, if we didn't have his viewpoint, he would likely come across as an antagonist). Harriet is more traditionally likeable, but complex. Lilian might at first seem like a stock obnoxious mother-in-law character, but soon becomes much more well-rounded.The historical detail is worked into the story well, and there's a good sense of place with some evocative descriptions (although one key setting--the Hurunui gorge--is left almost entirely to the reader's imagination, as if it were intended to be more metaphorical than real). And the writing is good. There's something opaque about it, though: scenes that seem intended to have some great symbolic or metaphorical meaning that was not evident to me. Maybe the point was that life doesn't always make sense or turn out well--it's a melancholy book--but there's something rather distancing about Tremain's vision or her writing style that I didn't feel I entirely understood.My other issue with the book is plot-related. Toward the end, a romance comes out of nowhere, as if the author suddenly realized the book had no love story and threw one in, but without bothering to integrate it into the rest of the story. And there are a couple of secondary characters who have their own minor plotlines, but don't contribute much, seemingly there more to add ethnic color than anything else.Overall though, I did enjoy this book and would recommend it as a good work of historical fiction--if more melancholy and less willing to give up its secrets than the typical fare."},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"Rush, don't walk or even run, to buy this book! In this magnificent novel of the New Zealand gold rush of the 1860s, epic in scope but intimate in texture, Rose Tremain shows a power that her most recent book,THE ROAD HOME, only hints at, although her central concern of humanity triumphing through struggle remains the same.\\"The colour\\" is the miners' term for that gleam of gold that may -- or may not -- indicate the presence of a seam. It is a madness, a seduction that seldom brings satisfaction. Joseph Blackstone, newly arrived from England, glimpses the colour by a stream on the hardscrabble property he has bought near Christchurch on the east coast of the South Island. It seduces him into scanting on the proper establishment of his farm, failing to replace the temporary sod house by a permanent structure fit for his mother and his new wife, who have accompanied him from Norfolk. It leads him to join the gold rush on the inhospitable west coast of the island, leaving the women to fend for themselves.Joseph -- compulsive, driven, and pursued by an old guilt -- is not presented as a very sympathetic character. That role is given to Harriet, his wife. A former governess with a taste for adventure, she yearns for some means of proving herself, and ensuing events give her opportunities aplenty. She emerges as one of those strong pioneer women without whom none of the great nineteenth-century expansions would have been possible. But she is also a person of great sensitivity, with a true gift for friendship. It is she who, at her lowest ebb, forms a connection with the Orchards, owners of a successful sheep ranch nearby, finding a place in the life of their family that she is denied in her own. She is also a woman with strong emotional and physical needs; the chapter in which these are finally requited, in the most unexpected fashion, brought me to tears.And what of \\"the colour\\"? Gold is found and gold is lost, but the truly sympathetic characters in the book are those who do not make gold their god. The novel is framed by the mystery and awe of an untamed country (and its original people) on the one hand, and by the simple truths of everyday living on the other. At its heart, it is about love -- love denied in the usual ways, but triumphing in unexpected ones. Not since the novels of Jane Urquhart (THE STONE CARVERSand especiallyA MAP OF GLASS), writing about pioneers in Canada at the opposite end of the globe, have I read anything of this kind that has moved me so deeply."},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"The Colour, a novel by Rose Tremain, tells an epic story against the backdrop of great events and a stunning landscape. James and Harriet Blackstone have left Norfolk, England, to make a new life in the South island of New Zealand. They have built a somewhat makeshift house called the Cob and are prepared to eke out a subsistence from the mixed though meagre blessings that the land and climate can offer. Their marriage might not be loveless, but often both have to search very deep indeed to find something that might approach their individually desired contentment. There is a history we learn, especially on Joseph's side, a history in Norfolk which may have prompted the decision to leave.While her husband is hard-working, he is rather secretive by nature. Harriet, on the other hand, is patient, diligent and long-suffering. She is also innovative, strong and honest. She relates to her mother-in-law, Lillian, who has accompanied them to their new lives, and to her neighbours, whose little son becomes especially important in her own childless life. Joseph's mother, meanwhile, will clearly never settle in these unfamiliar surroundings and there are tensions to overcome.When news of gold in the region stimulate a rush, Joseph stakes a claim, hides his interests in the same way that he hides his emotions, and tries to make his fortune. Eventually his independence, his insistence on self-reliance, becomes his downfall. His life amongst the other prospectors and the suppliers of services that are attracted to their needs is beautifully described.Harriet, however, is eventually more resourceful. She takes it upon herself to trace a Maori girl whose input to a little boy's life could prove crucial. Her search takes her across cultures as well as across the landscape and, eventually, she discovers things of her own, things that endure.The Colour is a beautiful book that does not, however, achieve the total success it promises. Somehow, its whole is rather less than the sum of its parts. The tale and its characters are all beautifully drawn, but the historical perspective, the feel for landscape and the crossing of culture all fall a little short. These are minor criticisms, however, of a thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"The story is set in the late 1800's. Joseph Blackstone flees England with his new wife Harriet and his aging Mother in tow. He was looking to start a new life in New Zealand and flee from a darkness that clouds his conscience and existence. On the other hand, Harriet was restless and was sick of her humdrum life as a governess -\\"weary of owning nothing and going nowhere and spending her days by other people's meager fires. He wooed her with dreams of escape. She sat on the heart rug with her head on his knee and he described to her the paradise he would create on the other side of the world. It was his words which made her cling to him when he touched her.\\"Joseph buys uncultivated land in rugged New Zealand and constructs a humble home out of cob (lumps of clay and dirt) with his remaining capital. They intend to raise livestock and crops however Joseph happens to find gold in a creek running through his property - and begins to pan on the sly - not sharing his secret with his wife and Mother. Joseph and Harriet drift apart - what little drifting there was to be from a marriage that was hastily arranged - with love not being at the core of the union.Joseph eventually finds little Colour on his property and decides to abandon his mother and wife to join the gold rush. The story moves on to depict the struggles of Joseph finding gold - circumstances leading to Harriet to travel to join Joseph and the gold rush and engaging story developments that pull you along to the finish.Author's imagery throughout the novel is spectacular:\\"But Joseph understood that the men of a gold rush were like moths, going towards a golden light, and in time - inevitably - that light began to die, and so they hurried blindly on to the next and the next, always hopeful, but always aware of the enormity of the pursuing dark.\\"The main characters' introspection is woven through a terrific story:\\"Harriet preferred not to think about Joseph.

Great story..."},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"Three generations of men in my family have been/are involved in the gold mining industry. When I found a novel by Rose Tremain, a favourite author, about the 19th century gold rush of New Zealand, I had to buy it. And I'm glad I did!Whether she's describing the harsh wilderness that awaits the newly-wed English couple, Harriet and Joseph Blackstone, and Joseph's mother Lilian, on their arrival; the dangerous man-made wilderness of a mining camp, or the toll both take on the human psyche, stripping away all inessentials and reducing individuals to their most basic nature, Tremain's writing doesn't disappoint.With subtle twists and turns, the characters that inhabit this story must face deep truths about themselves. Those, like Joseph, who at first appear strong and reliable, disintegrate under the raw influence of the colour (gold) and their own secrets (Joseph's relationships with both Rebecca and Will are excruciatingly revealing.) Others, like Harriet, discover unexpected inner fortitude, while Chen Pao Yi, the Chinese vegetable peddler, reveals a quiet strength and sensitivity that is Harriet's salvation.Tremain's skill comes to the fore in her characterisations: although the cast of secondary characters is at times overwhelming, each character is drawn with such exquisite talent that their world is captivating.Without any overt moralising, THE COLOUR ends with a clear message: those who face life with a sense of entitlement (whether based on their gender, race, social status or sense of victimhood) will find life futile and meaningless, while those who face life's challenges with hope, courage and kindness will prosper both spiritually and materially.Tremain has written a novel that is both profound and entertaining. A remarkable achievement.(my paperback edition has a different cover)"},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"Having lived in Hokitika on the West Coast of the South Island, New Zealand, this book was of interest.

Jenny Patrick does the West Coast stuff much better."},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"In THE COLOUR Rose Tremain creates a wonderful insightful portrait of individuals drawn into the lure of the New Zealand gold rush in the mid-19th century. Newlyweds Joseph and Harriet Blackstone immigrate to the south island of New Zealand with Joseph's mother Lillian in order to begin a new life on a farm in the untamed countryside. As the Blackstone family settles down to their new life it soon becomes apparent that Joseph and Harriet's marriage is not based on any deep sense of love or devotion. In fact, they are becoming increasingly emotionally distant from each other each day. In addition each is fleeing from a disturbed past in Norfolk, England. After their first year in their new homestead their lives are forever changed when one day Joseph spots a glimpse of the colour, a New Zealand euphemism for the glimmer of gold, in their creek. Keeping is discovery a secret from his wife and mother Joseph soon abandons his dreams of farming and joins the thrust of the gold rush occurring throughout the country in his dreams of striking rich and securing a better life. After he leaves his farm and heads to the west coast Harriet is not far behind with her own agenda.This book is filled with wonderful images of the hard painstaking life of establishing a farm in the midst of the untamed New Zealand countryside. I felt sympathy for their ever-increasing struggles to remain on their farm. The descriptions of the harsh winters made me appreciate my warm apartment. One of the most interesting parts of this book dealt specifically with the gold rush. I was entranced by the descriptions of men buying mining licenses and claiming a spot of land in order to pan for gold while living in squalor - all the while clinging to the dream of striking rich and cashing in their fortunes. Also intriguing was the varied individuals who developed a business to accommodate the miners such as selling food, lodging, and sometimes their bodies. But despite my enjoyment of this section of this book, I was dismayed by the inclusion of the Maori woman and her connection with the little boy Edwin. Tremain appeared to feel a need to include a Maori storyline but it felt too forced for my own tastes. Furthermore, I felt the story of Pare didn't coincide well with the other storylines and her relationship with Edwin was eerie and unsettling. Regardless, THE COLOUR is a book that quickly grabs your attention and had me guessing the ending until the last couple of pages. I will definitely now read more books from Rose Tremain."},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"If stories were meals, this would be a roast dinner with steamed treacle pudding for afters! \\"The Colour\\" is a filling read.Tremain has delivered a story with a stunning landscape - New Zealand in the gold rush - a strong, believable female main character, and a story arc that keeps you reading to the bitter, sad, yet liberating end.Someone told me that a good book teaches you something concrete about life you didn't know when you read the spine. Tremain has taught me about the sharpness of grass, the fickle quality of gold and how to keep a cow warm.Priceless.Bunny"},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"Set during the 1860s New Zealand Gold Rush, Tremain's elegant, passionate tale of a British emigrant couple's fresh start in the rural outback, grabs the reader from the first page with its effortless evocation of place and character.Newcomer Joseph Blackstone has built his house in a summer spot, despite expert advice. As the season changes, he lies awake, worrying. \\"He rebuilt it in his mind in the lee of a gentle hill. But he said nothing and did nothing. Days passed and weeks and the winter came, and the Cob House remained where it was, in the pathway of the annihilating winds.\\"It was their first winter. The earth under their boots was grey. The yellow tussock grass was salty with hail. In the violet clouds of afternoon lay the promise of a great winding sheet of snow.\\"With Joseph is his new wife, Harriet, 34, grateful to be saved from a stultifying spinsterhood as a governess, and his widowed mother, Lilian, who spends the cold days mending china, broken on its long journey from home. Uprooted, alienated by this inhospitable place, Lilian is miserable, but Joseph and Harriet both have ardent hopes.Joseph has fled England with a terrible secret to put behind him. He believes that strong, capable Harriet will renew him \\"and living sensibly with her, without loathing and without damage, then, he believed, his past would slowly vanish. He would be able to grow old without it, just as, if a man is careful, he can grow old without yearning.\\"But, a product of his times as well as his nature, he begins by stifling Harriet's dreams, first refusing her desire to help in building the Cob House (a structure meant to be temporary, built of mud and grass), then denying her longing for a child. Though growing disappointed with her marriage, Harriet retains her optimism. She surveys her hard-won garden with satisfaction or looks out at the distant mountains with wonder and desire.Then, during a thaw after a devastating snow storm, with Harriet gone to get help from their richer, more established neighbors, Joseph finds gold in their creek. It's not much, but it sends him into a frenzy of feverish work and secrecy. Instinctively he hides the dust he's found and takes pains to keep his work from Lilian and Harriet. Though he finds no more, his obsession builds and when gold is found on the other side of the mountains he seizes the chance to escape his failed life and eroding marriage.The narrative continues to move between characters, primarily Harriet and Joseph, but also Lilian, and their neighbors, the Orchards. Tremain brings alive the privations, filth, obsession and excitement of the Gold Rush; the struggles of the two women to maintain their Cob House holding in the face of an onslaught of New Zealand elements; the even, tranquil tenor of life at the Orchards' ranch.Eventually Harriet gets to fulfill her longing to go into the mountains, only to find them impassable. Joseph's failure to find gold inflames his self-absorption with hatred for the world, and young Edwin Orchard becomes afflicted with a strange, Maori-inspired illness. Harriet perseveres, obligated to meet up with Joseph one last time and the novel rises to new heights of cataclysm and a romantic obsession so intense it moves at times into the surreal.With its majestic, forbidding landscapes, passionate characters and precise imagery, \\"The Colour\\" is a beautifully written novel and a riveting read. Though the setting couldn't be further from the ultra-civilized 17th century royal court of her last novel, \\"Music &amp; Silence\\" (winner of the Whitbread Award), Tremain's deft depictions of self-defeating narcissism, and (on the other hand) the human longing for experience beyond the ordinary, remain elemental themes.Not that the book is without flaws. The mystical connection between Edwin Orchard and his Maori nurse is more alienating and puzzling than intriguing and Joseph seems, at times, overwrought. Quibbles aside, this is a masterful novel with a story, setting and characters that will stick with you long after the last page is turned."},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"The Colour is a beautiful book. The characters inhabit a world that is vibrant, emotionally alive, daring with a host of smells and textures that pour from the page into your heart. It is an adventure story, a love story, a human story.The setting is 1860's New Zealand, and the characters are trying to survive in a brash, untamed land. With an unfurling of lives that is natural and compelling, Rose Tremain transports the reader into a world that is so real that the cold of the mountain torrents, and the unbearably heavy lightness of the snow, and the strange wonder of the birds and air and clouds sink into your bones and deep into your mind.Finishing this book was sweet sorrow. It all came full circle, but i didn't want to say goodbye. The world of The Colour, though, is as real as things seen only in the mind. Travel there yourself, and you won't soon forget the journey."},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"With remarkable skill Rose Tremain reconstructs New Zealand in the mid-nineteenth century, where newlyweds John and Harriet Blackstone build their new, if temporary, home. Accompanied by John's widowed mother, Lillian, a saturnine woman who longs to return to her beloved England, the three live together, separated by flimsy walls of calico. Sturdy and resourceful, Harriet falls in love with this open land, her flourishing vegetable garden one small retreat from an ill-suited marriage to a man either unwilling or unable to be a good husband.When John discovers a tiny amount of gold dust in their creek, he is infected with the fever for more, the same gold fever currently raging on the west coast of New Zealand. He hides this meager treasure from his wife, beginning a long process of denying the partnership with Harriet. His desire is single-minded and selfish, as dreams of wealth consume him. Disappointed with his negligible booty, John decides to board a ship and sail to the gold mines to seek his fortune and he intends to do so alone.John becomes one of the miners, obsessed and driven, common sense a thing of the past. With observations unflinching as a camera, Tremain captures the force of this lust, wherein the quest becomes the goal. Here is this drive, this need in exquisite detail, the lives of the miners and the claims that patchwork the landscape exposed like helpless suitors in pursuit of an inconstant lover. Meanwhile, purveyors of goods collect handsome amounts of currency, providing necessities to the miners, a cottage industry springing up wherever Gold Fever strikes.When Lillian dies and the newlywed's Cob House collapses from the onslaught of winter, Harriet goes after John to inform him of Lillian's death. Their first meeting is as awkward and formal as it was in the beginning of their relationship. Leaving John's camp, Harriet climbs higher, starting a claim near the produce garden of Chen Pao Yi, who sells his fresh vegetables to the miners.Given time, the miners would scramble over the land and wantonly purge it, without a thought to the devastation left in their wake. But, like a sleeping giant, New Zealand has only to shift while dreaming and the men are scattered and destroyed, the continent returned to its former pristine beauty. With one brutal stroke, nature intervenes, changing all their lives. Separated, John and Harriet struggle to survive and it is clear that John is the glass half empty, while Harriet is certainly the glass half full. Harriet enters a period of awakening, cherishing each moment as it comes, while John is tormented by loss and self-pity. And the gardener, Pao Yi, is fortunate as well, for he is essentially the water, without need of a glass at all, inhabiting his world with quiet acquiescence.Tremain is one of those accomplished writers who fleshes out her characters, all the trivial moments and secret longings that give them depth and believability, allowing the reader to understand these people in their flawed humanity. The colour, the gold, changes John, Harriet and Pao Yi intimately, each indelibly marked by this vast and awesome landscape.

I am in the process of buying all of her works! If pressed, I couldn't tell you which I liked best. Each one wove its own intricate tapestry and connected with a part of my heart and mind. It would be like asking who your favorite child was... until I was a mother, I would say 'there HAS to be a favorite', but now that I have my own tykes, I understand. Each is special and lovely in individual ways.The characters are complicated. You loathe one moment, but understanding prevails, and you can see the inner struggles and hurt, even as you steam. Though much less complicated than the others, in this story, my favorite character was/is Edwin. I wanted to snuggle him and protect him.Tremain has a wonderful, exquisite gift for writing. I was telling my husband that reading her books is akin to eating... it just leaves you 'full'. Each sentence is meant to be savored and enjoyed. While reading in bed one night, my husband asked me to read a sentence as an example of what I was referring to (this whole eating analody didn't sink in with him)... I didn't even have to search; I simply read the next sentence.Her books elicit in me such a profound sense of introspection and objectivity about others around me. For through the words of Rose Tremain, I am allowed to see into the hearts and lives of others, as if they actually were present and real. That I think of these characters even now, through many other novels, is deeply profound.The only downside is that now, I crave her work. I am anxiously awaiting my next novel and plan to devour it with relish..."},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"An historical novel set in New Zealand, there is much here that lays to rest the romance of the pioneer life. The famous beauty of New Zealand of today is intimidating and dangerous in Tremain's vivid descriptions. The people are largely tough, hardened types but are believable and they \\"grow\\" on you.I consider this a very rewarding read and recommend the book."},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"At the opening of \\"The Colour,\\" John Blackstone, his mother Lilian and wife Harriet, are huddled in their mud house, shivering through a freezing New Zealand gale. The cob house is especially drafty and cold because John would not listen to anyone's advice and has placed the house in the most disadvantageous place possible. You know from the start that this trio is in for trouble.After the death of his debt-ridden father, John sells everything remaining when the debt collectors are done with it and takes his mother and new bride to the opposite side of the world for a fresh start. It is the mid-19th century and New Zealand seems as good a place as any to start a farm. But John's decisions are weirdly off-kilter, making everything even harder than it need be. Lilian plots her escape, and Harriet wonders what happened to the fleeting bliss she and her new husband knew while preparing to emigrate. Something is wrong here, something that is exacerbated by the discovery of gold-\\"the colour\\" of the title.This is a rich and mysterious novel, a place where grueling days of sodbusting meet the cloudy mountains of a dreamtime. Rose Tremain has the ability to imbue her story with the kind of deep emotion that cannot be described and do it in a most readable fashion. The setting and the characters of \\"The Colour \\" all ring true, including the mystical ties between an English child and a Maori woman. This is an worthy addition to Rose Tremain's earlier novels, which are worth checking out if you haven't done so already. Her books are notable for their strong historical detail and unusual emotional frisson. ---Reviewed by Candace Siegle"},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"The Colour is set in 1860s New Zealand, a time of mad rush for gold as well as nation-building fueled by heavy immigration. Newlyweds Joseph and Harriet Blackstone arrive from England with Joseph's widowed mother Lillian in tow. Joseph acquires some land, builds a temporary house, and they begin the work of establishing a farm. But Joseph is distracted by gold fever after finding some of \\"the colour,\\" and he is haunted by memories of the heinous act that led to his flight from England.Meanwhile, Harriet comes to regret hastily marrying a man she barely knew. He was her ticket to something new and exciting, but she finds she cannot love or even like her parsimonious, affectionless husband. She is smarter and more resourceful than Joseph, and he resents her for it.Eventually, the Gold Rush leads both Joseph and Harriet into experiences that test their mettle in ways they never could have guessed at when they dreamed of a new life in a new land. Joseph is found sorely lacking in character and fortitude, while Harriet discovers her hidden reserves of strength, determination, and self-sufficiency.This is a rather meditative and often melancholic work. Rose Tremain gets deep inside the hearts and minds of the characters, sifting through their hopes and despairs and secret motivations. This is where her writing really shines.I identified most strongly with Harriet. I could appreciate her growing desire for solitude, her love of animals and unbounded Nature, and her ability to go with the flow in a practical way. I was glad that her practical acceptance was eventually rewarded, and I can see her living out her future in a contentment very different from the one she'd envisioned.As for Joseph Blackstone, I think he's a weak and pathetic excuse for a man. He doesn't recognize the treasure he has in Harriet and doesn't deserve her. He has a stinginess of spirit that pervades every relationship and endeavour of his life. He sees other people only as stepping stones or obstacles to his own selfish ends, and he's utterly lacking in self-knowledge.The \\"supporting cast\\" of characters is also very memorable. There's Pao Yi, the gentle Chinese vegetable seller with his makeshift opium den. And the robust, enthusiastic, generous Toby and Dorothy Orchard on their very successful sheep run. And also Pare, the Maori woman caught alone between the two worlds, desperately wanting to do right by everyone, white or native.I enjoyed moving through this story at a slower than usual pace, and I strongly recommend it for the character studies as well as a rich introduction to historical New Zealand."},{"Title":"The Colour","review":"Strong women may not usually capture the centre of attention in a wild west survival story - it's a men's world after all. Yet, Harriet deserves her spotlight! Set against the background of New Zealand's gold rush in the 1860s, Rose Tremain has crafted a memorable, vividly coloured historical drama, that revolves around immigrants Joseph Blackstone and his new wife, Harriet. New Zealand's spectacular landscapes and the country's havoc creating extreme weather vagaries, powerfully evoked throughout the novel, are merged as an integral part into the story and adding to its sense of drama.The young couple, together with Joseph's mother, Lillian, embark on a farm life that none are prepared for. Tensions abound as the precariousness of their survival becomes evident, in particular during their first winter in the wilds around Christchurch. Three isolated and solitary people, each is preoccupied with attempting to overcome unresolved issues of their past life back in Norfolk, England. Joseph hides some shameful crime from his former life that comes back to haunt him with increasing intensity and is revealed to the reader in small portions. His secret is isolating him even more from his wife in particular. He becomes wary of his wife's positive attitude and growing self-confidence - \\"a woman as tall as he\\". When, by their creek, he discovers a few specks of gold, the 'colour', he is ecstatic and frantically searches for more. While no more gold is found and he manages to hide his find from his wife, his obsession can no longer be contained. He abandons the faltering farm and declares that joining the new wave of gold diggers on the other side of the country will be their financial rescue and salvation.Harriet, while still expecting ongoing domestic contentment, has also been changing. Discovering Joseph's gold secret adds to her increasing disenchantment with her current life. Tremain sensitively captures Harriet's character and evolving personality. She conveys the new sense of confidence that sees Harriet blossom and explore new and sustaining friendships in the neighbourhood. Eventually, the young woman decides that seeking clarification in her relationship to Joseph will be essential for her own future. She embarks on a journey across the mountain to the South Island to find her husband among the gold diggers. The author's description of Harriet, the solitary woman on a horse, in the midst of a wild bunch of rough and reckless diggers is vivid and shows Tremain's deep empathy for the fate of the young woman.Harriet had agreed to undertake another task during her solitary quest across the country: her young friend Edwin, gifted with unusual spiritual powers and in something resembling a mental dialogue with his former Maori nanny, Pare, needs Harriet to find her in the mountains. It is a life and death situation. While the sub-plot of Edwin and Pare moves the story possibly a bit too much into magical realism, the rest of the narrative is very strongly grounded in the realities of the time. Tremain's detailed description of the desolate living conditions that the diggers endure, their fixation to find \\"a homeward bounder\\" of gold that would relieve them, in one stroke, from all their worries and suffering, makes gloomy reading. Some characters, though, stand out, exquisitely captured by the author: young Will Sefton, a street urchin transported into the diggers' camps and especially Chen Pao Yi. Pao Yi came from China to seek his fortune, less as a gold digger than as a gardener and supplier of essentials to the different camps along the river. His life stands in stark contrast to that of the diggers. And then, one day, a sudden natural disaster threatens the survival of all those digging and living along the river and its vicinity... There is a moral undertone to the novel: in the end, those individuals who are least obsessed with the 'colour' have the author's attention and they have the best chance to gain the most in terms of humanity, dignity and happiness.

It's chock full of useful tips and information and a must-have for any Makin' Magic fan. The first half of the book is a basic recap of the original \\"Sims\\" for anyone who doesn't already know how to play ;-) The second half details \\"Makin' Magic\\", everything from how to raise your dragon to spell lists to dueling tips. I found several sections especially helpful...A chart listing all the spells/charms and cookbook recipes and their ingredients was especially time-saving as I no longer had to keep running back to the family spell book/cookbook to check ingredients.

As with every pack, a prima game has released a strategy guide. There is something you have to understand before you purchase this item. Yes, it is helpful in figuring out what to do for the first few days, but almost all the information included you could look up on the internet. Also for the SEVENTH time now, over half of the book is devoted to the original Sims, while only the last part is set aside for the new expansion pack. It says in the book this is for all the people who have only the expansion that the book is talking about, but by this point almost everyone who is buying Makin Magic has at least one other expansion. This book is 240 pages long, and the Makin Magic section doesn't start until page 129. Every time a new expansion comes out, I buy it and the strategy guide, to see if they have changed their ways. I have been disappointed. This is a HUGE waste of trees and resources, not to mention money.

There also aren't any cheats in this book like there are for the rest of the books (on the rest of the expansion packs). Overall, I found this to be a bit of a disappointment.

They had even sent him to Washington. Captain Free, they said, when they thought how he had fought for the freedom of the colonies a year before the Declaration of Independence. But few of them remembered that he had been Henner Dellicker in the old country, where he was born beside the Neckar; or the tale of his voyage to the new land in the crowded and starved emigrant ship; or his indentured service in the rich Bayley house in Philadelphia; or of the cruel dicipline that Miss Amity visited upon him; or how he fled the King's jailers to the wild frontier, and returned later to settle his accounts with Miss Amity in a way he had not expected.In The Free Man, Conrad Richter has written of those early Americans who were among his own forbears - the sturdy, courageous, hard-working, liberty-loving Palatine Germans who with the Alsatians and Swiss came to farm Pennsylvania and stayed to win their collective freedom on the battlefields of the Revolution."},{"Title":"The free man,","review":"&quot;The Free Man,&quot; is not Conrad Richter's best work of historical fiction, but it's better by far than most other works in the same genre. It's the story of Henner Dellicker, a German immigrant, who comes to America as an indentured servant, escapes, prospers as a trader, then distinguishes himself during the American Revolution on the side of the colonists. At the beginning of the novel, Dellicker is a well-respected merchant,freedom fighter and retired statesman, enjoying his golden years. For a local historian, he recalls his arrival to the colonies and how he is tricked into indentured servitude. The ensuing story of Dellicker's life of virtual slavery and his subsequent escape correct an overlooked chapter in the development of our country: the injustices of indentured servitude. Dellicker's service as a military leader and peacetime politician also highlights the contributions of the Pennsylvania Dutch to the USA's development as a strong nation.While the novel contains Richter's typical passion for accuracy in historical detail and in the spoken language of the early Americans, it does lack the powerful plotting that exists in his other novels. Dellicker's later marriage to the woman who purchased his contract seems rather rushed and tacked on, as if to satisfy the need for a romantic subplot.This aside, &quot;The Free Man&quot; uses its historic setting to correct several ommissions in popular history of the contributions of German settlers, and in the contradictions of the indentured servitude system. Stephanie Grauman Wolf, in her afterword, suggests Richter hoped to ease mistrust and hostility directed towards German-Americans during World War II (when this was written) by demonstrating their deep roots in our country's history. Despite this rather strained moral, this book is at its best when it depicts how one determined person, regardless of country of origin, can make a better life for him- or herself in a country filled with promise, and help build that country into a strong nation. In the end, it's not important what country Dellicker is from, but rather what his immigration and subsequent success represent: that the USA was built by immigrants looking for a better life for themselves."},{"Title":"The free man,","review":"This book arrived four days after I ordered it.

First, it is very rare and unique--a must for comic collectors and afficiandos. Second, it is a prime example of Nixon propaganda. Third, but most important, it was illustrated by the great Geo Wildman!Wildman, a lifelong resident of Connecticut, studied advertising at what is now the Paire College of Art. During the 1950s, he was a successful commercial artist, first working for an ad agency, and then becoming a freelance artist. During this time, he began producing freelance comic book art for Charlton Press in Derby, Connecticut.When King Comics ceased publication of their POPEYE title, Charlton acquired the rights. Longtime writer-artist Bud Sagendorf was busy with the daily and Sunday newspaper comics, and declined the job of continuing. George Wildman was offered a contract to produce the POPEYE illustrations, with prolific Joe Gill writing scripts. The first Charlton issue of POPEYE appears in 1969, the final one in 1977. Wildman was hired as assistant editor to Sal Gentile, and in 1971 was promoted to managing editor, and eventually executive editor. Assistant editor Nicola Cuti wrote several of the later POPEYE scripts for Charlton.Wildman's tenure as editor continued through 1985, while Western Publishing picked up POPEYE under their Gold Key and/or Whitman trademarks. Bill Pearson, by then assistant editor at Charlton, began writing scripts, and Wildman produced illustrations while off-duty from Charlton. Their crowning achievement was the epic 50th anniversary special published in 1979.Thanks to the Robert Altman POPEYE movie, a demand for Popeye-related merchandise led to Wildman's working for Random House, illustrating a classic \\"Pop-Up Book\\" which became a best-seller and later a display at the Smithsonian Institution. Wildman was also invited to produce a painted wooden Easter egg for the White House Easter event, his egg also now housed in the Smithsonian. Around this time, the National Cartoonists Society awarded him \\"Best Cartoonist, Humor Division.\\"Western Publishing ceased its comics line in the early 1980s, and Wildman retired from Charlton Comics in 1985, moving into a freelance comic book and children's book illustration career. His pencils, inks and paints graced publications featuring Disney, Hanna-Barbara, Harvey and Warner Brothers characters along with countless designs for various businesses.In 1994, George and wife Trudy Wildman were honored in a gala festival in Chester, Illinois, celebrating the 100th birthday of the creator of Popeye, Elzie Crisler Segar. Wildman received the Popeye Fan Club's Lifetime Achievement Award and performed a sketching show to a standing-room-only crowd. A return visit to Chester in 2004, to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Popeye, found Wildman teamed with Hy Eisman, the writer-artist of the Sunday POPEYE newspaper strip since 1994.Today, Wildman and son Karl operate their own advertising agency, producing computer animation, greeting cards, and a wide variety of products. Wildman's work is seen regularly in the \\"Hidden Pictures\\" publications of HIGHLIGHTS FOR CHILDREN. He celebrated his 80th birthday in 2007 and continues to receive mail from Popeye fans around the world."},{"Title":"Second Wind: the Memoirs of an Opinionated Man","review":"This is a highly entertaining, funny, and tightly written memoir. Anyone interested in ghostwriting should read this book. Taylor Branch does a wonderful job with structure, with each chapter reading like a thematic essay, rather than a chronological depiction of events. I couldn't put the book down.Russell is a wily and stubborn yet unconventionally thoughtful persona. Russell was an avid student and his opinions, while unorthodox, make a lot of sense, and thus are very humorous. His qualms with the idolization of sports stars, for example, manifest in funny anecdotes about fans seeking autographs and Red Auerbach trying to retire his jersey. And though Russell tries to depict his life in unromatntic terms - the final scene is of him giving up his clim of Mt Ranier - his story is inspirational. The path he takes from rural, segregated Louisiana - where his peers believe in ghosts - to media superstar is dramatic.My favorite section in the book is the part where Russell describes Sam Jones's ability to take over a game, but Jones's refusal to do it very often. Jones didn't want the responsibility, he says, which confuses his teammates. The juxtaposition of Jones's great abilities to his listless and uncooperative sides was captivating. This is by far the best sports memoirs, and one of the best memoirs period, I've ever read."},{"Title":"Second Wind: the Memoirs of an Opinionated Man","review":"Bill Russell writes as he played; with controversy and excellence.

He says what he thinks and has a great philosophy of life.This book was written in 1979, but is even more important today, as we are besieged with athletes with big salaries and even bigger egos.This book reveals a social as well as athletic history.

It takes a boy from humble beginings to being on top of the world."},{"Title":"Second Wind: the Memoirs of an Opinionated Man","review":"I have probably read a couple thousand books in my life. Fiction, nonfiction, history, technology, biography, etc. If I had to choose a top ten, this would be one of them.Admittedly, I'm a 6'10\\" guy who loves basketball, but many jock biographies are shallow, predictable and boring. This is none of those. He discusses the painful periods of his life, not just the successes. As stated elsewhere, only about a third of the books is about basketball. He is an African American man from the south who came of age during the 1950s, then spent his entire professional career in a place where people of his race were not treated well.Mr. Russell is an intelligent, thoughtful, and (as the title states) opinionated man. You don't have to agree with him, but his positions come from a lifetime of experience and contemplation. Jim Crow, identity politics and racial profiling are all discussed in this memoir. There is a humorous anecdote where he is pulled over for DWB (driving while black).As a basketball player, he won 11 NBA titles in 13 years. Think about that. That's Jordan plus Kobe. Throw in two NCAA titles and Olympic gold. Yes, he had tremendous ability, but you may be surprised by his deep analysis of the game. Have you ever thought about how you could use the blindspots in your opponents eyes to your advantage? Bill Russell has. And as they say in infomercials, \\"wait, there's more\\".His co-author, Taylor Branch, is also a historian of the civil rights movement. Another clue that this is not your typical sports book.I first read this book over thirty years ago, and have read it at least once in every decade since then. I realize it is no longer in print, and I wish there was an ebook edition, but if you like biographies, you will find it worth your time. If you are a basketball fan, even better. It may make you think differently about the state of game today."},{"Title":"Second Wind: the Memoirs of an Opinionated Man","review":"This is one of the best sports memoirs I've ever read. He's totally introspective and delves into every aspect of his life across different sections of his life. As I saw it, this book went through three parts of his life in order --* The first part of the book is about growing up, his family, school, and maturation.* The second part is about basketball.* The third part is all about his social life, divorce, philandering, and life post-basketball.Mr Russell seems to keep his comments about other people above the belt and doesn't level any attacks, but he doesn't hold back when saying things about *himself*; he's totally critical of himself and lays out scores of mistakes that he made over his life, explaining the decisions he made at the time and how they looked in hindsight. Every portion of the book was equally enthralling to me, from his Grandpa knocking out a mule with a punch, learning to jump in college and looking down into the hoop, and all of the crazy women he dated during his career. It's a story of growth and learning full of terrific anecdotes about basketball and life. Get it."},{"Title":"Second Wind: the Memoirs of an Opinionated Man","review":"Having watched Bill Russell play many times in the 1950s with the great Celtic teams I had to read this book and am glad I did. It shows what people can accomplish from hard work form humble beginnings. I was surprised Russell grew up in Louisiana, but soon moved to CA where he eventaully led the Univ. of San Fransisco to the NCAA title. It is interesting to note how coach Red Auberbach of the Celtics saw in him the skills that would make Boston NBA champs.

The work is a careful, well-documented study of nationalism and ethnic prejudice, and chronicles the power and violence of these two ideas in American society from 1860 to 1925. He significantly moves beyond previous treatments of nativism, both in chronology and in interpretive sophistication. Higham defines nativism as a defensive type of nationalism or an intense opposition to an internal minority on the grounds of the group's foreign connections. By defining nativism as a set of attitudes or a state of mind, he sets the course for his book as tracing \\"trace an emotionally charged impulse\\" rather than \\"an actual social process or condition.\\" As he argues that the ideological content of nativism remained consistent, he uses emotional intensity as a measure to trace in detail public opinion from the relative calm following the Civil War to the Johnson-Reed act of 1924 that severely limited European immigration.Strangers in the Land is, then, a history of public opinion, whose purpose is to show how nativism evolved in society and in action. Higham seeks to explain what could inflame xenophobia and who resisted it. He saw his work as part of a renewed interest in the study of nationalism following the national upheavals in the wake of the McCarthy hearings. Surely Higham's mentor at the University of Wisconsin, intellectual historian Merle Curti, influenced Higham's approach in seeking to examine the power of nationalism as an idea. Also influential was the intellectual climate of the 1950s with its of distrust of ideology and distain of prejudice. Higham admits being repelled by the nationalist delusions of the Cold War, again helping to explain why his study concentrates on seeking some explanation for the irrational and violent outbreaks. The book thus focuses on points of conflict, \\"antagonisms that belong within ideologies of passionate national consciousness.\\" For example, Higham's explains the 100 percent American movement in terms of progressive ideals and the desire of Americans to shape immigrants into a particular ideal of \\"Americanness\\" through education and assimilation. This intellectual construct eventually gave way to the racial thinking to which Higham assigns much influence in the efforts to restrict immigration. Ideology is also central to his chapter on the history of the idea of racism in which he argues that Anglo-Saxon nationalism, literary naturalism and a nascent understanding of genetics combined to bring forth arguments for immigration restriction to preserve the racial purity of the American people. Thus, key for Higham's argument is the power of ideas in shaping individual behavior and thereby shaping history.This text is an absolute must-read for anyone seeking to understand American nativism and the darker side of nationalism"},{"Title":"Strangers in the land;: Patterns of American nativism, 1860-1925","review":"... none that has been identified at least, but \\"nativism\\" does have some of the marks of what Richard Dawkins has called a \\"meme\\" - derived from the word 'memory' - a kind of evolutionary package of cultural 'knowledge'. Like genetic packages, cultural patterns are inherited and thus inherent, and like genes, 'memes' can be efficiently re-adapted to other functions than their originals.\\"Strangers in the Land\\" is a classic study of American Nativism from the Civil War to the 1920s. By no coincidence, the same era was the heyday of Jim Crow, of lynchings and ethnic cleansing directed against African-Americans. The hatred directed against Catholics by nativist movements merged eventually into the hatred of \\"blacks\\" in the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan, the acme of Nativism. But this same era was also the heyday of American anti-Semitism, culminating in the exclusion acts passed by Congress against Eastern European Jews as well as Sicilian Catholics. That anti-Semitism - like it or not, Americans - played an enabling part of Hitler's unchallenged ascent to power and in the Holocaust, when America kept the door closed to Jewish escapees. And let's not forget that nativism and anti-immigrant bigotry lay at the core of the exclusion acts against Chinese and Japanese, who might have sought freedom and opportunity in \\"Beikoku\\" - \\"Beautiful Country\\", the name used in Japan then for America.In other words, as author Higham demonstrates, bigotry/nativism is a \\"pattern\\" - his use of that word seems to me to approach the idea of a meme - that can serve the cause of hatred and exclusion of any ethnic/racial/religious minority. And it's almost always evident that bigotry expressed toward one minority merely temporarily masks bigotry felt towards all \\"others.\\" Today's nativist fear and loathing of \\"wetbacks\\" and \\"islamicists\\" contains all the memetic material needed for tomorrow's recrudescent anti-Semitism and societal persecution of.... ___________.

Though he does all he can to show nativists in a bad light and foreigners in a good light, the very facts he presents tell a different story. He identifies three main pro-immigrant forces: cosmopolitan ideologues and sentimentalists, business interests greedy for cheap labor, and foreign ethnic lobbies. Most telling is the fact that, by 1925, immigrants themselves were the only remaining opponents of immigration restriction, which only goes to show that they believed their real compatriots to be the ones back in the Old Country, not here in the new."},{"Title":"Saving Grace (Harlequin Presents No. 1543)","review":"Saving Grave by Carole MortimerHarlequin Presents # 1543 - April 1993Two years ago Jordan Somerville-Smythe's whole life had been shaken causing him to question his own identity. Jordan and his partner are interested in purchasing an estate in the country for conversion into a leisure center. Anyone of Jordan's assistants could have made the trip to coax the woman who owns the estate, now operating as a B & B, but Jordan feels a need to get away. And when he's greeted at the door by an elderly woman and mistakenly identified as an expected guest, Jordan doesn't correct her mistake. He's surprised to learn that the owner is not the elderly woman who opened the door, but a young redheaded beauty barely old enough to be on her own let alone raising her seven year old brother and running the massive household. Grace Brown knows immediately that Jordan is not the expected border, but she doesn't let on. There's something about this attractive man that reaches out to Grace and she has the intense urge to hug him and offer comfort. Grace knows that from that moment on her life will be forever changed.This is a lovely story of healing and the strong loyalties to family. Jordan and Grace share the early loss of their parents and the responsibilities of raising their siblings; Jordan his sister, and Grace her brother.

Although it is not aimed at addressing this issue directly, the title might lead the casual observer to the wrong conclusion. This book highlights the Tendai Japanese vajrayana tradition, and goes very in-depth in describing tantric practices. Very detailed descriptions of mudras (hand movements) and other practices provide the reader with a depth and breadth of information which reveal the truer nature of tantra. An ordained Tendai priest (one of probably less than 10 non-Japanese Tendai priests), he was required to do 30 straight days of running practice (you'll have to read the book) before he was taught some of the information found in &quot;Tantric Art&quot;. His descriptions of the use and purpose of mandalas show us that the mandala paintings found in New Age book stores have got the process backwards. Mandalas are representations of meditative experiences made after masters had the experience, not fanciful imaginings that the artist hopes will produce meditative experiences. Those interested in vajrayana Buddhism will find this a valuable tool to compare with Tibetan vajrayana on an in-depth level. There is little in the way of philosophy, it is mostly a description of the practices and explanation of how and why they function as they do."},{"Title":"Selected from It Was on Fire When I Lay Down on It (Writers' Voices Series)","review":"Robert Fulghum's style of writing is unique - simple yet deep and provocative.This book (like his other books!! ) has the power to touch your life with the wonder of simple ideas.

Whether a school story is a work of literary art such as Snow's The Masters or Antonia White's Frost in May, a decent novel in the vein of Hughes's Tom Brown's School Days, Kipling's Stalky and Co., or Farrar's Eric, or even the kind of boarding-school story churned out by the likes of Angela Brazil and the author of the Greycliff series, school stories tend to hold one's interest because they are school stories. Generally written by one with insider knowledge, such books seem to reveal not only the characteristics of a society in microcosm, but also the particular stresses and strains imposed by intimate, closed worlds.Snow's The Masters is perhaps the supreme example of this genre. A perfectly plotted and self-contained novel filled with unforgettable characters (Mrs. Jago, the embittered Despard-Smith and the beautifully-realized Professor M. H. L. Gay come to mind), The Masters is certainly C.P. Snow's best work. Snow's college world is no ivory tower. Passions and ruthless hatreds surface as two factions clash over the election of a new Master of a Cambridge college. The power brokers Chrystal and Brown display their practiced adroitness as they machinate to put their candidate in office and angle for a major benefaction from a wealthy industrialist. Political overtones from the outside world (the novel is set iduring the period of Hitler's rise to power) begin to agitate the election question further. This is a novel to read again and again."},{"Title":"The Masters: A Novel","review":"The Masters concerns an election of the head of a college in England by the masters (professors) at the school. Snow skillfully illustrates to us the politics of small groups, and how very different those politics are from politics in a broader sense. This book is one of the Strangers and Brothers series, but it reads very nicely as a stand-alone work. The Masters is a good read, in which we follow the partisan manuvering of two factions seeking different candidates in the school election. Snow's style is straightforward, almost a latter-day Trollope, and his ideas are very insightful. This is a classic, which deserves to be more read."},{"Title":"The Masters: A Novel","review":"I'd urge you to read this one. Few people describe the inner life of men, or at least his class of 20th century Englishman, so well as Snow. The characterisations are the strength, all vanities and motivations probed as if by a surgeon, though the &quot;closed&quot; politics plot is entertaining enough. Other reviewers list their favourite characters, I'd plump for Winslow and Brown myself. Beautiful writing style."},{"Title":"The Masters: A Novel","review":"C.P.Snow has some fine qualities; he is succinct, perceptive and astute. This novel, perhaps to a greater extent than any of his others, reflects these qualities as \\"The Masters\\" is a triumph of characterisation. Jago, Brown, Calvert, Nightingale and Gay will live long in the memory and the understated way in which Snow brings them to life is most adroit. Ultimately, however, like all of the Strangers and Brothers sequence, it is a novel about the narrator, Lewis Eliot; the relationship between tale and teller here is particularly impressive. The reader becomes unconsciously embroiled in and fascinated by his life - here is a narrator who is both partial and impartial, intense and detached. The claustrophobic, parochial and insular world of academic life is captured perfectly here. I recommend it highly; for anyone who has read it and enjoyed it, I commend to their attention \\"The Affair\\" by the same author. Set in the same Cambridge college, many of the characters reappear and it is another very fine read."},{"Title":"The Masters: A Novel","review":"Another terrific book , supposedly the best in the series (\\"Strangers and Brothers\\"), but I think that several others are possibly better. And, really, it ends so dismally. Although I guess any other way would be too trite, and I'm quite sure that this is based on some real event in Snow's life, as I feel all the books are. The dons are all so sharply drawn, each clear in his own character. And the eating and drinking they constantly did! I guess they walked a lot. I loved it. The intrigues and politics that Snow writes about, are worthy of any Washington lobbyist. Except that here we are at Cambridge."},{"Title":"The Masters: A Novel","review":"This book came up in discussion since we were talking about the historian Hugh Trevor-Roper and it was mentioned that he may have been a model for one of the characters in the book. I usually consider such suggestions homework and so got the book and read it with great interest. It certainly was an interesting study of men interacting over the nature of their status in a close knit group in an institution with a great sense of tradition regarding the status and promotion of individuals to offices in the college. I found it odd that hardly any description of the Fellows interaction with their students was part of the book though certainly that would have been off the theme. But it left the impression that most time spent is done in meetings and over drinks or meals. Throw in a few walks now and then. There was no discussion regarding their studies except for those of a scientific mind who were working on their experiments, or the individuals love for the subject was viewed as mildly annoying in the case of Professor Gay. All in all it was certainly a worthwhile read and I have done my homework for the week."},{"Title":"The Masters: A Novel","review":"How does an assortment of 13 professors at an English university choose the next head of their college? \\"The Masters\\" examines the personal and university politics that shape this decision through the narrative style of C. P. Snow. This captures a brainy professorial world through heavy reliance on complex and conditional dialogue, acute but unspoken observations, and highly abstract character analysis. Here's an example of his approach: \\"His manner was deliberately prosaic and comfortable. He was showing less outward sign of strain than any of us; when he was frayed inside, he slowed his always measured speech, brought out commonplaces like an amour, reduced all he could to the matter-of-fact.\\" Still, the story, while minutely imagined, doesn't go deep. It's a tempest in a teapot."},{"Title":"The Masters: A Novel","review":"The masters is the best loved of C. P. Snows works and a part of the series of novels that he eventually called 'Strangers and Brothers'. The overall theme of the novel is the behavior of men in a small closed society as they strive for advancement, respect and authority. Charles Snow was a master at portraying and understanding men and women although some critics have found fault on the latter score. The story, as in all of the 'Strangers and Brothers' series, is told by a semi-outsider Lewis Elliot and when I met Snow in 1970 he told me that Elliot was a man that we could all respect. \\"He is 'strangely' above all of our own mortal failings,\\" he joked at the bar of the University of Warwick. If you don't know Snow, please start with 'The Masters'. As a background read, find a copy of the book by his brother Philip Snow. Avoid at all costs the terrible TV serialization of Strangers and Brothers. Incidentally, Snow did slightly edit 'The Masters', for the three-volume composite collection called Strangers and Brothers but nothing of any significance. Note the dedication to G H Hardy, his great colleague at Cambridge."},{"Title":"The Masters: A Novel","review":"I first read the Strangers and Brothers series years ago, and avidly went from one to the next. I vividly remember loving them, the situations, the people, the writing. So, I thought I would read them again, several decades later.I was struck by how very much of a time and place they are, and how the English reticence and manners in the first half of last century shaped the conversations and relationships in the novels.Much is made of a glance, a start, or an averted face.Events unfold in their own pace, and the life and customs living in Cambridge and within a college are detailed and evocative.The Masters is about the succession plans for the leadership in a college when the master is dying, and when he does die, how the decision is made by the fellows. It is decidedly a period piece, but once into it, there is something compelling about the world and the people created by Snow."},{"Title":"The Masters: A Novel","review":"Lewis Eliot learns from Paul Jago that Vernon Royce, the Master of the college, has inoperable cancer. Roy Calvert is a student of the Master and a beloved friend of the family. It is believed that the Master's daughter Joan is half in love with Calvert. The Master's wife, Lady Muriel, decides to keep the true state of things a secret from the Master. The Master is to be told he has an ulcer and needs rest.Brown orders a bottle of claret to celebrate the achievement of Winslow's son. Young Luke and the other named members of the college discuss the Master's circumstances. Crystal and Brown are both capable of running things. They believe a Master can be found inside the college. It is believed that Crawford and Jago will be considered for the post.It is learned that Nightingale and Pilbrow are back from vacation. The oldest among them, Gay, is subject to a flickering memory. He seems to forget that Royce is the current Master. Nightingale has been frustrated, unlucky, and envy has never left him alone. He is a theoretical chemist. At one time he had promise. Roy Calvert has always found the intimate formality of the college humorous.Lewis says that his choice is Jago. Arthur Brown is for Jago and Chrystal thinks he can manage him. Brown actively dislikes Crawford and has regard for Jago. Brown is a politician by nature. Brown, Eliot, and Chrystal go to see Jago. Mrs. Jago is a sensitive sort who with her temperament drives Jago's friends away from him. It is anticipated that Crawford, Despard, and Winslow will be opposed to having Jago as the Master. Jago is more extravagant than many men and loves display more.Francis Getliffe, a scientist and Lewis's particular friend, says that he is worried about the talk of Jago as Master. Getliffe would rather have someone of the left fill the office and would rather support a scientist. Jago is an English scholar with an interest in the colonial figure William Bradford.Roy Calvert becomes Lady Muriel's mainstay in the nearly year-long process of the death of her husband. Nightingale wants to get a college office out of the change and Jago is disinclined to see such a thing happen. Following a feast held for a potential benefactor of the college, the Master is told the true medical view of his health. He says that it is hard to think without a future.The group supporting Jago loses its clear majority when Nightingale goes over to the other side. The Master lives for a longer time than expected. Winslow's son fails the final examination although the nephew of the expected benefactor gains a third class degree. With Winslow downcast, Roy Calvert, consumed by his own depression, speaks wildly to him.Jago's pride is mountainous. His diffidence is intense. He is vulnerable. He has never used his powers, he has never been able to compete. Pilbrow, after traveling abroad and in view of national and international issues, decides to shift his vote from Jago to Crawford. There seems to be a deadlock.Chrystal suggests a third candidate-- Brown. Chrystal announces he is moving his vote over to Crawford. Perhaps envy and pique and vanity changed the circumstances of voting for Chrystal. Jago is easier with proteges than with friends. He has a proud nature and is unable to unbend.The nuances of character and circumstances are fascinating in this novel. This skeletal summary of the plot is insufficient to demonstrate that the reader comes to care deeply about the outcome of the election described in full by the author."},{"Title":"The Masters: A Novel","review":"This interesting and intense study of people under pressure (and under glass) as they attempt to elect from their few members a new master of their college is much greater than any summary of its prosaic sounding parts. It is infused with a wisdom, compassion and detail about the machinations of human beings at close quarters that is frank, accesible, and ingenious. Read it."},{"Title":"The Masters: A Novel","review":"C. P. Snow's THE MASTERS, the fourth in his STRANGERS AND BROTHERS sequence, is his best-known book and has often been hailed as his masterpiece. It's been compared frequently to BARCHESTER TOWERS: a valid comparison, since among his many other achievements Snow was also a biographer of Anthony Trollope. Certainly THE MASTERS does seem to have used Trollope's governing plot of the jostling and politicking to fill vacant episcopal seats; but it is in comparison to Trollope that Snow's novel most seems to suffer today, despite its fame and undoubted influence since its publication in 1951.When the master of an unnamed Cambridge college becomes fatally ill at the beginning of this novel, the fellows of his college begin to maneuver to ensure the success of their own favorite candidates for the master's position. The novel is mostly an exhaustive description of the jockeying for influence and loyalty undertaken by the two opposing sides, behind Jago on the one side (that shared by our narrator, the central figure in STRANGERS AND BROTHERS, Lewis Eliot) and Crawford on the other. The competition is fought with fierce desperation, but because it's so difficult to tell what sort of vision either man has for the college should he succeed, it's hard to care much about the outcome--and Snow does very little to satirize his participants, as Trollope did to signal his awareness of the pettiness of the battle. Crawford, we are told, is an awful snob; but since when was this new among Oxbridge dons? Although the characters of the fellows are often amusingly drawn (particularly the two eldest among them, Gay and Despard-Smith), they're also not given much depth. The whole thing comes off as a bit arid."},{"Title":"Lamborghini Miura: The definitive analysis of Lamborghini's first sensational V12 supercar","review":"This book has been carefully written and well researched. It provides a complete, accurate history of the Miura from the initial market dynamics that caused Lamborghini to conceive the car, to prototypes, to the last SV. It also lists some of the one-offs such as the Jota, ZN-75, and Furia-bodied car. Almost every page has a black and white photo, and there are eight color pages in the center of this 184-page book. Pete Coltrin's photography is timeless. Appendix 1 lists the production order, chassis number, engine number, date, colour (it's a British book), interior, and comments for every Miura. The list is presumably as accurate as the factory's (which means it may not be 100% accurate) but it's a great reference. Appendix 3 shows Official literature. If you're a Miura fan, you have to have this book."},{"Title":"Rachael Plummer's narrative of twenty-one months servitude as a prisoner among the Commanchee Indians","review":"I jumped through hoops to read this book. I had to find a local college that actually had this book on their shelves. I found one, in a Texas History section under lock and key at Texas A&M; University. It had been on the shelf for decades, and looked that it had never been read before. I read it, and found that it was an interesting perspective into Texas early history. Its a sort of journal by a young lady who was captive by Indians, while one of her sons was missing, and her other son she witnessed being harshly killed by the Indians. At one point she got into a fight with her keeper after being severly mistreated, and tore apart the tent, and knocked a wall down of the main lodge as well. She feared death, but the Cheif being wise basically told her it is not for him to judge the spirit. When someone is mistreated like that, the spirit that allows self defense comes from the Great Spirit, and who is he to judge what the Great Spirit directed? What an insightful judgment! Eventually she was traded by the Indians, and returned to her family. Her journal never made major print because of what seems like conspiracy by the army or US officials at the time to keep her dialog of the vastness and usefulness of the lands of Texas a secret. I suspect that somebody wanted to use her eye witness accounts of the lands of Texas to rush out and claim certain portions of Texas for themselves back before Texas was inhabited by too many settlers.You may be able to read it as I did in a local University Library.

He excelled at stream-of-consciousness humor and non sequitirs, and made a permanent mark on the comedy landscape with a stature rivaling anyone in the last fifty years. This book can be viewed as a companion to Graham's earlier work, \\"A Liar's Autobiography,\\" as it contains a lot of material that didn't make it into that book, as well as many diverse pieces such as screenplays and correspondence, most of which appear here for the first time.Graham was a complex person, and this book gives an outstanding view into the workings of his mind. His struggles are well detailed here, yet he always made the most of any situation, especially if wild parties with the likes of Keith Moon and Ringo Starr were involved. I was pleased that the bulk of this book dealt with Graham's life outside of Python, as that has been very well documented elsewhere.The book itself has the feel of a mixed-media contemporary art piece as it is from so many diverse sources. I must admit that the title drew me in: it is taken from a piece on page 88 in the essays section. The essay does, in fact, make calcium much more interesting than in any chemistry class I have had, to wit: \\"Calcium...occurs naturally as the carbonate CaCO3 in limestone, chalk, marble, and in brothels....\\" Graham's medical training (he was a doctor, after all) comes through in other places as well, as on page 189 where he discusses disorders of the trachea and bronchial tree in a musical adaptation called \\"The Ciliary-Mucus-Escalator Dance.\\" Of course, the weirdness doesn't stop with scientific and medical humor, but dwells in both the mundane (a pompous man who brags about his \\"fleet of atomic-powered Silko-Glyde lawn mowers - each with a sauna bath, a cocktail lounge with three adjoining cinemas, and a discotheque\\", page 235) and the surreal (an insurance salesman selling a man a \\"special Being Nibbled To Death by Okapia Policy,\\" with correspondingly odd terms on page 245.)My two favorite parts of the book are the monologues and the personal letters. My favorite monologue concerns riding down a black diamond ski slope in a \\"wretched wooden gondola\\" with the Dangerous Sports Club, a piece that opens and sets the tone for the book. (I recommend the DVD, \\"Looks Like a Brown Trouser Job\\" which recalls this among other strange occurrences.) The letters are all fairly deranged, but my favorites are the letter reproduced in the dedication, which is an apology to a pub owner (\\"Words alone will have to express my profoundly abject apology for my behavior in your pub last night. I will have the shelf repaired, and I have already bought a half pound fillet steak for Dennis's eye...\\") and the condensed letters of E.P. Snibbet, Esq., which conclude the book.Graham was a genius and a loony, and I miss him. This is a brilliant book and is not to be missed by anyone fond of insane humor; I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Calcium Made Interesting: Sketches, Letters, Essays & Gondolas","review":"Even though he died almost 2 decades ago, Graham Chapman's comic genious continues to awe and inspire in this wonderful volume of letters, essays and skits. Chapman was always the most Pythonic of the team, a wild man who was the re-incarnated spirit of Oscar Wilde. Both were touched with erratic brilliance and a lust for living and in this book we get to see the inner workings of Chapman's \\"wild(e)\\" side at work and at play. Not everyhting in here is hilarious, some things might raise only a smile, but taken as a whole this book is an amazing collection of items that fans of Python will want to treasure--and laugh at--for years to come. \\"Calcium\\" is a welcome addition to the Python legacy and a wonderful way to spend a few more minutes withChapman."},{"Title":"Calcium Made Interesting: Sketches, Letters, Essays & Gondolas","review":"I thought I knew all about teeth and calcium and bones and such... but was I ever wrong.

And I could tell from my brief peek that the page numbering was both bold and consistent. If this is anything like Mr. Yoakum's other works, I will carry it with me (along with his other books) in the special knapsack I always wear (even when sleeping, as I am now) and speak of it proudly to my many friends with whom I share the subways and busses of New York City every day.

I've done a lot of political organizing and am interested in what makes a social movement tick and why it succeeds or fails, and this book does a great job of getting into the heads of political activists. The story is also very interesting, there's a real drama to the way the author tells the story. It reminds me of another book on the Populists, The Populist Moment, by Lawrence Goodwyn, only this book is more concerned with how women and men related (or not) to each other, and how this affected the movement. The book also does a good job of covering women's politics, especially the woman suffrage movement. The author's argument is that women tried to be both committed to their gender and their political party, and couldn't balance the two, which I think in part is a problem feminists have today. I enjoyed it very much, and learned a lot."},{"Title":"An Army of Women: Gender and Politics in Gilded Age Kansas (Reconfiguring American Political History)","review":"This book was assigned in a course on American political history, and I have to admit I didn't expect it to be so interesting--I mean, Kansas??!! Turns out Kansas was a pretty amazing place in the 1890s, and there were a lot of very strong, interesting women involved in politics for the first time. The book is often pretty funny, especially when it looks at how freaked out men were about women getting the vote. I've recommended it to a couple of friends as a book to read outside of class (although it helps to like history, like I do), and though they thought I was crazy at first, they really like it to.

In the beginning of the book Rama has come to realize the endlessly changing nature of life from such a profound level that he sees no hope in anything and does not know how to proceed to live in a way that can lead him away from the inevitable sorrow that always follows all relative hopes and endeavors. The bulk of the text of the Yoga Vasistha is Vasistha's response to Rama's questions and state of dispassion. This book presents the truths of life as perceived and understood by those who have risen above all small self concerns, beyond all karma... from the perspective of one in Unity consciousness, the only real achievement in human life. I find more depth and meaning to this text than to any other spiritual text I have ever read. It it is more totally fulfilling in a lasting way than any other source of fulfillment, except for the DIRECT first-hand experience of the Absolute field of life which the Yoga Vasistha describes."},{"Title":"Concise Yoga Vasistha","review":"This book is a dialogue between Sage Vasistha and Rama.

On the behaviour of the seeker.3. On Creation.4. On Existence.5. On Dissolution.6. On liberation.The original scripture of 'yoga vasistha' is in the form of verses and has several repetitions. Some stories stories are within other stories. However in this book Venkatesananda does a good job of writing the stories in prose form which is very readable. Also, in the \\"concise\\" form of yoga vasistha, venkatesanda takes out very similar sounding stories and keeps the book within 500 pages without taking away any flavour from the original teachings. The book is worth reading several times, and each time it reveals something new. This book is not something that you can expect to read and gulp over night, It has to be chewed slowly and digested.

So I posted about half the story. And I see it's still here. Over the years many people emailed to request the rest of the story.The earlier requesters received it. The later ones did not. I had lost the file about seven years ago and it remains lost.The YV today is still my favorite of all scriptual texts ever produced by any culture in any time. I might also add that I am agnostic and do not believe in reincarnation nor life after death. Anyone can relate to this work.The conversation between Vasistha and the teenage Rama is one that, in some form or another, seems to take place in every human being. The value of a \\"continual\\" reading of this wonderful translation, to me, makes clear the reality of this internal dialog already happening quite naturally inside; such value for me is deeply human, one that reflects the saying \\"we are spiritual beings searching for a human experience. But it's an astonishing experience... as these strange and ancient stories on paper unfold to become the daily experiences of one's own subjective reality. Soaking oneself in these words can do nothing but continually reveal oneself (whatever that means to you) for which there are impossibly good feelings, but alas no words to relate them.And yet, as with any scriptural text, much can and should be updated, re-interpreted and understood for the times and cultures we live in now. And this raises the question: Who would best speak for Rama today? Who best for Vasistha?That, of course, can only be you. And you will, no doubt, have your own stories to tell.

Swami Venkatesananda and Christopher Chapple. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1984. Paperback, 430 pages. ISBN 087395954XI was led to the Yoga Vasistha after becoming interested in a very pure and early Advaita text called The Ashtavakra Gita, a beautiful short work of just 300 couplets (for details see my Listmania list). The particular school of Advaita Vedanta represented by the Ashtavakra Gita is called Ajatavada. It propounds the fascinating notion that the universe was never created.The Yoga Vasistha is a later and much more extensive elaboration, in 35000 couplets, of the Ajatavada theory that nothing has ever emerged and that the world of names-and-forms is merely an illusion. The complete Sanskrit/English edition of the Yoga Vasistha, which may be thought of as the main 'Scripture' of the Ajatavada school, runs to over 2400 pages in 4 large volumes. It is from this massive 70000-line text that Swami Venkatesananda has distilled the brilliant summary he has presented us with here.The words 'Scripture', 'Doctrine', 'Philosophy', have an ominous ring for most of us. They suggest something dull, heavy, dreary, tedious, and quite the opposite of fun! Also, most of us would probably tend to agree with old Greek saying - Mega biblion mega kakon - A big book is a big evil!Given this, the Yoga Vasistha comes as a very pleasant surprise. It's certainly 'Scripture', and it's said to be the third biggest book ever composed, but despite what some would think of as its disadvantages it turns out - with its huge cast of Gods and Goddesses, Angels, Kings, Queens, Ministers, Priests, Sages, Warriors, Laymen, Students, Mendicants, Yogis, Demons and Goblins, etc., all of them, for our edification, pursuing their various fates on a universal stage - to be one of the most fascinating things ever written and those of us who are lucky enough to have discovered it should count ourselves very lucky indeed.The traditional Indian view is that the ideas we find expounded in the sacred texts of Hinduism should not be considered mere 'theories' that have been arrived at through the use of reason. The knowledge these texts hold is the product of insights achieved by a spiritual elite whose whole lives and entire energies were devoted to the search for truth. After heroic efforts they succeeded in their search and texts such as the Yoga Vasistha hold as much of the truth as could be embodied in words. But besides the truths it holds, what I also find fascinating is its scientific content.I get the feeling that its author - after taking us on an amazing voyage through a cosmos pulsing with vibratory energies and holding an infinity of universes strewn with galaxies with their suns and planets and black holes and clouds of cosmic dust and with space vehicles darting about and an incredible variety of both material and immaterial life-forms teeming and swarming and pullulating through uncountable alternate dimensions - would have enjoyed himself hugely if he had been able to sit down and have a good chat with some of our modern physicists since, as John Lowry Dobson makes clear in hisBeyond Space and Time, they certainly seem to have a great deal in common.As I've already mentioned, the particular school of Advaita Vedanta represented by the Yoga Vasistha is called Ajatavada. It propounds the theory that the universe was never created, that nothing has ever emerged, that the world of names-and-forms is merely an illusion.As for John Lowry Dobson, he is a Western scientist who, basing his theory on a careful examination of Einstein's equations, has arrived at the same conclusion: Neither the universe, nor you, nor I were ever created.

It will serve nicely as a review. But its a bit more than that. It's actually a record of my own experiences during the reading of this book seven times over a seven month period. &quot;Guruji&quot; and &quot;Punditji&quot; refer to Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, an enlightened master from Bangalore India. AoL refers to the Art of Living. Here it is: I met Guruji the first time in Tokyo in November 1992. He was breezing through town with Scott and Kevin and Doug. Doing a quick tour I suppose. My sister, Katie, an AoL teacher alerted me to the visit, then Scott called one day and said, &quot;Hey, do you want to meet Punditji?&quot; Well, I didn't know beans about this guy nor about Kriya and the Art of Living, but I heard that he was a student at one time of a man I have deep respect for, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. So I thought, what the heck, sure, I'd like that. But I had another motive beyond my light curiosity... you see in late 1992, I was at the bottom of my life in just about any catagory you care to choose. Really low. Nasty stuff. And I also thought, well, maybe this guy Punditji, if he's really hot stuff, can give me a few pointers... or maybe even tell me how I can fix things -- yeah, I thought, I'll go see him. I truly had nothing to lose. It was a rainy cold night in Tokyo and Scott met me at a train station. We walked to an old Buddhist Temple/Monestary about ten minutes away. Scott was, as I was to later confirm, his usual super casual self. He did or said nothing to prepare me, he just ushered me into this temple, we took off our shoes, and my first look at Guruji was behind a sort of light screen. And I thought, Whoa... wait just a darn second... this is somebody special. Looking at him made me think that I could almost see right through him, as if he wasn't really there. He raised his folded hands to me and smiled like I was an old and dear friend. I'll never forget that smile. We sat down. I met Kevin. Doug was apparently sacked out up stairs. There was a girl in the room, an American teaching English in Japan, and there was a Buddhist monk. We made small talk... and then there was some silence and I thought, hey wait, why is everybody being so quiet. And why are Scott and Kevin just looking at Punditji like that. They must be tired from traveling I thought. So I picked up the conversation a bit, you know, to make everyone feel relaxed. :-) But that didn't work so well, no one felt like talking, there was just all this silence. So I sat there too. Silent. Looking at Punditji. Looking at Kevin and Scott looking at Punditji. Hey guys, I thought, say something already. Then I was afraid that maybe this thing was going to end before I got a chance to make my big plea and get my life saving advice. So I spoke up to Punditji. I was too proud to go into all the gory details of my present situation. But I said things were not too hot, I was looking for work, and did he have any suggestions for me. He looked at me like he knew exactly what was going on with me... not with pity, but with some kind of understanding that I didn't really understand at the time. Guruji said, &quot;Your basic needs will be provided for.&quot; I said &quot;Oh... okay.&quot; Or something like that. But in my mind I was thinking, hey, I'm dangling from a cliff, here, hanging on to dear life from a dead leaf and this guy says my basic needs will be provided for? Is this some standard Indian way to respond to someone's desperation or is this guy patronizing me. But I looked at him hard, and something deep down inside me said that he was serious, and that he was right, and that I should listen to him and probably be grateful to boot. Before I knew it, Guruji said &quot;Jai Gurudev&quot;, and we were wisked out of the room, Punditji with raised folded hands smiling that smile I saw when I first came in. Scott put a book in my hands. A short work by Punditji. Both Scott and Kevin walked the English teacher and me to the train station. I asked a few questions about Kriya... Scott said it wouldn't be taught on this trip but that probably soon it would be. Okay... I got home. Looked at this book, &quot;Bang on the Door&quot;. What does that mean. Read it through that night. Went to bed thinking, bang on the door, bank on the door.... Geez I'm not even at the door yet. How the heck do I do that? Guess I'll learn this Kriya thing. Maybe that'll be a start. Hope it comes here soon. ... Months rolled by again... it was about a year after meeting Punditji. The dirt was really starting to pile up inside, but, yes, all my needs were still being met, and still in a very thorough way. Got out that book again. Bang on the door. What'll I do. Well, no one will ever accuse me of being a spiritual prodigy... but it suddenly dawned on me that maybe, just maybe I could start my meditation practice back up. I had learned TM about 20 years before. Soon after, I was going through a box of books and found something my sister had given me a few years before. Someone had told her, read this book seven times and you'll be enlightened. I remembered that. The book was called &quot;The Yoga Vasistha&quot;. When I first got it, I was all fired up. I was going to read this thing seven times if I had to die doing it. That was the summer of 1989. I read, oh, about the first 45 pages and thought, how could anyone possibly read this book even once! It was the strangest book I had ever laid hands on. But back to the story. I dug The Yoga Vasistha out of the box. Dusted it off. When I had moved from Cincinnati to Tokyo I had given away about 1800 volumes of philosophy books. Honest. But for some reason I kept this one. Mmmmm. Must have been that promise. Read this book seven times and you'll be enlightened. Well, I thought... I asked for a door to bang on... and here it is. Start bangin, Tommie. I figured that if I read 15 pages a day of this thing, I could cover one reading every 30 days, 450 pages a month. So, hey, in seven months.... I'll have it licked... I'll be enlightened. Ha! Piece a cake. And I read. And just to hedge my bet, I kept meditating. Well I got through that first reading, and marked the passages I liked, just to remind myself the second time through. I started to like this thing. There were a lot of good stories, there were a lot of interesting and simple practices spelled out. I started doing many of them. And I read on. Things really started changing inside me. I'm sure my meditation was kicking in by this point, but there was something strange about this book. As I read it, my perception of me, and my perception of everything outside me began to change. About half way through that second reading, I thought hey, I'd like to do some group meditation. So I called the local TM office. They said, sure. But you need a signed letter of recommendation from your orginal TM teacher. I said, well, that was 20 years ago. I know her name, but have no way of contacting her. They said sorry, they needed the letter. I said, but guys, I still have my flowers and my handkerchief and my receipt from my TM initiation in 1973. Doesn't that prove anything? It was true. I had carried those things around with me like a bride all those years. They said, no letter, no dice. I was frustrated. I read on. Started thinking that it was high time I had an advanced mantra. The Yoga Vasistha said there wasn't anything the mind couldn't do. And by this time I was starting to believe it. So I asked Vasistha and Punditji and Maharishi, all of them, for an advanced mantra. No telling who was listening and who was not, I thought.... NOTE-NO MORE ROOM, IF YOU WANT THE REST OF THIS STORY CONTACT ME.

However, personally, I found this book very difficult reading because of the extreme repetition of most of its concepts, the use of many Sanskrit terms, and the use of many gods, goddesses, demons, celestial beings, nymphs, and other \\"magical beings.\\" However, when one edits it down to its basic truths of spiritual and material existence, and the paths leading to enlightenment, it is a fantastic book.What I am about to suggest may seem to some individuals to be for personal gain by me, but actually, in making the following suggestion, I am only trying to give those individuals interested in pursuing a path to enlightenment, a more easily understood, updated, and simplified rendition of the same \\"truths\\" as those presented in \\"The Concise Yoga Vasistha.\\"I am suggesting that those individual interested in pursuing a path to spiritual enlightenment also examine two other books that I have written - \\"From Creation to Eternity-2nd Edition\\" and \\"A Grand View of Existence.\\"Both of these books attempt to \\"bridge science and spitituality\\" by presenting, in modern vocabulary and current concepts -- in simplified quantum theory, physiologic functioning of our \\"matter\\" bodies and brain/minds, and the extreme importance of the power that the self created \\"Ego\\" of our psyches exerts over all of our lives and our actions -- insights into the same truths as those discussed in \\"The Concise Yoga Vasistha\\" about our Creative Source, our \\"matter\\" universe, and the quantum interface that connects the two others.

This book contains over 1000 of his games. There are no annotation or comments so around 4-6 gamesare put into every page. Each game has 1 diagram, taken from somestage in the game. I have found that the very best, and most effective way to get good in chess is to study games of the great players. I have studied Morphy, Casablanca and Fischer.I suggest you play through every single one of these games, and try and understand what Bobby is doing. With every move try to make something of it, and try to predict what Bobby will do next. I have said there are no comments, but there are ! !! ? and?? to indicate crucial moves. Good or bad. Take a special look at these moves before you play on and try to discover why it is so bad, or so good. The book is laid out like this, starting with 1955 and then going year by year ( 56,57,58 etz ). All the games of the 92 match with Spassky are also here. There is obviously where it ends. However, after that there is \\" last minute additions \\". Mostly games from simuls that recently surfaced. In short, all of Bobby\`s important tournament games are in here, including blitz. The games from the \\" unofficial blitz WC \\" in the early 70s are here, the manhatten chess club blitz tournament ( In which bobby scored 21,5/22) also in the early 70s before his title match. Many simul games are included here also. Also, the 3 little known games Bobby played against a computer program in 1977( 3-0 ). If you want to get good, don\`t buy book after book on strategy,openings,tactics etz. Buy this book, the book on Morphy\`s games and the one on Casablanca. But how do i then learn the openings??- easy. In going throught this book, and trying to understand every move, you will become very familiar with the Ruy Lopez, King\`s Indian defence, Sicilian and some other openings. If you wanna invest time and energy, and as little cash as possible, into getting good in chess then get this book. If it doesn\`t work out, you can always sell it used and cut your losses. What more can i say, cmon people. For 20 dollars and a lot of hard work you will be getting alot back.I hope this has helped you decide."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer: Complete Games of the American World Chess Champion","review":"This book includes all of Bobby Fischer's games from 1955, to the 1992 rematch with GM Boris Spassky.

Unfortunately for the time being , no one had done this job. Fischer's \\" my 60 memorable games\\" covers only games up to 1967. Wade's book only a collection and with a few games annotated and also has been out of print. Soltis book only covers 100 games, so for the time being this is only choice.

That beings said, this book has arguably every published game that Fischer played.Not insightful:The author's annotations are very brief and do not explain anything beyond the obvious. Some of the games have a cryptic \\"!\\" or \\"?\\" symbol with out any explanation of WHY the move deserves attention. So if the person is below intermediate strength, this book might be more frustrating than useful.Not user friendly:Be ready to squint your eyes. The physical presentation of this book is very inconvenient at best. The author did everything he could to compress this book into the smallest layout possible at the cost of creating eye strain, he even removed the \\"x\\" capture symbol to save space. Every game has a diagram that is literally about the size of a US quarter [see image]. Also, all the moves are typed in BOLD and the annotations are printed in plain text. It would have been much easier to read if the moves in plain text and the annotations in bold. Forty move games are crushed into a 4 by 1 rectangle which makes it difficult to read the moves off a table without losing your place.Over all, this is a good book but could be better if it was user friendly."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer: Complete Games of the American World Chess Champion","review":"An excellent source for the complete games of the best.

Thea Lockhart is on the run with her young daughter, with more than one reason to avoid the cops. She has created a new life for herself and her daughter in Chicago when a woman is killed in their building, and Detective John Gallagher enters their world. Gallagher insists her daughter could be a witness; Thea wants nothing more than to get him out of their lives. With danger from all sides, can Thea dare to put their lives in the hands of a man with the potential to destroy her?A nicely original story, Ms. Stevens' tale neatly avoids the clich&eacute;s becoming too common in series romance. Hers is a tense, compelling story that should engage readers' sympathies from the start. Thea is the best kind of romance heroine, an admirably strong woman, willing to do anything to protect her child. I doubt most of us could be as tough in her position--her foresight with the fire escape was one detail that really caught my attention. Nearly all of moments involving her young daughter will touch your heart. As usual, Stevens keeps readers on their toes, and the ending is a nice out-of-nowhere surprise. Although paced slower than usual for a Stevens book, mainly due to the need to provide so much back story for the other two books in the trilogy, &quot;The Littlest Witness&quot; won't disappoint. With many plot threads left dangling, many will be anxiously waiting for next month's portion of the Gallagher saga, &quot;Secret Admirer.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Littlest Witness (Gallagher Justice, Book 1) (Harlequin Intrigue Series #549)","review":"This is a sweet story about a mother, Thea Lockhart, who is hiding from her past and trying to care for and protect her scarred little girl, Nikki.

Unlike Birnbaums and Sehlingers guides, which remain the same year after boring year, Aero's newest guide is completely new and fresh!She threw out all the old star ratings and replaced them with clever EARS awards. Apparently she gathered the top Disney experts and formed a panel much like the Academy Awards, except they vote on the best attractions, hotels, restaurants, etc. The emotional age ratings are also completely new and expanded from the previous 4 icons to an intuitive gradient type system. Birnbaums has no ratings at all and Sehlingers ratings never seem to change.The book's navigation is all new with easy-to-find self indexing tabs. The reviews are completely rewritten into columnar formatting. I didn't care much for the way the text used to span the entire page, so this is a very welcomed improvement. I also LOVE the new charts and maps!

This book stands head and shoulders above all other guide books. The reason is that Rita and her staff take great pains to find out any new developments/changes in the World.Rita explores WDW in depth--park by park, ride by ride, and eatery by eatery. No other guide book gives attention to detail like this publication.If you are interested in a particular hotel on Disney property, Ms. Aero discusses all aspects of that location, listing amenities, recreation, ambience, restaurants, and available transportation.If you are interested in a particular restaurant, the author goes into details including atmosphere, sample entrees, dining hours and location.Ms. Aero has also included information regarding Disney tours, Disney recreation, airport information, babysitting options, info for special needs population, and offsite hotel and shopping information. Information on Universal Studios and Sea World is also listed in Ms Aero's book. This information is skimmed over, if not overlooked totally, in other guide books,most of which I own. Had I bought Rita Aero's guidebook first, I would have saved a lot of money on other less informative and sometimes biased guidebooks.The biggest bonus, and the reason I bought this book though, is the online website available free to her readers. Her member hosts are very well-informed and keep current with breaking news and developments at WDW. Anyone logging into this website is warmly welcomed and invited to participate, whether it be by posting a question, sharing their experiences, or attending one of the nightly chat sessions on a well-rounded variety of topics. A wealth of knowledge, cutting edge information, and up-to-the-minute developments are at your disposable with just a click of the mouse. Down here in New Orleans, we call that &quot;lagniappe&quot;, which means a little something extra without any cost.If you are new to Disney, this guide book will steer you in the right direction. If you are a frequent traveler to Disney, this book will teach you about things that you didn't know existed. This guide book is worth its weight in gold. It will save you time, money, and frustration.

The organization is clear and logical and the use of sidebars and icons enables one to quickly locate useful information on attractions, food and beverage offerings, and entertainment within each park, as well as ratings for each attraction, organized by age group. The maps are, in my opinion, the most useful of any guidebook I have used, providing a simplified schematic of each park that makes navigation a breeze.There are brief descriptions of dining options within the chapter for each park, as well as more detailed descriptions of the reastaurants in a separate dining section. Useful touring hints and touring plans for the new visitor are also provided, as well as ratings by a panel of Disney World experts, most of whom have authored other guides or manage websites on Disney World. Outside of the panel ratings and ratings drawn from polls conducted on her website, Ms. Aero's descriptions of attractions and accomodations are refreshingly free of subjective evaluation, and are limited to straight-forward, objective information.Speaking of websites, one of the unique aspects of this book is the associated web site that enables readers to obtain up-to-date information and touring tips from the author and from other readers. Although the website is open to anyone, it is particularly useful when used in conjunction with the book. Taken together, the website and the book provide a powerful tool for trip planning and they have saved me hundreds of dollars on my Walt Disney World vacations."},{"Title":"Rita Aero's Walt Disney World : The Essential Guide to Amazing Vacations","review":"Every two years I take a group of Middle Schoolers to Walt Disney World (don't worry, we're not obnoxious!) and I have always found Rita's books extremely helpful as a leader in planning our trip!

It is by no means BDSM related and the work should appeal to those who find these moments of screen time memorable for reasons best known to themselves.The author does say that the rankings are very subjective and goes to great lengths at the start of his work outlining the staging of such scenes, while also doing a great job digging up some really obscure scenes that show the extent of his research.However, the book falls flat in some aspects, notably misspellings found in the text and also the failure to mention what must be some of the more outstanding scenes of this sort.Titles such as 'One Eyed Jacks', various editions of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin', along with TV's 'North & South' and 'Roots' all have vivid flogging scenes that somehow escape being listed or even mentioned in passing in this book.Still, if this subject is one of interest, the current dearth of works dealing in this topic makes this book a must have."},{"Title":"Lash: The Hundred Great Scenes Of Men Being Whipped In The Movies","review":"The title tells it all. Each of the scenes, ranging from 1932's \\"Mask of Fu Manchu\\" to 2004's \\"Passions of Christ,\\" is first described in detail. Then there is a commentary on the scene, discussing its strengths, weaknesses, unique qualities, etc. Movie buffs may find this mildly interesting but the book's primary audience would seem to be those who are\\"into\\" the field of physical punishment. The text won't dissapoint them -- it treats the subject seriously and is always readable -- but they'll probably regret the lack of illustrations. (Though there is a good photo on the cover of Alan Ladd being flogged in \\"Two Years Before the Mast,\\" a scene which ranks 8th on the top 100 list!)If nothing else, this book is unique."},{"Title":"Lash: The Hundred Great Scenes Of Men Being Whipped In The Movies","review":"As a fan of Sword & Sandal films, also known as Peplum, I had to buy this book as a reference. Whippings is one of the biggest clich&eacute;s of the Peplum genre. Hero whipped by nefarious villain. Slaves whipped into servitude. Rebels whipped by Roman Generals. Pirates being whipped after a failed mutiny, etc. The list is endless. I believed this book would be quite helpful and even though I've discovered a couple of new titles, with some titles I'll never see (the Lex Barker Euro westerns) the list is either incomplete or flawed.There are a lot of titles that should have been listed that are nowhere to be seen. Where's the great whipping scene of Steve Reeves from Morgan the Pirate? In my view, it's much better than the one with Reeves Duel of the Titans, which is albeit unique because Reeves is strapped to a cross and he's being whipped while the cross spins. But that scene is very brief. Around 20 seconds. And it's shot from a distance so the actor on the spinning wheel might just be a stuntman, not Reeves. The whipping scene in Morgan the Pirate, we clearly witness a barechested Steve Reeves fighting three men and eventually being held by them while someone else whips him hard on his exposed torso/abdomen in front of a captive audience, under the broad daylight. It lasts much longer than the one in Duel of the Titans, and it certainly stands out for its brutality and Reeves' obvious exposed vulnerability as he struggles to set himself free. It's a standout scene and yet it didn't make it in the author's top 100 list.Another great whipping scene occurs in Aphrodite Goddess of Love and again it didn't make the list. Other missing great whipping scenes: brief but memorable lashing in Thaurus Son of Attila; the brutal whipping from Pirate and the Slave Girl; the duels between men with whips in Perseus The Invincible, Gladiator 7 and in Kindar the Invulnerable where the two men brutally fight each other with whips for several minutes. And the whipping scene with Mark Damon in Son of Cleopatra should be listed in the top 5 whipping scenes of all time. That scene is brutal and original and yet it's listed at number 23 in the book.The complete lack of photos also diminishes the book's impact and worth.I'm actually glad that there is a book out there about this subject but honestly this is basically a list that should have been made for blog instead of a book. It's too subjective to be useful."},{"Title":"Miniature Empires","review":"Meets the expectations of those seeking to know more of the history of everyday people just commented on political and academic literature."},{"Title":"Nuevo Manual Biblico Ilustrado (Spanish Edition)","review":"Usamos este libro como el texto para Resena del Antiguo Testamento, y Resena del Nuevo Testamento.

NOT BAD AT ALL. The seller was right on, the product was delivered as said and came in great condition as described."},{"Title":"The Sociological Imagination","review":"\\"It is my aim in this book to define the meaning of the social sciences for the cultural tasks of our time. I want to specify the kinds of effort that lie behind the development of the sociological imagination; to indicate its implications for political as well as for cultural life.\\"The first chapter of this book is \\"The Promise\\" and in it Mills takes his stand with the great tradition of the Enlightenment and the idea of liberation by learning. For Mills, the promise is that cultivation of the sociological imagination may enable people to place personal worries and concerns in the larger social and historical context, and thus to think more effectively about them.Chapters on Grand Theory and Abstracted Empiricism show how the understanding of social processes is impeded by immersion in certain types of theory and in narrow-minded \\"nomal science\\". Other chapters explore the many and varied ways that the critical and probing \\"sociological imagination\\" can be subverted or frustrated. His description of the Machieavellian tactics employed by academics to sideline rivals is especially revealing (for example, have a potentially dangerous book reviewed by a junior member of a hostile faction). His comments on the function of professional associations and conferences are equally deadly.The fatal flaw of the book is Mill's Marxism and lack of understanding of economics, exemplified by his dismissive reference to people who could not see the value of the New Deal. The author's theoretical and ideological stance is not explicitly articulated but was clearly in the rational and humanistic Marxist tradition. He yearned for a viable alternative to liberalism and Marxism as he saw them in the 1950s but he clearly did not perceive classical liberalism as a candidate that was worthy of mention. It seems that classical, non-socialist liberals were so thin on the ground during his lifetime that he did not see any need to engage with them. That is a major weakness and it prevented Mills, and this book, from reaching the full extent of insight and understanding that his scholarship, his integrity and his industry should have permitted.The Appendix on Intellectual Craftmanship is worth reading every few years to keep focussed for effective reading, thinking and writing. The remainder of this review consists of extracts from the appendix to convey some of its flavour.\\"It is best to begin, I think, by reminding you, the beginning student, that the most admirable thinkers within the scholarly community you have chosen to join do not split their work from their lives.They seem to take both too seriously to allow such dissociation, and they want to use each for the enrichment of the other.\\"\\"You must set up a file, which is, I suppose, a sociologist's way of saying: keep a journal...In such a file as I am going to describe, there is joined personal experience and professional activities, studies under way and studies planned...\\"\\"One of the very worst things that happens to social scientists is that they feel the need to write of their 'plans' on only one occasion: when they are going to ask for money for a specific piece of research or 'a project'. It is as a request for funds that most 'planning' is done, or at least written carefully about. However standard the practice, I think this very bad: it is bound in some degree to be salesmanship, and, given prevailing expectations, very likely to result in painstaking pretensions; the project is lilely to be presented', rounded out in some arbitrary manner long before it ought to be; it is often a contrived thing, aimed at getting the money for ulterior purposes, however valuable, as well as for the research presented.\\"\\"Any working social scientist who is well on his way ought at all times to have so many plans, that is to say ideas, that the question is always, which of them am I, ought I, to work on next. And he should keep a special file for his master agenda, which he writes and rewrites just for himself and perhaps for discussion with friends. From time to time he ought to review this very carefully and purposefully, and sometimes too, when he is relaxed.\\"\\"Any such procedure is one of the indispensable means by which your intellectual enterprise is kept oriented and under control...In [a vigorous and free intellectual community]...there would be interludes of discussion among individuals about future work. Three kinds of interludes - on problems, methods, theory - ought to come out of the work of social scientists and lead into it again: they should be shaped by work-in-progress and to some extend guide their work. It is for such interludes that a professional association finds its intellectual reason for being.\\""},{"Title":"The Sociological Imagination","review":"I did not understand any of the concepts to this book. It was way over my head!!! I'm an honor roll student and I didn't get 95% of this book. Boring. Only read if you absolutely have to!!!"},{"Title":"The Sociological Imagination","review":"No one has written with more verve and authority about the awesome and frightening capabilities of man than the late C. Wright Mills, a prominent and controversial sociologist who wrote such memorable tomes as &quot;White Collar&quot;, an exploration of the emerging American Middle class in the early 1950s, and The Power Elite&quot;, a provocative examination of the nature of power, privilege, and status in the United States, and how each of these three critical elements of power and property in this country are irrevocably connected to each other. At last look, both books were still in print and are still used in both undergraduate and graduate sociology courses throughout the world. After fifty years, that in and of itself is powerful testimony to his enduring value as a scholar and an original thinker.Here Mills focuses memorably on the qualities and uses of the sociological perspective in modern life, how such a scientifically based way of looking at, interpreting, and interacting with the larger world invests its user with a better, more accurate, and quite instrumental picture of what is happening meaningfully around him. For Mills, the key to understanding the value in such a perspective is in appreciating that one can only understand the motives, behavior, and actions of others by locating them within a wider and more meaningful context that connects their personal biographies with the large social circumstances that surround, direct, and propel them at any given historical moment. For Mills, for example, trying to understand the reasoning behind the sometimes desperate actions of Jews in Nazi Germany without appreciating the horrifyingly unique existential circumstances they found themselves in is hopelessly anachronistic and limited.On the other hand, one invested with such an appreciation for how biography and history interact to create the meaningful social circumstances of any situation finds himself better able to understand the fact that when in a country of one hundred million employed, one man's singular lack of employment might be due to his persoanl deficiencies or lack of a work ethic, and be laid at his feet as a personal trouble, it is also true that when twenty million individuals out of that one hundred million figure suddenly find themselves so disposed and unemployed, that situation is due to something beyond the control of those many individuals and is best described in socioeconomic terms as a social problem to be laid at the feet of the government and industry to resolve. To Mills, it is critical to understand the inherant differences between personal troubles on the one hand, which an individual has the responsibity to resolve and overcome, and social ills, which are beyond both his ken or control. Indeed, according to Mills, increasingly in the 20th century one finds himself trapped by social circumstance into dilemmas he is absolutely unable to resolve without significant help from the wider social community.Thus, for both psychological as well as social reasons, a person using the sociological perspective, or invested with what he called the &quot;sociological imagination&quot;, is more able to think and act critically in accordance with the evidence both outside his door and beyond himself. Fifty years later, such a recognition of &quot;what's what&quot; and &quot;who's who&quot; based on the ability to judge the information within the social environment is as valuable as ever. This is a wonderful book, written in a very accessible and entertaining style, meant both for an intellectual audience and for the scholastic community as well. While it may not be for &quot;everyman&quot;, any person wanting to better understand and more fully appreciate how individual biography and social history meaningfully interact to create the realities we live in will enjoy and appreciate this legendary sociological critique and invitation to the pleasures of a sociological perspective by one of its most remarkable proponents some half century ago."},{"Title":"The Sociological Imagination","review":"TThis is a masterful work by an original thinker. Wright was concerned with the developments that he was seeing in the social sciences in his time. He was concerned that the social sciences was developing in ways that limited its value to humanity and therefore to itself. He saw the social science of his day as working against true freedom in society by allowing itself to be used to manipulate the population into unthinking acceptance of established authority.He saw two major trends that removed the social sciences from addressing robust problems whose solution would make genuine differences to humanity. The first was a retreat into 'Theory' so abstract that it was unable to describe anything of significance. Wright uses as an example an article that describes a theory of human relationships that was so abstracted from reality that, as Wright shows, it could not capture the fact that sometimes people accept the norms of their society unwillingly. This theory was wrapped in such opaque jargon to unambiguously define the trivial that it last all relationship to genuine society.Wright also identifies as a further development in the social sciences, an empiricism so constrained by technique that it can only address the most specific and mundane problem. If theory has become to remote and abstract to contact real society this empiricism is equivalent in being so immersed in the specifics of a society that it cannot capture more than the trivial.Wright's book is a plea to social scientists to abandon these two enterprises and to return to a social science which is concerned with problems whose solutions will change society,. He calls the ability to find and understand such problems the sociological imagination. He sees practitioners of this form of sociology as inherently political. They may not be in political office but they make their findings known to be acted upon in the political milieu.Wright sees this as a way to genuine freedom in that the governed will know the structure of the society that is governing them and can then freely choose to live within it or to make changes. Wright is concerned that the social sciences of his time were not used to promote this genuine understanding of society by the population but to manipulate them into a passive acceptance of norms that may not be in their interest. He is afraid of a beneficent tyranny with a population of what he calls happy robots.This book is a denunciation of passive acquiescence and a plea for informed acceptance as the basis of society. Wright's fears are as valid today as when he wrote them over 40 years ago."},{"Title":"The Sociological Imagination","review":"I first came across this book when I was an undergraduate doing a course on introduction to sociology. It was on the required reading list. I had to confess, when I first encountered it, I did not know what to make of the book nor what the fuss was all about.Now, many years later, I have just finished re-reading the book and am now convinced why this is a classic in the literature of the Social Sciences. Mills in this book seeks to advocate a certain ideal in the discipline of sociology. Known as the sociological imagination, he advocates the idea of using sociology to bear on the unease which man(in a generic sense!) faces in his daily life. Mills is arguing that much of unease felt by the individual has social roots, i.e., it is shared by many others. The cause of such unease has to do with the structure of society and changes that is happening in it. Hence, there is a great need for sociologists (and other social scientists) to articulate how such unease has sociological causes and thus enabling the individual to understand how his biography intersects with the structure and history of his society. In this way, hopefully it will empower to individuals to transform such unease into public issues in order to bring about changes in society.Overall, this work is intelligently written as well as being morally challenging.Sure, much has changed since the first publication of this book but it is a good place to start for those who wants to find out what is sociology and to those who wants to be reacquainted with the ideals of sociology.It is a morally challenging work which needs to be read and re-read time and again!"},{"Title":"The Sociological Imagination","review":"A classic of sociological thought, and one of the best (if not the best) accounts on the purpose and tasks of sociological mindset.
