Aptly discussing a series of related issues including the inequalities that riddle the economic system of capitalism by its very nature (both within and between nations); unemployment and underemployment; contradictions within capitalism; and means for social change that battle for a better world, Naming The System is an accessible and serious economic presentation which has self-evidently been deftly researched and is skillfully argued. A welcome addition to personal and academic Economics Studies reference collections and reading lists, Naming The System is especially recommended to the attention of anyone wanting to understand the rationale behind the importance of placing limits and regulations to ensure a prosperous future for labor and management alike."},{"Title":"Naming the System: Inequality and Work in the Global Economy","review":"Yates' book \\"Naming the System\\" is a valiant attempt to explain the failures, contradictions and problems of modern globalized capitalism in terms understandable to every layman. By and large, he has succeeded, though there are some flaws.His strongest point is reconciling the arguments against the orthodox neoclassical theory of \\"more free markets = better\\" with the 'facts on the ground', in the form of valuable statistics and examples from practical experience. He enthousiastically destroys the reformist view of capitalism as followed by many social-democrats and current-day labor union leaders just as much as the libertarian approach. In addition to that, he gives a worthwhile overview of the Marxist interpretation of capitalism and why it is better able to explain certain commonplace phenomena in firm practice than the neoclassicals. Finally, he gives a non-too-critical overview of the great variety of leftist anti-capitalist movements in the world today and some general perspectives on their success, though all this is very vague.The books great benefits are the easy to understand ways in which he shows the workings of capitalism in the many kinds of injustice felt by (young) leftist-inclined people, giving them a more solid ground for their critiques. However, this accessible approach is also the big downside to Yates' work: \\"Naming the System\\" is not in-depth at all, its wording is a little simplistic and childish sometimes, and it is virtually useless to those who already have a basic Marxist understanding of the capitalist world. Nevertheless, the book is worth four stars for its excellent utility as an education book on the Marxist approach for young people (high school and students), much like Naomi Klein's book was for the anti-branding movement."},{"Title":"Naming the System: Inequality and Work in the Global Economy","review":"This man lives in a world od distorted reality.

They were known in chemistry much earlier, of course, but to become really useful in enzymology they needed convenient methods for labelling biological molecules at the required positions, and, in the case of secondary isotope effects, accurate methods of measuring reaction rates. Once this step was passed, a major gap in the usefulness of steady-state measurements was filled, as it became possible to deduce information about the magnitudes of rate constants for bond-breaking steps without the need for transient-state measurements.At nearly 1100 pages this is a major work, with an impressive array of expert authors. So far as the part of the book that deals with isotope effects in enzymecatalysed reactions is concerned, most of the expected names are there, including Warshel, Klinman, Schowen, Plapp, Northrop, Cleland and Frey, as well as others almost equally distinguished. It is not so easy for the biochemist to recognize the names of the contributors to the first half, but there is no reason to doubt that they are just as appropriate. In any case, the book shows every indication of being an expert account written by people who know what they are talking about. It is perhaps a sign of how much the subject has matured that triose phosphate isomerase is not in the index, and appears not to be mentioned in the text, though it was once the universally cited example of analysis of an enzyme-catalysed reaction with kinetic isotope effects, following the classic work of Knowles, Albery and their co-workers. Probably their approach has been perceived as too difficult to be applied generally, and most modern studies derive from the methods pioneered by Cleland, Northrop and Schowen.For the biochemist the second half of the book is clearly the main attraction, and it will serve as a valuable handbook for anyone wanting to learn how to use isotope effects for studying enzyme mechanisms. Nonetheless, the first half is also well worth reading, as it provides a wealth of information on the theory of isotope effects and their application to chemical systems. The first chapter by Jacon Bigelson, an autobiographical perspective on the theory of isotope effects, including a substantial amount of historical information, is particularly interesting.This is a book that no serious library of books on enzymology should be without."},{"Title":"Matisse, Picasso and Gertrude Stein, with two shorter stories","review":"Buy this book, because it includes the amazing \\"A Long Gay Book.\\" This work is much, much shorter than \\"The Making of Americans.\\" Within it, Stein begins in the style which ends \\"The Making of Americans\\" (rhythmic, repetitive sentences which analyze the psychology of the different characters), and, somehow, during the book she transforms her writing, so that by the end of the book it is in the style of \\"Tender Buttons\\" (completely abstract writing, stunningly beautiful combinations of words with no clear referents.)

He explains the various concepts in layman's terms, cutting through the very archaic language beloved of some of the great philospohers.In addition, he provides exercises for the reader which allows the reader to make his/her own mind up about the theories and ideas proposed, so readers do not get the author's (possibly biased) viewpoint, but can formulate his/her own.It also helps the reader to approach all reading material with a more critical and analytical attitude.An excellent introduction to a subject which, courtesy of this book, is not as difficult or unapproachable as many might imagine.Paul WaldronDublin,IrelandNov 2004"},{"Title":"Learning to Philosophize","review":"\\"Learning to Philosophize\\" (1964) by British author/teacher Eric Revell Emmet (1909-1980), is a 270 page work bereft of an index. In this book the author examines language, concepts, questioning, values, reality and will, and offers mental exercises pertaining to them at the conclusion of each respective chapter for the reader to tackle. Sometimes \\"philosophical discussions\\" can degenerate into abstruse rhetoric, however, Emmet endeavours to make everything lucid here. Regarding learning to philosophize, he states in the book's introduction, \\"...we...hope to end up with more knowledge...wisdom and...understanding...if the...seeker after truth is not content with that...go elsewhere - to...mathematics...shutting...the world of 'it all depends'...in which we live.\\"To elaborate, \\"Philosophy Questions & Answers\\" (1980) from the Coles Notes series, by the Coles Editorial Board, explains that \\"Philosophy...is the love of wisdom....The distinctive feature...is...to evaluate...religious...aesthetic...moral experiences....the true...good, and...beautiful...scientists want...description of...facts of the world, philosophers are concerned about...meaning, logic, evaluation, or interpretation of...facts.\\"So it can come down to \\"a priori\\"--before the fact, that is philosophy, which belongs to the humanities, the study of experience of the human condition (in this context, via reason), versus \\"a posteriori\\"--after the fact, that, say, psychology, which belongs to the behavioral sciences, the observation/prediction of ideas, through experiment and experience.However, philosophy is where investigation starts, providing one with the methodology for all the behavioral/social sciences. Philosophy of science, i.e., psychology, is where philosophy would investigate matters like the cognitive and epistemological. For instance, with the latter, one would ponder what would be the most apropos methodology/theoretical approach in psychology to handle an issue--psychoanalytic, humanistic, or behavioral. A psychology of philosophy has never been in vogue, although \\"psychologism\\" was the inclination to embrace philosophical issues from a psychological viewpoint, as a few of the great philosophers, who were also psychologists (of various schools), did. \\"Philosophicopsychology\\" is the study of that which is both philosophical and psychological.Just what is it to \\"philosophize,\\" as Emmet describes in his volume, then? I believe a real (read: famous) philosopher, not one created by a book, could, in fact, philosophize. Said could develop his own system of thought--accompanied by a jargon (without being immured in it) to use in an argument to endorse his position--that profoundly changes something in the academic world and beyond, affecting the way everybody else approaches the aforementioned issues to evaluate. That's why we hear about and study such philosophers, who are all great minds, today. Those who merely teach (if philosophy can be taught, in lieu of participating in dialogue)/study/discuss ideas of these philosophers are what I would term \\"philosophists.\\"To get a feel for Emmet's book, allow me to refer to his chapter on concepts. A concept, according to some, is a notion/idea about a class of things, but also a word the author believes is used exorbitantly in the philosophical literature. Nevertheless, he says we can learn how this word is utilized and just what it is to use it. He does so admirably here, applying it to various things and phenomena. In the earlier mentioned analytical exercises we are asked about how words and phrases are employed and what they mean. In a typical sentence, such as fellow British writer David Herbert Richards Lawrence's asseveration \\"'Thank God I am not free, any more than a rooted tree is free'\\" Emmet asks one to talk about what concept of freedom is implied therein.Bottom line: Emmet's work assists one in thinking more effectively, but it certainly doesn't help one to learn to philosophize, or become a philosopher (whether or not that was his intention), as the answers to the problems the reader adopts are not earth-shaking, so perhaps he should have called this project \\"Learning to Think More Philosophically.\\" Please do give \\"Learning to Philosophize\\" by E.R. Emmet a chance to stimulate your mind (and learn a bit about psychology, too), where funky followers of the jumping intelligentsia dance high."},{"Title":"Elephant Cat (Copycats)","review":"What an absolute wonderful story!!!

Llinas.It was a pleasure to read this small book because Professor Llinas has managed to review his work and that of others within 160 pages. Llinas has written a very readable book that traces the history of transmission at the synapse. He has covered this difficult subject synthesizing ultrastructure, electrophysiology and molecular biology. The writer has been prominent in this field for 30 years and the book reflects his deep understanding of the subject. Dr. Llinas has managed to incorporate the major findings of some 500 papers into a working hypothesis of synaptic transmission. In spite of the complexity of the subject there are few errors. On page 65 microdomains should be in square microns and not square millimeters but this typographical error should be obvious when looking at Figure 3.2G and Plate 8. This little book is a must for graduate students and neuroscientists in general because it serves as both a starting reference and as a working text. The index is very helpful to find definitions used in the field (a glossary would be helpful). The soft ware shows the relationship of the presynaptic calcium current and postsynaptic voltage. This program will be instructive to students in understanding the importance of calcium dependencies on transmitter release.

The critics appear to be impressed above all by his mastery of the small, telling, historically accurate detail, details that add substance and a sort of veracity to his story. Imagine my surprise to find a litany of really bad mistakes of all sorts littering the text, making one wonder whether anything like an informed editor had ever been allowed remotely close to the text. In no particular order: 1) The French in the text is execrable: 'petits annonces' (!!!) Place Republique, Place Bastille, all sorts of solecisms. Couldn't his publisher have shown it to a REAL French person?! It's embarassingly bad. 2)In the very first scene of the book, the protagonist is seen in his seedy French hotel looking out the window at a slit of blue sky formed by a window shade banging aginst the window. Trouble is, French hotels don't have window shades, as anyone who has ever been to France surely knows, they have so called casement windows, shutters on the outside, and curtains inside. This is a commonplace of Frenchness, and Furst gets it wrong in his very first first paragraph. 3) His history is as deficient as his grasp of French culture and language. A few pages from the beginning, he has a character claim to have been wounded at 'le Chemin des Dames, near Verdun, in 1916.' Trouble is, 'le Chemin des Dames' is not close to Verdun, the infamous battle fought there was in 1917, and in fact provoked the French mutinies of May and June of that year, and has thus become a highly symbolic affair, whose significance Furst seems to have entirely missed. This is somewhat analogous to someone reputed to be an expert in American military history of the second war claiming that the Battle of the Bulge took place in Italy in 1942.So much for veracity, historical detail, and getting France right. Oh, yes. Furst refers to 'Gestapo troops' in the book. So much for his knowledge of things German!"},{"Title":"Red Gold: A Novel","review":"I read the paperback edition of this book, which lead me to read this sequel prior to reading the first book. There is no location on the outside of the book that explains this is a sequel. The positive news is that the story is self-contained and while it references the past it does not rely on it for this book to read well. I did read the first book, \\"The World At Night\\", and except for the dates the book is still enjoyable if partially compromised by having been read out of sequence. I don't see why a simple notation could not have identified the book as a sequel.Alan Furst writes about a narrow by eventful time from 1933 to 1945. His books are meticulously accurate to the point they would pass inspection by many readers of history. The author takes an unusual step at the end of his books by sharing with readers his sources for the novels he creates. This is not done in an academic bibliography or a blizzard of footnotes, rather he writes conversationally about what he reads, and what he suggests as reading for those who are interested.Our former film producer Jean Casson has transformed from a man without a positive idea of what he supports, to a man who now seems to get in the midst of everything. He also has lost any illusion of safety as he was taken to visit the Gestapo, and their interest in him has not declined.Casson's relationships with actors and other support personnel for his pre-war movies brought him in contact with a variety of political agendas that were of little interest to him at the time, and that now have become relationships that can get a person killed for real or imagined activities. His uncertainty about what constituted honorable conduct, and what loyalty means in wartime were all explored in the first book. In this sequel the lines have at once become all to clear, even as they are vague. Is a friend's politics prior to the war a reason to help them, to look the other way, or to promise to maintain silence in return for his own safety?In the first book Jean made a decision that set his future decisively in one area, and as the war progresses his environs become all the more lethal, and the reliability of relationships all the more questionable. There seems to be no end to those who would befriend him for his help, the question also remains how many of the same would turn him in without a moments thought.Alan Furst once again has written a fine book, and I look forward to the final two that are to be published later this year."},{"Title":"Red Gold: A Novel","review":"I read Red Gold just after finishing World at Night. The occupation has not yet ended at the finish of Red Gold. Casson has grown wiser and now is more dangerous as he is called upon to contribute more to the resistance. Furst does an excellent job recreating the sense of desperation among the French. In Red Gold the Germans begin to lose some of the bravura that they exhibited in World at Night. The exploits of Casson and his compatriots make for a great read. The suspense is created in a subtle manner which prevents this book from being what I consider a page-turner. Well worth the visit."},{"Title":"Red Gold: A Novel","review":"I was so impressed with, &quot;The World at Night,&quot; that I had to immediately read, &quot;Red Gold.&quot; &quot;Red Gold,&quot; unfortunately, doesn't compare with &quot;World.&quot; I certainly wish it did, because I was completely captivated by the first installment of the Casson story. I hope Furst continues and follows Casson on throughout the war. He's a compelling protagonist and Furst is a masterful storyteller. I've not read anyone who can recreate a time and period better than he can.Furst should consider writing another book or two with Casson. I love this character. He is a reluctant hero. What I enjoy about Furst's characters are their ambiguity, none of them are moralists.After the first twenty pages of &quot;World,&quot; I was hooked in, but I never felt that way with &quot;Red Gold.&quot; I read it through, but never felt the book was fully realized. I agree with a previous reviewer, who said, that Furst was going through the motions. I felt that a bit too. Having said that though, Furst is such a fine writer, that it really is a quibble, overall he's one of the best writing in this genre."},{"Title":"Red Gold: A Novel","review":"This work is a worthy sequel to \\"The World At NIght\\", and continues the story of Jean Casson, the French film producer, and now a, somewhat reluctant, member of the resistance movement in occupied France during World War II. The author has, once again, recreated the atmosphere of a country under the governance of another power, and the lives of the everyday people in reaction to that power, some submitting helplessly, some collaborating, and some, some few, taking steps to avenge themselves on the conqueror. There are the usual, for Furst, finely drawn characterizations, and the feeling of moral ambiguity constantly present in his writings. This book only takes Jean Casson to the latter part of 1942. I certainly hope the author continues his story, possibly until the end of the occupation: I like this man, and want to know how his story continues to go on as the years, dark and dangerous, pass for him and his associates."},{"Title":"Red Gold: A Novel","review":"Putting aside the fact that he is still one of the best time/place/scene descriptive authors in the noir genre, during much of this book Mr. Furst seems to going through the motions.

There are no unexpected twists or turns that would have made it a much more complete reading experience. A curious ending, too."},{"Title":"Red Gold: A Novel","review":"I suspect when a person reads any Alan Furst book, he is left with the feeling that some insane person has ripped out the last hundred pages or so. And so it is with 'Red Gold'. Furst is a master of atmosphere and characterization, but always seems to me to be a bit wanting in plotting. That said, I consider myself an enormous fan of Furst's. This book centers around Jean Casson, a down-on-his-luck film producer stuck in Paris without friends or money. He is thrust into the resistance and becomes a liason between a group of french army officers and the communist resistance.Casson has several thrilling adventures, amorous and violent. He hides in Paris, afraid of being recognised by old associates, but knows in his heart there is a war to be fought and, though he may be a reluctant warrior, he chooses to fight. Furst's novels all have a connection, the Brasserie Heininger, and it appears again here. So even though I get the feeling there are some missing chapters here, the war will continue in Furst's next novel."},{"Title":"Red Gold: A Novel","review":"For the second time in his well crafted series of espionage novels set amid the interwar years and opening acts of WW2 taking place in Eastern Europe, Furst departs from his usual stomping grounds in \\"Red Gold\\". Firstly, the story takes place in France, and its main character, Jean Casson, is French. Secondly, the timeline is from the invasion of France into World War 2- often occurring only in the final chapters of Furst's other novels. And in addition to this, \\"Red Gold\\" is Furst's only direct sequel in his novels of espionage.Jean Casson returns in this novel, and must chose between the Resistance and the Communist guerrillas while committing full time to active opposition to Nazi rule in France. Casson faces danger on all sides as he avoids both the Gestapo and the internecine conflicts within France's resistance movements. Furst continues to excel in his suspense, and this story contains some really great scenes; one in particular involving a covert radio transmitter being hunted by German counter intelligence. In its entirety- take with \\"The World at Night\\", I think Furst brings the story back to his previous heights that the first book alone failed to achieve.Unlike his other novels, this novel should probably not be read as a stand-alone book. If this is your first Furst book, I highly recommend beginning your foray into Furst's world with \\"Night Soldiers\\", his original and possibly best spy novel. \\"Night Soldiers\\" introduces several characters who make appearances throughout Furst's other novels set in the same period of time and general geographical local. However, if you are set on novels set in France, then start with \\"The World at Night\\", as this novel begins the story that \\"Red Gold\\" continues.What makes Furst's loosely structured series so compelling is that 1; they are very well researched and historical very accurate, especially with regard to spy craft - as I understand it through academic experience only. 2; the characters are extremely flawed, very believable and interesting to empathize with - all of the characters and their adventures provoke much thought. 3; the novels do not attempt to achieve a false sense of conclusion at their end - they always allow the reader to decide for him/herself what happens, and they rarely resolve the feeling of tension that pervades Furst's works. 4; the secondary characters are always very well developed and much more interesting than their sometimes small roles would have the reader believe- so one is always off balance (who will live, who will die - who can be trusted, who cannot?). 5; Furst does an excellent job of setting the atmosphere of terror that resulted from the conflict between fascism and the resistance in France during the Second World War.You cannot go wrong with this novel. While not Furst's best spy novel, for anyone interested in reading and enjoying spy stories, or stories of world war two, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"Red Gold: A Novel","review":"I am a recent convert to the fictional spy genre(much overused word). Along the way I lucked upon Alan Furst novels, among them was &quot;Red Gold&quot;. I found his sense of historical episodes to be factual, despite the fact that you knew the storyline itself was fictional. His characterization was somewhat wanting in my opinion and it seems that he writes with an overwhelming hint of &quot;this would make a good film&quot;. After reading several of his novels, I seem to have lost the thread of character, and find it difficult to recall who was in which novel....Perhaps my own shortcoming, or the shallowness of the characterization.

I wish Alan Furst could turn out a novel a year - I look forward to the next one, whenever it comes!"},{"Title":"Red Gold: A Novel","review":"Furst continues the character of Jean Casson (from The World at Night) in Paris and in Vichy France. The book's title refers to the misbegotten notion that Communists would have lots of money - thus Red Gold. Casson, as is Furst's wont, is an honest, decent, almost ordinary guy living on the edge of existence who falls into espionage work.Unlike some of Furst's more recent works (Kingdom of Shadows and Blood of Victory), this work has a fairly linear plot line. Casson is recruited by anti-German Vichy intelligence officers to make contact with the Communist resistance. Dangerous work indeed.The plot is stronger, but the 'atmosphere' is not as palpable.

Along the way he sees friends killed but manages to escape. Casson's new lover is the Jewish woman Helene who works for a travel agency. Casson's contacts in the resistance work hard to get Helene a boat ticket to freedom. Does she make it? Casson is also helped by his ex-wife Marie-Claire to hide out in her luxurious flat. Marie-Claire is living with an odious car dealer who is a collaborator with the Nazis. She is a patriot and hopes for the expulsion of the Nazi invaders.Furst is known for his succintly on target portraits of minor characters. Isidor Szapeta is a Jewish resistance leader who attempts to rob a Nazi transport. He also is a short wave radio operator. His story is exciting, scary and illustrative of the dangerous and deadly work of espionage.We see corrupt lawyers, Nazi officers, prostitutes, seaman and ordinary citizens trying to survive the dark days of German rule.Alan Furst is an elegant writer in the mode of English authors John Le Carre, Eric Ambler and Graham Greene. Anyone wanting a better understanding of the sable years of World War II in the City of Light will love Furst's novels."},{"Title":"Red Gold: A Novel","review":"Now and then I discover another of Furst's novels lurking in used book stores. I pick up these treasures and save them for times when good reading is rare and I have time to slowly unfold the story in my mind. This is fiction which gives the smell of reality, kind of like watching Casablanca but without happy endings. Not for the casual reader nor the lazy one, and many of the implications concerning the recent past are chilling. Furst explores moral and ethical questions in a fashion that does not force outrage or agreement. Of course this is fiction, but looking at the history of vengence, reprisals, betrayal and sometimes casual cruelty, I feel blessed in not having to confront such actions in day to day life and have some idea of current problems of conscience of those in Iraq and Afghanistan."},{"Title":"Red Gold: A Novel","review":"Former film producer Jean Casson returns as the main character, still struggling against man's inhumanity to man, in a France that seems to have given-in to its inevitable domination by Germany. After Furst's earlier \\"The World At Night\\", where Casson first chose to rebel, he is now a more skilled agent of resistance. He is tougher and more inventive, yet still vulnerable and human. His loves are real and passionate, and his losses accepted. They come with the war.In his 1999 novel, \\"Red Gold\\", when author Alan Furst describes this good man's descent into poverty and desperation during the horrors of Nazi occupation in Paris, we shiver in the dank and desolate hotel room with him, and we can almost taste the foul soup and moldy bread. Furst is that good a writer. His willingness to allow small victories and moments of humanity provides welcome bits of redemption.Furst knows about war and rough living, especially for the nomads from eastern Europe, who hate the nazis and fight desperately to escape the hold of mother Russia, whether in occupied France, Bulgaria or Madrid. Through his spare and vivid descriptions of places, and of real people thrust into unbelievable conditions, we learn how it must have happened in France. How people got involved with underground movements, how they compromised their friends, and how they became other people in order to simply survive. By extension, a reader can better understand how danger, violence, compromise, greed and deceit are still happening in different theaters like Iraq and Somalia and Afghanistan.Furst is a wonderful, inventive writer, who knows how to tell complex stories in a simple, profound way."},{"Title":"Red Gold: A Novel","review":"I recently read The Spies of Warsaw and now am reading all the Alan Furst I can get my hands on. Red Gold is another great one- the author writes so well about this time period. What sets Furst apart is the very ordinariness of some of the events and characters- the Gestapo occasionally screw up and let prisoners escape, and not every Resistance operation ends in Hollywood-worthy pyrotechnics. And Jean Casson makes a great world-weary hero."},{"Title":"Red Gold: A Novel","review":"After reading World At Night, I wondered whether all the praise for this author was justified and nearly passed on beginning another of his works. I was pleasantly surprised, perhaps \\"amazed\\" is a better word, to find Red Gold so different and so replete with the action and suspense promised but never delivered in World At Night. Perhaps the first book was necessary to understand fully our hero Casson, but Red Gold can stand on its own without belaboring his entry into espionage work, cluttered with a love affair that never seemed real.Red Gold is deserving of the praise heaped on Alan Furst."},{"Title":"Red Gold: A Novel","review":"I purchased this used book from Amazon and couldn't be more pleased with my purchase. The book arrived in a timely fashion and was in a like new condition. I would not hesitate buying a used book from this seller. The condition was better than stated and one would be hard pressed to tell it from a new copy."},{"Title":"Red Gold: A Novel","review":"Having recently read seven of Furst's eleven spy novels (as of 2010), I have offered a general review and a (of course opinionated) rank-ordering of them in the Reviews section of \\"Night Soldiers,\\" which I believe is Furst's best book. If interested in that overview, check out the review section for \\"Night Soldiers\\" or (perhaps easier) Amazon.com's catalogue of my book reviews on their site.I will offer one specific comment on \\"Red Gold.\\" It is one of only two books by Furst with the same leading protagonist, and \\"Red Gold,\\" is a direct sequel to the first, \\"The World at Night.\\" Much of \\"The World at Night\\" is spent building the character and context for that protagonist, Jean Casson, so the two books really complement each other and I suggest you not read \\"Red Gold\\" without first absorbing \\"The World at Night.\\""},{"Title":"Red Gold: A Novel","review":"Furst brings back one of his earlier characters and breathes a little more depth into him as he fully embraces his new life in the Resistance. As with all Furst books, the mood of wartime Paris is pervasive and he sucks you right into that environment, as you accompany Casson on his odyssey. As others have noted, you probably should read the earlier Casson book first in order to understand the man in full context. And if Furst occasionally boots an historical fact or a French idiomatic phrase, as another reviewer alleges, that should not deter one from enjoying this excellent Furst novel."},{"Title":"Red Gold: A Novel","review":"After re-reading 11 of Alan Hurst's novels, some 3 times, some 5, and always finding something new, I find him a novelist to live with. His evocation of life in Europe in the period he has chosen to research (1934-1944), his insights into the human condition in general, and his nearly poetic style, all bring me back to his books again and again. \\"Dark Star,\\" because of its rich complexity remains my favorite, but there is much to be gleaned from all the rest.The protagonist of\\"Red Gold\\" introduces the dark and complex politics of Hungary in the late 30's in such a way that it is possible to read about them without the reader's being completely swept away by the horrors of a small, defenseless country waiting for the arrival of the German army, knowing it means total destruction of their country and way of life. The sense of doom felt by most Europeans of the period is pervasive in the case of the small, indefensible countries - Hungary, Roumania and, after Chamberlain's betrayal, the Czechs. Furst through his characters and descriptions of landscape, hunger, armaments, history, in his relaxed and generally elegant prose, brings the reader close to the courage demonstrated by the characters in the novel facing desperate circumstances."},{"Title":"Red Gold: A Novel","review":"\\"Red Gold\\" brings another episode of the life of Jean Casson, the filmmaker who fell on hard times in Furst's \\"The World At Night.\\" This time, he's stuck between the resistance movement and the communists, not to mention the Nazis who wouldn't mind another crack at him. Casson soldiers on, through this complicated world that Furst recreates so well for all of us. This is Furst's greatest strength, bringing out the atmosphere, characters, and tension of a country occupied not only by a foreign invasion but a clash about how to fight it.I recommend reading \\"The World At Night\\" before this one. You won't be disappointed in either of them."},{"Title":"Red Gold: A Novel","review":"Alan Furst is a master of the spy novel and, given the texture and substance he gives his characters, we are often left wondering what ultimately happened to them. In this case (and perhaps only this case), the life of a main character continues into a second novel. \\"Red Gold\\" picks up where \\"The World at Night\\" left off and quenches our thirst for further details of the life of French filmmaker Jean Casson.In truth, \\"Red Gold\\" is the better novel. While \\"The World at Night\\" is unmatched in its physical description of wartime France, \\"Red Gold\\" carefully details the intricate political situation -- Gaullist and renegade militarist resistance groups; pro-Moscow, anti-Moscow, and former Communists; pro-Nazi French with pictures of Petain on their pianos. Add to this stew the war profiteers and black marketers, and you have a very different, and very ambiguous, picture of World War II-era France -- far different from the post-war propoganda of monolithic French resistance. Casson himself is a complex character without any definite political orientation. He is committed to fighting the Gestapo for personal reasons that amount to simple patriotism. While in \\"The World At Night\\" Casson almost seemed drawn into resistance efforts despite himself, by the time \\"Red Gold\\" opens Casson has grown as a human being and, while his motives are still ambiguous, his support for the cause is unquestionable.You can read \\"Red Gold\\" without first reading \\"The World At Night,\\" but I recommend against doing so. If you jump around Furst's novels, you generally lose nothing but an understanding of a wry reference to \\"The Brasserie Heininger\\" (which seems to appear in each one -- it is apparently THE PLACE TO BE SEEN in Furst's novelization of wartime Paris.) Reading the two Casson-related novels out of order, however, will cause you to miss important background information and will prevent you from understanding how some minor characters fit into the picture.I have read Furst's novels in order, starting with \\"Night Soldiers,\\" and have not found one that deserves fewer than five stars. \\"Red Gold\\" is no exception."},{"Title":"Red Gold: A Novel","review":"Furst is one of my favorite novelists. I have read or listened to all of his books. He writes about a fascinating time; the run up to and the progress of WWII. His characters are three dimensional with flaws, weaknesses, strengths and courage. He takes us to Hungary, Bulgaria, The Soviet Union, Checkslovakia, Poland, Germany and France. I got a very different view of the times, places and protagonists. These novels would make wonderful Film Noir movies.He peoples the novels with writers, movie producers, diplomats all caught up in the WWII intrigues. All become agents one way or another so you also get a view into the various secret services."},{"Title":"Red Gold: A Novel","review":"Red Gold was a very compelling, gripping read, but I think that was largely because I had read Furst's previous books first. His ability to evoke a place and time, loyalties and politics now all but forgotten, is competent here, but not on its top form as in Dark Star or The World At Night. What we do get is more than enough, though, a story about resistance to a highly bureaucratized power with no idea of the eventual outcome. Furst really captures the strange pace of life for a resistor in an occupied country, and his historical realism is superb. Try reading The World at Night before this one, and you might find yourself, like me, unable to stop turning pages."},{"Title":"Red Gold: A Novel","review":"...than Alan Furst. &quot;Red Gold' is another literary masterpiece from the king of the sophisticated spy thriller. My only regret is that, at 258 pages, I was hungry for more(I began rereading this gem immediately). I only wish Furst was published on an annual basis like some of the &quot;bestselling&quot; writers, but alas, he is a true artist and his work is far too detailed, his charactors too rich, to &quot;cookie-cut.&quot; Bravo, again, Mr. Furst. &quot;Red Gold&quot; is the finest novel published thus far in '99."},{"Title":"Red Gold: A Novel","review":"this is a good book for curling up with on a cold rainy day.

What you get with Furst is: good atmosphere and a likeable hero, who, however, is pretty much the same in each book. Personally, I would would like the books to have a bit more character and plot development, so that it doesn't seem as though the events and characters are basically interchangeable; but the books are entertaining nonetheless."},{"Title":"Red Gold: A Novel","review":"I've always enjoyed the intense atmosphere of Alan Furst's novels.

Before I was even halfway through finishing it I sent for 4 others of his WW2 era novels.Furst is often cited by professional reviewers as being like Graham Green or John Le Carre, Eric Ambler. But the writer who comes up for me is Hemingway. Perhaps because of the time period, and references to the Spanish Civil War, and Furst's spare writing style also conjures up Hemingway. Overall, not as noir-ish, meditative and dreary as the big Cold War novels, and the action more acute.I didn't realize this novel was a sequel while I was reading it. It stands well on its own, Furst managing to tell enough of the back story to satisfy a reader encountering this set of characters in this venue for the first time."},{"Title":"Red Gold: A Novel","review":"Furst's novels are great reads, not only because of the story, but because of the historical context and accuracy. The ending to this one came a little abruptly and, while setting up the next book, could have been a little more conclusive."},{"Title":"Red Gold: A Novel","review":"Red Gold continues the story of Jean Casson in occupied France started in the World at Night with more heart stopping suspense.

British music journalist Lucy O'Brien (author of &quot;Annie Lennox&quot;) goes above and beyond the usual \\"women in pop\\" formula to include not only extraordinary performing artists like Suzanne Vega and Billie Holliday, but also the groundbreaking female writers, producers, and engineers that aren't as often recognized by the media.O'Brien culls her information from more than 200 interviews conducted in Britain and the US over a 10-year period, beginning in 1984. Sifting through the genres of jazz, reggae, rap, folk, country, world, rock, and soul, she looks to those at the forefront of feminism in pop music, examining the extraordinary sense of self that propelled each of these women to not just ride the trends, but to create them.But don't dismiss this as a \\"just the facts\\" view of women in the music industry; it's much more. O'Brien is realistic and savvy enough to readily admit that there are issues that challenge women continually, including the ethics of blatantly leveraging one's sexuality as a marketing tool, the permeating lack of unity among women in the industry, and the self-destructive behavior that plagues many.Including a great collection of support material, such as photos, a bibliography, and a discography, She Bop is great addition to every rock fan's library."},{"Title":"She Bop: The Definitive History of Women in Rock, Pop & Soul","review":"though written almost five years ago, lucy o'brien's _she bop_ is still one of the definitive books to cover the role of women in the music industry. like _rolling stone: women in rock_ and _women on top_, o'brien extensively documents the often-overlooked contribution that women have made to all forms of music, since the birth of the recording industry. o'brien peppers her account with excerpts from actual interviews accumulated during her years as a music journalist. in contrast with other books on the same subject, o'brien provides a uniquely english view, including artists that are often passed over, even in femenist music anthologies. by documenting the contributions made by women such as lisa lisa, shara nelson and martha wash, o'brien's book seems more thorough than those that focus only on industry divas. this book is an absolute must for anybody interested in the way that recorded music is dealing with issues of sex."},{"Title":"She Bop: The Definitive History of Women in Rock, Pop & Soul","review":"She Bop is an in-depth look at the history of women in blues,country, folk, pop, rock,souland world music. In the Prologue the author tells of her own introduction to the music world in a girl group, The Catholic Girls, in Southampton, England in 1979.Based on more than 250 interviews conducted between 1984 and 1995 plus many secondary sources, She Bop is not a simple chronological history but rather an exploration of themes, trends and genres. It looks at how women have negotiated their place in the music industry, the importance of role models and even rivalry.The author examines the issues that have challenged women from the blues through 1940s swing to MTV at various stages in the development of pop, for example how they deal with stardom, how they negotiate everything from contracts to image, the genres in which women predominate and women on the business side: managers, executives, publicists, journalists, producers and A&R; people. In addition, women as consumers of music are discussed.Some chapter headings include: From Blues To The Jazz Age, Dream Babes In 1950s Pop, Motown, Spector And 1960s Svengalis, Whatever Happened To The Rock Chick?Punk, Performance Art And PMT Pop, Female Singer/Songwriters Of The Grand Hotel, Madonna, Manipulation And MTV, Artistry, Androgyny, DeconstructingThe Disco Diva, The True Story Of Women In Rap AndReggae, Women In World Music, Women And Protest Pop.Because of its length, this is quite a daunting tome but it soon enough becomes an engaging read. There are some factual errors, probably because of sloppy editing (the 6-day War took place in 1967 not 1957) and a few other contradictions often on the same page. Also, O'Brien's feminist theorizing can become tiresome but her knowledge and enthusiasm for the music ultimately make She Bop a gripping read.She Bop is also a handy reference work; it concludes with Notes, a Selected Discography, Selected Bibliography, Index Of Names and Index Of Albums and Singles. Photographs enhance the text."},{"Title":"She Bop: The Definitive History of Women in Rock, Pop & Soul","review":"This is an interesting and informative book. I especially enjoyed the parts that referred to Dusty Springfield and how her unique singing style influenced rock &amp; roll.

Check out both books, especially if you're a Dusty Springfield fan."},{"Title":"Paul Rand","review":"Paul Rand was a giant among designers, and one of the key reasons that graphic design exists as a profession in the United States. Heller, obviously a great Rand fan and friend(not to mention a prolific author), has given his subject his due, tracing Rand's evolution as an artist and the arc of his career. From a 1942 Autocar annual report whose design is astonishingly current to some work for Dubonnet that perhaps hasn't stood the test of time as well, Heller's choices of accompanying materials is excellent, illustrating as well as telling Rand's core philosophies: Effective graphic design is straightforward, purposed, and well-reasoned. This is a straightforward, well-assembled book that falls short in two very minor ways: While much is made of Rand's European influences, none of this work appears in the book, and select examples rather than just mention of Rand's contemporaries would have done a better job of placing his work in a more historical context."},{"Title":"Paul Rand","review":"a book to keep for designers. heavy with ideas and great graphics. having known paul rand and being inspired by him the book also presented some graphics i have not seen as it was before my time. a book to refer to about design in general. solid text and research. miho"},{"Title":"Paul Rand","review":"I just received my book today and have not been able to put it down.

I was very happy with my purchase"},{"Title":"Ironman's Ultimate Bodybuilding Encyclopedia","review":"I bought this book here along with all the other big popular thick books/encyclopedias, like the Bill Pearl books an the Arnold books, among others. I enjoyed reading the front section on the origins of the bodybuilding made popular from the early days of muscle beach and some of the early figures like Joe Golds' recollections among others. I am still looking this over, having bought it and many others to add to my bodybuilding personal library, and like I keep on saying in my other reviews, there is no such thing as \\"if you could only have one book then such and such is it\\", it is never true on any one subject, and I bought several books used from Amazon dealers, decently priced, though I bought this book new and on sale.Some areas of interest in the book so far I have read is for instance the chapter dealing with several greats of bodybuilding fame, Bill Pearl and Arnold Schwarzenegger, where Arnold mentions a great workout routine once used by many called the golden six, and Bill Pearl talks of beginner to advanced workout routine he used, and there are other workout routines outlined of course. I haven't completely read every page yet, but I can tell this is a fine reference that I will study along with all the rest to give myself the best, fastest, safest route to building more size and ironing out my weak spots in an ironman fashion, so to speak.Lastly, speaking of the last chapter, \\"Drugs in bodybuilding,....stop the insanity\\", an interview with a mr olympia contender is very interesting about the horrors of this particular subject. In my opinion, just like what Arnold said in this book when interviewed, and what Bill Pearl practiced, just like all the other early successful big names did, that gains in muscle mass can be done without drug enhancements, and it is true. Pretty much folks who abuse substances to become unrealistically large, for winning competitions or getting ahead in any way from looking extraordinarily big and looking artifically athletic and fit, are just junkies. Maybe it is society that is alot to blame, I mean, we see all the shows on t.v about women, models and actresses, even business women, who get breast implants, and suddenly those are the women who get acting roles, modeling jobs, or job promotions above average women who are \\"smaller\\" in the chest. Same is true for men of course, I got a job opportunity once over a much younger man once cause I had larger muscles and looked fitter, it was obvious, the employer thought I was much younger and fitter, but technically in that case I was stronger and more able to do the job from being stronger and lifting weights in my spare time and cycling. I don't think the other guy, that even if he took steroids to get muscle, would have had the stamina and actual built up tendon strength like I did, that took me years to achieve(probably why so many bodybuilders or those dabbling in it and young get injured so much and why evey major book has sections on injury recovery and how to avoid them, so much)."},{"Title":"Ironman's Ultimate Bodybuilding Encyclopedia","review":"I am running a succesfull gym since 2001.

Most books on the topic of weight-trainging are written by a single person and, therefore, only express one person's experiences. However, everyone is different; what builds muscle for one person may leave another no larger than 6 months before. This book gives multiple opinions by some of the country's most renowned body builders. Sometimes their opinions conflict, sometimes they coincide. Regardless, the reader is given a very thorough overview of the different possible routines to follow.

Culled from a variety of sources from deep within the culture of the west coast bodybuilding havens of Venice Beach and Santa Monica, this compendium of relevant information and sage advice has been produced by veteran bodybuilding coach Peter Sisco, who used extensive interviews with bodybuilding stars and the mounds of information produced by research technicians associated with Ironman magazine, who also produced a wide variety of helpful publications such as this one. You will find everything you need here, from the best way to flare your quadriceps to the best way to widen your shoulders by bombing the lateral heads of the deltoids.Given all this, the book is both highly informative and quite inspirational, showcasing a number of recent bodybuilding luminaries, using both photographs and drawings to illustrate correct exercise performance, useful training techniques, and the latest in scientific breakthroughs that are on the very cutting edge of what contemporary bodybuilders are using to constantly attempt to get even bigger, stronger, and more striated and cut. Using the treasure-trove of Ironman's photographic archives, Sisco has produced one of the best single volume works covering the waterfront of bodybuilding yet. It compares well to the standard Weider's \\"Ultimate Bodybuilding\\", Schwarzenegger's version of the book, and even Bill Pearl's superb \\"Keys To The Inner Universe\\". This is a book that works well for the bodybuilding enthusiast wanting or needing a handy reference volume he can throw in his gym bag and read between sets at the local iron dungeon.

The articles on training are the best ones that the magazine has to offer. As with all bodybuilding books, you'll want to pick-and-choose which routines and advice you want to adopt. I thought the book was a 4-Star book rather than a 5-Star book for the following reasons: 1) The section on Nutrition was weak. It didn't really address cutting edge nutrition questions, but focused--unusually, I thought--on variations (e.g., vegetarianism), and 2) it's a 2-color book. This is probably a nit, but the magazine is 4-color, and 4-color photos reproduced as 2-color lose something (especially if they haven't been &quot;color corrected&quot;). But these aren't really slams on the book as a whole...4-Stars is pretty good. The one thing I wanted to say above all else, is that Pete Sisco has done the bodybuilding world a huge service by including the anonymous interview with a &quot;Top Pro&quot; bodybuilder and his use of steroids and other drugs. What an eye-opener. [Good job, Pete.] This chapter will let you see why steroids and other drugs are such a disaster for the long-term health of bodybuilding athletes. I hope younger bodybuilders will read that chapter especially, and make the commitment to train as &quot;naturals&quot;. It's a really good book, and you'd do well to have it in your bodybuilding library."},{"Title":"Ironman's Ultimate Bodybuilding Encyclopedia","review":"I've been reading this Ultimate Bodybuilding Encylopedia for the last few weeks and I find it very useful and motivating.This is very different than Arnold's encylopedia, not better or worse just different. If you want a systematic and comprehensive guide to bodybuilding exercises and their performance then Arnold's is what I would recommend. Note that (in my opinion), many of the routines are geared more for someone w/ performance enhancing drugs and would severly overtrain most natural bodybuilders. Still, Arnold's book is incredibly comprehensive and has been updated since the original release.The Ironman encyclopedia is more of a collection of articles from Ironman issues over the years. The great thing about that is you get a variety of points of view and approaches which is excellent.The price of the book is VERY inexpensive compared to what one would have to pay if you were to buy the same volume of valuable information in magazines.Personally I'm not a big fan of the overall direction bodybuilding has gone with the extreme juice monsters, but this book has a mix of material that can cater to a natural bodybuilder as well as those into the more extreme aspects of the sport. In addition to the many excellent articles, there are photographs which contain bodybuilders from both \\"schools\\" of bodybuilding which is not something you find very often.I've recently purchased the Ironman Natural Bodybuilding Book which is also excellent for those interested in focusing specifically on a drug free approach (though certainly some of the extreme supplementation used by \\"natural\\" bodybuilders almost approaches a middle ground between completely natural and pharmaceuticals).For me the most important thing has been learning the difference between how to approach training from a natural point of view. I train for health and appearance, but not even remotely with the idea of competition, and it's been great to learn so much about how to workout hard without overtraining, especially for someone drug free like myself.A lot of attention is paid to the fact that natural bodybuilders/weight trainers really have to learn how NOT to overtrain, something I most definitely did many years ago. I worked out way too much and really hit a wall.Anyway, the different articles contained in this book has a plethora of interesting information that I think most people interested in pumping iron will find useful and enjoyable to read.Another thing I really appreciate in the book is the honest discussion of the various drugs being used by non-natural bodybuilders. I especially liked the fact that Ironman had the guts to have interview with the anonymous IFBB Olympia competitor who frankly discusses the insane drug combinations he uses to stay competitive and the dangerous health issues he faces from that use. It's such an over the top interview that it actually had me going \\"Is this for real?\\", but most certainly it is. I've talked with several athletes who have used performance enhancing drugs and they suffered greatly from the side effects so this interview rang true to me.It still amazes me that the IFBB hasn't tried to clean up and legitimize this sport into a sport that people can take seriously. Instead, they've taken a great sport and turned it into a freak show. They've created an environment that is horrific for the athletes, men and woman who should exemplify health and instead exemplify drugs. This Ironman book, while still featuring many \\"juiced up\\" bodybuilders, at least doesn't shy away from the truth about these drugs where many other publications have a \\"don't ask don't tell\\" approach.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Ironman's Ultimate Bodybuilding Encyclopedia","review":"I always rely on this book, scanning over and over certain mass-gaining strategies, like the featured article, &quot;Compound Aftershock&quot;, which is an awesome biceps/triceps program that potentially explodes your arms.This book is awesome because it includes 3 to 5 pages of weightlifting stories from classic natural bodybuilders like Bill Pearl, Larry Scott, Mike Mentzer, Arnold, Tom Platz, and others too. For instance, Tom Platz explains how he made his legs huge and musculur. Also, how Larry made his football-sized biceps grow so huge with his routine. One bodybuilder will tell you that a good triceps exercise for gaining triceps mass is the decline barbell extentions, which is very effective for me when I superset it with dumbell kickbacks. I've never seen this type of growth before.I've only read half of the book so far and yet I'm gaining mass.If you have trouble gaining mass, scan over the &quot;Training With A System&quot; section. It makes you see your mistakes with the possibility of overtraining, using too much weight, inefficient diet, or too much strees. This article shows you how to prevent it.Ironman's section on the mental aspects of training is especially motivating and convincing--making you eager to workout and get huge.The Nutrition aspect of this book is weak though. One article is about vegetarianism, which I have no clue why they introduced such an inappropriate diet for a bodybuilder. However, they still give a few pages of bodybuilding type diets that you can gain mass upon.This book will never bore you because I find that I am always reading new ways to build mass from reading this book and that has helped me eliminate worthless workout routines. Anybody who bodybuilds naturally should get this book, as this book unleashes very clever and strategic workout routines.

I always enjoy the banter between Wolfe and Archie and in this book we see how far both are willing to take an argument. I try to solve the mysteries but that is not my primary reason for reading Nero Wolfe.

And ends in a murder case.A murder that Archie may get blamed for! A good read for a slow or rainy day. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"If Death Ever Slept","review":"Author Rex Stout presents a delightful central concept showcasing one of mystery fiction's most unlikely yet enduring partnerships, that of rotund master detective Nero Wolfe and his smartalecky sidekick Archie Goodwin, who does all the legwork and narrating. Magnificent Manhattan ambiance and clever offhand dialogue abound, as does an appreciation for the finer things, like orchids, shad roe with creole sauce, and a second bottle of beer.\\"If Death Ever Slept\\" showcases these strengths, but as a murder mystery, it's neither plausible nor interesting. Wolfe is hired by a wealthy Manhattanite (vaguely described as a \\"capitalist\\" in \\"Who's Who\\") to investigate his daughter-in-law, whom he suspects of stealing business secrets. Archie poses as the man's new secretary, and finds himself \\"in a hive of predators and parasites\\" with the former including at least one person armed with a .38 and no compunction against using it.This should be good stuff, fine company for a rainy night, but the characters never gel into anything interesting, just stereotypes. You don't feel anything for them or their situations, not even when one of them is murdered. The pace is sloggy. \\"If Death Ever Slept\\" is an luxurious ambiance bath, and those that treasure Goodwin's funny lines and wry observational humor are well-served (About being caught in his room with his shoes off: \\"Conferring in bare feet with a man who is properly shod may not put you at a disadvantage, but it seems to.\\") Alas, it never engages the reader as a story.I had problems with the way Wolfe and Goodwin took the law into their own hands, tampering with a crime scene and then parsing over legalities while people died. Normally when the cops show up all out of sorts at Wolfe's brownstone stoop, you are supposed to relish the moment the fat man puts them in their place, but this time the pair meddles with a police investigation that's on the right track while Nero and Archie haven't a clue.Also, Archie's practiced patter wears thin after a while. He's got a great set of wisecracks, but nothing in this story seems to bother him, so why should we care? We already have a setpiece scenario, with all the stock characters in their stock situations, so any bit of empathy we can get from our humble narrator will help. But the most he offers is that the client's daughter does a mean rumba.Nero Wolfe books are usually good to great, and this at least is at times pretty funny. But it's far from Stout's best. If you read this and nothing else, give Stout another chance. And if you are looking for your first Nero Wolfe, there's at least a couple dozen better bets than this."},{"Title":"If Death Ever Slept","review":"Stout creates a female character here who writes a poem. She is moved to write it because she has killed a squirrel and is mourning its loss. Her turn of phrase is \\"If Death Ever Slept...\\"This supposes, of course, that death never sleeps. The conceptual buzz much informs this book. As detective fiction goes, it is leisurely and ruminative, so I give it only the two stars you see. However, I enjoyed its characterizations of the relationships in \\"the family.\\" Archie's insecurities and professional jealousy are never better described than they are here, and the other extended family members are given a good airing.But why did she write it? If it was because she felt bad about the squirrel and wants to share, she almost succeeds. There is too little satisfaction at the conclusion of this one; its tone of futility and moral loss rival the way the reader feels at the end of \\"Fer-de-Lance.\\""},{"Title":"If Death Ever Slept","review":"The Nero Wolfe stories by Rex Stout are timeless. Nero Wolfe is a fat, bad-tempered genius detective who almost never leaves his brownstone mansion in New York. The stories are told through his self-styled man-Friday, Archie Goodwin. Archie is Wolfe's foil: witty, active, and charming to the ladies.In &quot;If Death Ever Slept&quot; Archie leaves the brownstone to go undercover as a secretary to a rich and important financier. It's classic mystery stuff -- a house full of suspects, some of whom get killed off as the story progresses and enough clever banter to keep you interested between the murders.And that's exactly what I want in a mystery. Mysteries are supposed to be about clever people. There should be someone clever enough to think they can get away with murder. And there needs to be someone cleverer than that to catch them. Clever people should have clever dialogue. I'm not much a spine-tingling suspense mystery buff. I read mysteries for the fun of it. There has to be humour. Murder should be a funny business.The other important characteristic of a good murder is that it should be a struggle to figure out who did it. All the clues should be there to find but it should be far from obvious.If Death Ever Slept has the humour but it only partially succeeds on the mystery/clue front. I enjoyed the ride to the end. But once I'd finished the book I realised that for the last third of the book I had paid only scant attention to who the murder might be. When it came I wasn't surprised or gratified because I wasn't really interested any more.I think I just like being in the comfortable brownstone with Wolfe and Archie eating good food, sitting in comfortable chairs and discussing the intriguing business of murder. In this book, I had absolutely no connection with either the victims or the killer.Still, I enjoyed it as I enjoy almost all Nero Wolfe books."},{"Title":"If Death Ever Slept","review":"Just finished this book and my overall reaction was ... yawn. All the elements are there -- Archie, Fritz, Wolfe, beer, orchids, etc. But this is one of the later books in the series and there's a certain ennui evident. The mystery seemed over plotted, the characters under developed, and any genuine charm was missing. Of course even subpar Nero Wolfe is entertaining, so I'm not sorry I read it. I just enjoyed the earlier books so much more, and seeing the series go downhill is depressing."},{"Title":"If Death Ever Slept","review":"When a millionaire approaches Nero Wolfe with a plan to expose his daughter-in-law as a snake, using insider information to make a profit at his own expense, Wolfe is tempted to brush the man off. Sadly for him, he and Archie Goodwin have just had a fight, and in a fit of pique he allows Archie to go off to the man's house. However, it soon becomes apparent that something strange is going on at the Jarrell house, and when it leads to murder, Wolfe becomes determined to let nothing stand in the way of his getting to the bottom of things...no matter the cost.I have become something of a Nero Wolfe fan, having only discovered him over the last year. This book is another gem in author Rex Stout's crown! As always, Nero Wolfe is fascinatingly eccentric, and Archie Goodwin is a source of great fun with his witty banter. The mystery itself was very good, and the story and characters very interesting.What can I say? It's a great book, and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"If Death Ever Slept","review":"Okay, some of the elements of this book are a little silly -- like the dead squirrel poem -- but again, I'm trying to get into the Nero Wolfe fan mind, and this book pushed me just a wee bit closer. I find Wolfe just plain irritating, but the star of the show for me continues to be Archie, who really does underestimate himself. Well, this was book 3 for me; on to book 4."},{"Title":"If Death Ever Slept","review":"When Otis Jarrell came to see famed detective Nero Wolfe he did not realize that his cause was hopeless. He wanted Wolfe to investigate a domestic matter, the fact that Jarrell's problem was his daughter-in-law rather than his wife did not impress Wolfe. When Jarrell suggested that Archie move into his penthouse undercover though Wolfe decided to accept the case because he and Archie were annoyed with each other. The ten thousand dollar retainer didn't hurt either.Needless to say shortly after Archie took up his post in the Jarrell household things began to get complicated, first a break-in and theft, then a murder leading Nero to disrupt his routine, call in all the troops, join forces with a FEMALE colleague and leaving Fritz to guard the brownstone's door for the night. In the end of course, Wolfe triumphs.This is one of the later entries into the series. The situations have all occured before, the banter between the detectives has become a bit worn, life at the brownstone has been examined many times in the past and the action in this one is a bit slow. Even with all of this a visit to the Wolfe establishment is not to be missed. This is a must for fans of the series and not a bad place to start for anyone new even if it is not one of the best."},{"Title":"If Death Ever Slept","review":"Unlike Archie's last such assignment (in _Too Many Women_, written 10 years before this book), this case gives the reader a decent chance to solve the puzzle.Ordinarily, Wolfe wouldn't ask where Archie's been when he comes in at 2 a.m. But when Archie walked out on Lily Rowan's party because she'd invited some people he didn't like, she started calling the brownstone, starting at 8 p.m. and ending at 1:30 (\\"So I, not you, have spent the evening with her, and I haven't enjoyed it.\\") The conversation went downhill from there, so when Otis Jarrell appeared for his first appointment with Wolfe the next day, he got the benefit of a rather stormy atmosphere, with Wolfe exerting himself to be pleasant, just to show that nothing's wrong with *him*. (To be fair, the brown envelope with $10000, cash, offered as a retainer, might have helped.)Unfortunately for the exchequer, what Jarrell wants is to break up his son's marriage: Wyman married \\"a snake\\", and Jarrell believes that Susan has leaked damaging business information to his competitors several times. He wants to pass Archie off as a replacement for his own newly fired secretary, Jim Eber, until Wolfe and Archie come up with the goods. Archie's beginning to feel sorry for the rejection Jarrell has coming at this point - not only a near-divorce case, but depriving Wolfe of his services indefinitely - when Wolfe responds, \\"You realize, Mr. Jarrell, that there could be no commitment as to how long he would stay there.\\" Archie, always a quick thinker, runs with this rather than squawking, and \\"Alan Green\\" becomes Jarrell's secretary.Archie's new assignment palls very quickly. But matters become deadly serious when someone bypasses the security cameras in Jarrell's office to steal Jarrell's own gun, and Jarrell is too fixated on Susan as a suspect to get serious about finding it. Then matters escalate to plain deadly...Leavening the mix of emotional relationships and industrial espionage are several timetables distilled from police reports, but they're provided in one big block so that you can ignore them at your own peril if you prefer. (Personally, I can enjoy this one just fine without worrying much about trying to work out the puzzle.) More interesting points include: Jarrell's daughter Lois, who (despite writing the poem from which the book's title is taken) is one of the 3 best dancers Archie's ever escorted; the measures taken by Archie to appear as Alan Green when the group is interviewed by Wolfe; and how Wolfe manages to escalate their quarrel to a new and more frightening level. :)"},{"Title":"If Death Ever Slept","review":"\\"If Death Ever Slept\\" is a Nero Wolfe novel by Rex Stout. This book was written in 1957. As in all the Wolfe books it is narrated by Wolfe's assistant, Archie Goodwin. Otis Jarrell hires Nero Wolfe to find something that can get his daughter-in-law, Susan, out of his house. Archie goes undercover at the Jarrell house posing as Jarrell's new secretary under the name of Alan Green. Archie interviews everyone in the household to find anything on Susan that would get her out. While he is still investigating, Jarrell's former secretary, James Eber, is found murdered with a .38 revolver. Jarrell discovers that his gun which is also a .38 is missing. Two days later, Corey Brigham, a business associate of Jarrell's is found murdered also with a .38 and is presumed by the same gun that killed Eber. Nero Wolfe, with the aid of Archie and other detectives, solves the case is his usual fashion by assembling all the suspects as he announces the murderer. The title comes from a poem written by Lois Jarrell, the daughter of Otis. She has killed a squirrel and wrote the poem in remorse. A strange title, but a very good Nero Wolfe novel. I really enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"If Death Ever Slept","review":"Perfectly agreeable novel, until the denouement; the reader is not privy to information necessary to solve the case, and the solution relies on Wolfe's assorted henchmen and colleagues accomplishing a bit of routine work better than the police would. Perfectly ridiculous."},{"Title":"If Death Ever Slept","review":"Although there's a lot of funny dialogue between Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin at the beginning of this book, the story as a whole seemed rote, as if the author were going through familiar motions without heart. In this story millionaire Otis Jarrell hires Wolfe to discover whether his (Jarrell's) daughter-in-law is stealing business secrets and selling them elsewhere. In order to uncover the truth, Wolfe has Archie take a job as Jarrell's secretary and move into the Jarrell penthouse. Archie does, and then murder follows. More than one. The mystery is solved at the end when Wolfe interviews the suspects and presents a piece of evidence given him by Inspector Cramer. Worth reading if you're a Nero and Archie fan. Maybe even if you're not and just want the taste of a 1950s mystery with lots of wit and cleverness."},{"Title":"If Death Ever Slept","review":"What I ordered was acknowledged almost immediately.

The heroine, Coventry Dakin, begins the novel by stating, \\"I am beautiful and yesterday I killed a man.\\" From here, we go on a whirlwind journey, as Coventry eludes the authorities, abandoning her controlling husband and the two children she loves. She runs to London, lives as a homeless person, then as a domestic, and even stoops to one incident of prostitution.Meanwhile, the brother she loves, Sidney, is off in Portugal with his wife, Ruth, and is no help to Coventry. There is the police inspector obsessed with capturing her, in a very Inspector Javert style. There is the relieved widow of the man Coventry presumably killed. And, there is the question that Coventry doesn't need to be running away at all. How could she have killed a man more than twice her size by hitting him on the back of the head with an action figure?Sue Townsend's style is witty, acerbic, fast-paced, and incredibly different. It is amazing the characters she creates, and the situations she puts them in, and the novella is over almost as soon as you start it.

There were things that Townsend wanted to comment on that she couldn't do with Mole, so she has made this protagonist a homeless woman on the run.

If that were not enough, you also get a zombie poster gallery and a zombie movie guide offering reviews of most every zombie movie ever made (with some exceptions in Asian cinema}. This book is filled with color photographs throughout; even if you did not read the book, it would take quite a while to look through all the photographs.

There are some groundbreaking films missing from the main text, although they are still contained within the glossary to include an overview and rating. I would love to have seen Bob Clark's seminal and often derided CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS as a major feature in the book. There is a chapter titled \\"Hippies shouldn't play with dead things\\" but it focuses entirely on Jorge Grau's LIVING DEAD AT THE MANCHESTER MORGUE, which is a fabulous film in its own right, but I would have preferred some page time devoted to Clark's atmospheric and gritty portrait of the subject.All in all a more than worthy addition to any gorehound's library of Zombie Cinema, (if you care lucky enough to find a copy without having to sell your car)."},{"Title":"Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol","review":"Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol is a must for any Christmas library.

Otherwise, fantastic."},{"Title":"Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol","review":"The play script is useful in its own right, but it is NOT the hardcover story I was expecting. If a picture had been posted here on Amazon, the confusion would never have arisen."},{"Title":"Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol","review":"A Christmas Carol is a good book told in third person point of view. It is mostly about Scrooge and how he starts out all mean, lonely, and hates christmas, and how he becomes nice, kindhearted, and starts to like christmas, as he is visited by ghost of christmas. During the time he was being visited by the ghost he became nicer. He fered the ghost of christmas yet to come more than any other ghost he is visited by because he fears of what to come or what could happen in the future."},{"Title":"Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol","review":"Witty, charming and with perhaps a bit of plagiarism, Tom Mula spins a bewitching tale. In his \\"Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol,\\" Mula reverses the tables, and it is Jacob Marley, that venerable old fool, forever bound to torment by Dickens, who gets his crack at redemption. Not far into the text, Marley asks, \\"You mean we don't have to stay here?\\" [referring to his tormented state.] He gets a reply, \\"Of course not!... You apply for a transfer.\\" Grace, apparently, isn't meant just for Scrooge, and so the story unfolds. What transpires is a behind the scenes look at how Marley helps change Scrooge, thus changing himself. In the end, Jacob Marley is set free and it is, indeed, a remarkable moment. He has been bound by Dickens for all these years. We read: \\"Mr. Marley... all Debts are now Forgiven, all Bonds broken -- and here the shackles opened and the chains fell from Marley's hands, arms, waist, ankles, and neck.\\" Mula's story is not without imagination, but I'm a little uncomfortable with his over reliance on Dickens' work, not just his theme, but the use of exact sentences to fill in narrative, and numerous instances where he condenses Dickens' work into his own."},{"Title":"Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol","review":"I had the pleasure of seeing Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol in Chicago at the Goodman Theater over Thanksgiving weekend (performed entirely by author Tom Mula). His performance inspired me to read the book. I don't know which I enjoyed more! Both, in a word, terrific!"},{"Title":"Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol","review":"Marley and the bogel take the reader on a wonderous journey through Scrooges transformation from crudgemudgon to Christmas spirit. Author Tom Mula has created a story destined to be a Christmas classic in it's own right. In the Dickens style the reader views Scrooges change from Jacob Marley's side of the picture. Aided, and sometimes abeted, by the bogel Marley leads Scrooge, himself, the bogel, and the reader along the path to the true meaning of Christmas. Any who read it or have it read to them cannot help but enjoy this story. Bravo to Mr. Mula for creating this work."},{"Title":"Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol","review":"Mr. Mula has created more than an outstanding tribute to the Dickens' original; he has created a modern classic in its own right. Jacob Marley's case is taken up with humor and sensitivity as we follow his personal journey to redeem his former partner, Ebenezer Scrooge.A wonderul book with enormous insight, JACOB MARLEY'S CHRISTMAS CAROL will touch you as much the ninth time as it will the first."},{"Title":"Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol","review":"I have read or seen a production of Dickens' A Christmas Carol at least 25 times. Would I really like another version of this same story by a comtemporary author? Yes! I loved this book, and so did the young woman to whom I gave it for Christmas. This is certainly not a substitute for the Dickens' gem, but it is a nice supplement. I'm sure I'll read it many times, and I plan to give more gift copies."},{"Title":"Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol","review":"This wonderful little book is a welcome addition to the Dicken's classic.

If you love the original, you must have this!"},{"Title":"Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol","review":"As a Dickons reader and enjoyer, I can testify the author has caught the Dicksonian style beautifully. But, I must confess, I've only HEARD the book read aloud on an NPR affiliate. On the basis of that I would recommend it be read by all who have come to love the original &quot;Scrooge&quot; Christmas Carol by Charles Dickons. It is &quot;the same story&quot; from Marley's point of view. Movement from abysmal greed to heavenly generosity with the help of the 3 spirits and an imp."},{"Title":"Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol","review":"This is a an absolutely delightful read. It pays respectful homage to Mr. Dickens while taking us on a journey that is heartfelt, funny and poignant. Mr. Mula's creative portrayal of the real story behind the Marley visit to Scrooge on Christmas Eve will stay with readers long after finishing the book. I will be giving the book to many friends and family this holiday in the hopes of creating a new tradition - the annual reading of Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol. Leave it to a child - Mr. Mula's muse - to get indignant that Marley got a bum deal in the original story by Charles Dickens. Mr. Mula takes the reader on a stunning journey, creating a visual panorama through his words that enables the reader to see, to feel, to experience all that Marley does in his efforts to save Scrooge, and himself."},{"Title":"Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol","review":"I own & absolutely love the hardcover novel version of this story, and was very disappointed it was out of print when I conceived the idea of giving it to family members as a Christmas gift.So I was thrilled to see it available again as a paperback, and ordered 15 copies, without realizing the paperback is a play version (perhaps that it was published by Dramatists Play Service should have been a clue....) The dialogue in the play version is essentially the same as that in the novel, but it isn't nearly as enjoyable a read without Tom Mula's lyrical descriptions of Jacob Marley's surroundings, as well as the internal dialogue of the characters.If you are buying the paperback to stage a production, I think it would be a very worthwhile endeavor. If you're looking for a novel to curl up with on a cold December evening, get one of the used hardcovers...if I haven't bought them all!"},{"Title":"Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol","review":"This is a very witty and imaginative alternative version of Dickens's A CHRISTMAS CAROL. And it also has a very affecting moral of its own about self-sacrifice--Marley thinks that Scrooge is unredeemable, but then comes to pity his former partner and sacrifices himself for Scrooge, which has unexpected (and beneficent) results. It is also full of witty dialogue and pithy poetic descriptions.Also highly recommended is Tom Mula's reading of this work--he does an OUTSTANDING job."},{"Title":"Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol","review":"We have made it a tradition to read this story every Christmas.

In any case, there's hardly anything in English that covers matter in more depth from a Muslim perspective."},{"Title":"Hadith Literature: Its Origin, Development & Special Features (Islamic Texts Society)","review":"The book is mainly about the development of Hadith. Author also tries to prove that the science of Hadith has started before or at least with the Islam and not like some Orientalists think after 2-300 years of Islam. Author explains the classifications of the Hadiths, Isnads and Hadith writers, their life, how they were teaching and spreading. A lot of references are given to each claim so I suppose the descriptions given are real and not fantasy. Each major Hadith writer is briefly described with littel autobiography. Overall it is more like Historical text rather than techinal or philosophical explanations. There is no mention of hadits from Shia sources so it is stricly Sunni origin. Shia sources are as though non-existent so from this perspectiv I did not find it very objective. There is a nice Appendix at the end as a response to Goldziher or Schacht or people in their opinion."},{"Title":"Mac OS X Administration Basics Exam Cram (Exam 9L0-500)","review":"Very good intro book here.

Bartender, gimme another\\" she remarks about one fund-raising event. \\"Cancer made me feel special in a weird way... I didn't feel bad for myself and I didn't want other people to either.\\" The woman's insouciance is breathtaking (and could well be offputting to those who, unlike Erin, are losing their battle against the disease); love her or deplore her, it's hard to dispute that her brazen disregard for tactfulness reveals a most distinctive voice. Barbs fly in all directions -- including zingers at her adored mom, dad, and 2 sisters -- and she holds nothing back about her own motivations, e.g. \\"I hadn't really done much volunteer work since high school and even then it was fueled by my desire to look well-rounded on my college applications -- and because all the cool kids did Key Club.\\" It may not be the prettiest picture, but it comes across as very real."},{"Title":"My So-called Normal Life","review":"I read all of Erin Zammett's columns in Glamour magazine, so when I came across this book I hesitated to read it - I didn't want to re-read everything that was in the columns. Plus, I thought, how interesting could reading about someone's cancer treatments be? Turns out, very interesting.That's because this book is about much more than just Erin's cancer treatments. It's about her life as a whole, while going through some unusual and hard cirumstances. Ms. Zammett has a great writing style and manages to keep things interesting and fast-moving while instilling humor into the book and telling it like it is. It's obvious that she's very honest and makes no attempt to stay \\"PC.\\" (She openly states that she lost weight while undergoing treatment, and still loves how she looks in pictures from that time period.)This book is an easy, interesting read, and after finishing it you can't help but admire Erin and her family for what they've been through and feel a little bit grateful for your life as it is."},{"Title":"My So-called Normal Life","review":"I'm actualy Steve's wife, Jodi who's writing this review.

Cut to this summer, I was vacationing in Maui with my husband, right there, at our hotel was the girl from the pictures that I had read about for all these years. We spoke and she told me that she was on her honeymoon and that she was doing and feeling great. I told her that I loved her articles in Glamour. She then told me she had written a book.

When I found out she had written a book, I quickly looked for it and purchased it. At first I thought I might just be reviewing what I had already read in the magazine, but obviously the book goes into much more depth and I really enjoyed learning about and \\"getting to know\\" her family. I really feel like I know them and it made me want to be one of the many houseguests at her parents' home!

She turns her tragedy into good work and action by starting to fund raise for the cancer society and with the help of glamour magazine raises 25,000+ dollars. There is another twist in the story. Completely unrelated her sister gets cancer as well, Hodgkin's lymphoma. Unlike leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma is curable.

But just like the author, I was diagnosed at a young age. Even though we did not share the same cancer, I could relate to the way she described how she felt throughout her journey/recovery and how people in her life (boyfriend/family/coworkers) were affected by it.

There were a few, but I kind of lost interest when I felt she kept going on and on about everything she did for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.

But most places I already knew about and nothing really popped out at me as an extraordinary new discovery. The second part of the book, over 200 pages, is called \\"Places To Go\\" and contains three page descriptions of various countries throughout the world deemed to be worthy of the \\"bluelist\\" of best places to travel this year. I found this part of the book most useful and interesting, as it can serve as both a basic reference guide to the countries covered as well as an introduction to countries the reader is less familiar with.I can't quite give this book \\"5 stars\\" as none of the book's travel recommendations really blew me away.

I couldn't read Japanese, so of course I bought this romanized dictionary. It was a mistake. When I looked up an English word, there were too many possible Japanese words to choose from. After trying to use them, and my audience not understanding them, I showed them the book. More often than not, poth parties became more confused than before.Here's the solution: buy a dictionary that uses kanji. Every kanji character has a meaning, and all Japanese people can read the 2000 or so basic kanji that are likely to be in the word you looked up. If you buy a good dictionary, like Kodansha's Furigana dictionary, the kanji's pronunciation (hiragana) will be displayed over each kanji character. This makes the dictionary usable by beginners.If you can't read hiragana, I suggest you learn. Don't waste your money on a book that you'll stop using as soon as you learn hiragana, which should be within the first month of studying Japanese."},{"Title":"Holy Root, Holy Branches: Christian Preaching from the Old Testament","review":"Ron Allen is a professor of preaching and New Testament at my seminary, Christian Theological Seminary, and the author of many books on preaching and biblical exegesis. For this volume, he teamed with John Holbert, who teaches preaching and Hebrew Bible at Perkins School of Theology, SMU. One of the perennial tasks of a preacher is to faithfully use the scriptures that came before the four gospels and rest of the Christian era writings. This books addresses that issue head-on.One of the issues, which comes to the forefront at the very start of such an inquiry, is what to call it? There are issues with the terms \`Old Testament', \`Hebrew Scriptures', and other commonplace terms we take for granted. The assumptions built into the term \`Old Testament' conjure up negative images and an implicit second-class status. Thus, the authors adopt the terminology, still imperfect, of First and Second Testaments.Attendant to this, and highlighted in the opening of the first chapter, is the tendency on behalf of Christian preachers to trivialise the First Testament, recasting it as at best less important than the Second Testament writings, and at worst, recreating a Marcion-esque trait of leaving it out altogether. Marcion recast the Bible as a small document that included only a few of the major Pauline letters and the gospel of Luke.\`Ironically, Marcion's ideas led to the formation of the Christian canon as we know it. He forced the church to consider the question of what should be in the canon and what should not. The church ultimately and wisely voted against Marcion and said that it could not live without the First Testament. Nonetheless, Marcion's ghost still haunts the Christian pulpit.'In approaching the First Testament as a document worthy of preaching, Allen and Holbert look toward images of God and God's relationship with humanity that are able to stand alone while reflecting a message consistent with the gospel message. \`The First Testament does not always need the Second to give it meaning and importance for the Christian community.' Allen and Holbert give a systems of twelve steps to follow to build a credible and useful sermon from First Testament passages. (Readers of Allen's other texts will know that he is big on step-by-step methodologies for sermon construction.) In addition to this process, the authors give various thematic approaches that could be appropriate for use of First Testament texts in preaching, such as creation, covenant and steadfast love, deliverance and justice.Perhaps the most interesting chapter is the fifth chapter, \`Texts that Apparently Offer Little or Nothing to the Christian Pulpit.' To the astute reader, the word \`apparently' in the chapter title is an obvious give-away. Taking on texts such as regulations about circumcision, dietary restrictions, Temple rites and regulations, Allen and Holbert recommend various techniques and modes of thinking that can make them more relevant and useful. Above all, the authors caution against using these texts merely to dismiss them.\`The preacher may be tempted to criticise or dismiss difficult passages because they do not appear to measure up to Jesus Christ or the Second Testament. This tactic is often problematic. It probably misrepresents the relationship between Christ, the Second Testament, and the First Testament. It presumes that the picture of God and religion in the Hebrew Bible is inferior to that of the church and that the First Testament is discontinuous with Christ and the church.'Allen and Holbert then take a brief survey of the current state of biblical scholarship and criticism, particularly as it applies to the connection between the Testaments. The authors then look at five different sermons, the texts of which are presented in their entirety, with notations and important points highlighted in the midst of the sermons by commentary set off in italics.One of the tasks of Christian Theological Seminary over the past few decades has been a deepening Jewish-Christian dialogue and recognition on the part of Christian preachers and leaders of their responsibility in making Jewish-Christian relations difficult. This text helps in the process of reconciliation, by helping to limit the misinterpretation and misrepresentation of the Jewish people and the Hebrew scriptures in Christian pulpits.This is a useful text for anyone who wants to a greater understanding of the significance of the First Testament for current Christian preaching and practice."},{"Title":"The Death of Britain?: The UK's Constitutional Crisis","review":"John Redwood exposes the shallow hypocrisy at the heart of the New Labour 'Project'. The government's programme of ill-thought out constitutional changes can be harmful to Britain. Blair is a fraud; this book completely exposes his reliance on the politics of envy. All those who have been seduced by the Labour Lie Machine should read this book."},{"Title":"The Death of Britain?: The UK's Constitutional Crisis","review":"This book confirmed many things that I have long suspected. 'Democracy', as it stands, simply doesn't work."},{"Title":"Lemady: Episodes of a Writer's Life","review":"Lemady is subtitled Episodes of a Writer's Life and is a rambling, idiosyncratic stream of consciousness discourse which is probably the closest Keith Roberts ever came to writing an autobiography. Roberts is famous as the author of Pavane, an alternate history novel that brought him fame (though little fortune). Many of his other novels are worthy though they are very hard to find having been published mainly by very small presses with very limited print runs (though Wildside Press has brought several of the rarer novels back into print and they are now easily obtainable through Amazon.Com). One reason for this was Robert's rather irascible character - he had a positive genius for alienating his colleagues and sometimes he seemed to go out of his way to be difficult. Lemady contains its moments of bitchiness (he is quite scathing about Kerosina, a small press which almost single handedly kept many of his books in print in the 1970s) - but despite this a certain grace shines through. Nobody who could write such beautiful novels can be entirely devoid of soul and insight. Many of the obituaries published on his death concentrated on the negative aspects of his character - it seemed that even after he was dead, Roberts kept the enemies that he made in life, and those enemies proved to be very unforgiving. Well; distance lends enchantment. I never met Roberts, but I admired his books hugely and Lemady adds an extra dimension that I for one am very pleased to have discovered."},{"Title":"Lemady: Episodes of a Writer's Life","review":"Subtitled &quot;Episodes of a Writer's Life&quot;, Lemady is a fascinating and idiosyncratic fusion of fact and fantasy that records some key events and encounters in Roberts' life. Although, from one perspective, the narrative can be perceived as a personal record, it also features a fictional character, the Lemady of the title, who interacts with Roberts as he remembers. Truth and fantasy are therefore never what they seem; one becomes the other and the reader must decide where real life finishes and fiction begins. Not a major Roberts work, but essential for anyone interested in what makes the author tick."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This was one of my favorite books while I was a teenager--an elaborate plot, love, betrayal, wealth, what else can a teenager want. That is why I am giving it 5 stars. Would I read and appreciate it now as much as I did when I was younger--no. I am much more mature and knowledgeable to accept and enjoy the complicated twists, turns, and coincidences."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This was one of my favorite books while I was a teenager--an elaborate plot, love, betrayal, wealth, what else can a teenager want.

I am much more mature and knowledgeable to accept and enjoy the complicated twists, turns, and coincidences."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo, besides being a wonderfully entertaining story, is heart warming and inspiring. One follows not only the path of Edmond Dantes's life but also the path of hate and vengeance. The story blossoms at a comfortable speed so that the semi-complicated storylines don't leave you lost. I will recommend this book to all the people who are looking for an entertaining mind trip to &quot;a dazzling, dueling, exuberant France&quot;."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Nineteen year old Edmond Dantes is falsely accused and thrown into a dungeon by three men; one sacrifices Dantes to his ambitions, one covets his fiancee, one is jealous of the young sailors success. His unbearable captivity in the Chateau d'If lasts until his ingeniously conceived escape fourteen years later. When he returns to wreak his terrible vengeance on the men who imprisoned him, he is no longer the naive, idealistic Edmond Dantes; he is the cunning, cynical, and fabulously rich Count of Monte Cristo.The complex plot of the book makes it slightly challenging, but the suspense and intrigue more than compensate. I thoroughly enjoyed this fictional masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"If I could give more than five stars to 'the Count of Monte Cristo' I certainly would. Dumas' novel is less an action story than a testiment to human endurance, ingenuity, and ultimately, self-forgivness. The story's protaganist, Edmund Dantes, is sent to prison on false charges where he lingers for years. During his unjust incarceration he mets a fellow inmate who teaches him, guides him, and also bestows upon him a fortune. Dantes uses this fortune to set a plan into action. For years he has dreamed of revenge against the men who put him in prison and now he will have it. More riviting than the web of intrigue Dantes spins to fulfill his scheme is the deeper quest for self-redemption that unknowingly haunts him. Retribution and revenge, though important plot points, take a backseat to Dumas' opptimism in this stirring tale. Magnificent!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I read The Three Musketeers and loved it, so I decided to read another book by Dumas. This one was even better and easier read. I couldn't wait to see how Dantes would get revenge on each of his enemies.If you like a good adventure story, I recommend this and any other novel by Alexandre Dumas"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I read this book in 4 days. I couldn't put it down. It is an intense story about a man who is sent to jail wrongly. When he escapes years later, he enacts revenge against those who put him there.

Some readers might find that it gets &quot;slow&quot; at times with all the french lines and the sparce action, but if you stick it out, then you will find that in the end it becomes such a valuable experience. Compared to todays modern fiction, this book becomes so much more interesting and historically valuable"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is absolutely the best book I have ever read. Before I read this book I only read The Three Musketeers and both are amazing. After Monte Cristo I read all of Dumas' books and judge them all a 10+. Extremely amazing!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Alexandre Dumas has been placed up there in my opinion as one of the greats of all time. His plotline is so deep and thought provoking that I must say, this is one of the best books that I have ever read. Those of us that dream of revenge will love this book. The character of Dantes is developed to perfection as are his enemies. You want him to get them all. You want Dumas to hurry up and finish them already, but he keeps you hanging in there right up until the great ending. Highly recommended in my opinion - read it you'll love it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Counte Of Monte Cristo is my favorite book. What a story of revenge and it is not all bad. Dante only hurts those who hurt him and in the process helps others the only thing that I did not like about the book was the end. It was to short and fast, but I think that if I could have my way the story would never end."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is an excellent classic. I've read this book twice, and reread certain parts several times more. Full of rich, complete characters and fantastic subplots, this is a must read for everyone. The best Dumas book by far, it's simply outstanding."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Alexandre Dumas is brilliant with this fantastic novela. This tale is filled with love, revenge, wealth and misfortune. The hero, an innocent young man named Edmond Dontes, tells his tale of love, hope, fortune, distraught, happless, reveng and the rebuilding of his life. Edmond is shown his dreams being fulfilled only to have them ripped away from him as he was just getting a sniff. Set up by jealose colegues, Edmond finds himself inprisoned for life with no explanation of a reason. In prison he learns from a friendly cell mate of his blindness due he being nieve. After a daring escape plan that works, Edmond starts a long hard struggle back to the top that finishes with revenge.This is on of the better classic books that can capture the modern readers attention."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I REALLY enjoyed this book! I actually went to bed early at night so I could get to reading! We read it for school and it was the first time my teacher had ever had a class that enjoyed a classic novel so much! Only 1 person in the entire class read the Cliffs' Notes! Now my mom is reading it and agrees with me that it is an excellent book! I do think, though, that the end could have been better...I didn't think I would like a revenge book, but there is so much more to this one. I highly recommend it for entertainment purposes."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book is a great book. The way the plot is structured, the way Edmond Dantes slowly takes his revenge, to make it all the more painful on his enemies.The setup is ingenious--Dantes is in the best situation he could possibly be in. He is getting married, and is going to become the captain of the Pharaon, a ship that he is first mate on...and then, out of the blue, some police come in, and he is put away in the Chateau d' If, an island prison, to die.Dumas is a master of conveying emotion. At some parts of the book, one is forced to be depressed, and share the melancholy with the characters in the book. The arrow of anger that Dantes must feel toward his enemies is shot from the pages and into one's heart. And the happiness when Dantes is going to be married and at other joyous occations is almost an aroma in the air, rising from the pages of the book.Unfortunately, this book does, like every book ever written, has some aspects to be criticized. First and foremost, the length: 1074 pages is quite a bit for the average reader! Even the abridged version is 500-something pages. And there are also French sayings, anecdotes, and words that you must look at the footnotes to understand. Of course, in the abridged edition, it doesn't even have footnotes. But overall, this book is an enjoyable book, and unlike some other books written by amateurs, this book makes you think about the very nature of mankind."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Worth all the 1,000 over pages.

The unabridged version in hardcover is the best way to go. I had a trade paperback version but it fell apart during the second reading. I've read this hard cover version at least six times and it is holding up very well. Now about the book- I love the story, the way it is written and all the intertwined side stories that make the main plot all the more intriguing. I get something more every time I read it. It holds a permanent place on my night stand. You will not be disappointed reading this book. It is more than a five star rated book!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Just finished this marvelous classic. Don't delay - start reading today, this new translation is fabulous. Now it's on to Madame Bovary!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"It's very hard to find an unabridged version of this work and I had to wait a few years until this particular version came out...although even here there is some abridgement to eliminate repetition from the manner the story was originally written. I was very happy when it did. As a commentator notedThe Count of Monte Cristo (Penguin Classics)is the authoritative fully unabridged edition although it's in paperback. It's a classic story of the era - if you've never read this or heard of this story, it's classic.In my mind its very similar to Les Miserables and Great Expectations. There's the hero who gets beaten down, then he rises up, gets helped by a benefactor, and then proceeds to get some revenge: its a dish best served cold :-)This edition is wonderfully bound just like all the Everyman Library Editions. It comes with a dustjacket which is nice and it's a thick book.I highly recommend reading this by a fireplace in winter with some wine and cheese.Enjoy"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"great condition.

Unlike many works of classic literature, this book does not gbet overly wordy. Unfortunately, Dumas does begin to confuse the reader at times. This is due to a high number of characters who are either having affairs, scheming together, etc. From that standpoint, it was at times (short though they may be) like a very complicated soap opra. Fans of Monte Cristo are advised to read Les Miserables, by Victor Hugo."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"If you have not read this book, I encourage you to stop what you are doing right now and read it. It is simply the greatest book you will ever read. All too often the classics tend to be boring or a little too wordy. &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; is different. Even though it is over 1400 pages, the story never drags. Alexandre Dumas grabs your attention from the first chapter and never lets go. I read a childrens version when growing up which was my favorite book for years. Recently, I decided to read the unabridged version. Needless to say, I loved it. You will, too. So, do yourself a favor. Buy the unabridged version and just give it a try. I guarantee you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This edition is worthwhile alone for the translator's introduction, highlighting exactly what was missing in earlier editions and how the exclusions/changes grew in each version. His translation of dialogue retains some of the direct simplicity that Dumas' original has (per the experts), but lacks the faux, grande-melodramatic language of the popular editions I read as a child.This is THE classic 19th century saga, incorporating the Gothic and globe-trotting heroes of the tail-end of the 18th C. with contemporary Romantic sensibilities. If you've only seen film/tv versions you'll find some of their swashbuckling elements missing. This is not The 3 Musketeers; instead the search for a moral core to their choices is in all the characters. With a supporting cast of characters as rich as Dickens at his most memorable (Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist) the Count himself (and Sinbad the Sailor, and Edmund Dantes) still remains a complex archetype. I urge you to read this translation, whether you've visited the story before or not. Put it on your list with Big Reads to Savor (right next toWar and Peace)."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"If I could, I'd give it 6 stars rather than merely 5. Alexandre Dumas' writing style is what we lack today. He could not have told the story any better, and no writer will ever surpass his brilliance. If you think you've found your favorite novel and still have not stumbled upon this one, then you don't know what you're missing. In all honesty, this is what literature is all about. And if you don't care to read long novels, then buy the abridged one. This is absolutely worth the effort."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is a book which deseaves to be a best seller even today.

It may take some time to read, and the story may have many characters, but he develops everything so well and brings it all together.Not only is the story itself well developed and fascinating, but Dumas presents many other angles to observe and watch for while reading this book. The entire plot itself is a study of morals, honor, and ontological questions.

This is the reason it's so easy to choose amazon over everything else."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is a great story make no doubt about it, but it is slightly sprawling and unfocused, not that i'm suggesting and abrigment, it's just that the book could do with a trim rather a complete gutting. Several of the parts are rather longer than the need be, the Rome section in particular drags tediously (it was originally meant to open the book, it was only after he had scetched out the plot that he decided to tell the story of Edmond Dantes incarceration and break-out instead of us meeting the enigmatic Count in the middle of the Roman Carnival and moving on to Paris shortly there after).As most people know the Count of Monte Cristo is the story of a wrongfully imprisoned man who breaks free, gets a massive fortune and then sets out to revenge himself on the people responsible. What most people don't know is that the prison section serves only as a small part of the story and that it is in the main taken up by the Count's prolonged revenge. What most people also don't know is the bits that are often left out of the movies and the abridgements yet so enliven the tale such as suicide, infanticide, lesbianism, transexualism, murder and drug taking. On the whole then Monte Cristo is a brilliant if flawed tale."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"A true classic with good reason.It's a great read. Entertaining throughout.

He is engaged to the girl of his dreams, and has just been appointed captain of a ship. Life couldn't possibly get any better for Edmond.But every likable and successful young man has enemies. Edmond's conspire to get him arrested as a spy, at a time in France when the political situation was very touchy. On trumped-up charges, he ends up in prison, in confinement alone in the dungeon.For awhile Edmond thinks he will die. He thinks he would like to die, and begins starving himself to death. But then a chance interaction with another prisoner allows Edmond to gain some insight into his situation. Despair gives way to fury, and Edmond decides to get himself out of prison and take revenge on those who did him wrong. Through a fortunate set of circumstances, Edmond begins to put his plan into action.I really liked the plot of this book; I loved the idea of Edmond having the mental strength as well as the financial resources to ruin the lives of those who had him locked away in his youth. I enjoyed watching the worlds of Edmond's enemies crumble.The book was rather simplistic, though, with far too many coincidences that allowed the characters to get what they needed to get, from stumbling into a fortune to being in the right place to eavesdrop on a critical conversation. The author's hand was heavily felt in this story, when things just happened to work out exactly right for the characters."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I was pleased with my purchase it came very quickly and the price was great."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I enjoyed the movie, but the book has so much more story background.

The language, detail, and life of Edmond Dantes as depicted by Dumas is unlike any other book I have read. There is no filler or boring moments. Every line gives great insight into the characters. The idea Dumas presents is novel and paints revenge different than any way I thought about in the past. The movie is a disaster and distortion of the main points the book presents by the way. A must read."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I can't believe with all the books I've read that I never read this one. It was wonderful. enjoyed every page right to the end."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I love this book! I first saw the most recent movie that was made based on this book and after seeing the movie I needed more. This book has definitely delivered what I was looking for. Theres so much great detail throughout the book. I couldn't wait to see what happened next!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is the definitive Kindle Edition (ASIN: B002RI9KL8). Translated and introduced via Robin Buss.As a newcomer to the world of e-books and e-readers, I was very happy to discover all of the free classics available both here at Amazon and elsewhere (e.g., Project Gutenberg). Unfortunately in regards to translated works, not all translations are created equal and the other versions of this classic pale in comparison to this one.One of my favourite books of all time!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is an epic tale depicting approximately 25 years in the life of Edmond Dantes. The story introduces Edmond as an enterprising sailor, a young man full of promise, and one who appears to have everything in control. Edmond is a bit naive, but honor-bound, which ultimately leads to unwarranted hardships, grief, and despair followed by an unquenchable desire for revenge.The story includes numerous references to God and providence where blessings come down on those that do good, and punishments come down on those that do evil. I agree with these Christian concepts, but I was constantly thinking of Romans 12:19-21 where the Bible states we are not to avenge ourselves because \\"Vengeance is mine, I will repay says the Lord\\". Edmond feels it is his God-given duty to avenge himself by punishing those who plotted against him.I felt the story was a bit unrealistic at times in that things outside of Edmond's control usually worked out just as he planned; however, there were a few surprises. I held back giving this story five stars primarily due to its length and complexity. I understand Dumas wrote this in 18 installments and was paid by the word. I thought this caused the story to drag at times and to include some unbelievable schemes. On the whole, I found this book to be an entertaining adventure!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The title says it all. Go for the unabridged version. Great subplots and digressions that add to the flavor of the story."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I read this in high school and it was the best book I have ever read! It can be hard to understand so it may take longer to read then your average book. It is also pretty long. But if you enjoy reading you will def. like this"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Just wanted to put 5 stars on my favorite book of ALL TIME. UN-abridged. UNABRIDGED. I can't emphasize that enough. The story is genius, inspiring, engrossing, phenomenal, entertaining, beautiful & perfect. The detailed & years in the making revenge, fitting for each enemy was so clever. Dumas could have added another 1200 pages and I wouldn't have flinched. I reread The Count every year or two & I never get sick of it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Normally I shy away from really long books. But I remembered that some years ago my son read this in high school, and he thought it was great. I gave it a try, and found it to be fascinating. The language is not prosaic, but thought-provoking, and is best read when there's enough time to savor the author's choice of words."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"My father, Edmond, was named after the Count of Monte Cristo, which his father was reading when he was born in 1914. And so my dad introduced me to this book when I was 13. Alexandre Dumas' epic is a much-treasured book that has sojourned with me over many, many years: I've read all 1200+ pages at least five times (not including the time I mistakenly checked out an abridged version from the library), and own an unabridged copy published in the 1940s. My hardcover copy is in two volumes, heavy and cumbersome to read. Reading it one more time, now on Kindle, has been a delight.This book has it all: love, fear, betrayal, friendship, greed, passion, hatred, remorse, vengeance, death, heartbreak, intrigue, magic, second chances, and includes the drugs and sex as does my hardcover copy. The story of Edmond Dantes' wrongful imprisonment, his suffering, despair, education, ultimate escape from the dungeon of the Chteau d'If, and re-appearance as both the angel of love and mercy, and that of vengeance and death, is the story of humankind in all its permutations. There's no way anyone can read this book and not come face to face with aspects of their own being, for better or worse. I remain in awe of Dumas' imagination and ability to draw you into a world where the full range of human emotion is laid bare and anything, or almost anything, is possible.Those of you who have enjoyed this book might also want to consider The Prince of Foxes and Captain From Castile, both by Samuel Shellabarger, and of course Dumas' The Three Musketeers. I credit Dumas and Shellabarger with helping me break out of the spell that was cast over me by my traditional education and opening my eyes to the truth that things are not the way we're taught they are. Shellabarger in particular helped launch me into a lifetime of inquiry."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Buss' translation makes The Count of Monte Cristo a beautiful, smooth and understandable read. I highly recommend it. Dumas would be pleased."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"It is one of a must have classic stories of all time. With the price, and the illustration, there was no second guessing on buying this book."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I was told to read this book by a friend, I wasn't to optimistic about reading a classic since the last one I tried was \\"Les Miz\\" But this was such an amazing book. I loved the plot, the writing style (Dumas is very witty), and the characters. This has become one of my favorite books of all time.I will give a warning though to be prepared to spend time thinking as you read, this isn't a book where you can thoughtlessly read. There are a lot of characters and they are all intertwined.This is NOT a kids book!But get this book, it deserves to be read and enjoyed!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the best books I've ever read - and I'm not much of a \\"classic lit\\" person. The unabridged version looks intimidating but it's an \\"easy read.\\" Every word was so gripping that I flew through this in days. The story evoked emotions similar to watching a thriller movie. There were numerous \\"edge of your seat\\" moments for me.The Robin Buss translation is wonderful and very easy to read. However, the only thing I don't like about this is the binding. The cardstock paper for the cover is very stiff and it seems impossible to not permanently bend it out of shape once you open the book. It also seems impossible to not get ugly white cracks down the spine. I'm disappointed that Penguin didn't publish the paperback out of sturdier material like the Modern Library books.Other than that, I think this is one of the greatest novels I've ever read. My hope is that Penguin will republish this as part of their clothbound series."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This might be my favorite book of all time. One confession I have is that I had to read it a second time to fully appreciate some of the subtle nuances of the story. The first time I listened to the book I sometimes got confused about who was who.John Lee did an amazing job at naaration. In no way did his reading get in the way of the story.For those that have not read classical literature from this time period you are in for a treat. The dialogue is AMAZING. I am convinced that we have forgotten how to fully use spoken words in our everyday communication. Alexandre Dumas is a master of communication and I found myself thinking that I must remember some phrase or other that he uses.The story is no less captivating. The intricate web of diverging and converging plot lines kept me fully engaged as Dantes fortunes rose, fell, and rose again.For those that have not read The Count of Monte Cristo and are not afraid of a longer book you are in for a treat. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is a huge book at around 1500 pages. It is about the size of War and Peace but a much faster-paced read. It helps to print out a list of the characters as there are many.Though the term Magic Realism wasn't coined until around 1925, the Count of Monte Cristo easily fits into this genre. Hope, justice, revenge, mercy and forgiveness are themes in this excellent novel.I don't think I can write a meaningful review of a novel this long. It is huge in scope and a real nail-biter.Don't be intimidated by the size. It is well worth the effort. Of the 50 novels that I have read this year, this is the best."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Make sure you understand the number of pages in this book. Huge! A great book that shames the movie adaptions. Excellent translation to English. Funny to find out that Dumas was payed by the line, so it can be a little long winded at times."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is one of my favorite books of all time. It is a long book - let's admit that right up front. I mean weight-lifting heavy and need a month to leisurely read long. It is totally worth it.Author Dumas starts with a young, thriving protagonist who is a little wide-eyed innocent for my personal taste. Stay with it, things change big time. The count is well drawn and full of cunning, driven by revenge, grounded in a sense of his place in justice and frankly someone I would love to be...well, I would want only the count part of his life. His fate was forged by the worst of betrayals and self-centered ambition of those who could have helped him.I'll never meet a woman named Mercedes without thinking of young Edmund Dante's love. I am looking forward to meeting someone named Haidee. Curious? Read the book and you'll understand why.Actually you should read the book because you will enjoy it immensely. It is a great way to spend some quality time with a count."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is a wonderful book.I second the comments of J. Cooper.As mentioned in Cooper's review, there are two versions, the abridged and the unabridged. I have read both, and I strongly recommend the unabridged. It is long (Dumas was writing a serial for a magazine), but worth it. The time saved in the abridged version is paid for with confusion: People pop up and events happen without explanation. In addition, the secondary characters are fleshed out and made much more interesting/enjoyable in the longer one.The Buss translation is also very nice, particularly in comparison to the old, out-of-copyright, standard version. The notes are good, without being obtrusive, in explaining both current events, e.g., the July Revolution, and current literary allusions.In re-reading the book in this version, what struck me was how religious, in a sense, it is. The characters, and presumably the author, are people who believe in a God who moves in mysterious ways. The book is like a little time machine that takes you back to a way of thinking in mid-19th century France. Although the language is a bit florid (everyone seems to \\"shudder\\"), the book, particularly in this version, is well worth the time.I read the book in the Kindle version, which, given the book's size, is especially convenient. The links to the notes work well, as does the Table of Contents."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"brilliant, this book written by alexandre dumas is a masterpiece.. do not let the length deter you as my only regret is not having read this book sooner. thank you alexandre dumas for these wonderful characters."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Unlike the previous reviewer, I am a fan of this version. I've read other translations, abridgements and the full version of the novel, but this is my favorite. When I get to teach the story, this is the version I choose. It has the main plot elements and major characters, but leaves out much of the cluttering, distracting detail."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"A brilliant piece of literature, a real tribute to French literature, Alexandre Dumas is a genius with all the subplots and major plots that he intertwines which makes this a superb novel. I found myself guessing about what was going to happen next but each time I tried to guess, I was wrong. I loved the character development. There were so many characters in this novel and each character brought new attributes to &quot;the table&quot; which made the book even more interesting. Also I loved the plot development. There were so many subplots that all ended up tying into the main plot which made the book that much more interesting. Starting out as an honest sailor in Marseilles, he is framed for being a Bonapartist, and is sentenced to life in jail... With little hope for escape he is left to die in his cell, but when he meets Abbe Faria his luck just starts to turn around... With this in mind I would definitely encourage others to read this book!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Alexandre Dumas truly surpassed himself with the publication of The Count of Monte Cristo. The gripping beginning is full of mistrust and betrayal, as the main character Edmond Dates, is imprisoned as a result of his supposed friends. The story covers the turbulent years of his imprisonment, starting with depression and thoughts of suicide, followed by years of being educated and developed. After his phenomenal escape from prison, Dantes sets out on a journey to seek fortune and revenge himself. Years of tragic, surprising, and dynamic events follow, in which Dantes is exposed to old \\"friends\\" and even an ex-lover. The plot thickens as infidelity, bankruptcy, danger, and astonishment are incorporated into the scheme. The story ends the way it begins, full of love, and adoration.The Count of Monte Cristo is beautifully written, and truly a story that intrigues you the moment you pick it up. Its fast-paced plot line is full of revenge, love, and lying. The length, although extensive, is irrelevant, because the story that the many pages tells is revolutionary, and truly inspiring."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"You see all these reviews on this site of highschool kids says 'SOO BOORING' but these are obviously immature lazy students, who cant appreciate a great book. Im a freshman in highschool and this book was great! I didn't read it for school, i did on my own accord and loved it. Don't bother with the movie, it left so much out, and it isnt a quarter as good."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Not a bad translation, but AVOID AT ALL COSTSThis is an abridged version, and as such a waste and a slap in the face to the author's original vision.I'm doubly upset because I didnt notice this was abridged till I already bought it, and was already 200 pages into it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Occasionally departs from believability, but overall, an engaging, adventure packed story of a man (Edmond Dantes), his unjust imprisonment, and spectacular revenge."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book is amazing. Dumas's style has been criticised for its luxuriousness, but it has the great virtue that it always has the vision of something half-comprehensible behind the humdrum life. Some of his sentances are crafted with such mastery of language it is almost inconcievable. The beauty of this book is that, though we understand Edmonde Dantes, the Count of Monte Cristo is eternally a mystery. With every other character we get incites into thier mind, thier reactions, passions etc. For the Count, we get only the perceptions of others and thus never know the main character of one of the greatest books of all time."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I love this book! It's a great story about love, lust, money, and revenge. The first few chapters are a little dry, but after the main character is falsely accused of treason the pace picks up remarkably so stick it out. The plot keeps unfolding and there are a lot of little twists and hints. The ending might or might not surprise you, but suffice it to say Dumas is the one author that doesn't cop out and put everything in a neat little package tied up with a red bow. This ending is real. And if you haven't seen the movie yet, READ THE BOOK FIRST because you'll enjoy it more if you do."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"this book is awesome. Its a little complicated because of all of the characters and the past crimes they have commited but in the end the characters all tie together in weird twists of fate. You'll enjoy every one. The book is so different from the movie. Way better!! It goes into more detail and depth."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"A simple sailor, Edmond Dantes, becomes ship captain and wins the heart of one of Marseille's most beautiful women, eliciting jealousy amongst a shipmate (Danglars) and a friend (Fernand), who then use a loose connection between Dantes and the Bonapartists to have him arrested. After escaping, he transforms into the Count of Monte Cristo (with the help of an uncovered treasure), and infiltrates Parisian high society with the intention of ruining the men who unjustly imprisoned him fourteen years prior.An interesting story with a lot of drama, but the Count is a bit larger than life, richer than the wealthiest man in Paris, extravagant, and omnipresent in a really annoying way. Rather than retaining the modesty of the Marseille sailor he used to be, he turns into this perfect, almost deity figure who can do no wrong, cures the sick, solves everyone's problems,walks on water, etc...There are alot of detailed discussion about money in the novel, perhaps a sign of the times and the birth of capitalism. Money and politics are the tools used by the Count to get revenge.This novel is definitely better than the movie that came out last year (distorted Hollywood [junk]) but it was not as amazing as I'd expected. By the way, I read the full, unabridged edition, but this was the only edition I could write a review for."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This Penguin Classics version of what is in my opinion is the best book of all time.The translator even includes a chapter where Edmond returns to the Chateau de If to get a sign from God that what he was doing was just.Please if you have never read this book, buy this particular translation and, do not get the abridged. Why cheat yourself?This is such a wonderful story of love, and revenge."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Perhaps the only work in popularity to rival Alexandre Dumas' Three Musketeers is The Count of Monte Cristo. As with many of Dumas' works, the story has huge cast of characters and several underlying plot lines dealing with political upheaval and scandals in France during that era. I found that the The Man in the Iron Mask had so many side political story lines that it made the novel confusing and hard to follow. And then I got bored. However, The Count, has just the right amount and ties together very well at the end, which does not subscribe to the generic formulaic predictable plot. In fact, I would deem it the ultimate revenge story.There have been 11 films and 4 television series that have attempted to tell the tale of the wronged Edmund Dantes and his search for his fiance Mercedes and his pursuit of the man that wronged him. The most recent film was in 2002 starring Jim Caviezel and while casted well, paled in comparison to the novel in many ways and the liberal creative license taken with the story almost offending. The latter half of the film no longer resembled the masterpiece of the novel. Yes, most films pale to their written counterparts, but this one in particular deserved a Golden Razzie.The novel has a huge story to go with the cast of characters, but is pretty basic in that a man is wrongly accused and seeks to right the wrongs, along the way, losing those that he cared about, mounting his need for revenge even further. Edmund calculates and plans out the most exquisite plans and is not completely heartless or merciless. In fact, his compassion and loyalty are overriding themes throughout the novel. I guess you could say the richness of the Monte Cristo sandwich rivals that of it's namesake!The Count of Monte Cristo is not a novel to be missed.And if you really need the short version, The Simpsons did a 10min summary in the episode \\"Revenge is a Dish Best Served Three Times.\\""},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I am so pleased to see that the Count of Monte Cristo has moved up to about 2880 in Amazon's rating out of over 6 million books. It was about 280,000 3 years ago when I checked. Imagine, a book over 150 years old has again, like it did when he was alive, captured the world. Penguin was perspicacious in providing the first complete English translation of this inspirational classic written around 1840! I have read it 3 times and never tire of it.It is difficult to add anything of value to the fantastic comments already made on the site, as the book has over 5 out of 5 stars and I agree with every one of the reviewers. I am thrilled that this generation is reading the author that I personally consider the best author that ever lived. It goes to show that true art is immortal. One member of royalty, on their deathbed in the 1800s, said they read Dumas because he gave life in his works. I agree.The book, as well as his over 1000 works, is riveting, enthralling and full of plot twists and great characters.Alexandre Dumas was the ultimate wordsmith and studied, and studied, on his own, to master his craft, never getting his dues until recently, by the French government. They dug him up from his hometown of Villers Cotterets, France, and moved his body to the Pantheon, finally calling him a national treasure. I read his biography and he wanted to be buried in Villers Cotterets. The move was disheartening in that the town lost revenue from tourists. Also, you can find pictures of the Chateau he built on the web. The man's personal life is as fascinating as this book, but beware, there are many lies circulating about his father, a brigadier general in Napoleon's army, being born out of wedlock, as well as Dumas himself. Neither is true, according to his 5 volume autobiography.Current reviewers also love to emphasize the illegitimacy of his son, an author in his own right, named Alexandre Dumas, fils (Jr.), the father being pere. No child is illegitimate and the two were close. People were admitedly jealous of Dumas then and, in my opinion, today. The writing academy only recently admitted him and that was a goal he held when he was alive. Great men, superior men, as Dumas points out in his narrative about some of his characters, including Dantes, are generally hated. Dumas was one of those hated men.If you loved this book, I'd suggest going to cadytech and checking out his other works. In the Count of Monte Cristo, Dumas's ability to capture the emotional spectrum of the human heart, to portray a wide array of human interactions, his mastery of dialog, demonstration of the conflicts of man versus man and man versus himself, his ability to paint descriptive pictures and completely draw readers into well defined and thought out plots, his expertise in interjecting philosophical truisms as food for thought, to make you feel the experiences of the protagonist and construct a perfect story of revenge, indeed one of the best ever stories of revenge, in my opinion, all make this my favorite book of all time.Dumas loved Shakespeare and many other authors and if you are as interested in the life of this fascinating man, as I am, please don't forget to go to cadytech. It is maintained by one of the most prominent translators of Dumas's works from french. Also, for another good read by this author, check out the complete 3 musketeers musketeers series, comprised of 5 books: The 3 Musketeers, 20 Years After, 10 Years Later, The Count de Bragelonne, and finally The Man in the Iron Mask. Dumas actually wrote 1 book but it was later divided into the 5 mentioned above. I could go on and on but will stop now."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book was amazing. I first learned of the story watching the tv show \\"wishbone\\" as a child. Which opened my eyes to this great story teller Dumas. I am also ashamed to admit that I saw the movie before reading the book. =( If its not too late to warn you, dont watch the friggin movies! Does not do the book any justice whatsoever. They throw in a bunch of hollywood BS. sword fights are thrown out like candy to a bunch of school kids. And no matter how good the movie is, your cramming in 2 weeks worth of literature into a 2 hour clip. The penguin copy is the best Ive seen. The intro is very informative and the notes in the back are helpful. Dumas made tears swell up in my eyes 3 times. While i am not a macho man, I am pretty reserved in terms of cryin out but this book really hits a couple emotional buttons. Worth the read. Check it out."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Do you want to read an exciting book? Then the Count of Monte Cristo is the book for you. The Count of Monte Cristo is a very good book. It is a fiction adventure book about a man named Edmond Dantes who lived in Marseilles in the 1800s. In it Edmond is accused of being a Bonaparist and had to go to jail for fourteen years until he ecscapes and bec omes wealthy. He then set out for revenge. I like this book because it is very exciting and has lots of details that a lot of other authors would have kept out. I also like it because it is told in lots of points of view. Like one moment it is telling about Edmond and the other it is telling about Albert and Mercedes {characters in the book}. I recommend this book because it is very thrilling and ends in a wasy that makes you want to know what happens to all the characters in it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Edmond Dantes seems to have it all.

Now nothing can stand in his way between him and his goal......revenge.This book is great for people who like a good book."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"We bought this book for my son's required reading in school, but my husband and I also read it on his recommendation. Our son is only 14 and he loved the book, and he is NOT a big reader. Even though the book is over 500 pages, he couldn't put the book down, nor could we."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Apart from 'The Three Musketeers', this is probably Alexandre Dumas' most famous work and one of the greatest novels in Western literature: a novel every literate and educated person should read at least once in their lives.In this story, Edmond Dantes is an innocent man who was caught in the intrigues of Napoleon's escape from Elba and his 100 days of power until Waterloo. A sailor entrusted with a sealed letter of highest importance by his dying captain, Dantes delivers it into the hands of the evil prosecutor Villefort who, for reasons unkown to him, immediately sends him without trial or appeal to spend the rest of his days at the Chateau D'Iffe: a dark and isolated island prison presumed to be inescapable. With the help of Abbot Faria, a dying prisoner who knows the secret of a great hidden treasure on the small islet of Monte Cristo, Dantes escapes and prepares to unleash his revenge on those who did him wrong. For years he spends his time meticulously preparing his vengeful scheme against the treacherous friends and characters who left him to rot in prison for years and years. He refines his arts of disguise, alchemy, and manipulation to content himself with the ruin of his enemies.Unlike the adventure themes in his works such as 'The Three Musketeers', this story is a deep character study on being the victim of utmost injustice and how cruel revenge is sweet after all: how a wronged man is entitled to become the agent of divine retribution when God and mortal laws have abandoned his cause. The various themes, complex plot, profound character development, and rich prose makes this long work undoubtedly one of the greatest works of literature ever written: Dumas was without question a literary genius.This is a great story for people of all ages and should not be ignored by anyone who has a profound love of literature. I think this is Dumas greatest work far surpassing 'Queen Margo' 'The Three Musketeers' or 'The Corsican Brothers.'"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is honestly one of the greatest novels I have ever read. I absolutely loved this book. I could not put it down! This is a must read for anyone.When I first started into this novel, I had in my memory the 'movie' that was made for the big screen. So of course, I expected the book to be very similar to it. Well, I was very wrong! Other than Edmond Dantes being betrayed by his 'friends' and finding the treasure, this book takes on a different route.Believe me, the book is much more superb. The way the Count exacts his revenge is astonishing. I cannot fathom how Dumas came up with such a scheme. At times, one cringes for the those who wronged the Count.This book made me laugh and cry. There are many poignant moments throughout the book that make you feel good. Anyone who says that Dumas is not up there with the 'classic' writers, does not know what they are talking about. This book is rich in dialogue, mystery, suspense and storyline. All in all, this is an amazing classic, and I recommend it to anyone wanting a good read."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the most thrilling tales of betrayal, adventure and revenge that I have ever read. Edmond Dantes is betrayed by his best friend and imprisoned. After a daring escape, he turns himself into the wealthy Count of Monte Cristo. He soon puts his plans of revenge into action! This thriller will have you on the edge the whole time until the last ounce of revenge is exacted.

Simply, I wanted to read such a remarkable piece in its original version. This being done, I can assure you of two things when picking up Buss' translation. First, you are guranteed of a precisely accurate and tremendous translation. Secondly, you will be smitten with Dumas' work. Period."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Buss' translation is brilliant - spares no blushes. The \\"adult themes\\" are complete and unbowdlerized. This is not a children's book.[...] sells the audio book which is the Lorenzo Carcaterra translation, read by John Lee. It is some 48 hours long, unabridged. While listening to the sample, I followed the same passage in the Buss translation. The difference is staggering. Buss' translation is not only more readable, but would make a far more listenable audiobook. This translation should also be made available for the Kindle. I'd buy it a second time if it were in that format. The paperback (1070+ pages)is heavy and hard for me to hold up, and the font is too small for these old eyes. Nevertheless, it is an outstanding translation of a wonderful story. If you read any other, you will have been cheated.Buy this book!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Wow. What an amazing book. The plot was so well laid and a joy to uncover. I am truly glad that I took the time to read the unabridged version, which is quite daunting, but worth the length. A great book club read, as there are so many layers to discuss. A tragedy, a love story, an adventure all wrapped in a wickedly smart and conniving plot presented with beautiful prose. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"As human beings, we, for the most part believe in justice. When you strike me on one cheek, I should be allowed to strike you on the other, or at the very least sue you in court for the monetary damages your strike caused me. This sense of justice often transcends both culture and age. However, in many situations, justice does not occur. Evil men and women prosper at the expense of the good without consequence. Crimes and wrong doings go unpunished by the court of law. The question becomes should humans be allowed to take revenge for the crimes and evil committed against them when the legal system is too corrupt, lazy or ineffective to do anything about it. This question of vengeance is really the central question of Alexander Dumas classic novel, The Count of Monte Cristo, a thrilling tale of crime, escape and vengeance set in 19th century, post-Revolution France."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is one of the thickest books I've ever read, and it was worth every page. Don't be daunted by the size, the complete, unabridged Count of Monte Cristo is not just one of the best adventure stories ever written, but one of the best stories period. The simplicity of the story conceals everything the story has to say about life; the expectations, disappointments, despairs, hatreds, loves, joys and bittersweetness that everyone experiences. This book is timeless and unforgettable."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is far and away the best book I have ever read, and considering I read about a book a week, that is definitely saying something.I'm not going to give you another review of the storyline because there are probably a hundred others on here already so to do it again would seem quite pointless. What I want is to give people a couple of reasons why this book is so great. One of them is that the book is so well balanced and what I call an \\"everything book\\" because it has a great balance of everything in it: adventure, romance, mystery, humor, etc. There is really no one category you could put this book under which I think makes it even better.The other thing that makes this book so great (along with the great storyline) is the writing style of Dumas. First of all, he is never overly descriptive which is something that a lot of authors tend to do. He uses just the right amount of description on the scene and then lets the characters take over from there. Also, he has this wonderful way of always making the reader want to continue on to the next chapter. You just can't put the book down! Everything just seems to flow in such an effortless manner. Many nights I was up at two in the morning because I just couldn't put the book down.Do yourself a favor and read this book (unabridged penguin classics version, of course) and I can promise you that you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Wow. I am so glad to have bought this book. I cannot put it down! At first I must admit I was intimidated by its size as well as the period it was written. I find that many period books are really dense and difficult reads. Not this one at all!!! Easy to read and such a gripping tale! It draws you in and you do not want to put it down. I am so glad that I am reading the unabridged version because I cannot imagine it any other way. I am also so happy that it is so long because I do not want the story to end!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is a literary masterpiece. It has everything one could want in a book and more: adventure, fighting, planning, tales of riches, tales of suffering, tales of ultimate betrayal and revenge, and even a little love.This book may be long, but every single page is worth your time. It is written so perfectly and the story put together with such great design...an epic tale perfect for any reader."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I had never read Monte Cristo before and was at first reluctant to invest the time needed for this modern, unabridged version. I'm glad I did though, because it was a great story that moved along quickly in spite of its length. The freshly translated language helps, and because it's unabridged, it's satisfying to know that you're getting the full text that Dumas intended."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is a phrase that most people are familiar with; the broad outlines of his story have become a part of everyone's general understanding via cultural osmosis: Edmond Dantes, wrongly imprisoned by the contrivance of four men, escapes jail after decades, and, armed with essentially limitless money, plots his revenge. With this in mind, those revisiting the original novel have a general idea of what happens with the principal characters. While it would perhaps be optimal to begin reading with no preconceptions, the novel does not suffer for knowing the general outline. In particular, adaptations always end up significantly cutting the original story, which clocks in at nearly 1300 pages in this edition; so there are plenty of story points normally omitted for the reader to discover.An English professor once related that in the Renaissance genre of revenge tragedy, there were only a few that really examined the toll taken on the revenger (Kyd's \\"The Spanish Tragedy\\" and Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" being the notable ones), while most simply offered a black-and-white story of wronged men slaying the demons who haunt them. Alexander Dumas' story, which has become perhaps the archtypal revenge novel, also falls into the more complex category. It is perhaps telling that while the novel follows Edmond Dantes' perspective from the beginning to the point where he escapes from prison and finds the treasure that will finance his scheme, as soon as Dantes becomes The Count of Monte Cristo the perspective largely shifts to other characters; Dantes, a young and happy man, becomes something different and less human; the Count is almost automaton-like in his calculations and actions, though, as the story wears on, pricked by resurgent emotions. It is the conflict between his assumed roll as the wrath of God and his mere humanity that serves as the major conflict in the novel's climax.Dumas offers a panoply of other characters, generally well-drawn, and absurdly interconnected in the best traditions of the Victorian novel; particularly notable is the oblique sketch of a lesbian couple who ride off into the sunset, a risky inclusion for the time period (and generally sanitized from most versions of the story).This is by no means a quick read, but it is very much recommended for fans of classic literature."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"When I received The Count of Monte Cristo, unabridged, for my 16th birthday, I thought to myself, \\"Yeah right. This is over 1400 pages! I'll never get around to reading it!\\" Although an avid reader already, I was not prepared for this amazing work of art. My friend and I read it over the summer, and we both say it is the singular greatest book we have ever read! We agree that Alexandre Dumas must have been a genius to be able to think of such an intricate, fascinating plot. The characters are believable, moving me to tears at times and laughter at others. I recommended this book to all my friends and family, and to all people who love reading a good story as much as I do."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I have read 6 different translations of this book starting with a children's version when I was 6. I know, that doesn't count. But the 5 other ones were full versions. I know that such a thick book can be intimidating but it is worth while. Each turn of the page feels like unwrapping a new gift. By the time you get to the end you will miss it and wish that it was even longer. This is the best translation that I have read thus far. This book is for anyone that likes to treasure their time with their books and is not for impatient people who just want to know the plot."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is a great book full of betrayal and deceit. It may be long but it's definitely worth reading.Edmond Dantes was a sailor from Marseilles, poised to be married to Mercedes, a beautifl village girl. However, enemies of Dantes plan his arrest on the day that is planned for his wedding and he is condemnned to imprisonment on a desolate island in the dreaded Chateau D'If. Here, he meets the priest Faria who helps plan Dantes' escape and tells him of a treasure on the island of Monte Cristo. Edmond escapes the prison and goes to retreive the treasure and changes his identity. Now he is called the Count of Monte Cristo. He goes back to the mainland to retreive his love and seek revenge on his betrayers.I used a copy by signet classics, the editing was terrible and I found at least five typos; it was kind of distracting. I do highly recommend reading the book though!!!(only get a different version)"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Enough good things can't be said of this book. It is rightly considered Dumas' masterpiece. The story in a sentence is how a man named Dantes is falsely accused and imprisoned thanks to the machinations of his treacherous enemies, escapes jail, comes across a fortune and spends many a year spinning a sweet, sweet revenge on all.Of course the brilliance of the novel can't be described. It truly is great in its descriptions of the machinations and the motivations of the characters, as well as its insight into the human condition, second to few. Just because a book was published serially as popular fiction doesn't make it less worthwhile than the most pompous novel. The book explores the moral justification of Dantes in his revenge.This is a work where the hundreds of details come together (nothing being told for no reason) to pack a powerful punch. As such, no abridged version will ever do. It's long but it's a good read and worthwhile. A must."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is about a nineteen year old sailor named Edmond Dant&egrave;s, ion the post Napoleon era. Edmond is engaged to a beautiful Catalan woman and, after his captain died, became the captain of the Pharaon. His life seems to be very good and blessed, however, while his captain was sick, he stopped, under orders, on the Isle of Elba where he encountered Napoleon and received a letter from him. Once Edmond is found with the letter, he is imprisoned in the Chteau d'If, an island prison.I found this book to be very interesting and filled with excitement. It shows how a man, through faith in God, can prosper. I recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure, conspiracies, and classic books. This book has been around for a long time and is still flourishing."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I originally read this book for school but it turned out that I really enjoyed the book. This book allows you to take a look into the life of royalty and of peasants during the early eighteen hundreds. The action in this book took a while to start but when the action started it kept up throughout the novel. I saw the movie before I saw the book so I thought that the book would be the same as the movie. The book in fact is very different than the movie. There is fighting in the movie and the details of the story are different. This story filled with deception, but you know whom to trust. But Edmond does not seem to realize whom to trust. Edmond does horrible things to the people whom he has revenge for. Edmond only does this however to get back what he has lost and he still helps people along the way. Edmond plans out this revenge that he destroys the people he is out to get. He makes them into laughing stokes."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is THE book to read. No other book that I have ever read comes close to the excitement, passion and feeling that this book portrays. As I read it, I could feel the emotions Dantes felt... Dumas does a wonderful job of grabbing the reader and pulling him/her into the story, so that it is no longer just a story... but rather, it becomes reality."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I'm sure everyone is familiar with what the book is about so I won't tell you any of that. This book is a great read. Yes, it is 1000+ pages but it's difficult to put down and easy to get through. The Count of Monte Cristo is an interesting and mysterious character. Although the reader can easily see that Monte Cristo is Edmond Dantes, the author does not state this until near the end of the book, and even then continues to refer to him as Monte Cristo, as though Edmond is no more. This adds greatly to Monte Cristo's appeal, although you come to miss the sailor from Marseille when learning more about the bitter, vengeful count.I have to say, I wished the author would go deeper into Monte Cristo's mind, and show us his thoughts and actions when he was alone, rather than follow wherever there is action or dialogue. Although by no means am I critisizing, I couldn't possibly, being an amateur reader in the classics.I found that the beginning, during his imprisonment, and the end, as the story comes to a close, are the best and most moving parts of the book. It gets a little disturbing near the middle, with the executions and bandit stories and all! The moments when you see some of Edmond in the character of Monte Cristo are a delight. The story stirs your moral ideas, and you ask yourself as the story progresses whether the Count goes too far in seeking revenge. Other characters are equally interesting, such as Villefort, Maximilien, Danglars, Mercedes, The Viscount Albert and even Abbe Faria, who is a bit like the Bishop in Les Miserables. Don't hesitate to read the book because of its size, the pages fly by! And it's mostly action and dialogue anyway. I haven't seen any of the movie versions, but as is often the case, I'm sure they lack a lot of what the book can offer. Same goes for abridgements. So don't waste anymore time, read this book!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The real thing is about twice as long. I'd prefer that merchants and publishers would plainly label the abridged versions. As for the content, Dumas's &quot;Count of Monte Cristo&quot; is central to the development of modern western literature, a precursor to Mark Twain's &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; and a grand yarn in the league of Homer's &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Your grandparents read this story. Your grandchildren will read this story."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Unfortunately, the only copy of The Count of Monte Cristo I could find was the unabridged version in my school library. At the time I was glad I was reading the short version, 1,500 pages seemed a little too overwhelming at the time. But after reading the short version, I found myself wanting more. I could tell when they cut stuff out and it drove me crazy, I kept wondering what I was missing.I found myself wanting to read this book in the first place because I saw the commercials for the movie on t.v. (Which I know I'm not going to watch because they changed everything.) My mom told me it was a really good book so I checked it out. It took me a little bit to read because of school and chores. But once I picked it up I read 20 or 30 pages at a time. Sometimes more. Alexandre Dumas is a genius. His writing style is so unique. He draws a beautiful picture inside the readers head. All the characters in this book were multidimensional. I'm not used to seeing characters like that.At the beginning of the book Edmond Dantes was leading a happy, perfect life. He was engaged to the woman he loved, Mercedes. He was going to become a captain. And he had wonderful friends. But before he knows it his wonderful life becomes nothing but misery and pain. Two of his so-called friends, blackmails him and he's thrown into a dank prison for being a Bonapartist. Over the long harsh years ahead of him he plots his revenge on the people who sent him there. . .I'd love to tell you more, but there aren't enough words in the world to describe the impact this story had on me. I'll just give you a quick overview: This story is mostly about a man who gets revenge on those who made his happy life miserable. He slowly ruins their lives and they don't even realize it's him. No one recognizes him, except Mercedes, but she doesn't let him know for a long time. She becomes a very weak woman, who lives only for her son. But she still loves Edmond and I believe in some ways he still loves her. But he's a completely different person, then. He knows their time has passed.This book is very well written and has all the elements of a good story. Romance, adventure, revenge, mystery...And anything else you can think of. I'm going to have a hard time reading a book after this one. Other books will pale in comparison, I'm sure. Someday, I'll read the abridged version, but not today. . . Maybe when I'm older and have enough patience and time to read the whole thing. This story will stay with me forever, even if I never read it again."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I must say that I have read the abridged version of this book and it is nothing compared to the full version ($.99 mobi version of the book).This book is a wonderful read it flows much better in the unabridged version. Go for the gusto and read all 1600+ pages it is worth it.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Yesterday at 1:00 in the morning I finished The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas who also wrote The Three Musketeers, and I have to say \\"WOW\\". It is a book packed with themes such as betrayal, imprisonment, revenge, romance, history, drama, mercy, and ultimately forgiveness. It is a novel about a man named Edmond Dantes who has a good life up until people he thought were his friends betray him and end up taking away everything he holds dear to him: His wife to be (Mercedes) is stripped from him on his arrest for false conviction for being an agent of Napolean, this causing his father to die of grief and hunger. With the help of Abbe Faria, a former prisoner, teaches Dantes the ways of the world. He escapes one faithful night from the prison known as the Chateau D'If, finds the island of Monte Cristo with the treasure Faria spoke of and tracks down and punishes those who have wronged him under the avenging angel persona: \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\". After reading the full Unabridged novel I could see why people loved the book so much for it's rich detail and lush writing in politics and French history to undertone the great revenge of Edmond Dantes. The way in which Dantes carries out his vengeance is cold and swift; whatever they did to make him suffer he launches twice back at them. Dantes also finds romance from the girl Haydee who is the long lost princess of the Pacha Ali Tebelen of whom he rescued from a sultan after her parents' deaths. It was nice to see the count get a beautiful girl and find happiness again for the very reason his Mercedes was stolen from him by his enemy, Fernand Mondego. I don't want to ruin it for you so just go and read the darn book. If you are interested in reading the unabridged version (Which I recommend you do and not some stupid abridged edition) get the Modern Library hardcover like I did. It is a 1,462 page book and the longest novel I've ever read in my life, but it moves along at a fast, steady pace. Thats all I can say is if Alexandre Dumas was able to construct this huge genius book with great characters and a great plot all back in 1844, he must certainly have been ahead of his time along with his book. A beautiful piece of literary art and probably the only classic I've been able to read all the way through.

I wonder how the abridged version might have read? I guess I didn't feel rewarded for reading 1500 pages where the abridged versions are less than half the length.Anyhow, I found the plot a bit too convenient. Everything from the treasure to the intricate tangled web of the people involved in the central plot.In the first part of the book, I felt the emotion of Dantes. But towards the middle of the book, I became completely disconnected. It all came down to character development, but I lost my emotional connection to Dantes.The book is a marvelous read to discover the upper-class world of France in the 1800s.

It is an extraordinary account of a man's life which is full of intrigue and deception. With the great fortune of attaining a promotion as the new captain of the Pharaon and the hand of his beautiful fianc&eacute; who will soon stand at the altar with him, Edmond Dant&egrave;s could not have been a happier man. Yet, behind his back and in the shadows jealous eyes watch him and plot his downfall. On the night of his much awaited betrothal feast, Edmond is arrested and accused of being an aid to Bonaparte. Not long after an interrogation, he is condemned to life in prison at the Chteau d'lf. Unfortunate souls sent here are never heard or seen again. Death is the only way out of this dark place. Many of Edmond's precious years are spent alone, forgotten, and in despair and wretchedness. When all seems lost, he has an unusual encounter with another prisoner, Abb&eacute; Faria. A strong friendship forms as they plan their elaborate and final escape. But only days before their escape, Abb&eacute; Faria falls ill and cannot make the journey. On his deathbed, Abb&eacute; Faria gives his beloved friend the whereabouts of a forgotten treasure. With the life of his friend fading, he must make the most important choice of his life. Spurred by the hope restored to him by his friend and by the vengeance that has grown and festered in his heart throughout the long years spent behind bars, Edmond attempts his final escape. Whether it be death or great riches that lie outside his four prison walls, he is determined to play his part as the avenging angel. Those who have ruined his life will pay, and those who were undeserving of their fate will be avenged. He will have what is rightfully his, what he deserves...or...so he plans.This is one of Dumas's greatest novels. It will draw the reader into its story within the first few pages. It is a book that is hard to put down or walk away from. If you enjoy tales full of unexpected twists and turns, you will love this one. Yet, as a warning, it is a book that you cannot just breeze through. It takes your full attention to catch all the details. I highly recommend it to anyone who is willing to take the time.

Of course, this made me look a little strange when I showed up at work.When taking on a book of this size that is this good (and therein lies the catch), it becomes a part of your life. Some of the characters will remind you of people you know and bring them more to life, but already Dumas' characters are so lifelike and incredibly, amazingly real, and that with each chapter you have spent that much more time with them, learning something new about them (up to the very last chapter!), the story literally becomes a memory that you will be fond of looking back on.It is interesting to note that this translation is from an anonymous person. I had several issues with the translation unfortunately. I feel it was completed by at least two people, and I believe one can tell (in the first half of the book) because the chapters are clumped together in specific styles. It probably won't affect many readers, but I noticed it and thought I should point it out. This edition, unfortunately, has typos! Beware, that though they are sparse, they are blatant. This saddens me when I see a beautiful edition slighted by the hands of lazy-eyed editors. (I expect no less for modern authors!)I have waited years to read this.

It was only after I was reading through it when I noticed stuff different from my penguin soft back version did I flip to the front to discover the book was abridged.Who ever edited this book had to have been stupid because they did a horrible job of editing. I could understand cutting material which isn't critical to the story. Examples from the unabridged version included 'How to rescue a gardener from dormice who are eating his peaches' and 'the road for Belgium.' However to deliberately omit major portions which are critical to the whole of the story is wrong and causes the whole story to be misrepresented.Major portions which were omitted included the the final judgment of Danglars at the hands of Vampa, and also the story of Andrea Cavalcanti and how he ties to both Villefort and Danglars. Even the comic book version of the story I read as a kid managed to included all of these.This abridged version of this book isnt worth the paper it is written on.

A proper COUNT audio book should be in the neighborhood of 30 CDs...this one is only 14, although this information is concealed in the product description. The picture shown is not accurate. BEWARE!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This massive book has all the hallmarks of what you would expect in a classic: intriguing characters with great psychological depth as they evolve over a long period of time, an extraordinarily intricate plot of adventure and tranformation, and moral lessons along with rich ironies. So long as you embrace the complexity and can live in another world, the full version is utterly rivetting to read.Everyone knows the plot in outline. A gifted and yet simple sailor, Dantes, is the victim of a conspiracy involving thwarted love, greed, and unbridled ambition. By eliminating him, three men get what they want and move brilliantly into the rapidly changing and corrupt French society. They forget Dantes, who is isolated in despair in a notorious political dungeon, the Chateau d'If. While in prison, he meets an Italian savant who tunnels into his room and who teaches him the entire pantheon of classical knowledge, which he memorised as a tutor to princes; he also harbors a secret about an immense treasure on the island of Monte Cristo. Dantes escapes, finds the treasaure, and sets about creating an elaborate series of traps to wreak vengence on the three men who condemned him. This occurs in about the 1st 250 pages of the book. At this point, after doing some good for a family that had tried to help him, Dantes' interior dialogue - so vivid as he figures out who betrayed him and learns to hate them while learning the love the Italian savant as a 2nd father - becomes silent to the reader. What Dantes then does is insinuate himelf into French high society, creating relationships with the 3 men and their families with a cunning that can only be called genius. This takes place over about 700 pages and is an indictment of the society that Dumas despised. Though the Count is falling in love, his hatred is so implacable and cold as to render him an automaton of vengence. Then, in the last 3rd of the book as the train of destruction he created is set in motion, Dantes is again reborn as a man who can feel and reflect on what he has done. It is a moving apotheosis of redemption and regret.What is so amazing about the story is that, as outlandish as some of the plot twists and coincidences are, the reader is (or at least I was) swept into a fast-moving narrative that is irresistably readable. In doing so, Dumas helped to spawn an entirely new genre of novel: the psychological thriller, or adventure that provokes reflection and awe. Its depth is beyond a simple swashbuckler. Its world is complete in sumptuous and realistic detail while remaining too fantastic to believe. Its characters are so complex and yet such romantic ideals as they evolve. Moreover, there are also a number of symbols throughout the book, evoking Christian and pagan themes, so that the book can be interpreted on a number of levels.This is one of the best novels I ever read and certainly Dumas' best. Though it took me an entire summer to get through it, I will never forget it. For those of you who read French, Dumas' language is stunningly clear and graceful, while using a vocabulary that is easily accessible. Highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is the best book I've read in quite a long while. I wasn't expecting it to be. Frankly, I tend to have low expectations for 19th-century European novels in regard to sheer readability. Like vegetables and trips to the dentist, they tend to be more good for you than simply good. Add in the fact that the unabridged version is over 1000 pages, and I felt sure that the Count would be a somewhat difficult companion.Nothing could be farther from the truth! Edmond Dantes' adventures kept me fully engrossed from beginning to end. I was disappointed to turn the final page, left longing for more.If you've seen a movie version of Count of Monte Cristo, expect surprises. I had seen both the Richard Chamberlain and Jim Caviezel versions before reading the book (mmmm . . . Jim Caviezel), but neither were entirely true to the storyline or the mood of the original.Edmond himself is a thoroughly satisfying and seductive hero. (The reader must take with a grain of salt the numerous references to his drug habit; at the time, opium was unfortunatly de rigeur for a Romantic hero.) The secondary characters are equally engrossing, from the admirable Maximilian Morrel to the villainous Danglars; and the ingenious machinations by which Edmond contrives to reward the deserving and doom the guilty make the chapters fly by.I would encourage everyone to be sure and get the unabridged version of this masterpiece. It is by no means slow or ponderous, and the thought of what must be left on the cutting room floor to reduce this book to half its size makes me wince."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This masterpiece is a story of triumph, love, jealousy, wisdom, mystery, revenge, suspence, travel, secrets, longing, all the things that make up life.

Every scene is developed with great eloquence and artistry. This story is simply brilliant.Stories like this put writing to shame. It makes me wonder, is it even possible to write a great novel anymore? (not that writing is some big competition or something). There is nothing about this book that could have been better. It is as close to perfection as you could get. The writers intimate knowledge of paris, life, and people is unparalleled. If you want to be a writer or simply want to see the artwork of writing at the height of it's powers, here it is. This has the power of a mozart symphony or a charle parker solo. I thought les miserables was great and that it couldn't get any better. It just did!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"WARNING: For people who want to read a 1100 page The Count of Monte Cristo translated by Robin Buss on Kindle, it is NOT the one. Buss's version is not available on Kindle!! :("},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"In these troubled times, we are facing a crisis that is not mentioned very much. We have grown teenagers who don't like to read and cannot pronounce the simplest words. If they do read, it's the latest Wal-Mart fad novel that will not be remembered in 100 years. As for the classics, they are shunned upon as being too complex and too long to read.At least I still got the reading mojo people lacked. This is probaly the greatest book I've read in awhile. Even though it was written over 160 years ago, it's still hard to beat.The basic outline of the plot is simple. It takes place in France, and even though it is written in English, many French elements remain. Edmund Dantes has it all. He's a well respected sailor who has a beautiful bride-to-be named Mercedes. But unknown to him, a man named Fernand, (who is also Mercedes' cousin 0_0) wants her as well. So with the help of a man name Danglers, he sends a letter accusing Dantes of being a traitor, and the prosecutor Villefort sends him without trial to the Chteau d'If, an island prison, which is a real place, by the way. There he spends fourteen years of his life, the only company he has is a secret communication with the supposedly mad Abbe Faria, who helps him figure out who the framers were. When he dies, Dantes replaces his body with his own and he is thrown off to sea, where he manges to recover and heads to the island of Monte Cristo, where Faria said there was a treasure at. After becoming rich, he plans his unique revenge against his accusers, under the alias of the Count of Monte Cristo.But it's more than a tale of revenge. The novel is filled with many characters who have their own agendas, as well as some extraordinary writing and many twists in the story. It's actually kind of sad that this book doesn't get as much respect as it deserves. While you may be turned off by its length (don't get the abridged version, or God forbid the Great Illustrated Classics version, AKA 'Literature for Dummies') and its archaic language, but anyone who actually knows how to read should understand this book.So yeah, the next time you're at the library or the bookstore, perhaps you should skip Breaking Dawn and read something good, like this."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Without a doubt, this is the best work of fiction I have read in a long time. The depth and detail is just stunning. People don't write like this anymore. I'm only about halfway through this (it's over 1,300 pages), but I haven't tired of it at all. This is really a character study on the nature of man at its core. The author's observations in this respect are sprinkled throughout the story and are both deep and humorous at times. Truly a classic work of literature. This unabridged translation is very well done, and maintains a \\"classic\\" feel - slightly challenging and not at all dumbed down in the language. I would recommend it to any mature adult. However, it is not for children or adolescents, due to the wide ranging and at times harsh situations."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Le Comte de Monte-Cristo, or The Count of Monte Cristo, has often been refered to as the greates adventure novel of all time. The novel begins with a great betrayal of the lead--Edmond Dante, the count of Monte Cristo, etc -- by four associates--Fernand, Caderousse, Villefort and Danglars--which results in a lengthy imprisonment for Dante in the dreaded Castle d'If. During this imprisonment, Dante becomes highly educated under the tutelage of a fellow prisoner, Abbe Faria, and undergoes a spritual awaking; Dante henceforth wishes \\"...to be Providence myself, for I feel that the most beautiful, noblest, most sublime thing in the world, is to recompense and punish.'\\"What follows is a daring escape, the discovery of great treasure and an elaborate plan, taking place over more than a decade, to bring all to justice. There are approximately 45 different characters (of which 5 or 6 are aliases of the lead), and a complex, interwoven relationship among them. (I suggest creating a 'character map' as you go along to keep things straight.) Additionally, and unlike 'modern' novels, there is purpose in each carefully crafted scene; each element serving to drive the plot forward to the unforgettable climax. This is undoubtly a classic that is as relevant and exciting today as it was 170 years ago. Highly recomended."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I have read The Count of Monte Cristo a few times. The Unabridged Oxford Edition is the best. The explanatory notes are a great bonus as they deepen the experience of reading this Masterpiece. The introduction gives us very interesting supplementary information that allows for a greater appreciation of the story as well as for Alexander Dumas himself. This is a book everyone should read at least once in their lifetime, and I highly recommend reading the actual book, not Kindle. This is a book that you will develop a relationship to and it becomes your friend. There's something very nostalgic and comforting about holding a real book in your hands. I may be very old fashioned, but sometimes books don't feel right when electronics are involved. I love the cover of this edition as well (revised edition 2008) . I feel that it captures the essence of Edmund Dantes: A young, beautiful man with sadness and revenge in his eyes. The painting (Leon Cogniet's self portrait) evokes an ability to penetrate the Soul of Dantes, the greatest protagonist of all time. It may sound a bit silly, but reading this book makes me pause. And when I pause, I find myself studying this image while contemplating life. Life as I experience it through this incredibly complex adventure called The Count of Monte Cristo. The story is epic!! As the back page states: 'A novel of enormous tension and excitement'. I buy this particular copy in bulk and gift it to anyone I meet who is even just slightly interested in reading it. Most people, myself included, are absorbed within minutes of reading this book and we all finish it. As a good friend said to me while she was reading 'The Count': \\"You know when you are reading a great piece of literature; Classics are Classics for a Reason."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"When asked if he feared death, Alexandre Dumas' replied, \\"I will tell Death a story and she will be kind to me.\\" After reading this book, I believe him. This is a very intricate story with a wonderful variety of characters. My paper copy of the book actually has a list of characters and historical events to help the first-time reader keep track of what's going on throughout the story, so it is an involved read the first time around. However, the story is so wonderfully worth the effort that I have since re-read it at least five times. This book is the epitome of timeless classic to me."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Engrossing, captivating, heart-wrenching, thought provoking..... I, too, could not put this book down! It may not be verbatim but I can not imagine that it could be any more wonderful than it is. I read a variety of books and re-read the good ones on occasion. I will definitely re-read this book and encourage all of my children to do the same. I think having it on a kindle will help so they do not know how many pages it is and get discouraged. Warning! It had me so enthralled that I burned a few meals while I was reading."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"It took me 3 months to read this. I read it consistently. There was literally never a dull moment. I must make the bold statement of claiming it The Greatest Book I Have EVER Read!!! I am now going to buy the actual book, the B & N Leather Bound Classic just to display proudly."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is riveting, thrilling, and fantastic! BUT for those of you who like me have seen movies and animation \\"loosely\\" based on the book. Two elements in adaptations: the union of Edmond & Mercedes, and Edmond's transformation from cold-hearted avenger to human being again, are limited to the adaptations!!*SPOILER ALERT*The original story (English version anyway) is a lot more complicated. Edmond or Monte cristo, as the story progresses, is cold, cruel, and blind with revenge as he drives one enemy to the madhouse and the other to commit suicide, and yet another he allows to be beated to death. By the time he realizes he has gone too far and starts to feel remorse, the horrifying damage is done. Edmond never truly forgives the men who framed him or his betrothed (Mercedes) for not waiting for him. However, he does realize he can't play God and is not the hand of providence. He knows he must atone.As for Edmond and Mercedes, they DONOT reconcile and reunite, instead he hangs her out to dry and sails off with some Greek princess, Haydee, who is at least 20 years his junior in the last chapter of the book. Haydee who is a supporting character at best is so ineffectual and child-like, its actually annoying. It's hard to feel sympathy for her sad story while she acts pompous and dim witted. Her main purpose in the story is as a plot device (the revenge on Fernand), she is otherwise a shadow character whose affection towards the count is parasitic, she herself appears so indulgent and kind of a moocher. The count's choice of her as a mate killed the ending for me. Granted, the count is pathetic and all alone in the world at this point, and will take whatever he can get.The orginal story destroyed my cherished idea/memory of \\"The Count of Monte Cristo.\\" It was heart breaking! Daggers and thunderbolts :("},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time. Since the download was free, I decided to give it a shot. I was very pleased with this Kindle version. It's been a long time since I've read the book, but it doesn't seem to me that there is much, if anything, missing from this version.If this is your first time reading this story, don't be put off by other reviewers who claim that it is too wordy or easy to get lost. It really isn't. And if you've only seen the movie (unless it was the Richard Chamberlain version, which in my opinion is the only good adaptation)be prepared for the ending to be different.Overall a really great, must-read book!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Just got the book today and will be looking forward to reading it.

I read the summary for The Count of Monte Cristo and knew there was a movie version so I figured, why not? It has to be good if hollywood wanted to make a movie out of it. It has this reputation of being a very long book, but with the kindle you can't really tell and because I had a hard time putting it down, it didn't seem long at all. The story is fantastic! A man goes to prison, finds treasure and spends years....YEARS plotting the perfect revenge. Unlike other trite revenge stories of people going out and trying to murder whoever wronged them, Edmond Dantes just tries to make everyone's life miserable without actually appearing to be the cause of it. It's just very clever! You empathize with him and understand how he became the way he is. I liked almost everything about the book except his love story with Haidee because he treated her like she was his daughter and then realized he loved her....gross. Anyway, yes i guess it is a long book but definitely worth the read! It has become one of my favorite books...definitely in the top three! I wish I knew French so I could read the actual version."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"From the moment I picked up this book it has not left my eyes. I cannot put this book down.

Buss' translation is the best by far."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Having just bought a Kindle, I decided to read some of the classics, since I can get them for free thanks to Kindle. I saw the Count of Monte Cristo movie some time ago and decided to give this a shot. The beginning middle and end of the book are fabulous. I had to push through at about 70% through the book though. I even watched the movie after reading this. The author does a great job detailing the agony of the Count's revenge, where in the movie its one nice little trap set that does not really show how the Count made the others suffer. It was a great read, and had me thinking in old English all week."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is one of the greatest tales of revenge of all time. We owe to Dumas's skillful hand a narrative rivaling WAR AND PEACE, a vast collection of characters and tales within tales, all finally ancohered together upon the dreadful downfall of Edmond Dantes and his in some ways equally dreadful rebirth as that mysterious agent of justice, the Count of Monte Cristo. It is a fascinating story, providing thrills -- but not at the expense of shallowness -- and provoking thought -- but without affectation.My only piece of advice to the reader is to take a few notes on the characters, since they disappear and reappear, and sometimes are referred to by different names and titles. However, for what it is worth, I was able to follow the story closely enough to thoroughly enjoy it even without notes, and despite occasionally being forced to set the book down for a few weeks between chapters.Because of the size of the book, the Modern Library Classics edition is especially useful, having comparatively large and legible print, decent spacing between lines, and, most importantly, a flexible spine which allows it to be set open on a table without creasing or cracking."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"i love this book! it is one of my favorite classics, and i higly reccomend it to everyone. however, DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION!!! i borrowed this book from the library, only it was a much older edition, in hardcover, and much longer. i loved it. i bought this edition because i wanted to read it again and again, and i thought that it would be nice to have a paperback that was shorter, so it wouldn't be so bulky. i got three chapters into this edition and realized that it was abridged, despite not mentioning the fact anywhere. not only was it abridged (not to mention not telling me of that) but it left out complete parts, parts that were important to the story, including when fernand and danglars write the note accusing dantes, danglars trying to make caderousse too drunk to remember, and renee asking de villefort to be merciful to the prisonr. i don't know what else they've left out, seeing as how i didn't finish beyond the seventh chapter. also, the chapters are only two to four pages in this edition, while in the real book they are much longer. i would strongly like to deter anyone from buying this edition. it is a waste of time and money. buy the real thing."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The introduction to this excellent Modern Library edition says, &quot;The long journey of Edmond Dantes is one that we should all take at some point in our lives.&quot; I couldn't agree more. This novel easily ranks among the greatest epics--The Odyssey, Don Quixote, Les Miserables, War &amp; Peace and The Brothers Karamazov come to mind as works of comparable scope and moral grandeur.My only advice is: set aside some time. With 1500 pages, a complex web of characters (including many with shifting identities) and more than a few dispensible subplots, this unabridged edition is a challenge--albeit a rewarding one.The novel tackles all the great themes: war, revolution, love, power, money, justice, evil, God. But in a word, it's subject is REVENGE. A good-natured young man of exceptional promise, Edmond Dantes is betrayed by his erstwhile friends, unjustly imprisoned by an ambitious magistrate, and left for dead by the woman he loves. The first three hundred pages of the story are fast-paced and almost cinematic, from the wrenching scenes of betrayal and imprisonment, down to Dantes' miraculous escape and rebirth as a remarkable new man, the Count of Monte Cristo.The Count is part 007, part Stoic philosopher. He'll drop you in a duel, match wits with you in the salon, concoct potions from recipes in a dozen languages, be in three places at once, with three different identities, and exercise a kind of foresight and control over human events that we normally associate with gods and conspiracy theories. Oh yeah--and he's loaded, too.Dantes burns with a desire for revenge, but it's an entirely different sort than the Clint Eastwood/Charles Bronson variety. Instead of blasting his way into Paris with a semi-automatic (or less anachronistically, with a really big sword), Dantes methodically plots the downfall of his enemies using even more lethal weapons: the evil that lurks in their own hearts.All this takes a long time. There is a big drop off in intensity in the middle chunk of the novel, as Dumas transitions from the swashbuckling Napoleonic days to a more traditional European novel of manners set in the 1830s. A whole new set of characters are introduced. Later, we discover their relationship to Dantes' earlier antagonists--but for a time we are totally at sea. Meanwhile, Dumas launches various digressions that will occasionally cause the reader to wonder whether he was getting paid by the word (probably).But don't despair. The last half of the novel gathers steam like a freight train, as Count of Monte Cristo moves in for the kill. The suspense builds--not because we wonder whether Dantes will get his revenge, but whether he can avoid turning into a monster in the process.Ultimately, Dumas offers as sane and humane a message as you can hope for from 1500 pages of injustice and vengeance. In a novel where fortunes shift, names and titles are granted and extinguished, and identities are transformed on turns of luck, the old Stoic wisdom shines through. It's not what happens to you, good or bad, but how you respond to it, that determines true virtue in this world. One suspects this would be true even without an avenging Providence, even if Edmond Dantes' triumph were less complete."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The single star refers to this version, not the book itself. Do not read this version if you want the complete version of the Count of Monte Cristo. Other reviewers have noted that this is an abridged version, but it is much worse than that, this is a 19th century English Bowdlerized version. Still worse is the fact that the publisher does not disclose this fact, which I consider to be quite deceptive. Significant subplots have been eliminated so as not to have to contend with what the Bowdlerizer considered unpleasant story elements such as: murder (two of them are eliminated in this version), an affair between two main characters leading to the illegitimate birth of a third character, the attempted infanticide of that third character and a lesbian relationship. Important characters become merely ciphers, and main characters just fade away because the chapters describing their fate have been eliminated. While important chapters are eliminated, the flowery 19th century prose (or at least the English translation of this language) is retained. Thus, this version is over 600 pages long. In contrast, the Lowell Bair translation and abridgement (published by Bantam) is about 200 pages shorter. However, the Bair version is more complete in terms of story elements and is a version that I recommend.This book contains some enrichment in term of additions of some historical background, information about the life and work of Dumas, chapter notes and interpretive notes. In my opinion, however, these enrichments in no way compensate for the trashing of Dumas' story. Also, beware if you read this version for school, you will suffer the double handicap of not getting the complete story while still having to wade through over 600 pages of 19th century prose. Read the whole thing, or at least an abridgement that uses a more modern prose style, while still retaining the whole story. Beware, however, the complete book is about twice as long as this version and many times the size of the Bair abridgement."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I picked up the book because I found the movie very entertaining and thought it'd be nice to read the classic novel. I bought this edition and was halfway through it before I found out it was abridged. It does not say so anywhere on the book and I frankly don't know how that is allowed. As soon as I found out I went and got the complete version of the book and started all over. It astounds me how much they cut out. They pretty much butchered the story. Please read the book because is fabulous, but not this version."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Parisian bon vivant, drinker, womanizer and genius Alexandre Dumas has, in \\"The Count of Montecristo\\", given the world one of the greatest stories ever told.It is a marvel of literary invention. Its literary scope and scale and historical sweep is nothing short of revolutionary, and for all of its grandeur and jaw-dropping perspective, it is unfailingly intimate, brutally so.\\"The Count of Montecristo\\" is the story of young Edmond Dantes, a French sailor aboard the merchant-vessel Pharaon in 1815, who returns to the port of Marseilles with the glorious Catalan girl Mercedes waiting to be his bride, and with a promising future as the captain of the merchantman ahead of him.Or so he thinks: for there is no poison so bitter, so brutal, or so deadly as envy. And as Old Scratch slithered forth as a serpent to poison even earthly paradise, so too Dantes is stalked by an envious trio of the sort that put Caesar in an early grave: the bitter and calculating Danglars, supercargo of the Pharaon; Danglars's drinking buddy Caderousse; and Mercedes's cousin Fernand, hopelessly in love with his cousin and aghast at her impending marriage to Dantes.It is 1815; a time of shaky stability for France and Europe. The Ogre of Corsica has just been put down, exiled to Elba---but Bonapartist clubs assassinate Royalist generals in the capital, and the alleys of Marseilles are rife with whispers of Napoleon's return.It is into this poisonous, heated, feverish atmosphere that this trio of serpents work their vindictive magic, and with the flick of a plume the happy Dantes, on the very day of his wedding and at his nuptial feast, finds himself surrounded by soldiers, held at bayonet point, and hauled before the implacable gaze of Justice. And fatality!---Justice consigns him to the wretched dungeons of the Chateau D'If, a heartless, impregnable rock off the coast of France---for the rest of his life.To say anything more would be to give far too much away, but know this: \\"The Count of Montecristo\\" is both black book of revenge and horror tale: a consumptively engaging story of double Betrayal, Death, and Despair: a Man consigned to death and rot by his supposed friends and colleagues, buried beneath the Earth in a great black tomb, forgotten by his best beloved, lost to everything, left for the teeth of rat and Time.And it is also a tale of Resurrection---and Revenge.You'll want to get a copy of the unabridged version; Random House's The Modern Library edition (published in 1996) is a fine choice, and just so you can check (be warned: the shelves are full of sliced and diced pretenders) the unexpurgated version clocks in at a hefty 1462 pages. That means once you're through with it, you can use it to forestall a burglary or brain an assassin.Never have 1500 pages moved so swiftly and deftly. A rumor, bandied around the streets of Paris in Dumas's day which resurfaced in Perez y Reverte's mesmerizing \\"Club Dumas\\", is that the jolly-faced Dumas signed a blood-contract with Satan, and in return for his soul he was given a diabolic gift to be prolific.Diabolic or Angelic, there is no doubt that Dumas is pure genius: you marvel at the simultaneous breadth and depth and intimacy of \\"Count of Montecristo\\". There is no padding here; not one sentence is superfluous and every word tells. A paragraph sliced away here, a sentence taken out there, and the perfect, brutal, logical, coldly calculating structure would fall apart.In the meantime, the reader is introduced to some of the most fascinating and memorable characters in history: the tragic, beautiful Mercedes; her dandyish son Albert; her husband, the stiff and martial Count Fernand de Mortcerf. We see, in his middle age, the ever-calculating banker Danglars and his miserable family, including the boyish, driven, devious and ultimately foolish Eugenie; the Prosecutor of the King, Villefort, and his fascinating family: the hopelessly innocent Valentine, the paralyzed, rabid old Jacobin M. de Noirtier, and the Prosector's young---and tragically greedy---trophy wife.Beyond these characters, \\"Count of Montecristo\\" gives us even more, taking us deep into the lives of France's Rich & Famous---and villainous! We come face to face with the Old Ogre of Corsica himself, Napoleon Bonaparte. We pass the time in Latin and philosophy with the foppish, foolish, overly confident King Louis XVIII, who would rather count the angels on the head of a pin than martial his troops against the lively spectre of Bonapartism.And I have but scratched the surface: this story is the very essence, the pure, undiluted blood, of swashbuckling fantasy. Here we have pirates and Roman brigands, the famous Italian banditti Luigi Vampa, stories within stories within stories, buried treasure on a deserted volcanic island rising up over the waves of the Tyrrhennian sea. We have mad monks, and midnight assignations, and foundlings and changelings and villainous [...] sons appearing out of the blue. We have plots, and poisonings, and murder, and villainy, and great heroism; we have connections to the marvellous, tragic downfall of the great Abyssinian hero Ali Pasha.In short, we have a marvellous witch's brew of high treason and infamy, a Devil's Codex of revenge, retribution, and absolution. My flimsy prose is not worthy to provide adequate praise to this masterpiece: get a copy, close the curtains, have a bottle of your finest chianti at the ready, smoke some Montecristo cigars if you're a smoker (you should know that these, the finest the Dominican Republic offers, were inspired by this tale), turn off all the phones in the house---and transport yourself to a tale of betrayal, death, resurrection, villainy and revenge---served Piping Cold."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Unfortunately when I ordered this edition, it was not shown that this is only the abridged version.

The only reason that no one, excepting Mercedes, figures out who Edmond Dantes, the Count of Monte Cristo, Sinbad the Sailor, Abbe Busoni and Lord Wilmore are is because of the way the Count represents himself and 'others.'I think the real question that The Count of Monte Cristo is asking us today is why we have forgotten the things that were so key to the way people lived back then. Maybe we have gained in science and math, but we have lost so much! Thinking of the forgotten things is the real painfulness of this book. This one is at the very top of my list.

Edmond Dantes is a respected sailor who was going to marry a girl named Mercedes. Edmond was going to be the captain of his own ship and make a living. He lived in France in 1825 with his father. He is falsely accused of being a Bonapartist (a friend of Napoleon's) on the day of his wedding. Two men planned this accusation and they both benefited from his disappearance. Edmond was sent to a horrible prison and after a month an old man tunnels into his cell. The old man becomes Edmond's teacher in language, manners, and math. He also tells him the names of his two enemies, Danglars and Fernand. Edmond is filled with the power of vengeance and vows to avenge himself. Together, they plan their escape but the old man is hit by a disease. Before the old man dies, he gives Edmond a treasure map. Edmond uses quick thinking to devise a plan to escape and retrieve the treasure. Edmond gets out of jail and recovers the treasure making himself rich. He starts to do good deeds for others and changes his name to the Count of Monte Christo. The Count (Edmond) begins to slowly avenge himself while he helps out \\"Edmond Dantes'\\" loyal friends even though it is Edmond who is really helping them.My favorite quotes are \\"I have instilled in your heart vengeance\\" and \\"For the last four nights I have been watching over you.\\" These quotes show the two main meanings of this book, which are Edmond getting vengeance and Edmond helping his friends. The Count of Monte Christo is a fiction/adventure book that tells Edmond Dantes life story and his adventures. Alexandre Dumas creates great pictures in my mind with his fabulous details. He made the characters consistently sound the same in their dialogue. He used wonderful language and added a little bit of humor in some parts. I was amazed how he mixed English and French together.I would recommend this book to fourteen or fifteen year olds because it is hard to comprehend and the language is old fashioned. I think that it would be hard for younger children to keep track of all the characters. The Count of Monte Christo is unlike any other book that I have read. It is the only book that has had me guessing all the way through. I would infer something and then I was completely wrong, which makes the book exciting. I would compare the Count of Monte Christo to the Lord of the Rings because they are both great adventures. They are extremely well written books and I like them both. Another book series that I compare The Count of Monte Christo to is the Clive Cussler, Dirk Pitt series because in both of the books there are great schemes. In the books, written by Clive Cussler, the people who make up the ingenious schemes are bad. In The Count of Monte Christo, the good guy is the schemer who plots his revenge. They both have good schemes but what separates them is that the good guy is outsmarting the bad guys, Fernand and Danglars. The Count of Monte Christo is the best genre it could be. Very few fantasy or mystery books that I have read matched up to it. The Harry Potter series and Eragon were also good books that I would compare to The Count of Monte Christo.This book was really addicting and I read the whole thing in three days. I was completely hooked by the twentieth page because of the author's detail. I could not put down the book; I even brought it in the car for a two minute drive. The book ended with a twist that I never saw coming."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Out of all the many books that I have read, I would have to say that &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; is one of the most personally influential books that I have ever read. I had used to have a terrible temper, but here I saw the value of controling ones rage. Edmond endured a trial by fire and with inventiveness and unwavering steadfastness was able to achieve his goals. His revenge in each was a fitting exactment of justice. I personally love the revenge on Danglers. While the ending was predictable, I think that was the whole point. Revenge certainly is a dish better served cold. Anyone looking for an original story, and one that has obviously insipired many writers of our day. Read &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, and feel that certain power that only a classic novel can create."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book has appealed to me since I was in my teens. I'm prompted to read it again after watching a masterful version of in a French movie (with subtiltles.) It was shown in four episodes on Arts &amp; Entertainment - very superior to other movies telling this story. I have ordered a copy to read it again, since I last read it several years ago. I intend to encourage my children and grandchildrem to read it. Since it is so much based on revenge, I have often wondered what this meant about me, but it makes me feel ill to read some of these reviews by those who do not grasp the essence of this book, unless they found it too difficult for them to understand. I cannot in any way see this as a shallow novel. This book is truly a classic, especially for one who is as infatuated with France, as am I. Yes, it takes effort to keep the characters sorted out, but maybe it will become easier for me as I have gained wisdon over the years. This book belongs in my personal library, along with my other great favorite books, accumulated more recently."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"In school, one is forced to read many books for english class. Some read Beauwoulf (ewww), some read The Lord of the Flies (yuck) while I was forced to read this book or face a F. I was hesitant to read this at first; judging the book by its cover and thickness. It was discouraging but I started to read it. I couldn't believe someone could have been this creative! I just loved every page of it. I devoured it way ahead of everyone in class. This book was so good I even read The Three Musketeers on my own! This is a great book to read. I have read the abridged version and plan to get the unabridged version so I can find out what happened to certain characters!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I followed Edmond Dantes for 24 years. from a happy young man through many years of suffering till his revenge, which eventually didn't make him happy as he thought it would. What would have his life been like if he didn't have the misfortune to be imprisoned for 14 years. I think he would have made a fortune by himself and be happy at the same time, maybe less educated and brilliant but definitely happy. I couldn't help love and admire him and was sorry to let him go at the last page of the book.Dumas' writing is brilliant and breathtaking. He lets the reader guess and understand sometimes things that are not even written. I wonder how much of Dantes is Dumas.The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the most wonderful and exciting books ever written."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Let's see - I didn't read Dumas in English class, nor French class. There was a cartoon version I remember as a kid - 45 minutes, tops. Saw the Jim Caviezel Disney version and liked the story...so we download the free version onto the Kindle, and...wow! What a read. Swordfights. Poison. Beautiful women. No giants, though. Men in capes.Dense, prosy and engaging, with a travelogue into the Mediterranean, and enough silks and divans for the Arabian Nights. I didn't expect to be drawn in to this serialization, let alone turning the pages for \\"what happens next.\\" Definitely worth a week's reading.Now I want to purchase the Penguin unabridged version to be able to flip back and forth - one of the Kindle's limitations. But as a read-forward, and always know where you put it down, this version is a many-splendored, generous gift.Nice to know that the table of contents is clickable, although Dumas' chapter headings aren't very illuminating. The language is also very technical - of sailors and Italians. Having the dictionary handy is helpful. I don't like the Oxford one included, so I purchased the Merriam-Webster Collegiate for Kindle."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I have been going through the classics with my new Kindle. I made Monte Cristo one of the first on my list and I am not disappointed. Dumas has a way of telling a story, crafting it to make it weave a fabric of a story where all meshes together psychologically and suspensively. Dumas is a great observer of people and how they live and act and react to different situations and stresses.Excellent book."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I chanced upon \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" when my daughter needed to read it as part of a summer reading program. I am not a big reader of fiction and the story line of the book didnt inspire a lot of confidence. A story of a man who is unjustly imprisoned who comes back and avenges his enemies -- doesn't sound too interesting.Anyway, I just started reading a few pages just for the heck of it and found that I couldn't put the book down. This was story-telling at its best. It took me a couple of days to finish the book -- I really did nothing else during that period. The book was so well written -- and well translated.There are a whole bunch of characters in the story and their stories weave in and out of each other sustaining the pace of the novel. In some ways, this book seemed to be like a collection of novels (or novellas) that somehow got intertwined into a coherent large novel. Some of the things in the story might seem remarkable and hard to believe -- but that doesnt detract from the craftsmanship of Dumas which is quite unlike anything I have read thus far.There are a lot of abridged editions floating around -- however, after reading the original unabridged translation, I think its not possible to abridge the story without taking away significantly from its greatness."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Yes, that's my only complaint. It was too short. I never wanted it to end. I agree with others when they say you will devour it. You will be amazed how entranced you will be with the characters and the plot. And boy, is there a better thriller plot than this one? When I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it...thinking of what may happen next etc. How did Dumas craft such a story, I'll never know.Also, the book is much different and better than the movie (I saw the movie first and liked it so decided to read it). The book definitely does not have the Hollywood ending the movie. So if you saw the movie and liked it, or hated it, read the book anyways because you'll love it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I took this book to Europe on vacation and devoured it.

Dumas's style of writing cliffhanger endings consistently throughout the novel plays well to today's generations (myself included) who have been raised by television and movies. THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO reads like a compelling dramatic series (as it once was when published) that you simply never want to end. Woe to those who chose an abridged version of this book!I read all kinds of books for all kinds of reasons. Don't look here for realism, profound philosophy, or exercise for your intellect.

When you read the book in parallel with the Jesuit order all becomes apparent. The Jesuit General is the guy behind the scenes of the Vatican church."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is the kind of book that the author has a wonderful idea, but has the thought spread too thin over the novel to keep the reader's attention. Alexandre Dumas is an excellent writer but seems to accentuate too many subplots that are unimportant. He also focuses on numerous small and confusing characters.The basic plot, is about human nature, particularly revenge of a young man named Edmond Dant&eacute;s. At the age of nineteen, Dant&eacute;s has a series of important events happen to him. He is convicted of being a Bonapartist by two jealous rivals. He is unable to marry the lovely Mercedes and he is no longer capable become captain of the Pharaon, the merchant ship, on which he used to work on as a first mate. He is thrown into the notorious dungeon, Chateau d'if, for fourteen years. He escapes with a large secret: the map to the famed treasure of Spada. Naturally, he'll use it for his revenge. As they say, the rich can do anything.The book has so many intricate subplots and minor characters that the real plot seems to be lost in a hurricane of court intrigues, treasonous affairs, and numerous social gatherings. There are at least nine chapters concerning meals and balls, ranging from brunches to dinners, suppers to breakfasts, from a mere ball to a summer ball, and everything in-between. If you understand the difference between a baron and a count, then these things would obviously make sense, and may even be interesting to you. If you don't know the difference, prepare to be a little confused.Getting to the action takes a while, but when it comes, Dumas gives you a good read. From being captured by bandits, meeting Dantes's old fianc&eacute; (who is now married to his arch rival and has a child), to getting even with all those evil men who planned his imprisonment. Although, if you're not at the action yet, get ready for a long, not-so interesting read. Dumas, still manages to throw in some unimportant details and small talk in-between the action. You can't just go skipping around the book, because there are too many important details embedded in the small talk. If you don't read every word, I guarantee you'll get lost.This book is jam-packed with murderous action, so if that sounds good to you, you should consider reading this book. If you are looking for a challenge then this is a book for you. We recommend this book to older, more advanced readers."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The unabridged version of this is huge, huge. Like 1200 pages.I actually did read all of it. First time, though, that I would have to count myself sorry that I read the unabridged version of anything.There were exciting elements to the plot, to be sure, but after Dantes makes sure that M. Morrel is taken care of (p. 300 in the Penguin Classics edition: the part where the narrator skips ahead 10 years without telling you), the next 800 pages or so really drag. It's obvious that, at this time, writers were being paid by the word.Could be much stronger as a shorter (er, say, 200 pages) novel."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Very long book and not what I expected.

Not possessing the knowledge that the unabridged novel is over a thousand pages long, I assumed I had the entire book in my collection. Having finally cleared my schedule so that I could fully concentrate on Alexandre Dumas's classic about vengeance gone wild, I was horrified by what I was reading. Halfway into the book I took the trouble to look at the title page, and then the inherent weaknesses of the book were quickly explained; I was reading the Borders Classics Abridged Edition. Suddenly all the plot inconsistencies, timeline malfunctions, gaping holes in the story--along with all the mundane, trite, and nauseating melodramatic dialogue--made perfect sense. The Borders Abridged is awful, and, although I doubt I will ever try to tackle the unabridged edition, in my opinion does Dumas's classic not one iota of justice.I do hope the original tale is not as myopically presented--with each major character engaging in a monotonous pity party--as the abridged edition I suffered through. Protagonist Edmond Dantes comes across as cruel and reprehensible; the characters that conspired to send an innocent man to prison are demonstrably shallow and superficial. Hosts of other characters such as Haydee, Madame Danglars, Madame de Villefort, Debray, ad nauseum, are never fully vetted or explained. The only benefit from enduring this particular abridged edition is my determination, upon the purchase of another classic, to make darned sure I'm buying the unabridged version. Books, especially good books, are meant to be enjoyed as they originally were written--not hacked to nonsensical pieces for the sake of brevity. THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO deserves better.--D.

Recommended to me by my mom and as a choice for my World History class, I at first considered it to be overwhelming and incredibly long when I first picked it up. After getting into it, I couldn't put it down. The book, which is about a young man who is betrayed by the people who he considered his friends, is filled with love, revenge, murder and suspense. Yet it is full of European history and facts about the Napoleonic Era, which starts the book off. Alexandre Dumas' style of writing is extraordinary and even though it has a lot of detail, it makes you feel like you are a part of the book as you are reading it.

Unjustly placed there upon return to the port of Marseilles; made scapegoat for a Bonapartist action which he had no involvement with, Dantes is torn from his life as sailor, fiance, and son, and tossed into the darkness of solitary confinement, left to rot; untried, unexplained, and forgotten.Many years later, hope comes in the form of an ailing prisoner trying to tunnel his way out. He confides his greatest secret, the hiding place of an immense fortune, to Dantes before he dies. Seeing this as his only chance at freedom, Dantes assumes the place of the corpse, is removed from the prison for 'burial', and escapes.Thus begins his revenge. After collecting the very real wealth in the cavern on Monte Cristo, he assumes the title of Count, and exacts his vengeance on those who stole his life.The Count; benefactor, patron, and friend of the elite, insinuates himself into the lives of those who deprived him of all he loved, and authors their downfalls. All the while rewarding the good and just, he prepares punishment for those who are deserving.The book is entertaining from start to finish and was well worth the read. The Count's revenge is deserved, and well doled out, as he allows all to destroy themselves with their wrongdoing, simply supplying them the means. The ending is not so grand scale as to be Hollywood-esque in scope, but satisfying nonetheless. Dantes realizes that in following his path of revenge he has simply placed himself in another 'prison,' that of hatred, and he tempers his actions with deeds of generosity and gratitude, perhaps as a measure of atonement. But no matter what ills befall those who betrayed him, you constantly root for Dantes to emerge triumphant.The more classic literature I read, such as Count of Monte Cristo, the easier it is to see why good literature survives the test of time."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I read this book several years before the movie came out but before I go to my review, i suggest you see the movie as well as read the book.

This is the all time best book ever written.Most books written a long time ago, are slow placed and full of hard to read words but not this book. This book is written pretty modern despite it's time period. It was ahead of it's time, believe me. This book has action and romance and blends it in with a super awesome storyline like no other book ever. The characters are memorable and the bad guys are really bad. It's full of deception and betrayel and, above all else, REVENGE. Revenge seems awful to some but reading this book makes you think about all the good you can do with it.It's a very long book but you never get tired of reading it.

If you're afraid of reading a classic or have been told you HAVE TO READ this book, take heart.

While in prison he is told of a lost treasure on the isle of Monte Cristo, which he finds upon his escape many years later. Needless to say, his enemies have forgotten him, but he has not forgotten them.The way he uses his vast wealth to utterly destroy the lives and families of his enemies is simply amazing.

It is about a man who is wrongfully accused of a crime based on forged evidence by his enemies.

The many years in prison have changed him, and made him dedicate himself to revenge, which he completes very satisfyingly."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"More than a story of revenge and personal satisfaction, &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; is a story of loss and achievement. Young Edmont Dantes, of Marseilles, is a good-natured and competent man, and, being so, many of his acquaintances long to have him out of the way. Four people, for different reasons, throw him, using a series of schemes, in a jail where he will pass the rest of his life. But in the ill-famed Chateau d'If he discovers a secret that leads to an incredible wealth, and he is able to escape and work his life on the sole purpose of destroying his ancient enemies.We must understand that Dumas wrote this masterpiece on the apogee of romantism, and that is what Monte Cristo is: the utmost romantic story. And even if the potencial reader should think that, being written in the past century, it's going to be lots of cliches and known plots, think again. I don't want to spoil anything but to Edmont Dantes his revenge is not like what he thought it was going to be.The book is very long and sometimes even boring, with sub-plots seemingly leading to nowhere, just to be all sewn up in the very end. The best part, however is the inicial (the first 200 pages, more or less), when we see Dantes' life fall apart and he looses everything he cares for. This part is so well and pationately written, allowing similarities with Kafka's &quot;The Trial&quot;, but wherever Kafka is dark and cold, Dumas is colorful and emotive.Dumas is one of the best nineteenth century writers and has left a vast amount of works. This is, in my opinion, his best and should be read by everybody who is interested in good literature.Grade 8.7/10"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I have read this book in my childhood and got it for my son for Christmas.

When you strike me on one cheek, I should be allowed to strike you on the other, or at the very least sue you in court for the monetary damages your strike caused me. This sense of justice often transcends both culture and age. However, in many situations, justice does not occur. Evil men and women prosper at the expense of the good without consequence. Crimes and wrong doings go unpunished by the court of law. The question becomes should humans be allowed to take revenge for the crimes and evil committed against them when the legal system is too corrupt, lazy or ineffective to do anything about it.

You will be amoung \\"bandits\\" in the ruins of Rome, high society Europe during Carnival, Parisian society as well as sea faring trips with smugglers through coastal Spain and Italy."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"How does one review a classic? Especially one so noteworthy as to have demanded the creation of 11 or more film variations, numerous adaptations, and even television series? I long avoided reading this novel due mainly to it's daunting size, and the fear that it's translation would cause the reader more work than I was willing to put into it. However my burning desire to know the true tale of Edmond Dantes overruled my hesitation.The story, for those of you who are unfamiliar, follows Edmond Dantes in his wrongful imprisonment at the hands of his friends, his 14 years in the Chateau D'If, his escape and rebirth as a self proclaimed hand of vengeance against those who had wronged him. If you have only seen the movies, the book, particularly the ending, is far different than what Hollywood has created. There are no dramatic duels, no massive swordfights with brigands, and not everyone who we believe should, lives happily ever after. This is instead a slow but genius work of Dantes methodically stripping away all that his enemies held dear to them, at whatever cost. None die by his hand, but are rather destroyed by his influence, and their own evil choices come back to haunt them.The story itself is genius, interesting and very fun. The writing, particularly the translation that I read, is an often difficult and sometimes tedious work that one may need a notebook to keep straight. The cast of characters is very large and they are often referred to by different names, making it a bit more difficult to keep track of who is who without some sort of note taking. I was not smart enough to take notes, and thus had to spend quite a bit of time searching my brain to make sure I was thinking of the correct person as I read, particularly with some of the more minor story lines and the characters that weaved in and out of the story with multiple chapters between their appearances. Also, this book will probably be disappointing to those who are interested in the action that the movies provided. The Count of Monte Cristo, does not come in with guns blazing, but rather plays a very well thought out and disturbing game of mental chess against his opponents. As readers we hope for their downfall, but also wonder how far the Count will go... his years of imprisonment have left him hardened and disturbingly without remorse at the use of innocents to gain his vengeance. As he plays his pieces we wonder just who will be sacrificed, and who will have the chance to live happily ever after in this dark world of Dumas.Readers of more modern novels may have trouble with this book because of the sheer volume of concurrent story lines, all of which are necessary for understanding the strings being pulled by the Count. But to remember the tale of the lovers, the orphan, the bandit, the banker, the ship builder, the assassin, the count, the princess, the steward, the military man, the lawyer, the cheating husband and wife, the lost love, the musician, the buried baby, the dying father, the paralyzed grandfather, the murderess, the thief, the countess, the emperor and all of their relations, can be quite a daunting task for any reader. Still each of these stories could be a book of their own, keeping the reader quite entertained, but Dumas has managed to weave them all together into one, brilliant and shining tale... if you can keep them straight through the end.What surprised me most was the ending of this story. It was not what I wanted, or hoped for. True I loved Haidee, and wanted nothing but her happiness... but many seemed to be left in suffering that did not deserve the fate that they were bound to. I will not elaborate for fear of spoiling the ending... but this does not end on a Hollywood, \\"they all ride off into the sunset\\" ending. Perhaps the meaning of the story is not all about revenge, but rather what damage the hunt for vengeance can bring to not just those who have wronged you, but to all those that surround you. The downfall of selfishness; be it falsely imprisoning someone to gain what you may, to the selfishness of vengeance... there is so much meaning in this book, I can see why it is so often \\"required reading.\\" Though I highly recommend this book, I would advise you attempt to read it with others either in a class or a reading group so that you can discuss all of the rich meaning behind Dumas's words."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Having never read The Count of Monte Cristo and only faintly recalling a movie of some years ago, I was prepared for a swashbuckling epic of swordplay and derring-do. My expectations were entirely inadequate. The Count of Monte Cristo is rather a tale of revenge through the artifice of intrigue and cold calculation. Dumas creates a broken man, betrayed by a trio of duplicitous schemers, and devotes the bulk of the book to the complex machinations employed in retaliation.The phrase \\"intricately detailed\\" does not begin to describe the plots and sub-plots which carry this classic forward. Like all novels of its period, the author relies on what the modern-day reader would consider implausible convenience. This doesn't detract from its worth. To create such a tightly-laced weave, some liberties must be granted. The reader gladly forgives Messr. Dumas.On par with The Brothers Karamazov, Anna Karenina, and the works of James Fenimore Cooper, The Count of Monte Cristo is wonderfully thick and magisterially constructed.

It's about a twenty-year old man named Edmond Dantes, whose early fame (as a young, newly assigned ship captain) is short lived. Jealous of his success, a few bad men take actions that, on his wedding day, lead to his arrest and long imprisonment for a crime he didn't commit. After leaving the prison, he again gains fame, as well as fortune, learns all that he can about the men whose actions led to his demise, uses the information to concoct acts of revenge, ingratiates himself with the bad guys and their family members, and strikes. Although I'm not a fan of spending the time required to read really long books, in this case, I'm glad I did. An amazingly easy read, The Count of Monte Cristo has a complicated, well-thought out plot (though that involving V near the end is hokey and the ultimate fate of H troublesome) and great characters. Plus, it's always nice to see the good guys gain and the bad guys get their due. Also good: The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway, The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins, and An American Tragedy by Theodore Dreiser."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The book is excelent reading but please get a different version.This version only has 580 or so pages where as other versions have over 1,300 pages.

They can stand the test of time from 10 years to 100 years beyond, due to their meaningful story lines which everyone can both relate to and have different interpretations of. The Count of Monte Cristo has all these characteristic of a classic story. It is a story of revenge, love, hatred and the second chances in life one may be lucky enough to receive. Even though this story is almost 200 years old it still appeals to people of all ages and walks of life.Edmond Dantes is wrongly accused and imprisoned for a crime he did not commit. After spending 14 years in a horrendous prison he miraculously escapes and uses his new fortune given to him by a prison mate to live out his new life of enormous wealth and his quest for revenge. This seeking of revenge captured me along the ride with Edmond Dates' use of wit and internal hatred towards others to seek revenge on those who destroyed his life. It came to my discovery through the Count of Monte Cristo's experiences and actions that people back in 1800's were just as devious, greedy, deceitful, manipulative and vengeful as people can be today in modern times.Alexandre Dumas builds a captivating and rich plot throughout his story which makes the reader wonder what will happen next and what the consequences may be. The theme of love, hatred, happiness, vengeance and forgiveness is something everyone can relate to since they are feelings we have all felt. My negative critique for this book is the fact that it was a struggle to keep all the 40+ characters in order. The French names I am not familiar with as an English speaker, were confusing at times.I found this book intriguing because this story portrays the evil nature of the human spirit while at the same time teaching a lesson in the possibility of Karma and how eventually people will end up paying for their wrongdoings. It was at times a struggle to get through, but I was glad I did."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"except for the Bible, this is the best.It is the full and undiluted version from the first english translation.read it, learn it,live it.j"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is a classic for a reason. The story is easy to relate to. Love, betrayal, revenge, and a fanciful use of unlimited wealth. This is quite a monumental read for any bookworm.

It took a while to finish because of its length and language, but it was well worth it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is now added to my top five favorite books of all time. This is simply a great book! In my humblest of opinions this is what literature should be. The story touches the themes of justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness. But the story doesn't become excessively self righteous, because the whole time your evaluating what you would do if you were the protagonist. This is what great literature can do; make you consider your morals and ethics, so the story is much larger than just a tale. This book is long so be prepared. At times characters would be reintroduced and it would take some time before I could completely pull my remembrance of them together (such are the challenges of long books). It was funny the whole time reading this book I pictured Robert DeNiro as the Count of Monte Cristo."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"It is wonderfull even though i'm just nine i'm 49 chapters out 71 through it and i have 23 chapters left it is a triumph for Alexander Dumas has captured the life of people in france at the time of Nepoleon Barnepart&eacute;.He has given all his characters from the seafearing Edmond Dant&eacute;s to M.

Edmund Dantes, framed for a crime he didn't commit goes to an island prison to rot. There he meets an elderly man who quickly becomes his teacher. The man seems to know everything and his lessons transform Dantes into a sophisticated and wiley-intelligent individual.The two plan Dantes escape (I don't want to give away how but it has to do with the old man's death) and when Dantes, ultimately does escape he reinvents himself as a mysterious Count and starts taking revenge on those who framed him.This book made me appreciate the value of learning and how you can make yourself a better person, no matter your station in life, if you take advantage of books and other sources of information available."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Our Christian book club read this book from the \\"classics\\" genre. Although I have enjoyed many classics, it's rare for me to read a book written in the 19th c. or prior that I would consider a \\"page turner.\\" This is a suspenseful, can't put it down book comparable to those written by many of our best adventure novelists of today. Great book!!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book...it was a long book and sometimes I found it hard to follow the dialect but overall a great book. I also had no problems with my kindle after downloading this book."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Alexander Dumas was fascinated by the concept of revenge. It formed the core of two of his earlier novels, but nowhere else did he devote to it so much study and development as he did in his mid-19th Century gothic romance, \\"The Count of Monte Cristo.\\" Readers who choose abridged versions of this unsurpassed tale of vengeance short-change themselves, because it's only in the many sub-plots, the painstakingly depicted details of French elite society of France's Second Republic, and the subtle twists and interweaving of the activities of the novel's many characters that we truly come to appreciate this masterpiece in its in-depth exploration of what constitutes revenge in all its hideous terror and in all its glorious satisfaction.Edmund Dant&egrave;s suffers at the hands of brutal enemies, spends 14 years in one of the most awful prisons human perversity could devise, and through a series of suspense-filled circumstances gains his freedom - and a fortune - before spending an additional 10 years meticulously planning his revenge. He leaves nothing to chance. He watches. He waits. He is infinitely patient, and patience when wielded by skillful hands can be a weapon sharper than a sword. Edmund Dant&egrave;s, through years of training and practice, becomes dispassionate, cold, supremely calculating, supremely confident and capable - and implacable. The Count of Monte Cristo is born, and slowly, inexorably, he brings down retribution on those who betrayed him or forgot him rotting in prison. Even his former fianc&eacute;e, the lovely Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s (who certainly is no Homeric Penelope), does not escape unscathed.And in the end, for revenge to be complete, it must be cathartic. Dumas, after much carnage and financial destruction, leaves us with a few green shoots of love rising from the ashes, closing his magnificent saga with the line, \\". . . all human wisdom [is] contained in these two words - \`wait' and \`hope.'''"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is my favorite novel. Extremely interesting, complex, detailed, contains so much history (along with historical fiction), this book is great (was that a sentence?).This is the unabridged version, which i recommend. Reading the abridged would be like watching a thirty minute version of Shaw shank. It is just so much more detailed and complex. I took me about a week to read, with most of my time doing just that. The second time i read it, it took much longer.Watching the movie first does not ruin this book at all as they are very different.General plot and style for those who don't know:This novel defines the expression 'revenge is a dish best served cold'. Its tells a story of an innocent and optimistic young man beset by misfortune, who then vows to exact a long and meticulous scheme of revenge. Because of the books great lengths, many other characters are examined as deeply as shorter books examine their protagonist. Obviously the book is very detailed with interesting insight into the time period it was written in and about.Truly an epic book like no other, I strongly recommend it. Even if you don't like it, chances are it would make a great gift for a friend."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is one of those stories that, once it gets rolling, you can't drag yourself away from. The first half of the novel sets up the base for the unreeling of a revenge that is as complete as it is deserved. It's amazing how much of a foundation the Count sets up for his revenge. A throughly engaging tale!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"A great book. In spots the author drags just a bit but it keeps your attention all the way through."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"DO NOT BE DETERRED BY HE SIZE OF THIS BOOK.

DON'T BOTHER WITH THE 1975 MOVIE WITH RICHARD CHAMBERLAIN (COLD AND NOT WELL ACTED). HAVING SEEN 3 DIFFERENT ENDINGS IN THE 3 MOVIE VERSIONS, I WAS DETERMINED TO READ THIS CLASSIC AND SEE THE ENDING WRITTEN BY DUMAS.

It was in mint condition and was sent to us immediately. We are so appreciative for being able to purchase books online."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This was one of the best story lines that I have ever read. When I first looked at the book I thought over 1200 pages it has to be long and drawn out. But, I was wrong about drawn out. I found the book interesting all the way through. This is one of those story where once you finish it you want to start it over again.I had a couple of problem through out the book. One problem was that the book assumes that the reader is familiar with French culture in the 1800s. The book would slightly mention some current event like the Hundred Days of Napoleon and assume that the reader know about it. Also, the book would use French words for some items or events and assume that the reader knew that they were without explaining them. This was explainable because it was written in the 1800s in French for French readers who lived in the 1800s. It was hard to keep all the characters and their relationships with each other straight. It really became a large problem half way through the book when they introduced 8 new characters all at once. I would suggest writing down the main characters and their relationships with one another when you find out about them. Another problem was that the book would refer to a person with two different names."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This classic was interesting, but it had so many characters, some with multiple names, and subplots that it was a hard to keep straight at times. That being said, it was well worth the read."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"It's on my kindle waiting to be read. I downloaded a ton of free books.

I will probably read it again."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. And the dictionary on the Kindle was a godsend for all the archaic or foreign terms used in the book. It would have been nice to have a description of the various characters, without giving away the secrets of those with another identity. Sometimes I had to go back to verify who a character was. But other than that, it was a great story."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Once the history of all characters were read, it was a book hard to put down. E v everyone is important in this book."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I love this book!I was inspired to re-read it after spending a month in Corsica, where, on a clear day, you can see the island of Monte Cristo from the east coast beaches. When setting eyes on the outline of this large rock, it's not hard to imagine something mysterious associated with it. In fact, these days, you can take a boat near the island to fish, but if you get too close, military boats come along to shoo you off.I won't provide a summary here - the Book Description on the product page does that quite well enough. What I will say is, as a story, \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" has everything - everything! Deception! Intrigue! Romance! Ambition! Honor and vengeance, redemption and forgiveness. More than one character sinks to the depths of utter despair. All that's missing is a bit of swashbuckling, which might have appeared, except that the story took a different turn...Towards the beginning, it would probably help to know just a little about French politics around the time of Napolean. You can get by on context, though I did find myself reading up on some Wikipedia entries.As the story progresses, it does get a bit soap opera-y, as all the characters eventually come together, and everyone happens to know everyone else. But, all the connections do make for a great story, so I'm not complaining. If this is your first time reading the book, it might help to write down the characters in order to keep track of them.Some people might call this book a tome, but don't let that discourage you! It's just more of the story to enjoy. I usually only have enough time to read a few pages a day, and it honestly made me happy just to have this book to look forward to, for whenever I might find a spare five minutes to indulge myself."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This enormous book took quite a while to read, but I was certainly happy because I could not put it down. I felt that no part of it dragged along and felt insignificant compared to the genius of the author.The only problem I had was that the Kindle version says the book is about 600 pages, which was certainly not nearly correct. Maybe they will fix in an update."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is one of the books I should have read ages ago but have never picked up. I first started to read a different translation, but the language and sentence structure gave it no narrative flow. The Buss translation is terrific. The adventure tale of wrongful imprisonment and revenge keeps you reading for long periods of time. A little history lesson about Napolean and the Borgias is painless and welcome. When we read older books we are reminded how little human emotions have changed over 200 years.This translation is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"No words of mine can properly express the immense poetry and wisdom of this saga. It fully captures all of the human condition and experience but in a way that is gentle and respectable. If only more of today's art would take a similar approach, humankind would benefit and be better for its' influence. Need to read something that can excite you in thought and feel deeply for the characters? This is a must. Truly timeless written art."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Great book - 1200 pages but loving it! Dumas is so creative and imaginative - wonderful story, though focused very much on revenge."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Love this book, can read over and over again. Compelling, cannot put the book down. Highly recommendThe Count of Monte Cristo-a must read for everyone. Classic!!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BOOK!!!! That may seem incredibly overboard and over-dramatic, but honestly, when a novel is about the intricately plotted revenge of a man who escapes one of the toughest and unforgiving prisons after being falsely accused for thirteen years, then I think I have the right be be a little over-dramatic. To me Dumas never gets old, his writing is always meticulous and sweeping and he never misses a beat when it comes to plot. Everything is so perfect and with all the identities that Dantes takes on throughout the novel, it's so important that the audience understand what is happening and who that English Gentlemen or Sinbad the Sailor really is and Dumas does it with style.If Dumas was alive today and I somehow finagled the chance to meet him, I would probably swoon and faint on the spot. He's amazing. His writing is SUPERB! READ THIS BOOK if you haven't already, and if you have read it, read it again and again and again because it's never the same but it's always delightful"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I couldn't get past the first 5 chapters in this book due to the number of typos and poor translation. As soon as I'd begin to be immersed in the story a string of typos would trip me up and frustrate me. Often times I'd find myself re-reading a paragraph more than once to try and figure out what was being said because of the bad translation. This is certainly not a Wordsworth e-book conversion! You're better off just buying the book instead of this."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I'm going to start out by saying that this is one of my favorite stories ever and it has had many adaptations and given inspiration to many more in all sorts of media. I've seen the anime, the old 1975 movie and the newer 2002 movies, I've even read the abridged version. I'm just now getting around to reading the full unabridged version and regret not having done so sooner. After a quick glance at a few different reviews I discovered that this was the most faithful translation of the original, though I have no way of truly knowing for myself since I can't read french, but either way this is an absolutely amazing book. Getting the full story is much more fulfilling than getting the watered down unabridged version.To elaborate on the story for those who don't know it, a man named Edmond Dante's has everything he can ask for in life when it is all taken away by a few other men who were jealous of his success. He is then thrown into prison and after being trained in many aspects by his cell mate he manages to escape and that's when the true journey starts of him dedicating his entire life to exact the ultimate revenge on those who had robbed him of all he held dear all those years ago."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book is one of the best books ever written, by a great author. Revenge is necessary, but is it sweet?"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Let me be clear that I am a big fan of The Count of Monte Cristo, but don't spend your money on this copy. Visually, it's unappealing to the eyes (looks like a phone book). What is far worse, though, is that the editing in this book is horrendous. I will be half way through a sentence and the other half of it is starting a completely knew paragraph. There are spelling errors throughout the text. And what is really annoying is that the table of contents' page numbers don't match up with the text's page numbers. There's about a 50 page difference between the two. How that happened, I don't know. But, let me tell you that there are better unabridged copies of this excellent book out there."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Since I was a child, I've heard of \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" but as I grew into my teens and became an avid reader, I never gave a thought to reading it. For some reason (perhaps because the name was familiar to me from childhood), I saw it as a young readers book. Now, at the wise? old age of 69, my daughter, who is also an avid reader, suggested that I read it. She claimed it was one of the best books she's read. Normally, we have the same taste in literature. My daughter has read most of the \\"classics\\" and read the majority of them one after the other several years ago.After reading several pages, I gave up on it. While it is a fine work of literature for sure, I found a lot of the descriptive paragraphs to be repetitive and interrupted the flow of the story. Another issue for me personally was the amount of French content which I realize, is no fault of the author but a fault of my own for not knowing how to pronounce the French names, places, references etc.Another reason I gave it up was that while I found it to be a very cleverly written book, to me it was a childish/simplistic storyline.If it had been a smaller book (it's huge), I probably would have persevered."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"They do not write stories like this anymore. It is a complex and long read but worthy of the time. Without any spoilers, after about 150 pages into it, the novel will be hard to put down!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is an enjoyable story...even if you've seen any of the movies based on this book, you should still take the time to read it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Sometimes books are listed as Classics, and you have no idea why. English teachers are an odd lot as a whole, and I guess they're the ones who more or less determine what is considered classic. Some are clear choices, however, and to me \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" falls into that category.To begin with it is immensely readable, a point of necessity often overlooked on modern lists. It is a page-turner of the highest order, with romance and intrigue, suspense and drama, and as complicated a morality play of revenge and justice as one could desire. And the reader isn't harmed by a decent dose of French history in the process. There was an old movie version, with Tony Curtis of all people as the Count, that was amazingly true to such a long and complicated story. The more recent movie was forgettable, and if you don't recall it don't feel bad.Back to the story. It is well worth the reading, or re-reading, and personally I enjoyed it far more even than the Three Musketeers. It starts a little slowly, but if you stay with it through the point of Dante's (the Count) imprisonment, you'll be rewarded with a story you can't put down."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Wow, where to start on this? If you haven't seen the movie starring Jim Cavaziel and Guy Pearce yet, I suggest watching it before reading the book. The movie was a great movie also, but completely butchers the book, so to enjoy both, watch the movie first. My fiance bought this book for me, when I told her it was my favorite movie and I would like to read the book. When I first recieved it, I was intimidated. 1243 pages of pure classic literature! I was afraid that since it was a classic novel, it would confuse me greatly with the writing style, but Robin Buss (the translator) did a spectacular job of making it easy to understand. Also in the back of the book, he has included notes of certain words and phrases that are used to help clarify even more. The book is quite enjoyable to read, and I find myself laying in bed until one in the morning reading it. I have to force myself to put it down so I can sleep. Basically, a well written, very gripping book that I recommend to anyone. This is not my normal style of reading, but I have enjoyed it greatly. Again, watch the movie first so you can get the best of both worlds."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Please note that the product details dont mention it but this is an ABRIDGED edition and as such, leaves exactly those details out that make the book a classic. Dont get suckered into buying this edition coz it's cheap."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Every year amusement parks around the world spend millions of dollars trying to build the biggest and fastest roller coasters. These parks seek to give their visitors the greatest thrills possible on these rides without actually endangering the riders and thrill seekers flock to these parks by the thousands in order to take what they hope will be the ride of their lives. My advice is to skip the long trips and even longer lines and take a ride with Alexander Dumas and Edmond Dantes. No technology known to man can match the excitement and adventure you will thus find.Make no mistake; this will be a long and sometimes bumpy ride. Dumas occasionally will drop his reader into a chapter that seems to have no relevance to any of the chapters before it. After a while though, it will all become crystal clear as this master storyteller weaves his magic. There will be twists and turns that the reader will not be able to foresee and in the end you will marvel at the scope of the story and the extent of both the vengeance and kindness of the story's hero.As with many great works of literature, there have been many film adaptations of this book. Some were of course better than others were but none of these films come close to doing this book justice. If you have watched any or all of these films, be prepared to find that the book will often only resemble the films in that the characters have the same names. At least the characters that make it into the films will have the same names but many of the characters in the book never make it into the films. This book is simply too rich and too deep to be captured on film. To really experience Dumas' work you simply must read the book.This is a story of love lost, of deception, jealousy and murder. Within this book the reader will find villains so vile that they seem almost inhuman but when their downfall comes it is so terrible that one almost feels for these wretched creatures. All through the book the reader sees the story building to a climax, but it builds slowly. So slowly in fact that the reader will be almost on the edge of his or her seat as they wait for the inevitable falling of the ax. When the final act does finally come, the reader will know the characters so well that they will almost be able to feel their agony. On the other hand, the reader will also see that the Count's victims would not have become victims but for their own greed and pride. The traps laid by the Count simply would not have worked had not his victims been ruled by same vices that led them to wrong Dantes in the first place. As with all great works of fiction, the moral lessons are there, but buried under the surface so that they don't interfere with a great story.This is indeed a great story."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Updated to 5-star: Originally I gave this a low rating because it was incorrectly marked as the Unabridged version.

But I can't rate this edition higher because... well, to say that there are chapters missing in this edition would be to say nothing. I have read the original: it consists of two volumes each one of which is twice as thick as this book! Because chunks are take out, a lot of times you can't quite catch the story and figure out why things went the way they went. The story of Cadrousse and Andrea is missing completely, the reason why Villefort had a change of heart is not clear, the story of Danglars being kidnapped by the Roman bandits, Danglars' daughter running away from home, the results of Monte Cristo's visit to the telegraph... and that's not all! Good 3/4 of the original story is completely missing!

Not so! This is 800 more pages of delicious PLOT, whole twists, conversations, and characters that are chopped out in the abridged-glued-back-together versions! It went from being my third all-time favorite to my all time favorite book.As to versions: I LOVE hardbacks so after reading this one I *ahem* sold it to my sister and went about purchasing a hard back. I was unable to find a hard back in this addition and so looked at others. Thankfully I was able to compare other translations/editions that were hard-back on-line with *this* version (as it was still in the house) and I gladly proclaim that this is THE BEST VERSION OF COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO OUT THERE! It has richer, more natural, language (i.e. the difference between \\"see Spot run\\" and \\"the auburn Setter skipped down the steps towards me.\\" -lol) and far more satisfactory paragraph divisions. Read it, I just KNOW you'll love it.Twice bought. Twice loved."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"For a generation used to sound bytes and Cliff's Notes, this is an easy book to miss: the title sounds old-fashioned and boring. The setting (Napoleonic France) is an abstraction to most of us today. And at 1000+ pages, this is the antithesis of what the Sesame Street generation is used to.But pick it up and you soon discover that people back then were just as devious, greedy, deceitful, and vengeful as they are today. In other words, the book is captivating.This is a fantastic story in both the full and abridged versions. It is a study in what it means to have character: Dumas explores both the corrosive impact of petty and unethical indiscretions, as well as the awesome power born from personal responsibility. He keeps the protagonist human by tempering that power with a insatiable taste for revenge. As a reader, your heart breaks as you stand, helpless, while human weakness--greed, fear--bring ruin on a truly good soul. You find yourself oddly conflicted as that soul survives, strengthens, and flourishes while pursuing the dark goal of revenge... your desire to enjoy the journey is never without a nagging feeling that the evil that was done to the protagonist has left its mark...I cannot recommend this book highly enough... if I had a sixth star to give one book and one book only, this would be the one."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This was the first book I have read by Alexandre Dumas, and I have to say I loved it. The size is rather intimidating, but it is completely worth it. Despite the large size, I decided to read it, and I could not put it down. You know, I had those late nights where you just stay up and read for hours.The story begins with Edmond Dantes arriving home off his ship to marry his beloved Mercedes. The novel dives right into action with a plot made up by his \\"friends\\" to ruin him for some gain of their own. Edmond is falsely accused of being a Bonapartist involved in a scheme to overthrow the King and gets arrested right during his betrothal feast, and is thrown into prison. Right when he begins to give up hope, he befriends a very intelligent, old Abbe, who helps Edmond escape. The novel continues many years later with Edmond, or rather, the Count of Monte Cristo, and his brilliant, conniving plot of revenge.\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is a tale of adventure-yes, it is a tale of love-yes, but what this novel truly is, is a tale of revenge. How one's past haunts them because of one's wrongdoings and losses. But also how revenge cannot fix everything. Things in life do not usually work out perfectly, but there is always hope.This is a book full of twists and turns and those \\"Oh! What happens next!? I want to know!\\" moments. I can't wait to read more of Dumas' books. He's a gifted writer- able to write a thrilling plot and portray realistic characters and their true feelings. If you're a sucker for good literature, like myself, this is the book to read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"i had a similar experience as previously indicated. in fact i ordered both the unabridged and abridged versions of this product and received the exact same product (despite the fact that the allegedly unabridged version was 2X the cost.) if you'll notice, the picture are confusing and therefore you don't know what you will be receiving. now i am looking elsewhere for an unabridged version as the information on amazon is inconclusive and ultimately unhelpful."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This classic of Western literature was written serially, and like Dickens who also wrote serially, Dumas padded his writing.

The reader is a joy, the story is a joy, and a weary story line turns out to be so well written that it sets the standard for all others. Don't miss out on this if you are an audio book fan. The length is staggering, yet you'll be sad to have it end."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book took me about two months to read--partially due to its huge length and partially due to my own pace. I have to say this is one of the most rewarding reads I've ever had. Having seen the movie and the 7-hour subtitled epic, I can now say this: I very much dislike the movie, and the epic mini-series is disappointing (although much closer to the book.) I'll never understand why producers feel so obligated to completely change stories...OK, back to the book. This is one of the best revenge tales you'll ever read. Edmond Dantes is wronged in a huge way by three evil cohorts, and he plots for years to bring them to justice. Anything more and I'd be spoiling a book that shouldn't be spoiled! The elaborate schemes are unequaled in literature, and yet they are quite believable--especially as they almost all require the premise of \\"be sure your sin will find you out.\\" Dantes simply utilizes the evil that resides in his enemies to expedite his own plans for revenge. Quite stunning, and well worth your ample time.One more note--I've fallen in love with the name of one of the characters, Haidee.

Readers will lose count of the subplots, and indeed Dumas even let one of them peter out somewhere in the 1400+ pages of this unabridged version. Some parts of this novel flirt so much with contrivance it gets a bit ridiculous at times, but we're all here to see the well deserved smack downs for which the antagonists are just itchin'. The revenge wrought on each baddie is poetic, but not totally predictable. What's more, Dumas hints ever so subtly that in the end, evil for evil doesn't completely fulfill.This is the sort of novel that can't be well translated into a two-hour movie format. The older version with Chamberlain, Pleasance, and Curtis was kind of fun, but as with all other versions, the complexity of the interwoven subplots was entirely omitted.The full rendering of The Count of Monte Cristo must remain between novelist and reader a wholly telepathic experience."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The book is long, and seems to deviate from the plot a lot, although towards the end you realize that they all served purpose. The writing is ancient and there probably should have been some account regarding Edmond Dantes' transformation into the Count of Monte Christo.Having said that, the book is a fascinating study of the time and it works really hard at describing the characters, their motives, their thoughts and their struggles.I feel like an idiot afterwards for thinking I had already 'read' the Count of Monte Christo in elementary school - the original, unabridged version is much longer, more detailed, and has a different emphasis."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I can think of no character in all of literary history who is more obsessed, more driven than Edmond Dantes. Batman comes close.You don't know who Edmond Dantes is?Well, allow to offer up a brief synopsis (very brief) of the novel that is The Count of Monte Cristo.Edmond Dantes, a successful young sailor, returns home to France in the early 19th Century with plans to wed the love of his life. Instead of the expected happiness, several of Edmond's friends have grown jealous of his life and go to the authorities to accuse Edmond of being a spy for Napoleon. Edmond is sent to prison, his life ruined and basically over. But in prison he makes friends with another inmate, an old man who tells Edmond of a secret treasure hidden away on the island of Monte Cristo. After the old inmate dies in prison, through some twists and turns Edmond manages to escape. Then he goes to the island and discovers this treasure, so huge it would make any kings of Europe envious. Soon a mysterious stranger, the Count of Mont Cristo, appears in Paris and begins to make the rounds as to \\"coming out in society.\\" To give away more would be a disservice to the reader, but let's just say poor Edmond is no longer poor and goes to extremes to find his revenge against his old \\"friends.\\"Unlike most of the film versions I've seen of this tale, the novel does not have the happiest of endings. The tale is sort of a tragedy, but one in which the protagonist wins out, though finds that what he has won was perhaps not truly worth everything he went through to achieve it.There are no simple endings here. The good guy doesn't win the girl and everything else. In other words, this is a lengthy, complicated tale that will make you think in the end. All the while giving you a darn fun reading experience. There's action to be found here, sword fights and the like, as well as intrigue and skulduggery. There's also a bit of comedy here and there, but out-and-out murder at times.Most of Dumas' longer novels touch upon many facets of the human existence, and this one is no exception, though it is perhaps the darkest of his longer writings."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This Puffin Classics edition of Alexandre Dumas's classic \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is very readable. If you are looking for an abridged version of this classic tale, look no further. The storyline is well captured and with many delightful descriptions still kept in. Often, however, the story seems to move quite fast and it makes you wonder what details are being left out. The level of English is about equal to the High School senior or early college level. A number of French word's are left untranslated which help add to the flavor of this classic French tale. The price is very low and its a great deal.I would definitely recommend this novel to students studying the French Revolution and Romanticism. There is a lot of historical and stylistic content that make this novel a gem for scholastic study. Also, if you would like a portrait of the comings and goings of aristocratic Europe around 1835, this novel depicts a lot from those societies.[...]"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a book this much! I was a little daunted by the size of the audiobook (~47 hours) but once I started it, I could barely tear myself away from it. This is an amazing story that can be equally enjoyed by men, women and even teens. It was performed/read beautifully with a wide variety of accents that added to, rather than detracted from, the depth of the story. I'm pretty finicky about readers of audiobooks, and John Lee was fabulous! (He rivals Jim Dale.) The story itself is a must-read in any form -- beautifully-written, engaging, and intriguing. It presents an insight into the human soul without being preachy or boring, and I felt myself eagerly anticipating what was to come next, even up to the last minutes of the book. Do yourself a favor -- buy this book NOW!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Mote Cristo is a really exciting and fabulous story; I really enjoyed the book while reading it. The main character Edmond Dantes is about 21 years old, and for him, life is just full of success. He is a successful merchant and is about to be promoted to captain of a ship. At the same time, he is also about to marry a beautiful young girl whom he has loved for a very long time. But amidst all of these happy things, misfortune strikes, and Edomnd Dantes finds himself to be a prisoner in the Chateau D'If for life. He is a prisoner because he is betrayed by his so-called \\"friends\\" and rumored to be a servant of Napoleon Bonaparte. However, something miraculously happens, so read it to find out.Although this novel is usually thought of as a story of revenge, it has an even deeper meaning than that. This story not only warns people who betray others, but it also promotes love, friendship, and most of all hope. When the Count of Monte Cristo comes back and seeks revenge, he also meets some friends on the way that move his heart. Some of his friends become poor and have a sad life because of his imprisonment long ago, but they still hope that he will return and they wait for him day by day. The count rewards them in a secret way, and shows how important it is to have hope in one's life even when there looks like no hope. So when you read this book, keep in mind that there is more to it than just vengeance.This book is very pleasant and I finished it in a couple of sittings. It will definitely put you on the edge of your chair and you will hardly be able to put the book down. This book is for all kinds of people, but it is especially for people that think life is hopeless, because as this book will point out, nothing in life is ever hopeless."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I am reviewing the Pocket Books Enriched Classics version of the novel The Count of Monte Cristo. At about chapter 30, I was hooked on the story and reading reviews and doing research on it. At that point I discovered the Pocket Books version is an ABRIDGED version with about 70 chapters. The real version has around 117 chapters. This frustrated me immensely because nowhere on the Pocket Books version does it say it is abridged. That is my biggest complaint.I then found a complete version of the book and read it. If I was going to read the book, I wanted to read the whole thing. However, if you want a more tightly written book, I guess I could recommend the abridged version. It won't take near as long to read and will probably tell the same story. Just a quick comment about the 2002 movie starring Jim Cavizel and Guy Pierce. The 1st half of the move covers Dantes' imprisonment and escape, while in the book, it is maybe 25% of the story. While the movie is good, it in no way does justice to Dantes' life as the Count of Monte Cristo. I don't see how it would be possible to make a movie that follows the book closely, the book is just too long.Dantes is madly in love with Mercedes. On the eve of their wedding, Dantes is betrayed by 3 supposed friends. Dantes spends 14 years in prison and there he meets a priest he teaches him many things an tells him where to find a massive treasure. Dantes escapes, finds the treasure and sets out to get revenge on those who betrayed him. The revenge plots are long, detailed and sometimes farfetched. It seems Dantes can do anything he wants and is always able to buy what he needs or be in the right place at the right time. Still it is fun to get to know the characters and to see how Dantes exquisitely exacts his revenge. Many characters view suicide as a honorable way to deal with grief, which is ridiculous today but was accepted back then. In spite of leaving out 1/3rd of the novel, the pocket books version does include an large reference section that includes plot summary, character lists and other commentaries.If only Alexander Dumas were alive today. The Count of Monte Cristo is an amazing novel with an intricate plot, numerous characters and plenty of twists and turns. Unfortunately, it is written the style of the times, and is as not as exciting as it could have been. The dialogue all has a poetic feel to it. I wish this story could be told by an author today. This book oozes sexuality (affairs, lusts, lesbians) just beneath the surface. There is so much sexual tension that could be exploited without crossing the line to obscene. Also, so much of the behavior of the characters is wrapped up in French social customs that are hard to understand at first but the reader will quickly pick up on them.I recommend this book to anyone interested in books of this era or of a good adventure. Just decide if you want the abridged version or full version before you buy this book."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is a story that must be read to be truly appreciated.Set at a time of political turmoil in France, with Napoleon in exile,Edmond Dantes is an ambitious young sailor with prospects, and a beautiful fiance, Mercedes. Three people conspire against him to ruin his life, one wants his girl, another his position. He is banished to the notorious Chateau d'If, and is believed by his friends to be dead.In prison he meets the Abbe Faria, who becomes his teacher, and together they plan to escape. Edmond escapes with a treasure map 14 years later, claims the fortune, and becomes the mysterious Count of Monte Cristo, bent on getting revenge against those who wronged him. With his new found fortune he effortlessly penetrates the highest levels of society, and unrecognisable to his enemies, he now befriends them.The revenge comes slow and sweet, as he plots the downfall of his enemies. He is ruthless, deliberate and unrelenting, and appears to know everyones dark secrets, although we don't always know how he knows.There are many sub characters and subplots that are not in the movie versions of the story. There are some genuinely good characters whose path to love is blocked, and he is in the background pulling the strings to work the situation for those he loves. He is also pulling the strings on those he is out to get.He refers to himself as providence, as he takes the archetype role of flawed hero avenger, and wreaks his awful vengeance. He mysteriously appears everywhere, and knows everything, and uses it. He is karma incarnate.The society and manners of the time are brilliantly evoked by the beautiful writing of Alexandre Dumas. As the words leap from the page into your imagination, you see the characters, you hear their words, and feel their emotions.Most of all, you feel for Edmond Dantes. Will revenge bring him some measure of satisfaction, and make him happy? Or, will he be forever unable to forgive, and be happy. In some respects his life is our life, as you hope for some measureof transformation in his experience that you can apply to your own.Will he reunite with his beautiful fiance, now married to one of his enemies? Can he get revenge, and be forgiven by her?This is a story to be savored. So, go for the unabridged version.If you have seen the original movie with Robert Donat, and the more recent one with Jim Caviezel, who subsequently went on to play the contrasting role of Jesus Christ, I love both of the movie versions.There is way more in the book than can be conveyed in a two hour movie, and so the story is condensed and some of the characters altered to make the story more movie friendly. So, if you are like me, and enjoyed the movie, you will love the book."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"First off let me say that I love The Count of Monte Cristo. It is a great and exciting story that will leave you reeling.However the Signet Abridged version is not a great clipping of the long saga. For the most part the book seems to flow well enough with only a few potholes. The story of his neighbor who let his father starve is completely dropped without it ever being resolved. However the largest problem I have with this version is at the loss of one of the books most important points. This version shows how Edmond Dantes/Count of Monte Cristo takes out two of his three enemies and leaves them in ruin but completely ignores how he finishes off with his final enemy (As you can tell I am not trying to give away too much of the plot). This leaves his final actions to seem confusing.Please please read The Count of Monte Cristo, but I recommend getting yourself an unabridged version. But if you simply do not have the time then do not try this version as the cuts are so deep that it leaves the plot to bleed to death."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I often enjoy reading a book, and then checking out the movie. Almost always I enjoy the book more, although it is fun to see the movie version after reading the book. I don't think it would really even be possible for a two hour movie to do Dumas' classic justice (although the movie is enjoyable). This book is very entertaining, involves an intricate plot with many intertwined characters, and elements of suspense that could not be understood in a movie. It also covers a 24 year time span. The story is of Edmund Dantes, who after being promoted to captain of his ship, is brutally betrayed by those he trusts. On the day before his mairrage to his beautiful fiance, Mercedes, he is arrested for treason and taken to a prison on an island off the coast. He holds the image of his fiance in his mind, but unknown to him, she assumes he is dead and marries his friend who betrayed him. He is in prison for years, but life becomes barely tolerable after a tunnel is dug from a priest's cell to his. They are able to meet daily, and the priest is able to teach Dantes science, language, and even defense. Through his torturous incarceration, Dantes vows revenge on those who betrayed him. The two plot an escape through a tunnel, and the story continues to tell Dantes' life after prison.This is an excellent book and certainly a classic that most people, even younger readers, will enjoy. I plan on reading it again in a couple of years, and just may read it again after that. It is that good!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is the only Unabridged edition of The Count of Monte Cristo I have been able to find for Kindle. It looks like a public domain copy that has been adapted, but it is formatted well. It doesn't say who the translator is. It has the whole 117 chapters. It is worth the 99 cents, if you want the unabridged version. I think if you read the abridged you are missing out on some great parts of a great story. I gave this 4 stars because it looks like the public domain and has no extas that a lot of the big publishers have, but still, a great buy and a great version."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I got this download from Audible.com and it is brilliantly read by James Lee. I was completely captivated and transported to the world of Edmond Dantes and early 19th century France. I did consult spark notes every 5 or 10 chapters, because when listening to a book of this magnitude where aristocrats are changing their names (and sometimes needing aliases) and getting titles, it could be easy to get lost and hard to keep track of who is who. But I never felt lost or dragged down by this story that must be the blueprint for every romantic, adventure or character study novel that came afterwards. The novel is rich with sumptuous prose and unforgettable characters and is on par with other masterpieces like Lord of the Rings. It has everything and feels surprisingly contemporary. The language is not stilted at all and I found it to be extremely witty at some points. With Monte Cristo the first superhero is created by Dumas as he seems (to characters in the book) to posses superhuman strength, wealth beyond imagination and can always see 10 moves ahead in this very intriguing game of revenge chess he is playing with the people who falsely imprisoned him. John Lee is an amazing reader, so if audible books is your thing, go for it. I was never bored and was sad when it all, finally ended. It could have even been longer for me. I can't imagine being satisfied with an abridgment of this novel...it is too rich, and why let someone edit it for you when you can have the whole, glorious tale. And if you prefer print books, then I really don't see how you could go wrong. The Count of Monte Cristo is a hell of a good ride and deserves every single recommendation it gets. This is one of those once-in-a-decade books that deserves a whole constellation of stars instead of just five."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"You are not getting the full story with this edition and I am afraid you miss a bunch if you try the fast food variety of this book. While you will get the basics of the story, you miss too much background for it to be believable. The abridged version takes you from a dirty convict one day to a suave and loaded Count the next without showing you the transformation. The story is too good to skip 800 pages!Anyway...This is a really cool story! Not many of us know what it is like to be extremely wealthy and all powerful, but this book shows us this. After poor fisherman Edmond is thrown in prison for nothing, his fortune turns around and he escapes to the world again (after a decade and a half!) and finds trillions upon trillions (?) of dollars in jewels in gold that a fellow prisoner had discovered a map to. He spends alot of money over the next decade setting up the ultimate vengeance on those responsible for his earlier arrest. VERY ENTERTAINING THROUGHOUT!!! You will get an early view of not only early 19th century Paris but also a beautiful panoramic from life along the Mediteranean to the Catacombs of Rome. A truly sweeping narration!5 stars for the story!3 stars for this edition!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Often when I read, I have the television on (but muted). Imagine my surprise when I saw a trailer for the new film Count of Monte Christo while I was actually reading the novel. I suspect that the film will in no way measure up to this monument of world literature. This book is phenomenal. It is truly a magisterial work of the ages. The copy I read was the Penguin unabridged version, which clocks in at 1,078 pages in very dense font. I've never read the abridged version, but I imagine that cutting even a small bit of Dumas' work does it a great injustice. Read the unabridged version. It takes longer but always pays off. In fact, always read the full version of any piece of literature. Why cut corners?On the surface, the book seems to be a simple tale of revenge. Edmond Dantes, a young sailor with a bright future, has his life turned upside down when three men get him arrested on a false charge. Dantes ends up in prison for 14 years, where he meets a man who tells him of a hidden treasure. When Dantes escapes, he finds the treasure and emerges as \\"Le Comte de Monte Christo\\" and wreaks havoc on his enemies. Simple, right? There is so much more here than simple revenge. Dumas uses his sprawling epic to cast aspersions on the French aristocracy, as well as examining the relationship of God and man. Is man right to seek earthly revenge? Is it acceptable for man to assume the role that has been eternally given to God? It's all here in eloquent prose. Dumas also weaves into his work the European fascination of the time with anything Oriental, as some of the characters and events have a distinctive Turkish and Balkan character. As stated above, this book is brilliant. Dumas has an exceptional eye for character, and he loads this book with plenty of interesting people. The scheming businessman Danglars, the crown prosecutor M. de Villefort, the Greek slave Haydee, and Albert Morcerf are all characters you will meet during your journey through this book. My favorite character was Monsieur Noirtier, Villefort's father. What a tough old bird! Noirtier often saves the day.I was almost done with the book when I realized that I was reading a soap opera. All of the elements are there. It's the high level of melodrama that is most apparent. Eyes are constantly cast upwards towards heaven, chests are clutched in agony or joy, and sighs and blanching occur frequently. I felt sorry for the chairs and other furniture in this book. People are constantly collapsing into them over some agony or other emotional breakdown. Despite these constant emotional outbreaks, the book is still great. The book closes with the typical happy ending (even a ride off into the sunset occurs).This book is a classic and you'll quickly see why within a few pages. I would sure like to read other Dumas classics, although I can't imagine when I'll find the time. His musketeer stories apparently encompass some 3000 pages in its entirety. Start with this gem and it will suffice. Robin Buss is to be credited with his translation. Devoting the time to translating this huge book certainly is a labor of love. Five stars just aren't enough!!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"In the same spirit of challenge that led me to read Pride and Prejudice and A Tale of Two Cities (and find that they have become irreplaceable parts of my bookshelf) and that will lead me to read others like Don Quixote, Ivanhoe, and The Three Musketeers, I have now officially read The Count of Monte Cristo, and I can say that it was the easiest and most thrilling of all the classics I have yet read.Oh, sure, A Tale of Two Cities was tearjerking and triumphantly sad, and Pride and Prejudice just made you want to squeal in happiness, but The Count of Monte Cristo makes you think, makes you tear up (not out of sadness, at the wonder of the dialogue and the love you have for the characters -- and this is a translation!) makes you wonder, and finally, makes you go to this page to write a glowing 5-star review for one of the greatest books ever written in any language.If you're not fluent in French you'll do fine with this book, though without a basic knowledge of just a few words you might have a little trouble with it, and without having heard of some of the places or having been to France, you might not know exactly what the Champs-Elysees or Chateau d'If is. It doesn't matter. Those aren't the focal points of the book. The story is Edmond Dantes, happy and fortunate young sailor, about to become captain of his own ship, marry his beloved Mercedes, and live happily ever after. Then success is snatched from his hand and he is unjustly thrown into the monstrous prison of Chateau d'If, where he spends fourteen years vowing to avenge himself.He gets out eventually, in one of the most dazzling and vivid scenes ever written, and makes his fortune finding buried treasure on the tiny island of Monte Cristo. Henceforth he is known as the Count of Monte Cristo: Enigmatic, a little surreal, and ready to exact perfect reward for those who did him well -- and perfect justice for those who did him evil.But there are complications that even the mighty count couldn't have foreseen: the son of his ex-fiancee and his bitter enemy befriends him, the son of his dead benefactor is in love with the daughter of the man who sentenced him to life in prison to protect his career, and the question comes up: When is revenge right, how far do you go, and do humans even have the right?It's a fantastic story, a memorable and fast-paced story, and, unlike a few books I could mention, truly deserves its label of classic. For those who like action: This book has prison, escape, treasure, poison, love, cruelty, redemption, revenge, forgiveness, ambiguity, sadness, triumph, and hope. Don't be daunted by the page count. It's a true work of art.Has anyone got a copy of the Three Musketeers?Rating: Masterpiece"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"you must read this bokk, je vous conseille de lire en franais, c est beaucoup mieux.The story is great, there is a lot of suspence and action.

I just could never put this book down. At night I refused to go to sleep, and when I finally did, I'd dream about the brilliant Count of Monte Cristo and the elegant Paris society that's inwardly so corrupted.Dumas is an author of a rare quality. Through Dante, he depicts the most exciting story of love, friendship, adventure, justice, and drama. From the very beginning to the last page, I was always curious and dying to know what was going to happen on the next page.Edmond Dante is a young man who is a good and innocent son, fiance, and a sailor. He is being envied by his collegues and, on his wedding day, gets arrested and later put in the most infamous prison for no good reason. After many many years Dante escapes the Chateau d'If miraculously and makes perfect plans to get revenge on his enenmies. It's fascinating to find out what a genius he is at fulfilling his heart's desires.It really is a masterpiece and would like to recommend it to everyone because it's impossible not to enjoy this book throughly. Just be careful NOT to read the abridged version since it leaves out too many details."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"All I can say is that I spent many days enthralled with this book and when it was finished I felt like I had lost dear friends.

Evil villains, traitors, chivalry, romance, intrigue, redemption...I could go on forever. Some of the scenarios Dumas sets up are exquisite and will literally have your heart racing in excitement! There are so many mini-plots, each of them fascinating, to keep your interest. Do yourself a favor and read this book!

This novel is beautifully written, full of emotion and witty dialogue as well as Dumas' famous adventure, action, and mystery. The story of the wrongfully imprisoned Edmond and his quest for revenge is spellbinding. In fact, this book can be dangerous-- if you are midway through it and your house begins to burn around you, it is entirely possible that you will not pull your nose out of the book and go outside. Also, this book may bring out an ugly side to your personality; almost everyone has someone they would like to treat as the Count treats those who framed him. There's nothing like living vicariously through an almost 200-year-old fictional character.Someone commented in another review that this book is too long. I can't tell you how little I agree. I wish it were twice as long as it is. I don't believe that is has a single dull moment. However, there are abreviated versions available. I think that reading an abreviated version of such a masterpiece is a waste. Still, be careful when chosing an edition to buy."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the best books ever written, if not the best. It is a great piece of Literature written by the multitalented author, Alexandre Dumas. It is a thrilling and exciting adventure story of a young noble boy named Edmond Dantes.

He comes to find his lover Mercedes married to one of his enemies. To figure out if he gets his revenge on his enemies, you will have to read the book. The book is an action packed, never ending and very exciting. You will go on the greatest thrill ride of your life and it will not stop until you close the book."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This Alexander Dumas classic vies with his &quot;Three Musketeers&quot; in the genre of French adventure novels set in the eventful 19th century. Whereas &quot;Three Musketeers&quot; featured a quartet of swashbuckling heroes, &quot;Monte Cristo&quot; centers around one mysterious, seemingly omnipotent individual.The book opens in Marseilles, where the reader is introduced to the central characters as young men. A plot is laid and carried out against one of these men by his rival for the love of a woman. After the passage of 14 years, the lives of these characters slowly begin to converge once again as the victim of the conspiracy seeks his vengeance.The setting for his revenge, however, is a far different venue than the Mediterranean fishing community of Marseilles. His old enemies have become wealthy and powerful, and move in the highest circles of Paris society. The skeletons in their closets would now be the ruin of lofty reputations. Their families will become unknowing actors in the drama of vengeance that begins to unfold when the Count of Monte Cristo takes up residence in Paris.The victim of the conspiracy of hotheads in Marseilles was an unsophisticated provincial at the time. Upon his return, he is wealthy, subtle, and implacable. He embarks upon his quest for revenge with a well-planned, methodical campaign, marshalling resources that he has devoted years to organize. He uses a dozen or so people as his allies, some unknowingly, others willingly, but none are aware of his ultimate objectives. Yet, as complex and detailed as his plans are, he encounters complications that force him to choose how far to pursue his revenge.I was captivated by the dark and light contrasts of this story. The glitter and elegance and courtliness of French society of that day are set against the darkness of scandalous family secrets and destructive, coldblooded scheming. It's a combination that can't miss, particularly at the hand of a master writer like Dumas. This is a long book to plow through, but the further one gets, the more the threads of the plot come together to the final triumphs and defeats. As you reach the closing chapters, you may be reminded of a line from the movie &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; -- &quot;no man is rich enough to buy back his past.&quot;"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"you find it almost impossible to determine the translator of this book, either from the amazon description or even from an examination of the physical book itself. only by an in-depth reading of almost the entire introduction is it made clear that the translation is quite old, and considered one of the worst. surprised eco put his name to this."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The first time I read this book I was a sophmore in high school. Since then, I have reread it at least a dozen more times. This has to be the best book ever written. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"i thought this was a great book because i've never read the origanal but it was about 700 pages shorter DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The words \\"bestest\\" and \\"awesomest\\" should be added to the next edition of Webster's since nothing else can describe Dumas's \\"The Count of Monte Cristo.\\" When it comes to plot suspense and valuable moral lessons, Dumas has it all. Imbuing it with a rich and captive plot, Dumas enriches his masterpiece with themes of love, hate, vengeance, and forgiveness--all part of our quotidian lives.Although the original version stretches over 1200 pages, the abridged version with its 600 pages is just as enticing but more complex at few scenes where some characters appear suddenly.A background of the author's era is essential in understanding the setting and beginnings of \\"The Count of Monte Cristo.\\" It was during this era that French royalties exiled Napoleon Bonaparte, the hailed French hero, to the Mediterranean island of Elba, where Edmond Dantes, the protagonist, finds him. It is the letter containing Napoleon's secret plans of retaliating against the French nobility that partially causes Dantes's imprisonment. This political reason, however, is not the main reason.Though mostly direct and clear, Dumas's style varies to a more philosophical one when discussing human nature, which he does often towards the end. Edmond Dantes, as mentioned above, is the young and well-off protagonist, ready to become the captain of his ship and get married. With a big heart and somewhat ignorant soul, Dantes falls into the farce those closest to him had set up. In the beginning chapters, the ready already sees themes of love, hatred, and jealousy.Returning after a long time under the name of Count of Monte Cristo, Dantes begins executing his plans of revenge against those who destroyed him and recompense those who helped him. What truly makes this book such a remarkable one is the beauty and perfection with which the Golden Rule (\\"Do unto others what you with done unto you\\") is applied throughout the development of the plot.With abundant characters that differ in personality and beliefs, every reader is sure to find his/her own reflection taking part of the story's advancement.Overall, this book is worthwhile to read. I assure you that you will not be disappointed but you will enjoy every chapter of it. It is no wonder that it is hailed as \\"one of the greatest classics.\\""},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I just recently revisited this brilliant novel and recalled all the reasons it's one of my all-time favorites! It's a lengthy book but you hardly even notice with the way it keeps you hooked! Dumas originally wrote this as a serial in a publication over the course of a couple years so he kept his segments packed with plenty of excitement that keeps you wanting more. You don't need to wait for it to pick up like with most longer books-- you know right away that this is a great story!Edmond Dantes, nineteen years old, about to be made captain of the Pharaon, and just ready to celebrate his marriage to a young girl he is very much in love with has his liberty snatched from him and spends the next fourteen years locked in a dark prison cell, falsely accused. When he finally escapes, he finds his father dead, his fiance married to one of the very men responsible for his imprisonment, and the other guilty parties wealthy and respected. But a vast treasure bequeathed to Edmond by the Abbe engenders the Count of Monte Cristo, a man hellbent on being His hand of justice. Fast death is too good for these men that ruined a life for their own ends... ."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I have been a fan of the count and his story for a long time with tv series and the movie based off it, but nothing quite compares to this book. It's absolutely amazing and has become one of my favorite books along with Les Miserables. It deals with justice, revenge, and hope. Many of the passages are inspiring, and on a whole, it flows beautifully.This took me a very long time to read because of it's length, but I was able continue with ease every time I picked it up. All of the characters are interesting and detailed in a way that is almost shocking. This book draws you in and leaves you anticipating for what happens next. The ending was not exactly what I expected, but I was very satisfied with it. Dumas is a remarkable storyteller and I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Two jealous men plot to have Edmond Dantes thrown into a hellhole of a dungeon on false charges, and a third self-serving government man arranges to have Dantes kept there for life in order to protect his own interests. However, after fourteen years Dantes manages to escape and soon finds that his life as he once knew it is over: his promising career as a merchant ship's captain was aborted, his father had long ago starved himself to death out of grief, and his former beloved fiancee had married another. Yeah if I were in Dantes' shoes I'd hold a pretty serious grudge too.Fortunately Dantes' only friend in the dungeon had divulged to him, just before his death, the secret location of a buried treasure on the uninhabited isle of Monte Cristo near the French coast. Dantes soon becomes the fabulously wealthy Count of Monte Cristo and proceeds to gradually but relentlessly exact total retribution on his betrayers, two decades after they'd first hatched their plot.This long tale of revenge satisfies. The basic plot is quite drawn out as Dantes' master plan requires him to befriend and gain the trust of the men who destroyed his prospects in youth. He accomplishes this mainly by becoming somewhat intimate with these mens' families, so there are various sub-plots that comprise the middle third or so of the book. Following this section, the Count has his chess pieces where he wants them and proceeds to rapidly and systematically destroy his enemies. Of course the best parts are their horrified aspects when he finally reveals his identity to them.Though 'Count' is replete with rich renderings of scenes in various parts of Paris, Marseilles and the French Riviera, and Rome and rural Italy, his emphasis is on the dialogue and action more than on the settings. Unlike for example Victor Hugo, who puts much more weight on describing the stage upon which the actors walk, through delightfully sudden tangents on history and philosophy that do in fact relate to the subject at hand. Dumas's style is much more focused and to the point.Though rather simple in plot development and resolution, 'Count' stands among the finest of the classics. An absolute must for teen readers. For adults it's still a great read, though most of the events and the ending are somewhat predictable and almost always go the way of the hero. Also, Dantes' transformation from a poorly educated happy-go-lucky sailor boy to a cultured single-minded demi-god with seemingly infinite knowledge / wisdom and superhuman insight is a bit too much to believe!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"If you're going to read The Count of Monte Cristo you must read the unabridged version (the abridged version cuts out so much it will leave you going, \\"Huh?\\" half way through!)Betrayal, Adventure, Revenge - this is classic literature from which everything exciting we currently are exposed to derived.The translation of this particular version is excellent.It's the single largest novel I ever read (I'm not a big \\"reader\\"), but it went very quickly."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I had seen the movie and thought that the element of surprise would be removed because of that fact. I feared before reading it that I would not feel the tension or shock in the story that makes reading a novel like this so enjoyable, like a kid who peeked at his Christmas presents on the 23rd and then feels little emotion at the unveiling on the 25th. But, the movie had only basic similarities with the book. I was enthralled with every page and amazed with the character and plot development. Dumas was a genius. Do not miss any of this story. I do not see how an abridged version could possibly capture the weight of this story or produce the same kind of effect upon the reader."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I've been a reader of an abridged version of this tale since I was a kid in 7th grade. Probably read it 20 times. Then 2 years ago I got a copy of the Penguin unabridged version - holy cow!!! I had no idea what I was missing - incomparable depth, nuance, and detail so richly rendered you feel as if you're a bystander in the scenes!The story is a classic - a young man full of hope, love, and unlimited potential is falsely accused and imprisoned on the eve of his wedding. A miraculous escape 14 years later, re-birth and transformation into the formidable Count of Monte Cristo begins the painstaking planning of a long awaited revenge. And what a complete revenge it is.Even at 1100 pages, it's never boring (and although at times Dumas stretches out what could be related in a more concise way, I inwardly smile when I recall that he was paid by the word:), and when you reach the end you'll certainaly want for more.

Yes once you move on further into the book where his revange is already in motion he seems like a very mean person. I was fooled by it also, but he was in the forsaken jail for 14 years. You can't get out the same person you went in. But once he already avanges them he actualy forgives them. He saves valentine for maximilian and he even feels sorry for the revange on vielfort.

A good and happy man is imprisoned wrongly....he spends the next---what 14 years of his life in the cell of a prison for a shallow crime he didn't even commit. (The author doesn't dwell on that point). What happens in prison? Well, Edmond Dantes discovers a story of a hidden treasure and eventually an escape. It takes him years to set up his revenge and come to terms with it. (We don't dwell on the years, either). The author explicitly states that Edmond has God's approval to carry out his plans on his &quot;backstabbers.&quot; The revenge is great---for he only pushes these evil people's deeds in their faces.

It is a story of injustice and a quest for revenge that will hold your attention for hours.The story in this novel is darker and far more engrossing than any adaptation. If you have seen the film adaptations of this book then some of the character names and general outline of the story will be familiar to you.A young merchant sailor, Edmond Dant&egrave;s is about to achieve prosperity in his life. Unbeknownst to him; his soon to be wife's cousin and a shipmate accuse Dant&eacute;s of being a supporter of Napol&eacute;on I, because of a package and a letter Dant&eacute;s must deliver.

Set up to marry the lovely Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s, recently made the captain of his own ship, and well liked by many, he is the envy of three men who set out to destroy him. Dant&egrave;s, ignorant of the political scene, has agreed to take a letter from Napoleon to some Bonapartists in Paris. Using this as fodder, Danglars, Mondego and Caderousse bring him to court to be tried for treason.Dant&egrave;s is convicted, and once in prison meets a man named Abb&eacute; Faria. He is a priest who educated Dantes into a well-rounded, well-informed man. He leaved Dantes with the knowledge of many riches on the Isle of Monte Cristo, and how to get to the place. When Faria dies, Dantes uses his shroud as a means of escape, and is thrown into the sea.He reaches Monte Cristo and is astounded at all the riches. Disguising himself as a priest, he travells to Marseille. Upon arrival he learns that his father has died and that his fiancee Mercedes has married Mondego. He also is told about the plot to frame him.Ten years later, he reinstates himself into French society, giving himself the title Count of Monte Cristo. Nobody recognizes him with the exception of Mercedes. He uses his knowledge of his old aversaries to bring about their ruin in very public and humiliating ways.Not all of his motives are driven by vengance, however. He also sets out to reward everyone who helped him over the years, and does this through his extensive riches and influence.Overall the novcel is very intriguing and exciting. It is full of action filled escapes and duels which add to the excitement. There is an air of mystery around Dantes that gives it the air of a thriller novel. It is full of plot twists and intrigue that make it difficult to put down for a minute. Alexandre Dumas is an excellent storyteller who has crafted a masterpiece that rivals his well-loved Three Muskateers series.In addition to being an excellent storyteller, Dumas is an astounding writer. The plot line is gripping in and of itself, but Dumas' expert control of the English language grips the reader with the words themselves, not just what they represent.It would be wise to read the abridged version of this novel, because for the average person the excruciating detail in the long version detracts from the story a little bit. To keep it more exciting and gripping, the shorter version covers the most important parts without many of the very miniscule details in the original.The original is also an excellent read, and gives much more insight into the characters' lives, but it would be reccomended to read it second to the abridged version, and only by the most patient Dumas fans."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This has to be one of the greatest novels ever written. Its grandeur reminded me of Homer's Iliad. The characters are heroic, even when flawed. I had just watched the recent movie version starring James Caviezel, and was motivated to read the original book. Needless to say, the true plot is completely different after Dantes' escape from prison - and much better than what was used in the film. As I pored through page after page, I was awestruck by Dumas' skill and compassion. I've since read his Three Musketeers. Although enjoyable, it lacks the depth and soul-stirring of The Count.

And if you like complex, involved, convoluted plots, this book is certainly one that you will not want to miss.On the down side, while there is certainly 400+ pages of excellent plot in this novel, it takes the author 875 pages to tell it. (This refers to the unabridged Wordsworth Classics edition, in paperback.) The writing reminds me of a quote I once heard describing Dickens (and which could easily be applied to many 19th century authors): he was paid by the word, and it shows. Further, Dumas uses an odd convention for conversations: he does not change paragraph whenever he changes speakers. I don't know whether this was a standard convention for his time and place, or whether it is strictly his own. This is a minor quibble, but it is distracting, at least at first.Then, there are some truly immense amounts of suspension of disbelief that one must manage if one is to take the book seriously; primary among them is the fact of Dantes' immense competence, especially in the social skills and understanding of people, during his long, drawn-out revenge. Here, after all, is a man, who when he was a 19 year old was so naive that when he was imprisoned, he couldn't even fathom who would have wished him ill or why. He spent 14 years in prison, much of it in solitary confinement, the rest of it with only his one fellow prisoner as company. Granted, he had a native intelligence and charisma, and his fellow prisoner was well-educated, and spent much time teaching him languages, math, science, and history during their years together. And of course, once he escapes, he becomes fabulously wealthy. But native intelligence, a fine classical education, and a ton of money do NOT equate to a knowledge of people; he could not have picked that up in prison, because it is not the kind of thing that one can learn by studying the abstract; it can only be learned through practice, and he had none of that. Yet as soon as he leaves prison, he immediately is portrayed as a masterful schemer and manipulator. Granted, there is a ten-year gap during which we do not see his adventures, but even so, it is dubious that a man with his limited experience would be able to learn all that he learned in that time. Not to mention that it is dubious that a man with his limited experience would have been able to protect his person and his wealth while learning the people skills necessary.Then we have specific instances of his manipulation being more complete than anyone could reasonably expect to do, no matter how much they know, or how much money they have, at least without better explanations from the author (which we do not get). For instance, at the very beginning of his insinuation of himself into Parisian society, he buys the superior horses of one of his unwitting enemies, and then gives them back to the man's wife as a present, to sow marital dischord. When he does this, he knows that she intends letting a friend of hers (also the wife of one of his enemies) have a ride in the carriage behind the splendid beasts the next day. So he positions himself and his servant at precisely the right place to intercept the carriage the next day when the horses run amok and threaten to overset the carriage, and save the lady, thus insinuating himself into her good graces. It is made very clear that he knows that the horses will run wild by the questions and orders he gives his servant, but it is never explained HOW he knew that. Had he provided the driver for the carriage? It was never stated. Had he bribed the existing driver? Again, it was never stated, and it seems unlikely that such a bribe could be safely made, and kept completely secret. Had he insinuated an irritant into the horses' equippage? That would have assured them running wild, but not at the exact place and time that they did so, with no chance of overturning the carriage before ever they got to that point. All in all, an incident like that one needs to be explained in order to be at all plausible, and it wasn't. And there were others, too, less obvious, but still implausible.And a last negative, which causes me to drop my rating from three stars to two: Dantes is supposed to be a sympathetic character, terrible to his enemies, benificent to his friends, but all I can say is, preserve me from the pain of such benificence. Toward the end of the book, he saves his best friend's lover's life, by simulating her death. Yet he allows his friend to think that she is dead FOR A WHOLE MONTH in order to &quot;test his mettle&quot; to discern if he &quot;merits happiness&quot;. And in fact, years before, in his other act of benificence, to that friend's father, he saves him from financial ruin, but only does so at the eleventh hour and fifty-ninth minute, allowing the man to come within a hairsbreadth of committing suicide in despair. If this were done in order to demonstrate that his ordeals have cost him all compassion, it would be one thing, but as I say, he is portrayed as being a marvellously benificent friend; the friends he has treated in this way not only forgive him, but don't seem to be aware that there is anything to forgive; they act as if his treatment of them has been marvellous.No, I cannot say that I enjoyed this book. I cannot rate it highly. I cannot, even, concede that it is (on balance) well done. But there certainly are things to like about it, and any book that can produce the interesting philosopical arguments that this one is capable of can't be all bad."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Modern television did not invent &quot;MacGyver&quot;, Alexander Dumas did. &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; follows the life of Edmond Dantes who is falsely accused of treason against the crown, imprisoned, escapes in true MacGyver fashion, and then spends the remainder of his days wreaking revenge on his enemies. Dumas creates an interesting plot which winds its way through some 400 odd pages (and this is the abridged version). The plot is never boring and it is truly fascinating how Dumas manages to make what seem initially to be the most tangential details essential elements to the Count's plan for revenge. Also of interest are Dumas' explanations of events such as Dantes' tunneling through a stone prison cell using a tool he made from a soup pot, escape from prison by wrapping himself in his friends funeral shroud which he sews from the inside, and the construction of the crypt containing the seed money which transforms him into the count. That Dumas could coordinate all these nitpicky details and meld them into a singleminded plot makes the book worth reading just for that.Unfortunately, that is probably the only reason to read the book. Admittedly the abridged version leaves out significant portions of the story, but 441 pages should leave enough room for explanations without everything being attributed to sheer coincidence or to being brought into action via bribes and million dollar franc pensions. My other criticism of the book is that the singlemindedness of the Count seems fickle and unbelievable. Revenge is the overwhelming thought process of the count. In the abdridged version he spends some 350 pages ruminating about how he's going to have his revenge. Then suddenly towards the end, he has a change of heart - he feels that he just might have gone a bit overboard, after spending millions of francs bribing people and ruining the lives of several innocent people, all to give three persons their comeuppance. The count mopes about for a few days, then remembers that he truly was miserable in prison, and finally decides that he did the right thing and everything is fine and dandy. Bologna! If a man spends the majority of his life planning revenge and assumes the powers of essentially a sovereign entitity in doing so, what seems reasonable is that at the end he is either a hideous fiend who feels utterly no remorse or he is a total wreck of a man filled with unending guilt and remorse - certainly nothing that can be relieved by the joyful sight of the Morels.In summary, &quot;The COunt of MOnte Cristo&quot; is a great tale to quickly read (and that is probably needed since it is so long) but on closer inspection is unconvincing because of its reliance on coincidence, bribery, and superficial emotional turmoil."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book is Dumas at his best. An excellent plot with good character development. Parents should use classics like this to get their young children to read instead of playing video games and watching TV."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"If you don't usually read books this long (unabridged version 1000+ pages) because you never seem to finish them, don't worry you will read the entire book quicker than most 300 page books. The reason is that it is just that good. This is the best book I have ever read. I read the unabridged version and finished it inside of a week and I am not a fast reader. The strategy and cunning of the main character Edmund Dantes is unparalleled by any other character in any other book. If you like a well thought out plot, you will find none better. The story line will take you with it and you will become totally engrossed in the book. It is very well written. Once you get used to the dialogue, the book flows so well that you forget you are reading. It is truly an amazing, well written, thought provoking tale."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The novel, The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas is a story of a man who is tempted with utter happiness, only to find himself unjutly ripped away and thrown in the face of absolute despair. The majority of this story, however, is his return from the living dead. . .to seek complete revenge.This is a novel which will have you transfixed to the plot from begining to the very end. It contains all elements to kep you reading, unexpectancies, surprises, suicides, murders, affairs, revenge and undying love. . . anything you could possibly look for in a book. Dumas draws you into a time in history when honor was extremely valuable and fortune, was a must.So when considering reading a book that colors the imagination and reaches into the depths of your soul, this book has to be it. Because unlike many other modern day &quot;soap oper&quot; books, this one has made a name for itself in history and society, or at least in my eyes, as the best book ever written."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"My AP English teacher recommended this book for me to read over the monthly required reading list, and I thought, &quot;Oh great, what a great idea....&lt;yawn&gt;&quot;. But it was for two months because of its length, so I took it.Each chapter includes a specific idea to the plot that keeps you wanting to read more. I would bring this book to work and read a chapter a day during my 15 minute break and would go overboard reading two chapters because it just keeps getting better and better! Each new idea came as a surprise for me, and so much is in it that I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good book.Alexandre Dumas sure knew what he was doing when he read this, so I definitely recommend this."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I read and enjoyed this book as a youth. Later I read some of the Three Musketeers, was bored, and thought maybe Dumas had been a taste of adolescence. But the second time around, I found this story still a great read. Monte Cristo is not a study in psychology or culture: it is an amusement park ride before Disney, an Indiana Jones film in ink: a heck of a way to spend a rainy afternoon. (And make sure your plans for the evening are flexible.)The version I bought, Bantom, was too skinny, however. (Thus the missing star, also for typos.) Life is too short to read half of a masterpiece. Subvert the culture of instant gratification, and buy the unabridged version. Same goes for Hugo's Les Miserables, a similar bit of 19th Century French romanticism, even more rambling and magnificent in its un-cut version."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Required reading before my freshman year of high school, this masterpiece inspired a passion for reading that continues to this day. THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO should be read by every fourteen year old boy, and everyone else for that matter. Full of adventure, mystery, treasure, love, revenge, treachery, and intrigue, its 1,000 pages seem like 10. The tale is timeless, although early nineteenth century France adds a classical lustre and a a breathtaking romance. Read it. Please."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I really don't have much to say, but this book is so excellent, I had to say something. I was actually forced to read this for school once, and was expecting some boring crap-story from some french guy I'd never heard of. I was pleasantly surprised.From the beginning, the story is set up so the main character is at the point in life when things have gotten about the best than can get. Then everything goes to heck. Dumas reallly did an excellent job creating a twisting plot and real sympathy for the very much wronged main character. And this is one of the best books on revenge I've ever read.If you've never read the Count, then buy it, check it out, borrow it from a friend; whatever you do, make sure you read this masterpiece some time during your life."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"If you enjoy literature, then you must read The Count of Monte Cristo. In this book, a young sailor named Edmond Dant&egrave;s is arrested on false charges of treason. He spends the next fourteen years in prison trying to figure out how to exact complete revenge on his enemies. Once he gets out of prison he begins his quest for vengeance. The author, Alexandre Dumas, portrays this struggle for vengeance by mixing action and serenity together. By using both, Dumas makes the character seem like a real person. Throughout the entire book I felt like I knew Edmond Dant&egrave;s feelings. Dumas' writing style made Edmond Dant&egrave;s come alive. Instead of being on the outside watching in, I felt like I was in the middle of all the action. By making the reader feel like a part of the book, Dumas gets the reader involved in the plot; this makes the reader not want to stop reading. The Count of Monte Cristo continually makes you think about the characters and the plot. As the reader, I observed a great battle of intellect between the main characters, and this strife makes the book enjoyable to read. You constantly wonder who will get the upper hand. This book, with its many levels, will make a reader lose him or her self in the book. I read the abridged edition, which sometimes made me feel like I had missed an important detail or event.

As for the comments that it's boring, well, Dumas is occasionally long winded, but the story is extremely clever all in all, and pretty much anybody can see a little bit of himself/herself in Edmond Dantes, or vice-versa."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"By all means read the long version. That way it doesn't end so fast, and you capture all that Dumas wrote. Believe me, this is one book you don't want to end. It is that good."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is a classic tale, and it would be hard to add much to other reviews. It is the story of Edmund Dantes, falsely accused and sent to prison. While in prison, he learns about a valuable treasure. Contriving to escape, he recovers the treasure and sets himself up with a new identity as a wealthy nobleman. While many people would have enjoyed their wealth, Edmund is obsessed with revenge against the people responsible for sending him to prison. He is willing to destroy not only those people, but also their families. Money can buy a lot, and he expends large amounts of his new found wealth on elaborate schemes to ruin the people. Down deep, he is actually not a nice person, and you do not want to get on his wrong side. He holds grudges and pays people back in spades."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"My husband has been wanting this book for a long time and when I gave to him he was so excited!

I have always enjoyed the Oxford Classics series, they're all really well done, especially for paperbacks, they're the top of the line for softcover books, them and Barnes and Noble :Dhappy reading!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"We all know this book is a classic. The plot is excellent and the character development is unlike almost anything else I have read (if not EVERYTHING else). As this book is a literary classic, I will compare the book mostly to the film version bearing the same name.I saw the movie at least 10 times before reading the book. I have to say, being a cultural elitist, that I enjoyed the plot of the movie better.SPOILER ALERT!!!At first I thought Danglars was completely left out of the movie and the antagonists (Danglars and Fernand) were combined in to a single person (Count Mondego). My wife later corrected me, as Danglars was in the movie. The problem then became that Danglars had such a small role it didn't make much of an impression on me. I actually APPRECIATE this Hollywood approach. Danglars and Fernand in the book are little weasels, but I have to say I didn't really \\"hate\\" them. They were just snivelers. The movie brings out the human emotion and thus the hatred of the single antagonist in a much more astonishing way.REAL SPOILER ALERT!!!The movie version is centered on the love story between Edmond and Mercedes. This is not the case in the book. Hollywood made Albert the son of Edmond...that isn't the case in the book either. It is thus hard to say which I prefer. In the book the Count at the end sails off in to the sunset (literally) with his Grecian Princess Haidee. In the book the family is reunited and finally happy. Either ending suits me. If Albert were truly the son of Edmond, the happy family approach wouldn't much work.The real awesomeness (if I may use that word) of the book is in its character development. I have to say I was wondering if there was a glitch with my Kindle when I was only 33% done with the book and Edmond has already attained the the treasure. I guessed after 2/3 of the book that the last 1/3 would be about Edmond reuniting with Mercedes...boy was I wrong! The character development was incredibly deep. If you have never read the book, but adore the movie...you should read the book.Be warned though....it is just about as long as the Bible, and pulls you in to the richness of Europe in the 1800's."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is, to me at least, Dumas' capstone work. While his other works are, without a doubt, amazing in their own rights, nothing can capture the amount of emotional connection and intrigue present in \\"The Count of Monte Cristo.\\" The translation found here is well-done (of course, you always have minor snags when reading a translated work), but it does not detract from the story.\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is the tale of a young sailor, well-loved by both family and the wider community. Jealousy, at the hands of a friend, causes this sailor to be imprisoned for a vast portion of his life. When he is able to escape due to an act of God, it would seem, the time has come to right the wrongs that have been afflicted upon him....What is present in \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" will no doubt make you become connected to Edmond Dontes, his lost fianc&eacute;e, and will make you wish for revenge on his behalf. Every detail in this plot is crucial, as Dumas writes with a beautifully complex, yet highly readable style. The prose is wonderful. Suspense is in high quantities at all points in this novel, as you are driven along the tragic path of Edmond Dontes' life and witness his attempt to ameliorate those wrongs done against him....is it karma, or is it divine providence, Dumas asks. That is left to you to decide...This is highly recommended, and for a free price, why not?"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Just started this book a week ago. Love it already.

I have also read other works by Dumas (namely the Muskateer trilogy) and, while I thoroughly enjoyed those, this is by far a better novel. This is a brilliant work, one that must have taken vast amounts of time to arrange beforehand. If you appreciate an excellent story, with many themes, action and events that (seemingly) have no holes or contradictions to each other, you will love this book. Do not be daunted by the length!!

I don't usually recommend books so highly, but this novel is more than just a &quot;classic&quot; your high school teacher would have you read simply because it's set in the Napoleonic era, it's a GOOD book. :)"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Do not short change yourself by watching a movie version of this classic,you'll miss too much!

Edmond is finally able to escape from prison after many years (I can't tell you how, read the book!) and is now able to seek revenge on those who have wronged him in the past. Now the fun part starts as Edmond begins to piece by piece ruin the lives of his enemies who have long forgotten that Edmond might still exist.

It's full of colorful dialect. It has just enough detail to give you a sense of what it would be like there, but not so much that it bores you. It goes through all the stages and emtions of human life and puts the important things of life into perspective. Many classics tend to be a little boring and hard to follow and understand, but Dumas puts excitement and life into his book which makes it easier to follow. The Count of Monte Cristo is not a book that is easily forgotten."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Well, as any person would first notice about this book, it's HUGE! Or, at least it looked that way. I found the random use of French words irritating and i think that if a book is going to be translated they should at least translate it all of the way. I understand that the French is supposed to make an impression on me, but i like to know what i'm reading about. I love the plot. I love being able to constantly have to remember people who have not been mentioned in around 400 pages and have to test my brain to keep the plot straight.

A love despised by her brother, Fernand, who seeks the beautiful Mercedes for his own bride, and the calculated hate of Danglar's, Edmond's rival for the position of Captain on the Phareon. A treacherous letter written by his enemies denouncing him as a Bonapartist thrusts Edmond into the hands of the law where the deputy pro curei, Villefort, decides to sentence Dantes to the Chat e tif, an island prison for political prisoners, to pursue his own ambitions. Thus begins the tale of love and hate for Edmond Dantes, the sailor, and subsequently, the Count of Monte Cristo's merciless revenge of his Imprisoners. Without out a doubt Alexandre Dumas has written one of the greatest romance stories of all time. Duma develops the most amazing plot that has many twists and turns. He immerses the reader into the anxious world of France, just after Napoleon's demise in 18414 to just before the second revolution of France, blending in the plight of the lower classes mixed feelings hate and acceptance of Louis the XVIII, and the constant fears of the aristocracy, whose every moment brims with the fear that Napoleon, the accursed, shall return from exile on the island of Elba. The reader walks through the winding streets of Marseilles and the dark and smelly dungeons of the Chat e tif, a tribute to the author's on site research. Dumas's writing beautifully blends the language of the rough spoken sailor with the eloquence of the elite with subtle humor and powerful soliloquies. I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to blaze through a classic story of love, hate, and revenge from one of France's greatest writers. I promise you will never stop turning the page to find out what happens next."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The review guidelines state that I can compare this book with others.

Dumas' style is years ahead of his contemporaries. But you wouldn't know this from reading the Modern Library edition because its poor translation gets in the way of both the story and the storytelling. The translator - who is not acknowledged (you won't find his or her name anywhere) - chooses words poorly, punctuates badly, and uses English words that while literally correct are either archaic or inappropriate in context. (For example, using the word \\"bullet\\" for \\"cannon ball.\\") Alexandre Dumas is well worth reading and I recommend the Count of Monte Cristo to everyone, but choose another version. Most Modern Library editions are exceptional; this one is an exception."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I purchased the Oxford Worlds Classics version of this book, amounting to over 1100 pages thinking I'd never finish this book. A friend told me how great the book was after the movie came out, and said unabridged was the only way to go. I figured I would give it a try, and I finished the book over a period of time.I was definitely surprised at how much the book kept me on my feet. I have not read many 1000+ page books, and this has to be my favorite. The story of Edmond Dantes' revenge on the people who imprisoned him is a true classic. One would figure that a man who has been locked away for 16 years for something he didn't do would come back with violent intentions, but Dantes does not. He keeps his cool, comes across a huge fortune and over time has truly obtained his revenge.A lot of death occurs in the book, but not by the hands of Dantes. Misfortune strikes each of the people who took everything from Dantes, and each time he reveals his identity to one of them, the suspense is very high. This book kept me on the edge of my seat for a long time, and I enjoyed every page of it.If you have the time to devote a few chapters of this book a day, by all means get it. It will remain a classic forever, and will hold a spot as one of the best pieces of French literature ever written."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the best books ever written, if not the best. It is a great piece of Literature written by the multitalented author, Alexandre Dumas. It is a thrilling and exciting adventure story of a young noble boy named Edmond Dantes. He was young honest sailor who had the privilege of directing the ship called the Pharaon after his captain died. He is then betrayed by two people he thought were his fiends, Monsieur Danglars and Fernand. Danglars was jealous of Edmond because he was the likely candidate to be the captain of the pharaon and Danglars wanted the job. Fernand was jealous that Mercedes was in love with Edmond. The public prosecutor M. de Villefort confiscated Edmond's only proof of innocence. The reason is that the evidence proved that de Villefort's father is a Bonapartist, which would put the prosecutor out of the favor of the court. Edmond was sentenced to life in the infamous dungeon, the Chateau d'If. There he makes friends with a priest. They develop a father, son friendship. He spends fourteen long, hard years in jail. He has a daring escape and finally leaves the oppressing dungeon. He then plans his revenge on his enemies. He joins a smuggler ship to protect his identity. He returns to his village, to find his father dead from hunger. He protects himself by changing his name to the Count of Monte Cristo, and travels to find his enemies with his new found fortune. He comes to find his lover Mercedes married to one of his enemies. The book is an action packed, never ending and very exciting. You will go on the greatest thrill ride of your life and it will not stop until you close the book. I enjoyed the book and I appreciated the author's hard work to write a fine piece of literature. It is an adventure story unlike any other, which involves a great deal of mystery. The use of one character in more than one role might be at first confusing, but it only adds to the drama of the story. The story is an intricate web of what the word vengeance really means. The plot is forever rolling and unraveling until the final resolution. You will be on your toes for most of the book and apprehensive to see what is yet to come. I greatly enjoyed the passion of the protagonist, to make his enemies feel the hurt and despair he went through. The plot is nicely developed to intrigue the minds of young adults and to make them think. The reader feels the joy of Edmond his sorrow is also felt.There are a few negative parts of the book. The length of the book may intimidate the reader at first and might deter them away from it. Edmond playing more than one character could also confuse you at first until you read more about the book. There was also the use of many different characters, which confused me as the story progressed. The positive aspect of the book was incalculable. The author's use of plot was very good and used wisely, this added to the quality of writing. I liked the book a lot and I would recommend it to anybody ages 13-up. This book makes you feel the magic of reading, so enjoy it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Of all the books I've ever read, this is one of my favorite. But all my good memories of it come from the first third of the book. Up until the end of chapter 30 I'd give the book five stars, but after that it's pretty long-winded and drawn out (And that's 87 more chapters!) . Furthermore I didn't even like any of the characters introduced after the first 30 chapters, except two I'll mention below, who were very minor characters.The first thirty chapters deal with Dantes being unjustly imprisoned and spending a miserable 14 years in the Chateau d'If. The story of his imprisonment, escape, and coming to riches and power culminates in his saving his old boss from financial ruin and suicide. It's a fantastic story but after that it's on to a long, drawn out, extremely wordy, and ultimately not-very-satisfying revenge on those who put him in prison. The main characters during these 87 chapters, aside from Dantes, his woman, and the four men who put him in prison are Haydee (the beautiful, but disturbingly reclusive Greek woman), Albert (the hotheaded son of Monte Cristo's old rival Fernand), Madame Danglars (the shrewish wife of Danglars), H&eacute;lose de Villefort (the one-dimensional murderer whose love for her child is her only emotion), Franz d'Epinay, (a nice guy, but forgettable), and a host of other forgettable characters. Finally, there are Valentine de Villefort and Maximilien Morrel: two annoying and sappy lovers who remind me exactly of Cosette and Marius from Les Miserables. If you liked those two you'll love the latter half of the book. I detested them and the latter half of the book gave them an unfortunately large amount of sappy-time.So that's the principle problem with the last 87 chapters: I don't like any of the characters. I wasn't even all that fond of Dant&egrave;s during this part. The only characters I even remotely liked were Ali, Monte Cristo's slave, and Noitier de Villefort, who talks by blinking. Everyone else is either annoying or forgettable. This means that the almost the entire last 87 chapters are dedicated to conversations among all these annoying or forgettable people, very little of which was interesting.Still, my memories are mostly fond. It's only when I put on my critic's hat that I began to realize how bored I was during the last two-thirds of the book. I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants a good long read. The abridged version would probably be better for the non-OCD type, as it'll cut out a lot of the superfluous stuff."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I like reading older books, and I like reading longer books, but this older longer book just seemed to drag on and on. The section describing the \\"drug trip\\" was particularly tedious. I did some reading about the book and apparently this was a popular sort of scene in the time period in which Dumas was writing. I was yawning through it.

If it's not exactly the #1 champion, it's sure among the front-runners. It's simply a sprawling, thrilling tale, which reaches out and touches most people right where they live: \\"Boy, if I had a million dollars, I'd show them!\\" \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" turns this theme into a sometimes savage, sometimes heart-breaking tale of the revenge of an innocent man wronged, but the theme can also be treated as high humor (\\"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\\") and surely is not unknown to music (see Madonna's \\"You'll See.\\")Anyway, I'm not going to even summarize the plot --- not even going to try.

After buying a Kindle, I started reading the story again. I couldn't put it down. It's such a page turner. It's unabridged. The translation is excellent (I compared with other versions). My only complain is this version doesn't come with a TOC, but it is also FREE. You can create your own Bookmarks and Notes."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is the best book i have ever read. It is a little long so its a good book for the summer unless you have alot of time on your hands bc once u start reading it u wont quit ;)"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I had seen the movie when it came out a few years ago and loved it. Recently I was inspired to start reading the book, which as books tend to be, is much more elaborate and entertaining than the movie was. I highly recommend this book, especially if you enjoyed the movie. Although I must say the plot line of the movie is not closely related to that of the book."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The rising action in the Count of Monte Cristo starts out with Edmond Dantes sailing into the Port of Marseilles, eager to meet his father and his dearly beloved Mercedes. Unbeknownst to him, there are some who are jealous of his successes in life, and seek to destroy him, namely Fernand Mondego, Caderousse, Baron Danglars, and Gerard de Villefort. Danglars, Caderousse and Fernand write a letter claiming that Edmond is a Bonapartist agent, and should be imprisoned immediately. Edmond is then unjustly imprisoned in Chateau d'If for life by Gerard de Villefort, the judge at his trial. In prison, Edmond meets Abbe Faria, the Mad Priest, and learns of the treasure on the isle of Monte Cristo. Edmond manages to escape prison and uncovers the great wealth hidden on the island. With his newfound wealth and power, he seeks revenge upon those who wronged him.\\"I wish to be Providence myself, for I feel that the most beautiful, noblest, most sublime thing in the world, is to recompense and punish.\\"-Edmond Dantes, the Count of Monte Cristo.The majority of the conflict in the book is Character vs. Character external. There is plenty of internal conflict however, as we note when Edmond no longer can say, \\"God is for and with me\\".This novel is exceptionally well written. The only problem with it is that there are many characters and its sort of hard to keep track of them all. However, I like how Edmond sneaks around and pretends to be so many different people, Lord Wilmore, the Count of Monte Cristo, Abbe Busoni, Sinbad the Sailor. I love how deep this book is also. Makes you think. Is it just to punish those who have wronged you? Is it ok for you to take the place of Providence and carry out your vengeance? The Bible says that vengeance is the LORD's, and that man shouldn't try to take matters into their own hands, like Monsieur Dantes did. Personally, I don't think Edmond should have executed his vengeance like he did, but then we wouldn't really have such an interesting book, now would we? I would definitely recommend this book to a friend."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I first read this in high school and have since then read it many more times. Dumas is a master plot creator, and this is his best. Nothing is harder to do, and more important, than the creation of an ingenious, original, complex plot. This is what holds all of the threads together, the characterizations, the motives, the scenes. Dumas is one of the world's greatest in this regard.Then, Dumas' simple, direct style impels the reader along from page to page. The result of the plot and his style is, as just about every reviewer remarks, a novel that one can't put down; if it were another 1500 pages, one still would want more!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. I wish I could read it again for the first time."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I'm reading this book for the second time. I first read it about 13 years ago and forgot some of the details. Since I love this book so much and forgot some of the details, I decided to read it again. I have read many classic and modern novels and this is my favorite. The free Kindle version is abridged and a lot of the free and purchased copies out there are. I started reading the free Kindle version and noticed I got to 4% complete pretty fast. This surprised me, as I remembered it being a very long book. I also felt like some intricacies were being left out. I then compared it to my paperback copy of this very edition (Penguin Classics, translated by Robin Buss), that I had read before, and noticed the free Kindle version to be abridged. A lot of the finer details are cut out of the abridged version. The Project Gutenberg version is abridged too.Some people may prefer the abridged version. It is shorter and the main plot is still intact. I am sure it is still entertaining and it will take less time to read. Others, like me, prefer to read the unabridged version for all the details, like the author intended. Some adult themes and subplots are missing in the abridged version. The book is a masterpiece and altering it is destroying a piece of art. At least you have a choice to which version you would rather read. I just want to inform you to be aware that many versions are abridged and not appropriately labeled so. The unabridged version is over 1,000 pages, small print. The Penguin Classics version, translated by Robin Buss, is the unabridged version.The plot involves a young and poor man, Edmond Dantes, who recently gets news of a big career promotion and promptly makes plans to marry a young woman he is infatuated with. She is infatuated with him too. Some jealous acquaintances scheme to ruin his recently found success, because doing so means success for them, instead. The scheming results in Edmond Dantes being imprisoned for many years and his love, thinking him dead, marries one of the scheming acquaintances. The other schemers profit by his misfortune too.Dantes escapes from prison, after many years, and comes upon a great fortune. The fortune makes him extremely wealthy. He is not very happy though and is not willing to just move on and live his live in lavish comfort. He wants revenge! It is the only thing he cares about. He uses his fortune and also a new well-rounded education to plot and execute revenge, methodically. Will vengeance ultimately be worth it or not? Will it finally make him happy? Read this book and find out!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book is about patience - not just in the sense of waiting but in the sense of tolerating the most awful life circumstances one could imagine upon oneself, until they ultimately make way for better times that are made sweeter by perspective. Although the book itself may be an exercise in patience (it is very long!) it is very much worth reading, entertaining throughout, and divided into \\"digestibly\\" sized chapters. Indeed, a two-hundred-year-old novel that has stood the test of time must be pretty good, right? It is."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book is absolutely amazing. Despite its length, which may scare some people away, if you read this cover to cover I swear you wll not be disappointed! The only reasn I give this our stars is because ther are a few issues regarding thekindle version. This can be sometimes distracting from the otherwise gripping novel!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is, in itself, a fantastic novel. This edition brings the story to English speakers in easily readable language, and given the brilliant simplicity of the words, I'm sure this translation stays true to Dumas's original French masterpiece. There are a few \\"Frenchisms,\\" such as the use of \\"quit\\" instead of \\"leave,\\" or \\"seek for\\" as an awkward substitute for the French \\"look for,\\" but these tiny inconsistencies don't take away from the text at all. I highly recommend this version of The Count of Monte Cristo to anyone!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The best book on revenge ever! This book I could read over and over again. I read it first in high school and 5 years later its still one of my favorites. I recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is an excellent edition of the book, it even includes a small timeline biography of Alexandre Dumas which was very insightful. Overall no complaints with this product at all."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I higly recommend this book. This book ropes you in from the beggining. This review may not be helpful, I just wanted to rate this a five. Read the book, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"All I can say is AMAZING. This novel is incredible. The subtle and deliciously wicked scenarios that Edmund Dantes orchestrates to exact his revenge on his enemies are awe-inspiring and SOOOO entertaining. Although the 2002 Jim Caviezel movie is a great stand-alone film, it reveals so little of the subplots and supporting characters that you can dive into the book as if it's a brand new story and it really doesn't ruin either one. Please keep in mind that it IS a 19th century novel, so you'll have to wade through some serious romantic protestations, but they do not take away from the action. Definately worth reading...and FREE on Kindle. Thank you Kindle!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The book is wonderful with number of different characters intertwined. The book is long, but once you get into the plot you really don't want to put it down. All the characters are unique and each is interesting in there own way."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"First, let me compliment the narrator. He did a wonderful job with the different accents of the various characters. It was truly a joy to listen to.I picked this up at a whim on a trip to the local library, not knowing the impact Dantes would have over me for the next two months. I found myself driving slow, taking the long way to my destination in order to listen to more of the book. Don't be alarmed by the largeness of the volume. It is a great story, easy to follow, and full of adventure. This is VERY different from the popular movie from a few years ago, so seeing the movie doesn't mean you know how the story goes or ends! Give it a shot and you will be very glad you did."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I have read this book once a year for about ten years, and it never gets old. A great story of revenge."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"alexandre dumas included love, vengance,action, and well thought out characters in to the triumphant tale of edmond dantes, latter to be come the awe-inspiring count of monte cristo."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I am one of those people who never got around to reading the book until after I had seen the new movie. When I finished the book-which I had been glued to and finished in one week- I felt like burning my DVD of the Count of Monte Cristo. The movie screen writers must have been mentally impaired to massacre the book as they did!I loved the way the book was always moving, it was never dull for a second. Many people seem to think that the book was too long and too complex with the many characters, but I thought that made it all the better. When it was over I was disappointed, not by the story, but by the fact that I was finished reading it. I have to admit being a little disappointed that Mercedes and Edmond don't end up together, and that Edmond and his friends end up separated, but really I was not expecting the book to end the way it did (again Hollywood's fault!) and so I was actually pleasantly surprised to be surprised. I don't think the book could have been any better than exactly as it is. The bottom line is that it is an excellent book, and I will no doubt read it several more times before tiring of it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"At first I saw the movie. Then I read the book. It was completely different. I was surprised how different and more exciting, more enjoyable the book is. However the novel has much more details of course, but the details make the book so interesting. This is the book you can't really put it down. When I was reading after chapter and chapter it became just more and more captivating.This is a genius story about revenge and betrayal. (But I have decided to buy the movie and add to my collection because the movie inspired me to read the book).I honestly recommend it to anyone looking for a good read."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I hope the reader will forgive me, but since other reviewers did a fine job of commenting on this wonderful story, I'd like to dwell more on this books author, the great Alexandre Dumas. The man is an incredible writer who, despite the length of some of his novels, is able to entice the reader on and on and when the story ends they put down the book wishing that there was more to read. The reader by the end is won over by the enduring characters, good, bad, and in between, by the intricate and exciting plot, and by the wonderful wit of the author who is almost another character himself because of the flair of his writing.All I can say is that if you are the type of reader who can be scared off by the length of a novel, you should realize that Dumas' books usually move along at a wonderful pace and that everything in them is essential reading, and everything cut out of the abridged editions is a loss to the reader.So that being said I recommend The Count of Monte Cristo very highly, and recommend also that if you choose to read it that you are sure to get an unabridged copy. To cut out parts of this wonderful story is a crime, and a needless one considering how wonderfully told this story is."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is one of the best books ever written. The characterizations are remarkable. Certainly a \\"must-have\\" for anyone who likes to read. It is a long book, but the richness of the text will more than compensate you for the time spent reading.The characters all comport themselves with a dignity and nobility that cannot be seen or portrayed by people of our time period. It is as though all of the characters have the distinction of Anthony Hopkins(and this still does not do it justice!). This work is a feast for the mind!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I just finished reading this book and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The emotions I felt while reading it were of varying degrees. There are many lessons to be learned in this book and the most profound is the revelation Dantes had in the end. I never imagined I would feel pity for those who so sorely wronged him, but the reader cannot help but feel that way. In the end, Edmond realized that he too, was not above this passion. That is why I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Not to mention the intricate web designed between all the characters. There was hardly a useless character.In short, I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good story with numerous lessons about human nature and its passions."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I had borrowed my friend's copy of this and I assured her that it's gonna take a long time before I could give it back and what do you know, I finished it 3 days!!!!Because the moment you start reading it you cannot put it down.The things he had been through is so unfair you can almost feel it that you wanted to strangle those people who did him wrong.There are some loopholes though in some of the situation but then it is fiction so Dumas has the liberty to do whatever he thought was best to give the story that edge. The movie is good but the book is better."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book was a summer reading assignment for ninth grade Pre-AP English I, and I expected naught but a monotonous, wordy, dusty &quot;classic.&quot; However, when I finally began to read, I was suddenly entranced by the well-woven plot. A variety of feelings are portrayed through the dialogue. The story was very adventurous, romantic and so highly unbelievable. I did not want it to end, and so I read it again immediately. I highly recommend this book, even to those who usually reject classics."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is one of my all time favorite novels by Alexandra Dumas, who is likewise one of my all time favorite authors. Although it is 1,400 pages long, it is an incredibly involving tale of adventure, suspense, intrigue, romance and revenge. If you have time to spare, reading The Count of Monte Cristo will be well worth your time."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The story is very captating, it taps into two of humanities' basic desires; revenge and power. Too many french words were left unexplained in the book, I assume that they were just copied from the original text. That is the only reason that the book was kept from attaining the ultimate goal of five stars. If you liked the Three Musketeers, you'll love this book"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I was first introduced to Edmund Dantes as a child (circa 1946)and was enthralled by the child's edition of this classic. Even the movies of the day told the story of The Count of Monte Cristo (abridged and with the &quot;typical Hollywood altered screenplay.&quot; The story has been a classic since its inception; but Robin Buss translates the French with aplomb clarity and poetry. He has made this magnificent novel in French a magnificent novel in English. Read it and enjoy. It is a masterful translation of a masterful story."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Betrayed and accused falsely on the eve of a marriage. Thrown into prision and percieved as dead. The hero is buried in a shroud, then returns with power and influence to exact righteous judgement with great riches and a healing balm for those on whom he chooses to show kindness.I'm ashamed to admit it took me 10 years to realize I had read a thinly veiled allegory of the Holy Bible. There are hundreds of ingeniously crafted points of contact that only someone who has studied the Scriptures is likely to spot, after having it pointed out. It even goes so far as to express Dumont's dispensationalism and perhaps a little bit of anglo-israelism.Like all allegory it breaks down, of course, but then that's the nature of the thing.Public schools would have an absolute fit if they had the religious background to see the clever work for what it is.The Count is a must read, and would highly recomend you read the Bible thru to see the full extent of Dumont's ability to tie the works together."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is, without a doubt, the most masterful piece of storytelling to ever have been written. Alexandre Dumas paints a canvas of characters that are larger-than-life, with motives such as revenge, deceit, greed, lust, vindictiveness, and a sense of justice propelling them. This book has everything!If you are looking for an epic adventure, then this is the ultimate book for you.This book has been my favorite novel since I was required to read it in 9th grade English class. Over the years I have visited and revisited it, and have yet to grow tired of it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo stands alone as Dumas' best work. His character development and innovative storyline should be used as a model for fiction writing. A lengthy read to be sure, but worth every page.Among the classics, this is one of the greats. Additionally, this edition is surprisingly well-done and isn't sloppy and riddled with errors like some free ebooks.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"half way thru. a great read and a joy to read on kindle. there were a couple of times that I wondered if there were sections missing."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"its a great story no problems but i wish it had table of contents but for FREE cant beat it"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"It's the perfect length and the book looks beautiful. The hardcover and the book mark strap are great. This book was in beautiful condition and an excellent read! You definitely should buy this as opposed to the full version because it cuts out a lot of the repetition that Alexandre Dumas seems to do. Great book!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"An extremely engaging story. I am only disappointed that I had not read this earlier in my life.

I had a hard time putting it down whether it was time to get to sleep or get off the bus after my commute."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This review applies only to the 2002 Modern Library Classics edition of the book. I read the book partly online but mostly as this paperback. At the very end there is, in this paperback edition, a very important section missing. It's in chapter 113. Right after Dantes takes his leave of Mercedes, and before he meets Morrel in the cemetery, the online version includes what must be several pages where Dantes returns to the Chateau d'If. Inexplicably, the whole episode is missing in this paperback edition."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I have had the pleasure of reading one of the greatest novels of all time, and the displeasure of seeing one of the worst movies. Both were The Count of Monte Cristo. If you've never had the pleasure of reading the book, I urge you, read it. But at all costs, stay away from the movie. Don't even watch it on cable for free. If you want to read an enriching tale, read The Count of Monte Cristo. It will not disapoint!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"WARNING: May include \\"spoilers\\".\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is the most extraordinary book I have ever read.The first aspect that makes it so interesting is its variety. \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is usually described as an action-adventure novel about revenge. It is that, but it is also much, much more. It is a fantasy novel, a romance novel, a mystery novel, a horror novel, a comedy, and a social satire. There is something in this novel that will please nearly every reader.The second aspect of the novel that causes it to be so wonderful is the characters. There is, of course, first and foremost, Edmond Dantes, the Count of Monte Cristo. Dantes is an amazingly charismatic character. He is also incredibly complex, being at once a philanthropist and a sadist, a man who is remarkably intuitive about what motivates his enemies but who at the same time is frequently oblivious to the feelings of the people who he cares about. For example, he thinks that Haydee, a beautiful Greek-princess-turned-slave, loves him like a father. He's right about the love part, but not the \\"like a father\\" part. In parts of the novel, he appears God-like, in others, he is compared, not entirely without justification, to the Devil. Edmond Dantes is fascinating.Then there are the secondary characters. The secondary characters in this novel are such that you can't help but wish that many of them had their own novel for which they could act as protagonist. There's Albert de Morcerf, Eugenie Danglars, and Haydee. Of the three, Haydee is my personal favourite. She is, initially, somewhat annoying due to her hyper-sensitive, cloying, and comedically melodramatic nature. Gradually, however, as the reader learns more about her tragic past, it becomes extremely easy to sympathize with her and care for her. She later demonstrates her inner strength when she aids in the ruination of Albert de Morcerf, one of the men who had betrayed Edmond. Both she and the Count have gone through similar experiences and are remarkably alike, which helps makes the novel's conclusion logical and rewarding.An additional aspect of the novel that makes it qualify as a classic are its themes and the way the novel presents those themes. Dumas pokes fun at the aristocracy, mocks the often contradictory social values of his day, and philosophizes about revenge, love, hate, and philosophy itself, among other things.Some readers have complained that the plot is too complex and confusing. I, for one, found that not being certain about what the Count's plans were made the novel all the more interesting. As well, some readers have said that too much of the plot relies on coincidence, luck, etc. True, some portions of the novel stretch believability, however, I did not find that this in any way damaged my enjoyment of the novel. The story is, in many ways, allegorical, as a result, the occasional implausible plot twist makes little difference in whether a reader enjoys the story or not.It's impossible to summerize what makes this novel so wonderful in a simple review. I strongly advise against reading the abridged version, because there's something worthwhile on every page of the full-length novel. \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is that rare specimen of a book that manages to be intellectually and emotionally satisfying, and, at the same time, is extremely fun to read."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I read this book for a high school book report in 1966. And I mean I read every page. When I started reading the book I had the feeling that I had bit off much more than I could chew. The book is over 1400 pages which would be a very large book for a 16 year old. I found that I could not put the book down. The writing and the intrigue of the manuscript was spell binding. I even read on the week ends and late into the night. I have forgotten much about the book but I am in the process of buying the book to read again now that I am 52 years old. If you want a spell binding, can not put it down, book to read - this is a strong candidate."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Never in my life have I read such an outstanding work as \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\". Alexandre Dumas is brilliant in bringing us an air tight story of a naive young man who is unjustly accused of aiding the Napoleanic uprising. He spends fourteen years in prison until he finally escapes, bent on revenge. Every single chapter was crucial--nothing was thrown in just because. All extra subplots had a reason for being there and were all excellently intertwined, as each furthered the main plot. Nothing is left to chance. That is master storytelling and that is what makes a book not just good, but oustanding! If you want a good, thick novel to curl up with, this is the one for you. You will not be disappointed. Highly readable and bursting with history."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book, The Count of Monte Cristo, is an engrossing tale of loyalty, revenge, and obsession that can still teach lessons today. Edmond Dantes seems set for life: the young man is now the captain of a ship, his best friends are his father and his boss, Morrel, and he is set to be married to a beautiful girl named Mercedes. But two men, Danglars and Fernand, are jealous of him for different reasons (Danglars for his job, Fernand for his fiancee). This jealousy comes in the form of a conspiracy so that both will be benefited: a letter is written saying that Dantes is a Napoleonic agent (he is not). He is further crossed by the ambitious magistrate de Villefort, who destroys the only piece of evidence because it implicates his father and sends him to prison, using the Napoleonic phobia of the time. While there, he meets the brilliant yet enigmatic Abbe Faria, who teaches him several languages and they collaborate on how to escape. The Abbe has an attack, he tells Dantes to leave without him, so he does. But before the Abbe dies, he tells Dantes about the magnificent treasure of Monte Cristo, and then the adventure begins as Dantes gets the treasure and lives extravagantly for a while, then he comes to pay vengeance to his enemies and rewards to his friends. This book is quite long, but I could not imagine it being shorter: it is the perfect size for the story. This is one of the best books of all time for a reason, and I would highly recommend it to anybody interested in adventure."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"In the story, as written by Alexander Dumas, the reader is entraced into a world of peace, war, honor, nobility, piratery, prison, crimes, and most importatly their vengeance. Dumas' way of revenge and peace finding for the main character is superb and unparelleled. A MUST read for any literate adult or high school-college student."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Ever since I was in 9th grade I have read The Count of Monte Cristo every summer. I can't seem to start the next school year without reading it one more time. Each time I discover more about the characters and I relate to their struggles. I wish that I could give this book more that 5 stars because it is better than that. I have made all my roommates read this book. Each time they come back to me and thank me for making them read it. It is an excellent story of lost love, despair, and revenge. You will not be disappointed, I promise. You literally wont be able to put it down. If you have ever thought about reading this The Count of Monte Cristo now is your chance, trust me you will read it over and over. So sit back and relax because you are in for an epic adventure that will change the way you select the books you read."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I have read the Count of Monte Cristo about 4 times and have seen it on TV numerous times starting with Tyrone Powers as the leading man. I have never found it more exciting or more fun then I am with my Kindle. A great piece of literature made fun to read again and again."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Do not be dissuaded to read my review because it is a children's review; I do not have an amazon account. On a more relevant note, the Count of Monte Cristo is one of the best novels I have ever read. Period. I have always been an avid reader, and since high school I have been required to read rather tedious books, some from the same era as Dumas. However, the Count of Monte Cristo stands above the rest from its time; it is an amazing story, and to not read it due to its size is a terrible decision. In fact, the intricate, detailed, and entertaining plot of the book necessitates more pages to explain. This translation is superb. It keeps you awake, and it has a modern feel to it, as it should, all the while retaining the feel of the orginal transcript. One note I should make is as such: do not, and I repeat, DO NOT attempt to read this book over an extended period of time, as there are many characters and plot points you ought to remember throughout the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"If there's one thing I can't stand is when people liberally give out 5 stars on books; epecially when a book doesn't deserve it. I rarely give out 5 stars, so a book really has to \\"wow\\" me and go way over the bar. The Count of Monte Cristo is such a book. Dumas grabs your attention right from the beginning, and never lets go. There's not one boring moment, and I kept wondering: \\"What's going to happen next?!\\" It's incredible. Edmond Dante, a sucessful sailor, is promoted captain and is about to marry a beautiful girl, when two men, jealous of him, devise a way to get him out of the way of their own ambitions. Dante is imprisoned, ecapes, and vows revenge on them. This is only 3 of 200 books I read that deserve 5 stars, so I recommend it very highly."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Almost immediately in the story, Edmond Dantes, a poor 19th Century French sailor accused of a crime he did not commit, finds himself imprisoned for life in the infamous Chateau d'If. He might have died there were it not for a piece of good luck. He hears noise in an adjoining cell and digs his way to the sound, finding an old priest who tells him about a great fortune left undiscovered on the island of Monte Cristo in the Mediterranean Sea. The priest spends the next few years teaching the young, inexperienced sailor everything he knows about life and living and then dies. Dantes changes place with the dead priest, sewing himself into the winding sheet used to dispose of the priest's body. Dantes, not the priest, is thrown out of the Chateau into the sea where he is picked up by a passing vessel. He asks to be taken to the island of Monte Cristo where he discovers the fortune described by the priest. Dantes is reborn as the Count of Monte Cristo.All that I have mentioned is just prelude to one of the greatest stories of revenge ever writen. The reader is well advised to get the unabridged version of this novel and not be cheated out of any part of the Count's systematic and single minded pursuit of the men who betrayed him and sent him to prison.Many readers today will shy away from starting to read a book that lasts for over a thousand pages thinking that they might be bored with interminable pages of description and detail that add little to the development of the story. This concern is unjustified. The story always moves forward with a brisk pace and is entertaining on every page. Often we find ourselves astonished to have read so much at a single sitting. Hours pass like minutes as we accompany the Count on his mission of revenge.After years in prison Edmond Dantes has learned to be patient and the priest who taught him all he knows has given him a hope he thought was lost. &quot;Wait and hope&quot; are words which end this great adventure. The reader will not soon forget them."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I purchased the Scholastic version of the book so I could finish reading the novel (I had it on my PDA and lost my PDA). After finishing reading the Scholastic printing of the book, I found the book seemed to leave many unanswered questions, so I thought I would re-read it. It was then that I discovered that the scholastic publication is missing some of the chapters (though the included chapters are sequentially numbered). In fact, a person reading the Scholastic printing would never understand the most important act which caused Edmond Dantes so much grief, as that most important chapter, \\"the Conspiracy\\" is one of the omitted chapters. Thus, this printing is, in my humble opinion, worthless.The book, as a whole, is great, and I recommend the book (in its complete form) to anyone."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I know this seems a little over the top perhaps but Alexandre Dumas' The Count of Monte Christo is just that in my opinion. The scale, the depth, the characterisation, and ultimately the story underpinning it all- a tale of a virtuous young man, wrongly imprisoned, mentally and physically due to the jealousy of others, and his resurrection from the abyss as an avenging angel to exact his revenge on those who inspired it- add up to a breathtaking picture spanning 1200 or so pages. In Edmond Dantes, Dumas has created a character which deep down we can all identify with as our pure inner self. All of us can remember our childhood when everything was a lot more natural and bereft of worry. He is careful to highlight Dantes strengths and flaws early on in the novel, so as we can appreciate this person against who this terrible act has been aimed. His transgression from innocent, naive but virtuous boy into the cold blooded man of the world, is excellently handled, and fits with the gap of years between his escape from the chateau d'if until his re-appearance as the chameleon he has become. The way that the plot comes together shows the time Dumas must have spent creating the jigsaw, and the ending is everything you could want and more. I implore you to read this book- the length of the script will keep you busy for some time admittedly- but the end result and the fact you will be able to look back afterwards and remember its message for a long time, should make this top of your to-read list. And amazingly it was based on a true case."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is honestly one of the greatest novels I have ever read. I absolutely loved this book. I could not put it down! This is a must read for anyone.When I first started into this novel, I had in my memory the 'movie' that was made for the big screen. So of course, I expected the book to be very similar to it. Well, I was very wrong! Other than Edmond Dantes being betrayed by his 'friends' and finding the treasure, this book takes on a different route.Believe me, the book is much more superb. The way the Count exacts his revenge is astonishing. I cannot fathom how Dumas came up with such a scheme. At times, one cringes for the those who wronged the Count.This book made me laugh and cry. There are many poignant moments throughout the book that make you feel good. Anyone who says that Dumas is not up there with the 'classic' writers, does not know what they are talking about. This book is rich in dialogue, mystery, suspense and storyline. All in all, this is an amazing classic, and I recommend it to anyone wanting a good read."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"A piece of something lost. An elegance and order that is no longer available to this generation. That is what the Count of Monte Cristo takes us back to. As you follow Edmond Dant&eacute;s, a young and enterprising French fisherman, through a remarkable journey of long and torturous suffering and carefully wrought revenge you will soon gain a new definition of romance and adventure.The book starts it's story in early 19th century France in a small fishing village called Marseilles, where we first meet youthful Edmond Dant&eacute;s who is engaged to the most beautiful woman of his village and is soon to be the captain of his own vessel. Though ignorant and nave, he is beloved by all who know him and has amassed a great deal of friends, however, one with such good fortune also amasses many enemies. Through a series of events plotted by Fernand, who desperately covets Edmond's betrothed, Mercedes, and Danglars, a fellow sailor jealous of Edmond's new promotion to captain, Dant&eacute;s finds himself in prison for a crime he did not commit. Still ignorant of the scheme that put him in prison, or the plotters who ruined his life, Edmond waits in prison. This changes, however, when he meets his cellmate, Faria, an ancient abb&eacute; who is considered mad. This \\"mad\\" abb&eacute; will reveal an amazing secret to Edmond that will change the course of his fate forever, and hope is finally in his view. Dant&eacute;s emerges out of prison changed and worn cynical by a long and terrible imprisonment of 16 years. Though he assumes many identities, he gradually adopts the identity as the Count of Monte Cristo, an immensely wealthy and indifferent nobleman as he returns to Marseilles to wreck his much-thought over revenge individually on his plotters. His last words as the former Edmond Dant&eacute;s after he rewards one of his loyal friends are:\\"And now,\\" said the unknown (Edmond) \\"farewell kindness, humanity, and gratitude! Farewell to all the feelings that expand the heart! I have been Heaven's substitute to recompense the good -now the God of Vengeance yields to me his power to punish the wicked!\\" At these words he gave a signal, and, as if only awaiting this signal, the yacht instantly put out to sea.-The Count of Monte CristoHowever, Edmond cannot remain under the cover of the illustrious Count of Monte Cristo forever, and he will soon find that a heart even so indifferent and cold as his own cannot remain lifeless for long. This is an amazing novel of suspense, romance and betrayal. Alexandre Dumas weaves many stories into one enthrallingly suspenseful and complex story of love, hate, betrayal and loyalty. This book has no equal and I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates classic and elegant, while exciting and adventurous, literature."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"First off, if your copy of The Count of Monte Cristo is only 350 pages long, throw it out and get this one. As far as I can tell this is the only unabridged translation currently available in the U.S., and the others abridge, oh, 75% of the book. I think that's usually called Cliff Notes.This 800 pound, 1100 page gorilla is a marvel of perpetual storytelling, a spellbinding page-turner despite its length, a plot so complicated one senses even the author had only a tenuous grasp upon it, and Dumas' prose style, the elegance of which might charitably be compared to King or Lovecraft.Doesn't matter -- 150 years on the culture's archetypal revenge drama still kicks like nobody's business. The initial betrayal of Edouard Dantes, his politically expedient persecution at the hands of an unscrupulous prosecutor, and his imprisonment in and escape from the Chateau D'If are the bits we recall from a dozen films, rip-offs, cartoons. But that's just the first 300 pages.Then comes the dazzling if at first puzzling stop-off for Carnival in Rome, where Dumas puts his predilication for stories within stories to spectacular use, and then Paris, where the bulk of the novel turns on The Count of Monte Cristo's mind-bogglingly complex plot to avenge himself against the four principals of his ruin.Does the plot hinge on one unlikely coincidence after another? Does the writing turn ludicrously purple? Can anyone, including Dumas, keep track of all these characters?Again, it just doesn't matter. This locomotive of pure story won't be denied. The pages fly by, leading to a conclusion of suprising power. The Count of Monte Cristo is considered to be one of the first \\"popular\\" novels ever written -- it remains one of the best. If only our current popular novelists could work such magic."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I admit, I was motivated to read the book because I saw the movie first. I don't know how I escaped both high school and college without reading this one, but I regret not having found it sooner. The movie, though enjoyable on its own, shares only one thing in common with the book: its title. Everything else has been inexplicably altered.There is sooo much more to the story. Here is a man, who, unfairly convicted and imprisoned for 14 years, has everything good in his life taken from him. He cunningly escapes prison, finds immense wealth, and spends the next 10 years plotting vengeance on those who took his former life away from him. He studies his enemies and, one by one, brings about their downfall and destruction by exploiting their vices. He also finds cause to reward those who did not betray him, and who lived irreproachable lives of unrewarded nobleness.The writing is enthralling and fast-paced. It is a fascinating story, well-told and impassioned. I wouldn't limit it to any specific audience, like juveniles or only those who know they like adventure stories ~ I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The characters in this book are so Shakespearian. They're all larger than life. We're not dealing with post-modern self-doubting everymen stumbling through life, these are extreme characters in extreme circumstances: it's not too often you're going to pause and say, \\"Hmmm, I know exactly how he feels.\\" Likewise the plot, action, and devices. It's all around a quest for revenge (or is it justice?), there are crucial letters, poisonings, star-crossed lovers' trysts, courtroom performances, disguises, last minute averted bankruptcy, and, for goodness sake, yet another of these meddlesome priests with their cunning plans to fake a death with an ingenious potion. We have dozens of prose soliloquies, characters turning over their plans, doubts and motivations, and wonderful extended dialogue, with people talking with a depth and precision mere mortals could never hope to improvise (even if there aren't as many killer one-liners in there).And while I'm making big comparisons why not throw in Tolkien: Dumas too has pulled off an epic. I can't think of many other books of this size that maintain such coherency. Now they do it in different ways, and Dumas teeters on the edge in a couple of places (while Tolkien is sublimely on track the whole time - he simply needed that many words to tell his story), but they both still manage to bring so much to a basic central story line. Most epics climax in book one, then have weak sequels added on once the publishers realise they have a hit. Most unsuccessfully try to reopen the old story and climb back in to a structure that will not fit them, and only undermine the superior complete original (Card, Jordan, Feist). Some series avoid this mistake by telling a new story within the old world (Pratchett, Leiber, Saberhagen), but this isn't making an epic. In the Mars series, Robinson gave himself freedom to continue because no character is indispensable, the future is open.But Dumas! Like I said, in a couple of places he's on the brink, but doesn't quite fall over. We wonder why we spend quite so much time with Franz - who turns out to be quite incidental - but in Dumas' defence, to meet Edmond reinvented as the Count through Franz' eyes is an intriguing and clever way to introduce him. Indeed, the book could almost have started here (and the second part does feel like an entirely new book for some time), but, like Tolkien, rather than leap in with the \`main' story, Dumas patiently and painstakingly has to paint the whole history before we get there. But while Tolkien splits up the major characters and has us desperately turning pages as he leaves each in cliff-hanger situations, Dumas has the slowest of slow burns running through the whole book. You don't have to read it all in a sitting, and as the protagonist points out, a simple and quick revenge would not be just or satisfying. So he takes his sweet time. Along the way some of the time he spends to flesh out the characters of the sons and daughters of the subjects of the Count's patient and comprehensive revenge seems liberal, but I suppose Dumas could say with his Count, \`What's your hurry?'And to carry you along you have this wonderfully sophisticated French high society. Being cool - or being honourable - is not only about ego and looking good, it has a major effect on your whole family's prospects. Make a fool of yourself in public, and you could lose your credibility - which could also cost you your house or your life. How you're presented, who presents you, and how you carry it off is a game with big stakes. There was an excellent SBS movie that caught something of this - about a relatively low income 19th Century noble who actually cares for the people on his land, and knows the only way to save them is to get them clean water. To afford this he needs the court's patronage - and the favour of the court has nothing to do with the needs of the poor, and everything to do with whether you are seen as having a lively wit. The decent noble has to play the dirtiest games to do good. It's in this sort of Dangerous Liaisons context that much of the drama takes place, and Dumas does it well (indeed he's probably the prototype).Moreover his count is a real triumph. He imagined the pinnacle of 19th Century cool and painted it. Moreover he gives us the whole process of just why this guy has got it so completely together. He's Shaft, James Bond, Miles Davis ... whoever ... you just can't touch him. So when the reader gets to see someone getting a bit close to his self-possession it has a real impact.When we do eventually get to the resolutions of the old wounds, they are powerful and satisfying. I said this is Shakespearian, and there's no pulling punches here - the crimes are terrible, the prices paid apposite, and both are vividly and minutely explored. Hence the massive length of the book - but this epic, unlike so many others, is coherent.And all this without even mentioning the fascinating central philosophical issue of just who the Count thinks he is to take charge of so many lives. Is he, as he contends, merely the agent of providence? But the way he treats those he cares for seems at times more cruel than the way he treats his foes! The torture he puts Morrel through can only be compared to God calling Abraham to sacrifice his son. Monte Cristo is unapologetically taking the role of God, and his justification is that:...There is neither happiness nor grief in the world; there is only the comparison of one state with another - nothing more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness...It's a tough one to try to pull off. Did he manage it? Let the discussions commence."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I love the Count of Monte Cristo, but I'm about a quarter of the way through and I feel like little pieces are being left out of the story from what I remember it to be. My memory could be wrong, so can anyone confirm if this is the unabridged version. Guess you can't beat the price though."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"If you're reading Dumas for the prose and the style of writing, the words \\"abridgement\\" tell you everything you need to know: this isn't the edition you want. Unfortunately, even if you're reading Dumas for the story, this /still/ isn't the edition you want. While there have been good abridgements -- the Signet Classic springs to mind as being relatively inoffensive -- this is not one of them; it butchers the story to such an extent that anyone who doesn't already know the tale is likely to come away with the impression that Dumas was a scatterbrained idiot who couldn't be bothered to keep track of what was happening in his own work.There is so much in Dumas that /can/ be sliced out without harming the integrity of the story that it's hard to see why the abridgers resorted to the measures they did. Whole subplots and, worse, parts of subplots are left on the proverbial cutting-room floor in apparent ignorance of the tangled mess this creates. Some of the decisions on what to keep and what to cut seem to have been made by throwing dice or flipping coins -- what possible train of thought could have led to the excising of climactic scenes of Monte Cristo's revenge on his tormentors so as to retain the chapter where Haydee recounts in vivid detail a story that's told later on in the book anyway?This edition is closely associated with the film version starring Antonio Banderas (who appears on the cover), and perhaps the edits to the text are made to keep it in step with the movie -- a bad choice, if so. While there is a (somewhat) coherent story left standing after the abridger has had his say, it hardly does justice to Dumas' original.Overall, a very, very disappointing edition. Even badly edited Dumas is better than no Dumas at all, so I can't in good conscience award it zero stars, but anyone interested in the Count's story -- whether via the movie, Dumas' other works, or recommendation, is strongly urged to consider another printing rather than purchasing this one. It's a fantastic adventure story -- I would rate better versions at four or five stars -- let down by sloppy abridgement."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Simply put, I love this book.

But if you're gonna read this story, I believe only the full length version will give you the scope of Dumas' writing. having a little knowledge of French is a help with this as there are many references in his vernacular.

Dumas's genius shows as he intertwines characters and twists and turns through out the entire book. Definetly the best book ever!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book kept me up till 4 am many nights. You will not be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is a good edition in English of a wonderful reading experience, which I looked over in a store. Is there anything new in it? No. But it is inexpensive and fairly well translated, tho nothing compares to Dumas pere's astonishing detail and clarity in the original language. Alas, it is abridged, which is dumbing it down in my opinion.This massive book has all the hallmarks of what you would expect in a classic: intriguing characters with great psychological depth as they evolve over a long period of time, an extraordinarily intricate plot of adventure and transformation, and moral lessons along with rich ironies. So long as you embrace the complexity and can live in another world, the full version is utterly rivetting to read.Everyone knows the plot in outline. A gifted and yet simple sailor, Dantes, is the victim of a conspiracy involving thwarted love, greed, and unbridled ambition. By eliminating him, three men get what they want and move brilliantly into the rapidly changing and corrupt French society of the Restoration. They forget Dantes, who is isolated in despair in a notorious political dungeon, the Chateau d'If. While in prison, he meets an Italian savant who tunnels into his room and who teaches him the entire pantheon of classical knowledge, which he memorised as a tutor to princes; he also harbors a secret about an immense treasure on the island of Monte Cristo. Dantes escapes, finds the treasaure, and sets about creating an elaborate series of traps to wreak vengence on the three men who condemned him. This occurs in about the 1st 250 pages of the book (unabridged version). At this point, after doing some good for a family that had tried to help him, Dantes' interior dialogue - so vivid as he figures out who betrayed him and learns to hate them while learning the love the Italian savant as a 2nd father - becomes silent to the reader. What Dantes then does is insinuate himelf into French high society, creating relationships with the 3 men and their families with a cunning that can only be called genius. This takes place over about 700 pages and is an indictment of the society that Dumas despised. Though the Count is falling in love, his hatred is so implacable and cold as to render him an automaton of vengence. Then, in the last 3rd of the book as the train of destruction he created is set in motion, Dantes is again reborn as a man who can feel and reflect on what he has done. It is a moving apotheosis of redemption and regret.What is so amazing about the story is that, as outlandish as some of the plot twists and coincidences are, the reader is (or at least I was) swept into a fast-moving narrative that is irresistably readable. In doing so, Dumas helped to spawn an entirely new genre of novel: the psychological thriller, or adventure that provokes reflection and awe. Its depth and ambition are beyond the simple swashbuckler. Its world is complete in sumptuous and realistic detail while remaining too fantastic to believe. Its characters are so complex and yet such romantic ideals as they evolve. Moreover, there are also a number of symbols throughout the book, evoking Christian and pagan themes, so that the book can be interpreted on a number of levels if that isyour bag.This is one of the best novels I ever read and certainly Dumas' best. Though it took me an entire summer to get through it in the original, I will never forget it. For those of you who read French, Dumas' language is stunningly clear and graceful, while using a vocabulary that is easily accessible, so why domb it down?Highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I LOVE this book, therefore I was sorely dissapointed to discover that this is an abridged version and the amazon page did not indicate this at the time of my purchase (3/07)!!

Accused of treason, he is betrayed by those close.

For anyone who is looking for a novel that combines romance with high adventure will find this a highly satisfying book. The story is set in 19th century France. The storyline concerns a young man named Edmond Dantes who has his whole life ahead of him. After being promoted to ship captain, he makes plans to marry the love of his life, Mercedes. He is suddenly betrayed by three jealous rivals and arrested on the eve of his wedding, being unjustly and falsely accused of treason. He is transported to an island fortress prison where he remains in confinement for fourteen years. Dante's dying cellmate reveals to him that there is a vast, hidden treasure buried on the island of Monte Cristo. Edmond promises to escape the dungeon and seek out the treasure. After orchestrating a narrow escape, Dantes finally discovers the vast fortune on Monte Cristo. Edmond Dantes becomes the Count of Monte Cristo and returns to Paris to seek out the one he loves and also to use his new fortune to seek out revenge on his betrayors.

Throughout this story I am constantly amazed at the insight into human emotion, pain, intricacy and joy that Alexander Dumas had. The story fills your head with another time and place- it takes you there. You hurt for the Count, begin to understand his thinking and are with him as he incredibly takes revenge on the men of his past and their families by becoming one of them, and later begins to see that vengence is, in fact, not his alone. As he begins to desire peace once again, he begins to feel again...and to weep for the love lost. This book is more than amazing - it is an experience that has put into me considerations and dreams that move me still - long after I have finished looking at its pages. The invitation? ...Come and ache and love and hate and hurt and grow and LIVE! Go to another time, another place that will effect and move you, and perhaps change you, here and now.

For years I had a vague recollection of The Count of Monte Cristo as some required reading, a tale of a man wronged and his ensuing adventure as he attempted to take his revenge and right the wrongs done to him. As a child, I knew nothing of the foreign origins of some books and the process of translation to make them accessible to me nor of the concept of abridging a document from the original form as written to a presumably more digestible, shrunken version better suited to those with shorter spans of attention or time constraints.The story, to be painfully brief: This is the story of Edmund Dantes, a man of bright prospects and on the verge of wedding the beautiful Mercedes. Betrayed by envious friends, Edmund finds himself spirited away to a prison island. Despondent and having given up all hope of his release and of a reunion with the love of his life, he resigns himself. While in the depths of despair, he meets an eclectic and learned fellow inmate. They immediately bond and Edmund's newfound friend becomes as a father to him and proceeds to teach him all that he knows: languages, culture... and of a mind-boggling buried treasure. Edmund manages to escape the island prison years later and makes his way to the island of the buried treasure, not really expecting to find it. What he finds is treasure so vast as to make a king blush. Newly wealthy, learned, and free, Edmund assumes the identity of the mysterious Count of Monte Cristo and sets in motion the machinery of revenge...I returned to this book as an adult to satisfy my own curiosity and to add flesh to my memory of the adventures of Edmund Dantes that were admittedly skeletal. Because of my previous experience, I was expecting the same stilted, simple read I remembered, a children's book. Initially I was shocked, having done some research to lead me to this particular translation, to find over 1,200 pages of text. That rivals the intimidating girth of my copy of War and Peace. I took the plunge, though I also committed myself to dropping the project once it became apparent that I'd never make it to the end. I needn't have worried. To my amazement and pleasure, I found a tale of adventure of epic proportion replete with revenge, murder, love and loss, in the best tradition of operatic drama. For those of you who love to read and shy away from this because you think you've already read it or that it is only for children... trust me: you haven't, and it's not.This review is for the particular version translated by Robin Buss. This is an excellent and modern translation, executed with an academic's eye for accuracy but the flow and readability of a novelist. Anyone who has compared different translations of novels knows how vastly different the two readings can be. It is not just a matter of age, either, where modern readers can stumble over words or stylistic cues that one may consider archaic. It has more to do with the translator's understanding of the intent of the author, of the subtleties of style, of context, both historical and within the story itself. The Buss translation is, in my opinion, THE translation to read. The beauty of it is that the translation does not get in the way, it is invisible. It is the author Dumas one hears, not the translator Buss, and that is the brilliance of this translation. As a bonus, there are fully thirty pages of notes on the text at the back which I found illuminating and useful.But 1,200 pages, you say? Don't have time, you say? I was so thoroughly sucked into this tale of revenge and adventure I completely lost track of time. By the time I finished I felt only that it was far, far too short. I suppose it has to be so that, as a child, I was offered only the abridged version; I would never have put up with a book as long as this one. As an adult who loves to read and appreciate, however, I will be forever grateful to have been let back to this rich, amazing tale at full strength. I recall turning pages by the hundreds, fully engrossed; the lawn mowing would have to wait until next weekend...Make no mistake, while reading this unabridged version will evoke in you a child's excitement and sense of adventure, this is a book for adults to appreciate. Read it, enjoy it, get lost in it. Unequivocally recommended at five stars."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"this book is one of my favorites. once you get to the action, you simply cant put it down. it is filled with something for everyone: betrayal, action, murder, romance, and even a little mystery."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I can't tell you the number of times that I have read The Count of Monte Cristo. I have studied several translations and many abridgments. Although nothing is a truly adequate substitution for the unabridged version, this the by far the best that I have read. The story flows nicely, and unlike some abridgments, there is not the feeling of having missed something. The major details and plot lines are all present, and the characters are as genuine as in the unabridged versions. I would highly recommend this abridgment over the others on the market."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I am not a type of person who reads 'classics' because I want to understand and appreciate fine literature. I have no intention of broadening my literary, historical or philosophical knowledge to impress other people so here is a review from a guy who just happen to read it because this book was on sale for $1 at the local library clearance.I read a lot. Most of books I read are popular paperbacks I see on best seller list. One day I was at the library and saw this thick book for a $1 and I thought I would give it a try. Even if I don't like it, I am out of a $1 so no big deal. I won't bore you with the story or the translation because that's not why you are reading these reviews on Amazon website. You are looking for a reason to pick up this yellowpage thick book that you already know the plot so allow me to give you several.Story in this book is not what you expect as it is much more detailed and insightful to the movies and young adult versions. Story is darker than what you expect so that's a good thing. Also, finding a good book about revenge is difficult enough so stick with a proven winner. Certain lines in this book adhere to your brain like it's been spread liberally with crazy glue. I sometimes write \\".. now the God of Vengeance yields to me his power to punish the wicked.\\" on my forearm whenever I have a business meeting with some jerk I cannot stand. Lines like this sticks to your head and it lingers like a noxious fart in public toilet.Let me leave you with this. After I finished this book, I bought Les Miserables, Brothers Karamazov and David Copperfield because I finally understood why people are so high on some of these so called 'classics'."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is a wonderful edition of The Count of Monte Christo. It is abridged enough to eliminate the repetition that was in the story, written as a serial initially. Great story, and there is enough detail to get a tremendous feel for the times at the end of Napoleon's era. The bad guys get theirs in the end in spades. Wonderful tale"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Reading classic fiction entails a fascinating insight into human nature. So often, we're intimidated by the \\"classic\\" status of a book, assuming it's going to be long, dry and inaccessible. With some exceptions, what you typically find is the opposite; a book that is just as engaging today as the day it was written, something that strikes you as a piece of pop culture that has endured because it was done so well. It's a real testament to the idea that some elements of human nature transcend time and place, staying fresh across generations.So it is with the Count of Monte Cristo. Add its massive length to its classic status and you have a book that a lot of people might be hesitant to pick up. I implore you to abandon any hesitancy you may feel and read this book immediately. It is nothing more and nothing less than the ultimate tale of love, betrayal, revenge and redemption. You will find yourself wrapped up with the characters, shocked by revelations and uplifted by the care lavished on the tale by Dumas. It's really that good.This book is obviously the inspiration for many popular stories that have followed in its footsteps. The one I couldn't get out of my head was The Princess Bride, which boils the story down to some of its most critical plot points and then plays them for laughs quite well.Now, stop reading reviews, order the book and start reading it. You'll be thrilled that you did."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book is awesome and a great choice for anyone who enjoys classical literature. The language is clear and the plot flows smoothly throughout the whole book."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I stumbled through a couple of different translations and was only able to complete a seriously abridged version. This Barnes and Moble translation was a pleasure to read. I have recommended it to numerous students needing to actually read the book and they have all been pleased with the accuracy and readability of this translation."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This review is for the Abridged Puffin Classics version, ISBN: 0-140-37353-5.This version has been abridged not so much for adults as for young readers. It is now appropriate for ages 13-15, I would say, or for advanced ESL learners.The abridgment reads naturally and flows well. Extraneous plot elements that Robin Waterfield decided to leave out have been completely left out, meaning that, at least as far as I was able to detect, no vestigial traces of the original plot lingering about to confuse you.All the much-ballyhooed references to lesbianism and drugs in Dumas's original have, it need hardly be said, been deleted. Also, Dantes doesn't curse God so much in this one (in the dungeon scene, I mean)."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is a simply wonderful story that will easily keep you engaged through the entire 1,000+ pages. The setting is Europe, mostly France, in the early 1800s, and in addition to everything else, the book provides a little window into that time and place. The characters, especially the Count, are fascinating, if not realistic. I'm no literary critic, but the mixture of reality and fantasy reminded me a bit of magical realism. Finally, the writing style is both engaging and easy to read. There is a reason why this book has pleased readers of all ages for so long."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"When I first purchased The Count of Monte Cristo, I laughed to myself how long it was. Weighing in at a hefty 1200+ pages, the thickness was pretty intimidating. I thought it'd take me at least a month to finish.I ended up finishing the book in only a week and a half. What the other reviews say about this novel is true - you really won't want to put this down. Dumas may have written this book in the 19th century, but don't let time gone by deceive you - it reads like a modern day page turning thriller. Don't be surprised if you are emotionally invested in the characters and the story after only reading the first 4 or 5 Chapters. The plot is compelling, and it will keep you interested the entire time - not an easy task for a book this long.On the surface, this book is just plain entertaining. You'll have fun as you are reading. At its core, though, The Count of Monte Cristo presents insightful philosophies on human nature, revenge, and justice. It tackles intriguing questions and themes as it goes on. I think some of the more apparent ones are 'the limits of human justice' ... 'the saving power of forgiveness' ... and 'will those who are evil and selfish in the world be judged in the next life by some higher authority?'Dumas attempts to answer each of these questions with brooding, elegant passages and descriptions. Along the way, you'll meet interesting characters that you'll either really care about or genuinely despise. It was a bit tricky to keep track of all the characters and the relationships between them all, but eventually, things will lock in and you'll feel like you're a part of the story.It's a classic for a reason. Don't you want to find out why? Put this one on your list! The sprawling epic of Edmond Dantes is a spiritual journey, and it's one that is worth experiencing. It may change the way you feel about the tempting impulse to avenge, and push you towards the liberating power of mercy and forgiveness."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Edmond Dantes shows the true meaning of a superhero! Though he has no super powers, it is much more realistic than the comic MARVEL heroes such as \\"Spider Man\\" or \\"Hulk\\". He is taken away from his fiance\` to be thrown in prison for fourteen years after being falsely accused of Bonapartism during a time when Bonapart was exiled to the island of Elba.After fourteen years, however, Dantes escapes, with the help and wisdom of a supposed mad priest, and desires revenge on those who accused him of the crime. Over time, through love and wisdom, Dantes eventually finds that he not only needed to help his friends but he also needed to ask God to forgive him for possibly being vengeful.The characters are written with such emotion, the scenes with such detail, that one feels he is taking part in this cunningly written intense book. Alexandre Dumas has really done what others have not accomplished when writing such a carefully laid-out plot."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"It all begins at Marseilles on February 24, 1815. Nineteen-year-old Edmond Dant&eacute;s is a promising sailor. So promising, in fact, that he is about to be promoted to captain. He has saved up a fair amount of money and is about to make more with this promotion, enough to marry Mercedes, the love of his life. Young, vibrant, trusting and full of life, Dant&eacute;s couldn't be happier. And that is what causes his ultimate downfall. Envy, contempt and cowardice drive three men to wrongly accuse Dant&eacute;s of being a Bonapartist. For many years, Dant&eacute;s' only companions are a dungeon and a priest (fellow inmate). Dant&eacute;s has sworn revenge. The old priest and a small island called Monte Cristo will be the tools that help Dant&eacute;s become the Count of Monte Cristo, an avenging angel with a one-track mind. There are many twists throughout the novel.I read this book for the first time when I was sixteen. It had been a class assignment, and so I read it in automaton, not caring either way about the story. All I cared about was getting a decent grade on the quiz. Sixteen years later, I read it for the second time and... well, to say that I couldn't put this book down would be an understatement. The Count of Monte Cristo is a riveting tale full of history, suspense, romance and adventure. The backdrop of the Napoleonic era makes this book all the more palatable. Alexandre Dumas knew Napoleon and all of the political intrigue that went on during that era quite well. Even though I loved this book, there are some areas that threw me. Characters and storylines are thrown in without so much as an explanation at first. At times these occurrences felt like riddles or missing pieces to a puzzle I couldn't wait to complete. It all makes sense as the story progresses, of course, but it was nevertheless frustrating on some occasions. I don't know if the fault lies in Dumas' writing or in Lowell Bair's translation, or if the story had been intended to be narrated that way. In either case, it wasn't enough to keep me from enjoying the story. If you're new to Dumas, then this is the book to seek. It's one of the most popular classics for a good reason, after all!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"For the price, this is a great copy of the book, however, I think 'leather bound' is a little mis-leading. The leather is VERY thin, so it looks and feels more like a cloth-bound copy. The gold leaf and color is nice, the book is sturdy and the typeface is very readable and average size. The book is HUGE, about 4.5\\" thick. Definitely the unabridged version. I have noticed quite a few typos in just my casual reading, so I wonder how well this was proofed before going to print. Overall, for the price, I think it's a good deal."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I cannot add anything new to the adulations already written about the Robin Buss translation of my favorite all-time novel. It is the best translation of the best novel ever written. I've read four different versions so I feel qualified to make this claim. Remember, Dumas' plot was virtually ripped-off by General Lew Wallace as he formulated the plot for another great novel - Ben Hur.DO NOT BUY an unabridged version, it will ruin this veritable work of art for you. It would be like viewing the Sistine Chapel back wall and never seeing the ceiling.Now, there is a self-serving purpose to my review besides giving Buss props. When I visited Venice for the first time in 1999 I fell in love with the place. When I returned home, I looked, in vain, for a Monte Cristo-esque story set in Venice. It didn't exist. Sooooo . . . I wrote it. I have inserted the links to the two books in case you are interested in getting another Monte Cristo \\"fix\\" set in fifteenth-century Venice.

Yet for its time it's amazing how modern the novel still feels and one can see how it influenced other stories such as The Shawshank Redemption and Midnight Cowboy. Through these different themes are different narratives. There is the story of wronged imprisonment, a hunt for hidden treasure and a cunning and perfectly executed revenge scheme. All masterfully intertwined. The scenes in prison with Dantes and Abbe Faria are well paced and captivating. They do much to reveal the strong character and will of Dantes. It is after his escape from prison when he assumes the identity the count of Monte Cristo do we see just how resilient and capable Dantes is."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I haven't read a book in years.

Thanks"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I was familiar with the Count of Monte Cristo from the movie by the same name starring Jim Caviezel, and it used to be one of my favorite movies.... that is until I read the book. Now, not to say that the movie is not entertaining, but the breath and scope of this amazing book cannot be contained in a 90 minute movie. As a result of enjoying this book so immensely, I no longer enjoy watching the movie that much, but it is well worth it.I don't think I've ever read a book with so many different faces. The story has action, romance, friendships, enemies, betrayal, vengeance, redemption, comedy... everything you can think of is masterfully done in this book. Do not be daunted by its length, and definitely do not buy an abridged copy. This is the kind of book that will have you hooked in no time and before you know it you're closing the back cover; it's just that damn good."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Quite simply, one of the best novels of our time and one of my most favorites, hands down.From the moment that Dumas introduces us to the 18 year old tall slim and honest Edmond Dantes with his dark hair and black eyes sailing into Marseille, I entered his world not to quit a second before the very end was reached. In this complex plot with no less than 27 major characters and a dozen other minor ones, the author tests the strength of your memory and depth of your focus and you will still not stop reading the novel.For a while, my life was put on hold while the life of Edmond took over, occupying every fabric of my imagination. The beginning, the betrayal, the cursed fate, the shattered dreams, the agony and anguish of that innocent sweet soul in that dark dungeon for 14 harrowing years. How did Dumas have the heart to not only make up but also tell us such a cruel bitter tale? How could he make one single man endure so much agony?They say good writing entertains and great writing transforms. Ironically, the greatest sections of this book to me, difficult as they were to read, are during Edmond's captivity in Chateau d'If dungeon and during his relationship with Abbe Faria. Those passages are the most exquisite writing even if they recount the most agonizing period of Edmond's life. They were painfully difficult to read yet the unease lessened in knowing and anticipating the imminent revenge of Edmond.Today, I draw strength from the memory of Edmond's undying yet swaying hope in my most ordinary tasks and my humble difficulties. Perhaps, this is the definition of transformation on some level.I would read The Count of Monte Cristo again, if there weren't so many other amazing classics on my list. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, Monsieur Dumas, for this gift to the world."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"What a character was Alexandre Dumas (1802-1870). The half Creole native of France wrote hundreds of books. Among the immense number are several classics such as \\"The Three Musketeer: tales and The Count of Monte Cristo. Both of these epic workswere penned in 1844!The Count of Monte Cristo is Edmund Dantes a young sailor from Marseilles. The callow sailor is in love with the fetching Mercedes but tragedy strikes1 He is betrayed by three jealous friends who send him to a dark prison cell. Edmund becomes friendly with an old Italian abbe prisoner who educates him in literature, language and history. After 14 years in a cell Dantes escaps from prison. He becomes involved with a group of smugglers. Dantes becomes a millionare many times over when he locates the buried treasure on the isle of Monte Cristo. His deceased friend the abbe had told him where to find it.Monte Cristo then begins a long series of adventures helping his friends and wrecking exquiste revenge on his enemies. He somewhat fades from view.The action focuses on the lives and loves of several Parisian families who have either helped or hindered Monte Cristo in career. Monte Cristo has Christ like qualities and is a wonderful hero beloved by the heroic age in which the novel first saw light. Everyone who clams to be educated should read this tremendous classic which is very readable.Dumas is able to portray a world through the use of his powerful pen.The Modern Library edition contain 1462 pages of print large enough not to cause eye strain! It is a feat of strength to lug the behemoth around! There are no footnotes or illustrations. Dspite its great length The Count of Monte Cristo keeps your interes. It is one of the world's classics which demands reading and rereading throughout a lifetime!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Alexander Dumas proves in his novel The Count of Monte Cristo that he is definately one of the best litterary geniuses of all time. Dumas captures the imagination of his readers as he leads them through the life of Edmond Dantes. Through Dantes, Dumas relates to everyone who has ever wanted adventure, romance, and of course revenge. It seems as though Dantes is a real human. Dumas uses true tallent in the way he shows the feelings, thoughts, and actions of every character in his novel. This novel is long but never old. It captures the mind in a truly complex intertwined story of a poor young man accused of a crime he never committed. For this, his wonderful life is destroyed. He spends several years in prison. Upon his release he then uses his acquired knowledge to repay his enemies in a most interesting way. All of this leads to an ending that is as good as the rest of the story. This is truly a masterpiece worth reading. Everyone should read this novel. It's worth it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Just finished reading this classic novel again for the second time. I read it the first time over fifteen years ago and at that time I considered it to be my favorite novel ever. Since then, I have probably read close to a thousand books (which is about as many as Harriet Klausner reads in a month) in the past decade and a half, and I still have to put this one alone at the top. It's the best! Reading it a second time made me appreciate it even more.I have seen all of the movies that have been made from this incredible book. None of them have even come close to doing the novel justice. It is great to see that most of the Amazon reviewers concur! At the time I am writing this review, there have been 80 reviews of this book and it still is able to retain a five-star rating. That says a lot. Most of the classic novels that have been reviewed on Amazon have 4 and a half stars. However, not this one!A lot of novels (particularly ones that are considered classics) take a while for the reader to really get into them. Not this one folks. From the first chapter on, the novel takes hold of you and just never lets go. Believe me, once you start reading this it's almost impossible to stop. You don't want to sleep, you don't want to eat, you don't want to talk to anyone, etc... all you want to do is continue reading on about the life story of our hero Edmund Dantes. The book may look a bit long, but believe me, you will be wishing that it was a hec of a lot longer once you are finished with it.So order this now and I promise you won't be disappointed. It's a masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Just a quick review on one or two technical details that someone might want to know who already knows what a great classic story this is. Why this translation? Why kindle if I have to read it from start to finish every time? I'm glad you asked.Pretend I've already gushed about how wonderful the book is, Dumas is, and all that. Now, let's get down to business. I first read the \\"unabridged\\" version published by Modern Library back in the mid 1990s. I thought it was unabridged because it was so long and nothing seemed to be left out: subplots, dialogue, characters, etc. What I didn't know until the Robin Buss translation came to my attention years later was that I had been reading the Victorian version of the novel. One that ranks right up there with Constance Garnett's translations of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky (avoid them if you don't want \\"watered-down\\" versions.) The point is they left out the more \\"adult\\" things that would have put off or shocked Victorian readers back then. They also side-stepped language idioms to avoid confusion.Ten years ago when I was shopping for a replacement translation, I used a little litmus test on evey copy I picked up to see what the translator did in a certain scene. It's the beginning of chapter 49 or 50 (depending on which edition you have) titled \\"HAYDEE\\" or \\"HAIDEE,\\" in which the Count enters the quarters of his slave Haydee and she asks him why did he ask for permission to enter her room rather than just come in. He says something like, \\"Haydee, you know,\\" or \\"Haydee, you well know.\\" To which she responds (in the ML edition), \\"Why do you address me so coldly, so distantly?\\" ...WHAT?!For someone like myself who had never read the original French editon this came off as a bizarre thing to say. It's like: Babe! He's only said three or four words to you since he entered the room- what are you talking about? But then I discovered the Robin Buss translation and he explains that like many romance languages there is a formal and an informal way of saying \\"you\\" to someone. In Spanish it's \\"tu\\" vs. \\"usted.\\" In French it's \\"tu\\" vs. \\"vous.\\" So in the original novel Monte Cristo responds with the formal word \\"vous\\" which causes her to question him. However, since in English there is only one version of \\"you\\" for any situation, it wouldn't make sense for her to ask, \\"Why do you not say 'tu' to me as usual?\\" Robin Buss corrects this and I am thankful for it.Finally, to address the practical problem of this version not having mobi-like chapter navigation or access. This does stink. If you're like me and sometimes enjoy rereading a book out of order because you like to revisit favorite parts, you're out of luck unless you know exactly the digit location of the paragraphs you seek. The solution is simple even though it does take a little time. I found out that by bookmarking every first page of a new chapter, it allows me to create a table of contents that I can navigate through by going to the \\"My notes and marks\\" menu. Like I said, you do have to go through the book at least once to obtain these marks, but it's worth it if you ever want to go back and refer to a chapter somewhere in the middle of this epic without going crazy.Hope this helps with customers who were unsure why they should consider this translation or were thinking of skipping it altogether because it has no automatic chapter navigation.Thank you and happy reading!March 2010 Update: Found out table of contents IS accessible on the kindle. Sorry for the confusion. Either my kindle was updated, or I didn't read the directions onscreen when searching the TOC."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas p&egrave;re. Highly recommended.As translator Robin Buss points out in his introduction, many of those who haven't read The Count of Monte Cristo assume it is a children's adventure story, complete with daring prison escape culminating in a simple tale of revenge. There is very little for children in this very adult tale, however. Instead, the rich plot combines intrigue, betrayal, theft, drugs, adultery, presumed infanticide, torture, suicide, poisoning, murder, lesbianism, and unconventional revenge.Although the plot is roughly linear beginning with Edmond Dant&egrave;s' return to Marseille, prenuptial celebration, and false imprisonment and ending with his somewhat qualified triumphant departure from Marseille and France, Dumas uses the technique of interspersing lengthy anecdotes throughout. The story of Cardinal Spada's treasure, the origins of the Roman bandit Luigi Vampa (the least germane to the novel), Bertuccio's tale of his vendetta, and the account of the betrayal and death of Ali Pasha are few of the more significant stories-within-the-novel. While Dumas devotes an entire chapter to bandit Luigi Vampa's background, he cleverly makes only a few references to what will remain the plot's chief mystery-how the youthful, intelligent, and naive sailor Edmond Dant&egrave;s transforms himself into the worldly, jaded, mysterious Renaissance man and Eastern philosopher, the count of Monte Cristo, presumably sustained by his own advice of \\"wait\\" and \\"hope.\\"This novel is not a simple tale of simple revenge. The count does not kill his enemies; he brilliantly uses their vices and weaknesses against them. Caderousse's basic greed is turned against him, while Danglars loses the only thing that has any meaning for him. Fernand is deprived of the one thing that he had that he had never earned-his honour. In the process, he loses the source of his initial transgression, making his fate that much more poignant. The plot against Villefort is so complicated that even Monte Cristo loses control of it, resulting in doubt foreign to his nature and remorse that he will not outlive.This long but generally fast-paced is set primarily in Marseille, Rome, and Paris. It begins with Dant&egrave;s' arrival in Marseille aboard the commercial vessel Pharaon and ends with his departure from Marseille aboard his private yacht, accompanied by the young, beautiful Greek princess Hayd&eacute;e. What gives The Count of Monte Cristo its life, however, are the times in which it is set-the Revolution, the Napoleonic era, the First and Second Restoration, and the Revolution of 1830. Life-and-death politics motivates many of the characters and keeps the plot moving. Dumas also uses real people in minor roles, such as Countess G- (Byron's mistress) and the Roman hotelier Signor Pastrini, which adds to the novel's sense of historical veracity.The most troubling aspect of The Count of Monte Cristo is Edmond Dant&egrave;s himself. His claim to represent a higher justice seems to justify actions and inactions that are as morally reprehensible as those that sent him to prison, for example, his account of how he acquired Ali and his loyalty. Had he not discovered young Morrel's love for Valentine Villefort, she too might have become an innocent victim. As it is, there are at least two other innocents who die, although one clearly would not have been an innocent for long based on his behaviour in the novel. One wonders of Dant&egrave;s' two father figures, his own flower-loving father and fellow prisoner Abb&eacute; Faria, would have approved of the count.The translation appears to be good, with a few slips into contemporary English idioms that sound out of place. In his introduction, Buss states that the later Danglars and Fernand have become unrecognizable and that Fernand in particular has been transformed \\"from the brave and honest Spaniard with a sharp sense of honour . . . to the Parisian aristocrat whose life seems to have been dedicated to a series of betrayals.\\" There is never anything honest or honourable about Fernand; his very betrayal of Edmond is merely the first we know of in his lifelong pattern.What seems extreme and somewhat unrealistic about Fernand is his transformation from an uneducated Catalan fisherman into a \\"Parisian aristocrat,\\" hobnobbing with statesmen, the wealthy, and the noteworthy of society. This, however, is the result of the milieu that the novel inhabits. During these post-Revolution, post-Napoleonic years, Fernand could rise socially through his military and political accomplishments just as Danglars does through his financial acumen. Danglars is careful to note that the difference between them is that Fernand insists upon his title, while Danglars is openly indifferent to and dismissive of his; his viewpoint is the more aristocratic.Countess G- is quick to point out that there is no old family name of Monte Cristo and that the count, like many other contemporaries, has purchased his title. It serves mainly to obscure his identity, nationality, and background and to add to the aura of mystery his persona and Eastern knowledge create. What is most telling is that his entr&eacute;e into Parisian society is based primarily on his great wealth, not his name. Dumas reinforces this point with Andrea Cavalcanti, another mystery man of unknown name and reputed fortune.I have read The Man in the Iron Mask and The Three Musketeers series, both of which surprised me with their dark aspects (the character and fate of Lady de Winter, for example) and which little resembled the adventure stories distilled from them for children and for film. When I overheard a college student who was reading The Count of Monte Cristo on the bus tell a friend that she couldn't put it down, I was inspired to read it. I couldn't put it down, either, with its nearly seamless plot, dark protagonist, human villains, turbulent historical setting, and larger-than-life sense of mystery. At 1,078 pages, it's imposing, but don't cheat yourself by settling for an abridged version. You'll want to pick up every nuance.Diane L. Schirf, 12 September 2004."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"For the past year, I have thought that Austen's Pride and Prejudice would remain my all-time favorite book, but now I see that I am mistaken, as The Count of Monte Cristo has DEFINITELY topped P &amp; P on my list.This book, about the transformation of Edmond Dantes from an unsuspecting, guileless, innocent young man into a vengeful, dark, and clever man, and how the newly born Dantes uses his fortune and wit to avenge his past life, is one book that I shall never forget. I simply could not put this book down, and was even scolded by my family for neglecting my meals, sleep, and work to read this enchanting story. The details, the plot thick with intrigue and secrets...all of this and more were combined by Alexandre Dumas to create a masterful work of literature that one will surely come to appreciate greatly. I urge you, READ THIS BOOK! You shall not regret it!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Novels such as these convince me that the larger the story, the more profound will be its ending. There are too many features to this book to do it justice. The basic story line follows Edmund Dantes, a young sailor accused of treason. He is sentenced to life imprisonment, but (as one can guess might happen) he manages an escape. The rest of the novel follows his plan to revenge himself. The whole while, the reader never knows how evil prison has made Dantes, and the possibility that he will spare no one in his mission is quite plausible. What emerges is a suspense in terms of plot and character intertwined.Anyone interested in reading a huge book, but unsure which one to try first, this would be my top recomendation. Dumas' style is suited to suspense, adventure, and action, but is also moving and has penetrating insights into humanity. One will also find a wealth of descriptiveness to let your imagination absorb itself into another world. It is easy to read, and easy to pick up where you left off, in case you need to take a break from it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I had previously kept way from Dumas novels thinking that they were about swashbuckling and helpless maidens. Since I decided that I should read more classics this year, I picked up this book. Since the film should be releases soon, I figured I should read it before seeing the film might ruin it for me.That being said, this book was an exceptional story, and lives up to the acclaim. Rather than recount the plot, I will give a few reasons for my 4-star rating. The action begins immediately. While some books walk into the story, this book has significant plot development in the first few pages. Contrary to my preconception, there was really no fighting in the book. The action comes as the Count's intricate plan of revenge unfolds. Dumas does a great job of combining narration with introspection. While unraveling the plot, he provides insight into the emotions and personalities of his characters. In addition, the book isn't mired by excessive language. All in all this is a great story that should appeal to both men and women. I was able to read all 508 pages in a week of leisurely reading.On a negative point, this specific edition contains numerous typographical errors. Somone favored the letter \\"A\\" over \\"S\\" and many words are misspelled. If that is important to you, I would suggest you try another edition."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"'The Count of Monte Cristo' is part thriller, part love story and part drama. Its got alot in it, but all of it is fantastic. Edmond Dantes is unjustfully set-up and imprisoned early in his young adult life, just as things were beginning to go his way. Thus begins the plot of the transformation from Dantes into the Count of Monte Cristo after he escapes from his prison dungeon at the Chateau D'If.The story unfolds for a thousand pages about his vindication and revenge on those who mercilessly and vilely allowed him to rot in his prison over the course of many years. When he finally escapes with secret knowledge about a treasure, he uses all the means of his disposal to turn his life around as well as infiltrate the lives of those that did him an injustice back when he was Edmond Dantes. The book includes everything from islands, ships, Paris, the country, guns, poisons, chariots, wealth, poverty, and an infinite amount of intrigue. Sometimes Dumas takes a couple hundred pages to set up someone who you haven't seen in awhile in a new identity, but he never leaves you hanging without wrapping up the past, present and future of all of the players in the story. One of Dumas' greatest elements in this book is to set up story well in advance. The astute reader will appreciate his care and concern for knitting a tightly bound story.When I was given this book for Christmas, I saw the 1168 page length and thought to myself, &quot;I may start it, but I will never finish this long book.&quot; Much to my pleasure I finished the book yesterday and just had to write a review about it. I read about 500 pages and then put it down for a couple months. After picking it back up four weeks ago, I found it so interesting and intriguing that I ripped through the final 600+ pages. It really is one of the most wonderful books that I have ever read. I would recommend that you read the unabridged version rather than the abridged to gather the fullness of rich imagery and deeply developed characters in the book. Alexandre Dumas' &quot;Count of Monte Cristo&quot; is well worth the time it takes to read."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Perhaps one of the best novels ever written, the Count of Monte Cristo is a story of an innocent man that seeks to revenge his wrongful imprisonment. Dumas brilliantly confronts themes pertaining to nearly all facets of human existence including that of justice, revenge, love, friendship, greed, jealousy, etc.Despite its vivid detail and striking character development, the novel reads rather easily and quickly. This story has been the inspiration of many great movies, most notably, that of The Shawshank Redemption (1994).Truly a classic and a must read."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is perhaps one of the best literary works of all time. Riveting, it is the story of a young man, Edmond Dantes, who is falsely accused of treason by three selfish villains who each desire something different from Dantes; The story is set in 19th Century France. Dantes is a young, strikingly handsome, 20-year old newly-apppointed ship captain with his whole life ahead of him. He is about to marry the woman of his dreams, a young, vivacious, awesomely beautiful Catalan girl from France named Mercedes. For reasons unbeknownst to him he is betrayed by three cruel, evil men, accused of treason, and secretly heralded away to the foreboding Chateau de If prison where he serves almost 14 years in solitary confinement. With the help of a wise old abbe, he successfully institutes an escape plan; After a daring, nerve frazzling escape, he sets about to claim a vast, hidden, enormous fortune that is hidden at the Isle of Monte Cristo. After locating riches beyond imagination, Edmond dons the title the Count of Monte Cristo, he is a man of immense wealth, stature, class, and a man of society. But with all the riches and fame bestowed upon the Count, he must complete some unfinished business. That is, he must enact revenge upon the evil men who robbed him of his youth, the love and life of his father, the loss of his betrothed, and his prominence as a ship captain. You will find yourself seated at the edge of your seat, perhaps stopping only to take care of life's necessities because when Monsieur Le Comte de Monte Cristo enacts his revenge, he takes no prisoners. The Count of Monte Cristo captures our very essence as we watch his plan unfold before our very eyes. He carefully and fastidiously orchestrates his plan of revenge to punish the men who acted so predictably and maliciously against him. This book gets five thumbs up because it demonstrates vulnerable life experiences that happen to many of us. That is, to say it is a story about true human courage, emotion, greed, jealousy, betrayal, and revenge. And, the count makes the punishment fit the crime for each man. This book is not for the squeamish or immature at heart. One of the best novels of all time."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I just finished this book as a summer reading book for school, and it was amazing. Dumas uses an incredible amount of foreshadowing in this book, but it only adds to its intrigue. The plot itself has so many twists and turns as it follows the life of Edmond Dantes and others involved in his life. The evolution of the characters is also amazing. It's almost a psychological analysis of human characteristics, with their qualities and defaults.I read this book in three days. I was hooked from beginning to end. The story simple flows together, and by the end, everything comes to a neat solution; the conclusion isn't completely definite - it gives the reader time to imagine what happens to Edmond after the book ends.I highly recommend this book to anyone of any age. The writing style is guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat, eager for more."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is honestly one of the greatest novels I have ever read. I absolutely loved this book. I could not put it down! This is a must read for anyone.When I first started into this novel, I had in my memory the 'movie' that was made for the big screen. So of course, I expected the book to be very similar to it. Well, I was very wrong! Other than Edmond Dantes being betrayed by his 'friends' and finding the treasure, this book takes on a different route.Believe me, the book is much more superb. The way the Count exacts his revenge is astonishing. I cannot fathom how Dumas came up with such a scheme. At times, one cringes for the those who wronged the Count.This book made me laugh and cry. There are many poignant moments throughout the book that make you feel good. Anyone who says that Dumas is not up there with the 'classic' writers, does not know what they are talking about. This book is rich in dialogue, mystery, suspense and storyline. All in all, this is an amazing classic, and I recommend it to anyone wanting a good read."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Edmond Dantes was a happy and fortunate young man, blessed with a beautiful fiance, good looks, and an upwardly mobile career. In short he had everything that a man could want. As is always the case, one man's fortune breeds another's envy. Jealous of Edmond's good fortunes three of his friends conspire to remove him from the scene. The plan might not have worked were it not for his bad fortune in chief prosecutors. His fortunes soured, Edmond is sentenced to life imprisonment.What follows along this plotline is one of the greatest novels ever written. Edmond escapes, finds his fortune, and begins a long road of revenge. Not satisfied with killing his enemies, Edmond instead seeks to do unto them as they have done unto him. Ruin their lives by taking away everything that they hold dear.I cannot emphasize enough the quality of this book. The plot is complex and intriguing. The characters are deep and fully fleshed. Always intelligent, often whimsical, occassionally romantic, and interspersed with action, this novel has something for everyone.Read this book!!!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"After watching the movie and then finding myself compelled to read the book, I wrote a review for the DVD version of this great classic by Alexandre Dumas. I did give the adulterated movie 3 stars, even with its deviation from the far superior storyline of the novel (this story does not lend itself to being told in a 2-hour movie). But rather than 3 stars, the book is well deserving of 5, and then some.The tale of the Count is one of heavy, dark intrigue. This is not light reading, and the story will tax your patience and demand of you significant time and concentration if you are to mine its riches. Those with an attention span of a six-year-old need not apply, although any person, young or old, who yields to the lessons being lived out will come away from this book with impressive knowledge regarding the pitfalls of willful ignorance, deceit, and pride; and hopefully a better appreciation for justice, compassion, and love.As for the story itself, Edmond Dantes, a young man of considerable good character, finds himself wrongly imprisoned under dreadful circumstances. He eventually is tutored in prison by a man with extraordinary wisdom-just as the reader is tutored without realizing it as he reads the unfolding chapters. Edmond loses all, gains eternal wisdom and insight, and then begins his true journey into lands where friends and foes experience his heavy influence. The story is one of desperation and deliverance, defeat and despair, and ultimately of triumph at an awful cost. Spiritual applications abound throughout as learned from within dungeons to palaces, and our notions of justice and mercy are sorely tested as a wronged man loses all and then begins to execute what he considers to be, and may well be, God's judgment.If you dedicate the time and attention that this book deserves, you will not be disappointed. If you want to speed-read and add another title to your library card, you will miss the worthwhile messages that this book can bring to the soul. I say soul, but for those with spiritual understanding, the better term is spirit, for this is above all a spiritual book. The movie alludes to it; the book embodies it. Having now read the book and carefully endured the more tedious portions to ensure that I missed little, I can only say that we do ourselves much disservice by not committing the time to study works such as this. Love, hate, revenge, mercy, justice, and forgiveness are explored in detail in the lives of Edmond Dantes (the Count) and his friends and foes. This complicated novel is unbelievably rich in its timeless spiritual lessons."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is one the greatest book ever written.I read the abridged version because it was shorter and cheaper. Big mistake.Upon reading the cliff notes I noticed all sorts of thing I missed out on and some of them were pretty important (such as what happens to Danglars)I have gone back and bought the Oxford Classics version and you should do the same."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo, some people did not know it was a book until the movie came out, some people still don't even know it is a book. I thought it was an exciting, keep you on the edge of your chair, hafta turn the page, cliff hanger. That is, until you get past the first five pages of boring mush (literally only 5 pages). It is a classic story about a man who has everything going for him; until, on his wedding day his supposed friends frame him and send him to the legendary Chateau d'If for the rest of his life. But when he escapes from prison and finds a gigantic treasure, he sets out to reclaim his lost love and exact a slow, fitting punishment on his betrayers. Will he find his beloved Mercedes and get his revenge against his enemies, or will his whole plot go ka-put?"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The author is one of the most imaginative writers I have ever come across. With one unpredictable plot twist after another, this was an addictive page-turner that had me reading for hours on end, days at a time. Despite its formidable length, you will not want this novel to end.The novel centers around Edward Dantes, who we first glimpse as a young innocent sailor about to be married. The treachery of three men results in his being sent to waste away in prison. He manages to escape after 14 years, and the remainder of the novel entails his painstaking and elaborate revenge on the villains.The author taps on every human emotion in weaving this tale - love, hate, greed, fear, empathy, pride. It reminds me of a Russian novel: it has a large cast of characters about whom the reader knows everything, an intricate soap-operaesque plot, and is impossible to put down.In my view, this is great escapist entertainment and very imaginative. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. I am not usually the type that likes to read books as long as this but The Count of Monte Cristo was worth all the pages. I have never been more excited to read a book before. Each time I picked it up I would tell myself I only had time to read one chapter but I always read about ten chapters before finally and reluctantly putting the book down. If I was to recommend any book to anyone, this would be the book. No matter what you are looking for in a book you can find it in this book."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo, by Alexandre Dumas. This is an excellent story of jealousy, exile, fortune, and vengeance. A young sailor, Edmond Dantes, is wronged by friends and enemies alike. To cover up a conspiracy, Dantes is imprisoned to protect the guilty. While in prison Dantes is educated and hardened with hatred for those who betrayed him. He has sworn revenge on those who wronged him and is ready to escape when he learns of an immense fortune hidden on the isle of Monte Cristo. After his escape he unveals the vast treasure and disguises himself as the Count of Monte Cristo. Educated, free, and now wealthy; he has only to find those who wronged him and recover those who he loves."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Without exaggeration, 'The Count of Monte Cristo' is one of the greatest stories on earth. I\`m not saying it\`s the greatest book on earth--there are flaws sometimes in character development, and the overuse of coincidences--but the story itself is a gem unrivalled anywhere. When it comes to weaving a complex plot rife with fascinating characters, Dumas is a master; and each scene is instilled with just the necessary amount of dramatic tension and foreshadowing. Never once does the story slow its pace, yet without once detracting from its depth and power. The characters are often thrown into situations that are literally a matter of life and death, and suspense becomes the reader\`s constant companion. But the most compelling element in the story is Edmond Dantes himself, aka the Count of Monte Cristo, looming like a spectral shadow over the bright spectacle of French wealth portrayed here--a shadow with a broken heart and needs of which he is hardly aware, so intent is he on becoming a pitiless agent of revenge. The book\`s main flaw, I thought, was the abrupt resolution of his relationship with Haydee--she seemed more like a plot device than a real person. Other flaws consist of contrived plot scenarios which would be unacceptable today, but which to me at least, with their exuberant spontaneity, make this book even more of a joy to read."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This review is for those who've already decided they want to read The Count of Monte Cristo (you won't regret it!), and don't know which version to get.Short answer: see review title, duh!The Count of Monte Cristo is my favorite book, and I've read several translations, both abridged and unabridged.TRANSLATIONThe Buss translation is the most modern, and reads most fluidly. A quick example comparing this translation with the one found on Project Gutenberg:PG - His wife visited for him, and this was the received thing in the world, where the weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were accepted as an excuse for what was really only calculated pride...BUSS - His wife visited on his behalf; this was accepted in society, where it was attributed to the amount and gravity of the lawyer's business -- when it was, in reality, deliberate arrogance...Buss's work reads like the book was written in English. The two or so times that the work is nearly untranslatable, Buss makes a footnote about it (eg, an insinuated insult using the formal \\"vous\\" instead of the familiar \\"tu\\"). Other translations just skip the subtlety. The most common translation out there (uncredited in my version) reads like a swamp. Trust me, get Buss.ABRIDGED V UNABRIDGEDAbridged versions of this book rarely say \\"abridged.\\" You can tell by the size: abridged is 500-700 pages, unabridged is 1200-1400 pages. Go for the unabridged.The abridged version is VERY confusing! Pruning 1200 pages down to 600 leaves a lot of plot on the cutting room floor. Suddenly, arriving at dinner are 4 new characters; it's very tiring to try to keep up with the hole-ridden story of the abridged versions. And you know where the holes are? Publishers \\"clean up\\" the book by omitting the affairs, illegitimate children, homosexuality, hashish trips, etc.As an added bonus in the Penguin Classics edition, there's a wonderful appendix bursting with footnotes to explain all the 19th century references, and a quick guide to the rise and fall of Napoleon (crucial to the politics in the story).Hope this helps. Get the book and start reading!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Warning: Do NOT pick this book up and start it if you have something that you need to do in the next day or three. You won't be able to put the book down, or if you do, you'll move zombielike through your everyday tasks while your mind stays with the adventures of Edmund Dantes.The Count of Monte Cristo is a delicious book, full of intrigue, great fight scenes, love, passion, and witty social satire. Dumas has a wonderful grasp of human nature and a talent for rendering all the follies of man in delightful, snappy prose. I immediately recognized people that I know (yes, even myself) in his vivid characters, which made the book all the more engaging to me.Some people might be put off by the size of the book -- it's a pretty hefty volume -- an tempted to buy the abridged version. Don't! I've heard from people who've read both versions that the abridged version is a pathetic, washed out shadow of the full novel. At any rate, as thick and impossibly long as The Count of Monte Cristo may seem when you open it for the first time, you'll feel as though it's far too short by the time you get to the last page."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book is an example of perfect fiction writing. Its length is 5 times the average book and it still was not long enough! The story, the characters, the settings and the emotions enthralled me for days. I could not put it down. I was living the book as it took me to France, the mediterranean, Italy and every home, cave and mode of transportation detailed in exemplary fashion by Dumas. Without giving away the intrigue... This book is the story of a wronged young sailor and follows his life as he is imprisoned due to the actions of 3 jealous men. He lives in prison for an extended period of time, meeting a man who gives him hope and a life beyond his dreams. He escapes the horrid dungeon and seeks revenge on the 3 men who took away everything he ever hoped for. This book is amazing, it will not disappoint anyone. I cannot believe I did not read it before. Thank you Kindle for allowing me the pleasure of reading this book for free, however, it is worth paying for and sharing with anyone who loves to read."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I agree with the reviewers that this is one of the best books ever written. I read this book as part of a book club and probably never would have read it on my own--having read many of the books of Hugo and Dickens and other writers of that approximate era. I love both of these writers but find them both at times cumbersome and stilted and really wasn't in the mood for another. However, I could not put the Count of Monte Cristo down. This book seems freshly modern in writing style compared to these superb writers. From the beginning it is a page turner--almost Harry Potter like in its ability to have action, adventure and drama on almost every page. If you read the unabridged version you will find some allusions to morality and the wrongness of revenge which I enjoyed. But what makes the book great is the grandeur of the writing, the tightness of a wonderful plot, filled with subplots, the development of the characters, and the constant magic of combining romance and adventure. It is the ultimate romance book. If you watched the most recent version of the movie, you might be disappointed at the lack of sword fights, but there is never a lack of adventure and suspense. It might be 1400 pages long, but it never disappoints."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I first read the Bantam abridged Monte Cristo when I was 13 years old. Then, the next year, I saw the unabridged version and immediately bought a copy. Monte Cristo is an absolutely wonderful and wonderfully written masterpiece that tells the story of a young man that could be any of several people that you and I know. It is a story of injustice, despair, remorse, cruelty, misfortune, and evil. However, at the same time, the book manages to show that in the seemingly rotten world we live in there is hope, charity, love, honor, and purity as well. Edmond is one of the greatest dynamic characters of all time, innocently sent to face punishment that he in no way deserves. While enduring this unjust punishment, he meets a man and they become friends. Edmond learns from this man that everyone acts according to their own standards, and that everyone will eventually receive reward for the actions or crimes that they have committed, whether that reward be payment for honest living or pain in reparation for hardships forced upon others. Edmond then becomes that reparation, rewarding those that were his true friends, and exacting revenge upon those that caused him pain. A wonderful story, with excellent characters and an intricate plot. I would recommend this book for anyone that wants to laugh, cry, and triumph with a single character and his struggles. As the title states, this is one of my favorite books of all time, the only other that really compares with it is Victor Hugo's Les Miserables."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I've reviewed this book before. I'm writing another review of it now so that it will appear on my list of reviews next to my review of the butchered 2002 screen adaptation of this epic work.Alexandre Dumas's _The Count of Monte Cristo_ is one of the greatest novels of all time and in fact stands at the fountainhead of the entire stream of popular adventure-fiction. Dumas himself was one of the founders of the genre; every other such writer -- H. Rider Haggard, C.S. Forrester, Zane Grey, Louis L'Amour, Mickey Spillane, Ian Fleming, Tom Clancy, John Grisham -- is deeply in his debt.The cold, brooding, vampiric Count (born Edmond Dantes; known also, among other aliases, as \\"Sinbad the Sailor,\\" Lord Wilmore, and a representative of the firm of Thomson and French) is the literary forebear of every dark hero from Sherlock Holmes and the Scarlet Pimpernel to Zorro, Batman, the Green Hornet, and Darkman. And the intricate plot provides everything any reader could want: adventure, intrigue, romance, and (of course) the elegant machinations of the Count himself as he exacts his terrible revenge on those who have wronged him -- thereby serving, or so he believes, as an agent of divine justice and retribution. Brrrrrrrr.The book is also a good deal _longer_ than many readers may be aware. Ever since the middle of the nineteenth century, the English translations have omitted everything in the novel that might offend the sensibilities of Victorian readers -- including, for example, all the sex and drugs.That's why I strongly recommend that anyone interested in this novel read Robin Buss's full-text translation. Unlike, say, Ayn Rand (whose cardboard hero \\"John Galt\\" also owes his few interesting aspects to Monsieur le Comte), Dumas was entirely capable of holding a reader's undivided attention for over a thousand pages; Buss's translation finally does his work justice, restoring all the bits omitted from the Bowdlerized versions.The heart of the plot, as most readers will already know, is that young sailor Edmond Dantes, just as his life starts to come together, is wrongfully imprisoned for fourteen years in the dungeons of the Chateau d'If as the victim of a monstrously evil plot to frame him as a Bonapartist. While in prison he makes the acquaintance of one Abbe Faria, who serves as his mentor and teaches him the ways of the world (science, philosophy, languages and literature, and so forth), and also makes him a gift of a fabulous treasure straight out of the _Thousand and One Nights_. How Dantes gets out of prison, and what he does after that -- well, that's the story, of course. So that's all I'm going to tell you.However, I'll also tell you that the 2002 screen adaptation doesn't even begin to do it justice. The plot is so far \\"adapted\\" as to be unrecognizable, except in its broad outlines and the names of (some of) the characters. Pretty much everything that makes Dumas's novel so darkly fascinating has been sucked out of it. It's not a bad movie on its own terms, but if you're expecting an adaptation of this novel, you'll be disappointed. And if you've already seen it, don't base your judgment of the novel on it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is a great book and I highly recommend it, but don't buy this enriched classic version of the book. It was good, but I felt like something was missing, and not until I finished the book did I discover that this version leaves out significant portions of the actual story. Nowhere in this book does it tell you that it is an abridged version, but it actually is. Buy a different version of this book."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is more of a note to compare the Oxford unabridged version to abridged versions of this story.Previously, I read an abridgement of The Count of Monte Cristo and enjoyed it thoroughly. The story is a classic Man-Done-Wrong-Wreaks-Revenge tale.Eventually, I decided to read the unabridged version, even though it is over 1,000 pages, and I'm exceedingly glad that I did!There is an incredible amount of tension in this book, which miraculously enough is retained throughout the entire work. In the unabridged version, the reader is inserted into the story in a &quot;you are there&quot; sense, moment by moment, which is, in my opinion, the thing that retains this tension.Not to disparage the abridgement, but - in shortening the story - the reader is sometimes not a participant in the storyline, but merely hears about the events in an off-hand summary. As a result of this, part of the soul of the book is removed.That is a shame - especially with this work - because you are partly robbed of the emotional reward of following Edmond Dantes' journal from hell along his complicated strategy to struggle toward heaven ... which is a long journey from Marseilles!You should set aside the time to read the unabridged version of this work! You will not feel the time a useless sacrifice!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I'll admit up front - I'm only 15% of the way through the book. But so far, I love it. It's got plenty of intrigue and suspense to keep me very interested. I have no doubt I'll love the remaining 85%. Also, I'm 90% sure that this is the unabridged version. I took this Kindle version to a bookstore and compared it to an unabridged hard copy of the book, and they line up very similarly. From what I can tell, the unabridged versions have 117 chapters, compared to about 71 chapters in the abridged version. A hard copy unabridged version will have roughly 1200 pages, compared to about 600 pages for the abridged.

I WAS a bit curious though..All in all, I found it an amazing book. I especially love how Dumas protrays each character--true, they can get a bit mixed up at times, but it didn't deter me!--with deep thought for each of their personalities and proper actions (At least, I thought their actions were very appropriate in proportion to the descriptions of them).Also, the plot is interesting and intense enough to keep you immersed. Sometimes Dumas explains things a bit too much, but skimming through those parts hasn't damaged the story (for me, at least). I highly recommend The Count as a leisure book, or for anytime, really.

I couldn't put the book down and finished it all in a few days.I really don't want to ruin the plot for anyone, so i'm not going to go into any details. It's just amazing how a character can be at a new climax in life, fall to great depths, and then rise again.There will always be parts of the book where you might say or think things should have been different. But that's what happens when you watch almost any drama movie, for sometimes we don't want any sadness directed towards characters we grow to love. But sometimes that makes you appreciate the plot even more.Believe me, you really will love some of the characters in this book. Just give it a chance.I have to admit that I read the ... edition of this book, and I'm not sure if it is a different translator or if it is abridged to a different degree. I looked up the translator, but the book didn't say, and it's not for sale here on Amazon[.com], which is why I'm reviewing this book.Sometimes it's hard to pick out the right edition for a translated book. But I've asked so many people about this book, and all that I've known to read it have unanimously praised it. I don't think you can go wrong, but make sure you do the research before picking one specific book.And finally, I'd say don't pick a book with an ugly picture of the Count on the front. He's supposed to be a relatively good-looking guy, and an ugly picture on the cover can psychologically influence a partial opinion towards him contrary to the descriptions of the text. ;)"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Please don't let the length of this book scare you! I read the Count of Monte Cristo in five days. I could not put it down. There is never a dull moment! Murders, love affairs, bandits, illegitimate children, greed, disguises, insanity. Why this book is chock full of good stuff! A new surprise waits around every corner. And the bast part is that all the villians get their just what's coming to them, making it a most gratifying reading experience.I have friends who refuse to read this book because they already saw the movie and think their is no point. I have seen multiple film adaptations of The Count of Monte Cristo and none come anywhere close to the original story.I urge you to read this book. It is an absolute must for anyone who loves adventure. The only disadvantage, if it is a disadvantage, is you won't be able to accomplish anything until you have finished the book. You simply won't be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Everything in Edmond Dantes' life is going right-he is about to become the captain of a ship, and about to marry his true love, Mercedes. All the good things in Dantes' life are wrenched from his grasp in an instant, due to the betrayal of men he once considered friends. Dantes is unjustly thrown into prison. In jail, the kind, friendly Dantes the reader is introduced to is transformed into a merciless conspirator, bent on extracting revenge from those who betrayed him.Dantes comes upon a fortune that he would never have even dreamed of, and with its aid, is able to hide behind the mask of the Count of Monte Cristo, a mysterious, brooding man with a huge amount of power. Dantes slowly and subtly begins to ruin the lives of the men who ruined his own life fourteen years ago.Alexandre Dumas' tale is thrilling, full of excitement and surprising twists and turns. His writing style is hardly ever slow. In the middle, it seemed like he was abandoning the main story line, but by the end the author cleverly ties all the loose ends together to weave a fantastic story. This book is sure to please anyone who enjoys reading about love, betrayal, revenge, adventure, action, romance, and most importantly, self-discovery and change. Dumas shows the reader, through Dantes, how pain and anguish can change a person so extremely.I highly recommend this book. Dumas' writing is so good; I was caught up in the story of Dantes instantly. I felt horrible when he was thrown in jail, and triumphant when he finally extracts revenge from his enemies. Though, in the middle of the book, is seems a little slow, the author soon picks up the main plot line again and all the subplots make sense again. The characters are well-developed, and the story, though not quite plausible, is full of exciting and delightful surprising."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"So much has been written about &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; that it is well nigh impossible to add or subtract to the opus of literary criticism (including all that has been written right here on Amazon.com.) So, rather than trying to provide a plot overview, or extolling the virtues of Dumas' story of injustice, obsession and revenge, I would like to take a somewhat contrary stance and point out that this is a literary masterpiece with a few &quot;classic&quot; flaws.The first is the narration. Undoubtedly, it suffers from the fact that Dumas wrote this story in serial form. That's a fair excuse, but what is troublesome is his abrupt shift from the Count's rescue of the Morrel family shipping business, to his 100+ page Italian excursion, including the chapters on, &quot;Roman Bandits&quot;, &quot;The Carnival At Rome&quot;, etc. I suppose one could argue that we are introduced to the Viscount Albert de Morcerf and Baron Franz d'Epinay in Italy, but surely these two secondary characters could have been just as easily place in France where all the action is. I guess I'm left with the gnawing suspicion that Dumas once filled his travel journal with numerous observations and insights about Italy, and decided it was a good time to spill them all out about a quarter of the way through &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo.&quot; Unfortunately, his Italian excursion (artfully rendered in its own right) throttles what was a driving, haunting compelling narrative, which reaches a wondrous climax when the Count mysteriously steps in to save the Morrels.My other issue is the sheer improbability of coincidences that pile up on one another. The artist is entitled to ask of the reader to engage in a certain willing suspension of disbelief. But I think Dumas has asked the reader for a bit too much. We know the Count, bent on retribution and revenge, is an outright control freak who obsessively manipulates Caderousse, Danglars, Villefort and Fernand. He's got them on a string. But the circumstances that tie these four together go far beyond the Count's machinations. Dumas has entangled them all in a spider web of relationships that is entirely contrived.With that said, who, today, would like to challenge Dumas to a creative writing contest? Most assuredly, not I. One of the reasons &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; is such an enduring classic is that any criticism is overwhelmed by the sheer literary virtuosity of Alexandre Dumas. One reviewer said that, &quot;....you just don't find novels like this anymore.&quot; There's a very good reason for that. No one alive today can right like this!One last observation. I read Sir Walter Scott's &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; shortly before picking up &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo.&quot; In some way, I got the feeling that Scott portrayed Medieval Englishmen the way 19th Century Englishmen would have liked to have thought of themselves. Dumas has rendered a national portrait of his countrymen as well, but I don't get the sense he cared whether or not they liked the image."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVER. THE STORY IS INCREDIBLY LONG BUT INCREDIBLY INVOLVED AND INTERESTING. THE WRITING IS CLEAR AND UNDERSTANDABLE, AND EVEN THOUGH IT IS REALLY LONG, IT IS REALLY WORTH IT. When I got to the end of the book I was SAD it was over.I also had thought that the whole book was going to be about his imprisonment and then his escape, but that happens in like the first 100-200 pages! The rest of the book is where the whole story unfolds, etc. etc. etc.You MUST read this book. Don't miss it! (TIP: start a list of characters when you begin to read it, so that when they appear a couple hundred pages later you will know who they are)"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"By fate, I was a member of the armed forces when the Persian Gulf crisis erupted in 1990. In preparation for what I expected to be a long camping trip, I paid a visit to the nearest used book store and purchased some 40 books, as a means of passing the idle time that awaited me in the Middle East. It was my good fortune to come across a small illustrated version of the Dumas' classic tale of revenge and intrigue. One afternoon in Saudi Arabia, at the behest of one of my compatriots, I finally thumbed through the small pocket-sized book, and much to my surprise, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I could not wait to read the original version. When I returned to America several months later, I rushed to the nearest book store and purchased the abridged version. I must have read that engaging novel 10 times! Just a few months ago, my wife purchased the unabridged version (over 800 pages) and I, once again, was privileged to enjoy the company of the eccentric Count.

This 300-450 page novel does not do it justice. A lot of passages have been edited out and in some way translated extremely poorly. As a fan of Dumas or just a reader I would NOT recommend this book, instead go and get the 1000-1100 page version, idk if they make it in a softcover though, but that edition is EPIC.This is like watching a movie in fastforward, you miss a ton of the most important vital conversations/scenes b/c you're only skipping through for the action, and then just as you're about to get interested it'll end.Great for highschool book reports terrible for people that actually enjoy reading."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Again, classic Alexandre Dumas and a great story.

Terrible formatting will not let you get pleasure from reading this book."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I didn't think I would add another review to the already 8,000 + out there. But, while reading the final pages of this book, I found myself overcome with emotion. When a book can do that, it deserves a little notation.Most everything has been said about this towering classic. I particularly liked Joel's review, complete with pictures. However, when I picture The Count, it is a mix of Edmund Blackadder and Orson Welles.In any case, what I have taken from this book is a lesson in the law of unintended consequences. While everything (sort of) falls into place for the Count's well-planned revenge, one cannot escape the myriad of tendrils that effect so many other people. Edmond realizes that perhaps he had gone too far in his scheme, but yet those guilty parties most likely deserved their comeuppance.Other lessons are learned through these men (Danglars, Villefort, Mondego, and Caderrouse). One cannot escape one's sins forever, greed has no happy ending, and desire for power will rot your soul. Though the style of this book, and of the time, is one of exaggeration and over-the-top emotions, the story is timeless. When we step on the backs of others to reach the top, is it not inconceivable that one of those broken bodies will rise again and pull us from our pedestal?Davis' translation is wonderful and the notes are extremely helpful in understanding the time frame of the story. I can only imagine Dumas' readers, waiting expectantly for the next installment, talking in cafes excitedly over the latest \\"episode.\\"There isn't much more that I can say that will add to the discussion, except that this book should be required reading for everyone.There are very few books I re-read, and this will be one of them."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"While the Three Musketeers is better known, Dumas treatment of The Count of Monte Cristo is exceptional. His character development is excellent and puts one into the scene. An excellent read. One classic to be revisited."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is my third time reading my favorite novel, The Count of Monte Cristo. It was an easier read, I think because of the translation as well as because I paid more attention to the characters in the early part of the book because I knew they'd be playing their roles again later. The first time I read it, sometimes it was a strain to remember later who had done what back in the beginning.What was interesting was to see how my feelings about some of the characters was different with this reading than in the past. I could see how I have evolved as a person and in my philosophy about life as I reacted differently to how the book unfolded. That was unexpected, and it was satisfying.I bought this to read on my Kindle. Was going to get the free version but saw another review that said this translation was better. So I read the first three or four pages of each edition free online, and easily saw the difference in the translation. It's worth paying a few bucks for this translation.The story is as gripping as ever. Whether it's your first time or third time, prepare to be mesmerized!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book has it all. It is set in the early 1800s and involves ambition, humility, envy, love, power, poverty, education, travel, and many other subjects of life.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is the quitessential Dumas novel. This book is his own creation, not one which his factory of writers wrote and he flourished and embellished. He found a story about a cobbler who after being imprisoned by presumed friends brutally murdered them all. Dumas entrigued by this occurence proceeded to write a glorified version of it. The book provides the tense atmosphere of France during the Napoleonic Era, the political dealings and believable characters. From the most vile villain to the Count everyone seems human and flawed. Dumas has created a world in which one can easily delve into and be absorbed. This work is truly worth reading!!P.S. Do not be daunted by the length- after the first 50 pages or so the story truly moves!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo has to be one of my favorite novels. It's full of intricate plot twists, fascinating characters, romance, revenge, hope, despair, deception, betrayal, redemption and all the other emotions and experiences that make up life. All of the characters are multi-layered, no one, not even Edmund Dantes (aka the Count) acting out of easily-defined motives, and are intertwined in such beautifully complex ways with terrific backstories. Edmund takes revenge on these horrible people who ruined his life and took his fiance and future away from him, but one still feels a little sorry for them, because they're real characters. All in all, a fantastic book that really delves into the psyche of revenge. It's quite long, but it's worth it because it is so intricate and detailed and so beautiful."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is an intriguing tale of retribution.

There he meets a man who will change his life...and point him towards freedom and his means of vengeance on those who have wronged him. Without a doubt, this novel is a masterpiece, attaining the balance of true symphony between justice and revenge. The characterization and atmosphere portrayed is rich enough to evoke anyone's imagination. Dumas' attention to detail adds to the ambiance and vivacity of the tale. As a fitting testament to it's nearly be rushed, rather savored. The unabridged version (875 pages) is a must, with its banquet of flavorful scenes - it is a full course meal for any hungry bookworm - the abridged version is merely a buttered cracker. \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is one of my most treasured novel and, without hesitation, by far the best book I have ever read!

This book is too good to cut out more than 70% of the book like some of the abridged versions have done.I mean who would go to see Matrix Reloaded and be satisfied with only 30% of the movie from random scenes?! Of course not!As far as the story itself, don't try to look at the story and if its perfect or what is believable or not.

It explores many facets of humanity, and you need to see how you fit into them!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book was a gift to me from my sister, and I must say it was one of the best gifts I could have received. Having recently read 'Les Miserables' (the book is so much better than a movie or play) I was primed for The Count. The stories are so similar; two men who escape prison and begin a journey towards enlightenment and salvation. The only difference being that Jean Valjean was a true criminal who redeems himself through selfless philanthropy while Edmund Dante (the Count) is a wrongly convicted man who uses his wealth for revenge. Yet both of these stories ultimately have identical moral themes.Classics such as these transcend time, and for good reason. You will not be able to put it down once you start reading it; it will give you a profound sense of humanity when you put it down, and will keep you thinking well after you have finished it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book is stted in Paris, France and the main actor is Edmond Dantes.

There was a lot of excitement and suspense. For example Edmond gets in a duel and Edmond is dragged to the bottom of the ocean. One thing I didn&#65533;t like about the book was that it didn&#65533;t start out that exciting. It is though, a book you can&#65533;t put down.I believe this book has a very good message. The message is: &#65533;help your friends and they will help you&#65533;.

Whence from there he begins to revenge himself on the ones who did him the great injustice that put him through the suffering of isolation in jail.This is a brilliantly written book that only a few could even think of. Maybe the idea of a man getting revenge is common, but only Dumas could put it into words of such power, showing the cleverness of Dantes as he takes each step towards getting revenge upon all his enemies. Although it might be a bit confusing at first, with all the detail, once you understand everything that goes on in the intelligent mind of the Count of Monte Cristo aka Dantes, you will be captivated by this book."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is a great read. I decided to read the book after having seen the movie. Where the movie is an action adventure, the book is drama to its core. As always, I regret having seen the movie first and having it's characterizations impressed on me. In this case, the movie and book are so different that it didn't matter too much.The book is about a young man, Dantes, who is severely wronged. He is imprisoned and vows to get vengeance on those who caused him to suffer. He meets a mentor in prison, escapes, and then finds his mentor's treasure. With this treasure, as a older man, he is able to exact revenge on his enemies. His many twisted schemes form the bulk of the book (practically ignored in the movie). The way these plans weave in and out of each other is magnificent.The Count of Monte Cristo should be on everyone's &quot;Must Read&quot; list. It is truly a masterpiece that should not be missed."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"As a 16 year old girl, I couldn't believe how amazing this book was.

I liked them both in their own respect.This is one of those exciting books that you can't put down. I read this version and I am glad I did. At the book store, I compared it to the unabriged versions, and not only did this version contain more, the translator tends to use better word choice and has superior sentence fluency.The plot of the story is intriging and exciting. If you like books that make you twist your head around and think, this is for you!

I have only read the abridged, but it was enough to judge by. While beautifully written and expressed with vivid detail, it was too dramatic to be given 5 stars. Dumas makes the mistake of making Dantes a god, and giving him infinite intellect. He is not a real-life character in the least! Therefore, it is hard to believe all the 'once in a blue moon' events that occur around and through Dantes.However, Dantes' revenge is so fantastic, that it is hard to discredit the book. Reverting from the classic 'kill-all' revenge, Dantes stealthily discredits all his oppressors, involving the reader with the plot. But Dantes himself knows perhaps too much, can do things that are not humanly possible... and so, I rate this book 4 stars."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I found the thought of reading this book rather intimidating as it's 1077 pages long. Once reading however, it was compulsive enough to be worth the effort (I'm a slow reader).

I had to will the suspension of disbelief and managed it just enough to enjoy the book. I liked, or rather agreed with, the idealistic themes, the lack of truly good and bad main characters - the four of Dantes targets are all very human. Some of the secondary characters seemed too good to be true though but more depth to them may have resulted in a further few hundred pages!Taken less seriously, if you just want to enjoy a book, it's a compulsive, fun read with not too many frustratingly long-drawn out parts- though there are some."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book was specifically required by my daughter's 8th grade English teacher, in the version obtained from Amazon.

But i was very taken into the book and enjoyed it until i got near the end.... Where it just collapsed.Dumas built up way too much on the characters, like Albert and Franz to let them have such a poor ending, or NO ending. I found myself getting bored sometimes when it seemed like the story was going nowhere since so many pages were wasted on meaningless parts like the whole \\"italy carnival\\".The Story seems to distant itself from Edmond and get into the sub-plot \\"romances\\". I found my self feeling less sympathetic towards Dantes as the story progessed but more sympathetic towards Albert, Mercedes, Valentine and... Where is jacopo?Dumas leaves out far too much, after spending far too much time building up the story, to let it just die at the end. We all know Valentine is alive, why waste page after page Edmond and Morrel talking about it.. WHEN he could be talking about Haydee more or Franz or albert or Better yet, re-joining mercedes instead of deserting her and finding out if albert is really his son or not. I couldnt understand why Dumas makes you wonder by hints that maybe albert is Edmonds son but does nothing to confirm it. Was this clever in some \\"analyzing way\\"(cant stand analyzing books like this) or was it just a mistake?Ending with Morrel was far too expected(all that build up for what..) and really wasted to much time with the whole \\"wait longer\\" part so it would be clever in someway with his father's waiting. Give me a break. Last chapter made me wonder what made Dumas give up on such a good book. Maybe his publisher was pushing him, or he wanted to just finish it or his reader's were losing interest... Honestly though when i got to the last 2-3 chapters i realized there wasnt another 100 pages and was disappointed after allllll that reading.I wanted to read the unarbridged to know the real story(because i usually prefer the original of books) but when i finished i realized i was better off just reading the abridged because so much of it was meaningless and the ending was horrible to spend so much time on a book to be disappointed.Great Start to a book, not so great halfway in where he is in Italy but it soon picks up to tell of his new fame by doing good acts and becoming friends with his enemies who he is slowly(really slow) making plans to ruin. I thought the Andrea part was pretty smart but it drags on too long. Getting to the end of the book, i thought the ruin of Morcerf, danglars and Villefort's family were genius, but the ruin of Albert and his mother was pathetic and undeserving.Being that Edmond never did trully marry her, i dont think they were in the whole \\"Love till death\\" situation. Would have been better a romance had they fell in love in the end... but I guess the Moral of the French in 1800's regarding \\"Forgiveness\\" is much different than that of our modern time \\"Christianity\\" views, which dumas loves to bring up. I dont see how he could call Edmond a Christian or any the other characters(the bad ones who claim they are) such as it is disgraceful towards the religion.To much Emphases on Edmond being \\"Angel of Revenge\\" and his so called philisohpical views...Book has many Flaws to it, but thats to be expected in such a big book. Cant say its the Best book i ever read but its up there. Have to say \\"Les Meserables\\" was a better french story. Doesnt need 1400 pages to be good... and that story was sad but uplifting as it has good morals to it, while Count of Monte Cristo had very few... unless you think playing God is ok and deciding for yourself the fate of others, who really didnt deserve to suffer but did.... Also thought the \\"wisdom\\" at the end wasnt to smart. ;oOverall i give it 4 stars, since it had a pretty good story and was interesting. Lacked a good conclusion after all those pages.. but makes up for it with the justice right before it. These are all my opinions and im sorry if you dont agree, but i spent too much time reading so carefully in such a short time and so willingly to be disappointed by the lack of another 4-5 chapters to explain the \\"other characters\\" he forgets about, but has so much emphasis early on in, So i cant give it 5 stars. :(IF you had the patience to read Counte of Monte Cristo, read the bible even if you dont believe in it but.. to at least read the interesting stories. IF you Ever hear of Joeseph and Technicolor Raincoat, a play well known, adapted from a bible story) That story is so close in so many ways to this book, i think you get the picture... (and people wonder where such great stories come from... writers have a Sub-conscious too.)Recommend Reading: The Devil's Advocate(not the movie, and has nothing to do with it), By Taylor Caldwell. Les Meserables(unabridged), by Victor hugo. \\"THE BIBLE\\" .... it has sooooo many good stories which Books like THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO originated from. The bible is almost the same size and you get much more from it(story and morality wise)."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"i read this book because i saw the movie and thought it was awesome. the book is very good, too... it moves at a slightly slow pace but the elaborate plots people put into place against each other and the swordfighting and everything are still in place and thoroughly wonderful.the thing that keeps me from absolutely loving this book is the character of valentine de villfort, who singlehandedly sets the women's movement back about a year everytime someone reads this. mademoiselle valentine is so weak willed and insipid a character that she makes my teeth hurt everytime she speaks. she also somehow manages to have less spine than her quadrapalegic grandfather. excuse the pun, but he is actually able to have more direct impact on events through his actions than she is. mademoiselle sugar cube nearly ruined the ending of the book for me, and so i cannot give this a perfect rating. read it, but if you're a feminist, keep a look out for her and try not to let her ruin it for you."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book clearly states that it is abridged on the back cover. I realize it would be helpful if it was stated on this pages title but that just goes to show you that you always need to do your research folks. I can't vouch for this edition specifically but the first version I read was abridged very enjoyable. I do however prefer the unabridged. Also whenever purchasing a book originally written in another language you should always check for reviews about the translation, there are usually multiple translations of various quality from different publishers."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I recommend reading this book -- simply because so many others have read it. At some point a book gains such a critical mass of readers that reading the book is necessary to maintain your level of cultural literacy.Considering only the text, I felt it was very good, but not one of the greatest. I agree with all of the positives cited in the other reviews. Dumas is a master story teller, the tale is coherent and easily visualized. There are however, two drawbacks that ruined the book for me. Firstly, the story is so contrived that it completely destroys any suspension of disbelief. Secondly, the story is so predictable that you can see what's going to happen several hundred pages in advance. Other than these two annoyances, The Count of Monte Cristo is about perfect."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"i don't know if this is the best translation but i enjoyed it. it was very long which i never regretted. its one of those books that stays with you forever"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I absolutely love this book. It is an amazing story that inspires and compels. Love, intrigue, revenge, wealth, determination -- it's all here."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"At first I was only reading this book because someone had recommended it to me. But then, as I read, I began to take my own interest in it. Although I am only 13, it was easy enough to understand, and a very, very, very good book. I recommend it only to serious readers, however. I myself am a very serious reader, and was considering putting it down because I was having a little trouble getting through some slow parts in the book. If you think you'd have trouble 'getting through it' then I suggest that you don't read this book. It's a classic story about a man done wrong who comes back to wreak havoc on those who wronged him. I am dead serious that you should NOT read this book if you don't want either a challenge or a good read, or don't think you'd be prepared to deal with it. It has a complicated interworking of plots, three or four at a time. So don't read it unless you think you can deal with it. If you think you can, then be prepared to read a really great book!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"From the Frenchman who wrote 'The Man In The Iron Mask' comes 'The Count of Monte Cristo', an intriguing tale of adventure, romance, thievery and everything in between. Bittersweet, sad and touching. You really can relate to the characters and the settings are ever-changing and filled with variety. Great for readers of all ages is the abridged version. The unabridged one may be taxing for some. So if you're an avid adventurer or an aspiring writer looking for ideas, tCoMC is a must-have.I'd even go as far to say this is the best book I've ever read."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is perhaps one of the best books I've ever read. I cannot say this for certain because of the doubts that arose in my mind whilst reading it; however, I felt that each chapter was better than the one before it, and the book has 117 chapters in all! That is why, even though I have some complaints regarding this book, I think it does deserve four stars, because one quality of richness is able to eliminate any deficiencies one may find.I cannot refrain from being critical of the fact that Edmond Dantes changes so drastically - from a nave young lad to a supreme being who has an \`infallible' scheming mind. Alexandre Dumas doesn't do much to attenuate the effect that such a radical change in the personality of the main protagonist may have on the reader. It is true that Dantes spends fourteen whole years in the Chateau d'If, but it is only in the very first parts of the book that this suffering is portrayed; the revenge takes many, many more pages to be effected than the imprisonment and the madness itself. It should be the task of the author to keep reminding the reader of the real internal suffering of Dantes more, or at par, than emphasising his feelings of revenge. On the other hand, such a well constructed plot is nothing less than admirable - one would think that only God could plan events so ably, making things happen to other people and being ready to see to the consequences as Dantes does. This is, according to me, the marvellous side of The Count of Monte Cristo - a character who, although quite inconsistent with the initial portrayal of his personality, has the opportunity to show his genius through such a strong feeling as vengeance.Another element I don't like in certain classics is the too-frequent mention of suicide, which is shown as something easily done or easily decided upon, just like this being the consequence of someone's whim. Maybe in the past centuries this act was more commonly done to protect one's honour, however, I will still insist that suicide shouldn't be so commonly mentioned, especially not as it is in this book, where more than one character resorts to it. It is on this point, however, that I was mostly struck in the whole load of Dantes' reflections, or more exactly, in his reflections made during the concluding chapters. He realises that life has a meaning and that it is to be preserved, so he eventually becomes a life-giver instead of a life-taker. Dantes finds true value in the words \\"wait\\" and \\"hope\\" - something that, when one reads the whole book, will understand in the same depth as Alexandre Dumas does, the latter being the real mind behind this great work."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Most people you run into say the idea of trying to escape from prison is a bad thing. This isn't the case in Alexandre Dumas' book The Count of Monte Cristo, where our hero Edmond Dantes, is thrown into one of the darkest, dirtiest dungeons in all of France.Edmond Dantes, a carefree young sailor, who it seems will soon be captain of his very own ship, wants nothing more than to be able to marry his fianc&eacute;, Mercedes and settle down.Sadly this will not come to pass, for Edmond becomes the victim of other men's ambition, greed, and envy. His enemies each have a different reason for making him want to disappear, but only when they come together do they decide what they will do.They devise a wicked plot to frame poor Edmond and falsely accuse him of being a traitor. He is sent to the horrible dungeons of Chateau d'If, to spend the rest of his life in a lonely cell.However during his long imprisonment he meets the \\"Mad Priest\\" Abbe Faria, who takes him from the brink of insanity and teaches him geometry, chemistry, history, algebra, and many other skills. He then tells Edmond of a secret treasure on an island known only as Monte Cristo. Soon after that Edmond escapes prepared to take his revenge. He finds that those who wronged him had gained enormous power and now lived in Paris.So backed by his newfound fortune, he decides that it is time for Paris to get a visit from The Count of Monte Cristo."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"i am a great fan of classics. this book betrays the moral of revenge, an although it is well written it certainly does not come CLOSE to Phantom of the Opera by Gaston Leroux, which is in fact my favorite book. and i forgo to mention i am only12 years old."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I have just finished reading this for the umpteenth time. . . . I can see all my notes in the margins from the many other times I've read it. Afterward I read the critical essay in the front, which stated that Dumas was good at plots, but not very good at character. I _disagree_. They said that the count changed, but with no satisfactory explanation of his change of character; and that the change of character (into a vengeful / resentful person) was not plausible. I don't agree. I have actually seen people in my own life who changed in exactly the same way. Also, there was certainly a satisfactory explanation!I think my favorite character is Albert. I wish there was more about him. Albert is sarcastic; has a great sense of humor; is fun-loving, intense, loyal, and intelligent. He can also be rash."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I bought this book off Audible.com and have been listening to it on my daily 1 1/2 hour commute. There are many days that I pull into the parking lot at work or my garage at home and just can't turn off the recording.

It was interesting in my bookclub to hear all of the different plot lines left out of the various abridged versions. Some of them were pretty pivotal! I'd stick with this great version."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I've never been disappointed by a Dumas book, and this one is certainly no exception. With a gripping and intricate plot situated in a turbulent time in French history, THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO represents one of the the most widely recognized and important books of all time. More subtle and serious than the swashbuckling THREE MUSKETEERS, this one really speaks to the soul with highly emotional and real ethical dilemmas. Full of adventure, suspense, love, and drama, this book is hard to put down for the entire 1300+ pages. Even though you probably already know the basic jist of the story, don't hesitate to pick this one up. Knowledge of the outcome doesn't take away anything from the enjoyment of reading this top-notch novel. I can't speak to the abridged version, but I can't imagine it could be nearly as good, as the detail of this story is part of what makes it so gratifying.The best thing about this book is certainly the character of Edmond Dantes. Perhaps the best character in all of literature, the Count of Monte Cristo is a real delight. He represents everything you like about a hero to the extreme. Mysterious, powerful, intelligent, and caring, the Count is what drives this book. Watching as his absurdly complex, but brilliant, schemes for vengeance come to fruition represents one of the most enjoyable reading experiences to be had. While many of the characters in the book are great, they are all completely overshadowed by the immense figure of the Count.Alexandre Dumas makes numerous political statements in this book. Very satirical about the nobility, politics, and high society in general, this book represents the cultural tendencies of the time. Published during the reign of King Louis-Philippe, during a time of political unrest, uncertain future, and revolutionist ideas, this book was certainly well-received by some but not by others. Only a couple of years after this book's publication, the Second French Republic was founded under which Louis Napoleon Bonaparte was elected president. So, the conflicts we find in this book between the royalists and the republicans were still in evidence during its writing.I digress. This is a truly excellent book that shouldn't be missed by any fan of good literature. Don't let the length scare you away, as it is not wasted space and creates a wonderfully complex and beautiful story. Give yourself a month and read this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I purchased the book for a present for my son.He was very pleased with the book."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"One of the best pieces of fiction that I have ever read.

Do not question...buy it!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is probably the best revenge story ever written. As the back cover of the story states, \\"On what slender threads do life and fortune hang.\\" Edmund Dantes knows something about those threads. A promising sailor, he is arrested, thrown into prison, and succumbs to hopelessness. From there, he meets a friend, gains a boundless inheritance, and soon finds himself in a position to obtain his revenge on those who caused his predicament. The tone, like most Dumas books, is simple, elegant, and witty. Why I call it the best is that it is a revenge story, but it also involves the subtle emotions involved in going about revenge. How revenge can go wrong, who revenge forces you to leave behind, who you attempt to emulate in casting judgement on your fellow man.1200 pages is quite a long novel, but it moves quickly, I'm currently reading it a second time, more to refresh background details and characters. There are plenty in this novel, who act like real people, with distinct personalities and flaws. The count himself lives a life of luxury which modern people can still be jealous of. Rome, Paris, and Marseille are visited with great detail, for those of us who like to travel on a budget. As the count begins to succeed in his vengance towards the end of the novel, you may be surprised about the outcome.Dumas, a prolific writer, wrote many novels. Those that like this would do well to move on to The Three Musketeers and it's sequel, which supply similar historical action and quick dialogue. The investment there is even greater, probably working out to 3500 total pages of narrative. Exciting, yes, but not many have that sort of time to invest. Count of Monte Cristo is self-contained. If one was to read just one novel by Dumas, this would be it. This is a famous author at the height of his powers, telling a self-contained story about destitution, fortune, and the nobility between."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"\\"Only weak minds see the future in a black cloud\\" this is my favorite Count of Monte Cristo's remark, this and other similar pieces of wisdom kept me riveted to this great long read. Montecristo is a long consectrated piece of classic literature and for me is useless to rate it as good or bad, it is better to give a personal impression about what one felt after finishing its almost 900 pages. In my opinion this novel is about personal relationships, how can be fostered and then easily destroyed due to jeaulosy and personal ambitions. The ideas of spirituality, material ambition, fair revenge and Divine blessing and punishment hover over the plot all the time. The plot begins with one focus, the transformation of Edmond Dantes into the Count of Montecristo due to misfortune arising from a personal treason, and then shatters into small stories with many different characters, each and every one of them, related one to another due to events told throughout the storyline. On the final chapters the novel recovers the single focus, the idea of justice, in order to conclude in an ending based on moral reasoning. The story unfolds at the post-Napoleonic era in France."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Among the best books I've ever read. It grabs you in the first pages and you're hooked.

This classic has it all. I am amazed."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Alexander Dumas has weaved all the characters so well and I would say this is one of the gems in the history."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is my all-time favorite book. It's compelling, fast-paced, intriguing, romantic, heart-wrenching, and most of all -- the adventure of a lifetime. Alexandre Dumas is one of the most brilliant storytellers of all time. Just as you think you have the plot figured out, a new twist surfaces. Just when you think it couldn't get any better ... it does. Witnessing the transformation of Edmond Dantes into the enigmatic Count of Monte Cristo is both fascinating and tragic. It is, of course, the consummate tale of revenge. But how sweet is that revenge! And how harrowing. Just as fascinating as the Count himself is the cast of supporting characters. You will remember them all long after you've finished the book. Who can forget the villainous M. de Villefort, deceptive Fernand, beautiful Mercedes, greedy Danglars, mysterious Abbe Faria, noble Maximilian, innocent Valentine, loyal M. Morrel, or wise and gentle M. Noirtier? I could go on and on. Every one of them is intriguing in their own right. Just try to put this book down. It defines \\"page-turner\\". I did nothing but talk about this book the whole time I was reading it, and long afterward. I cannot recommend it highly enough. A must-read."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I think that The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas is one of the greatest works of all time. Edmond Dantes, its protagonist, experiences character change to a degree that few other characters in literature ever achieve. Set in France, near the year of 1815, Dumas sees Edmond quickly betrayed and imprisoned in the Chateau D'if. The story wastes no time. His love is married to another man and he is forgotten to all but the least few of the world. Upon escape, he finds himself the unlikely recipient of a host of wealth. A grand treasure. But Edmond seeks revenge with it.And so the story follows one of the wealthiest men in Europe, bent on gripping the last drop of revenge out of his enemies. Edmond is pleasant, affable, and wise. But his motives are dark. He feels like he is the hand of justice. He even says it: \\"Please believe I've put my task above the mean level of personal vengeance. I am exposing criminals, not for their sins against myself but for their black injustices to others... not only for what they have done but for what they continue to do. They are the ones devoid of all humanity, the ones that profited by the sufferings of others.\\"For anyone not willing to become accustomed to a book written mostly of dialogue, this book will wash over the eyes in overwhelming waves. Not a bad thing, but for those who are willing to push through the learning curve, the book is a masterpiece; it can deepen your life. The dialogue is elegant and flows out of the page and into the reader like courses in a $400 meal. Word after word, delicious.Few other novels in literature stand equal with Dumas' masterwork. This is a classic so far beyond what you will find in the Harlequinn section of your local bookstore that it is almost a must for cultured humanity. Even if the book is not to one's taste, it should be seen and admired in the same fashion that the starry night sky should not be ignored. Mankind has very rarely topped this work."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Favorite book of all time in my library. The other views pretty much sums it up. All I can add is you should read this book sometime in your life."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is my favorite book of all time and this was the first time I have read a modern translation that is unabridged. Buss does a wonderful job capturing the essence of this novel. The added scenes in this unabridged edition also adds a lot of background and clarifies many ambiguous events. This edition reads much more smoothly and coherently than the original 1850s translation and I'd recommend this translation to all of my friends and family."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I will not give a description of the book like everyone else. i am not a writer. i did however enjoy reading this book. and if you are looking for a classic novel to put under your belt, this is a good one to do it with! loved it!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Old world type thriller. Definitely better than the movie. Talk about revenge being best served cold. This is the epitomy of that."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Not your too-boring-to-read classic, this adventure will definitely keep your interest. The story line is well known. Edmond Dantes returns from a job at sea at age 19 to the promise of a beautiful bride and captainship of the vessel the next time it sails, only to have others send anonymous allegations about him to the crown prosecutor, who has his own reasons for Dantes to disappear. So, in Marseilles of the early 1800s, Dantes, without trial or due process, finds himself for reasons totally unclear to him, in the dungeons of an escape-proof prison. From his first moments imprisoned, Dantes vows to avenge his undeserved incarceration. Plot description stopped here to avoid spoilers, but be ready for a wild ride, unrequited love, riches and poverty (one or the other sometimes coming surprisingly quickly), locales primarily in France and Italy, but on the sea and in the islands, too. There are notorious bad guys, good guys who get their just rewards, and bad guys who do, too, as well as love, death, friendship, betrayal, politics at its worst, duplicity and ulterior motives, and moral goodness and, uh, not-so-goodness. There are the sticky issues of vengeance - its propriety and appropriate degree, and questions of wisdom/knowledge and divine representation Descriptions and characters are terrific. Dumas' literary references and some points of geography, politics, and monetary denominations and their relationships went past me, but those modest issues aside, I found it a truly special read for both its writing (in the Penguin Classics modern translation - easier to follow than older translations) and a story line that keeps the reader completely engaged. Is it worthy of \`classic' status? In spades. A fine addition to the short list of the finest books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I must say, this is one great book. A real classic, that in spite of being written a long time back, is still as engrossing and pleasurable as ever. The book is long, quite long. Even so, you do not find it tiresome. It keeps you guessing until the end as the Count of Monte Cristo's plan are revealed bit by bit.My advice - BUY IT! It is a great book, if you are not put off by the large size of the book. You will in all probability forget about the size as you keep reading, and the Count emerges as an enigma. Also buy get yourself a decent translation of the book, and the unabridged version. It makes what is already good better.

At first I wasn't too excited because I knew the book was from the 1800's and I thought it would be a difficult read. I also saw the movie made in 2002 beforehand and remember not liking it too much. None of the movies they have made to this day do the book any justice though.As soon as I started reading it I was instantly hooked. Dumas has a way with words that makes you feel like you are actually there with the count from his downfall to his eventual revenge. The story is epic in scope and the language is easy enough to understand that I had no trouble following the plot. Each of the characters is believable and the subplots fit perfectly in to the overall story. Once I started reading this, I couldn't put it down.I'm now a sophomore in college, and I've read read the book 3 times now. I suspect I'll read it many more times throughout my life.

This is not a story of 'forgive and forget' by any means and does not teach Christian charity and forgiveness.

Each reading rewards me with some new insights, for this is a multi-layered, complex tale that grips the reader from the first few sentences and never lets go.I have several editions of this novel and recently purchased the Barnes and Noble Leatherbound Classic edition because I loved the cover art with the blue, gold, and red colors and motifs.

It helps to have some background in French history (of the Napoleonic era, to be specific) to really understand what's going on.

I called my cousin, who suggested the book to me, every night, and we had detailed discussions of what was happening. I was highly disappointed when I discovered that it was not on my school reading list for this year. If you like dull, informative books with few characters and no suspense or mystery, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK! However, if you are normal, you should definitely read it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The story itself is excellent and gets you involved with the first page you read.

I'm still in love with it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Alexandre Dumas was considered in his time to be the foremost adventure novelist. What he created in The Count of Monte Cristo is so much more. The story chronicles the journey of Edmund Dantes, a young and hopelessly naive sailor as he matures into the worldy and cynical Count bent on revenge. Had Dumas ended there, he would have written a stupendous and sweeping saga of adventure and drama. The greater relevence of the story is in its moral telling: Edmund Dantes regains his humanity and learns to live again. Here is a story of spiritual redemption, told against the backdrop of post-Napoleanistic France. It is a tale of love, of loss, of revenge, and of the rekindling of the heart. While the unabridged story is long, it is best enjoyed while seated in front of a fire, with a warm beverage in hand.

The characters seem to come to life as The Count goes thru his trials and tribulations. This has it all: Adventure,suspense,joy, tragedy ,Love , hate and Let's not forget Revenge.

Edmond Dantes is a young sailor who has everything he needs in life. He has a wife and a large amount of money to start a family. He is betrayed by his friends and sent to the dreaded Chateau d'If, and is imprisoned for life. Edmond thinks his life is over, so he swears vengeance to all who betrayed him. Edmond makes a miraculous escape and puts his plans into motion. He is determined to gain vengeance and nothing thrown in his way will stop him. He adopts the name Count of Monte Cristo and becomes friends with the ones who betrayed him. He gains his vengeance slowly by revealing little secrets about each of them, while revealing nothing at all about him. This is a story of a man who was wrongfully accused, and was able to escape and return the favor to his friends. The Count of Monte Cristo is an amazing book by Alexandre Dumas, and it is also one of his best."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Alexander Dumas was an early 19th century writer who would be considered a writer of suspense novels or thrillers today. He wrote in the Romantic style of the day, but he wrote adventure novels that became popular bestsellers. The escape into the past, especially the reign of Louis XIV, or the Napoleonic Wars, was fictionalized and romanticized. One can imagine the mulatto French writer, mind off into a world of adventure and a quill pen writing endlessly as he burned the midnight oil. Escapist literature, it seemed, was well received in France. His novels enabled Dumas to live an extravagant lifestyle which resulted in his demise. He died penniless because he had spent so much of his money on women, alcohol, card games and pursuits of pleasure.Dumas most recognized work is The Three Musketeers but &quot;The Count Of Monte Cristo&quot; is his best work. It is his most well written, his most expressive, psychological and deepest work of fiction. It is not just a revenge tale. Ultimately, it sends a message against taking revenge and living a life of virtue. The hero, Edmond Dantes, is a young man in the French navy, who has jealous enemies. He is accused of aiding Napoleon's escape from his island exile, and sentenced to life imprisonment in a gruesome island prison (like a French Alcatraz). His fiancee, Mercedes, is left alone to grieve his terrible misfortune. During his imprisonment, Dantes befriends an old man who inspires hope in him and moreover, shows him a map of treasure worth thousands. Dantes escapes the prison and finds the treasure, becoming a powerful and wealthy Count.Finally, Dantes, in his guise as the Count of Monte Cristo, extracts revenge on his enemies, especially when he finds out Mercedes has married his worst enemy and birthed a son. The last parts show Dante at his most inhuman, as his revenge is manifested, he realizes he is losing his humanity, and even Mercedes no longer sees the good man she once saw. Mercedes and Dantes do not end up happily ever after, nor married, as films often portray. Their tragic parting is a reminder to Dantes of his flaw of revenge. The novel is poignant, well written, a classic sure to enthrall French literature fans as well as fans who love to curl up with a great book of meaningful adventure."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"somehow i managed to get out of school without ever having read this book. what a bummer, because i truly loved it! i couldn't put it down! i even brought it with me in the car and read it at the red lights. i started reading it because the movie was coming out and i thought i would just never get to it if i saw the movie first. but i waited, read the book and just saw the movie last nite. the book is better because it is more detailed, but the 2002 movie version is worth the [money], on its own. it's different enough from the book that those who have read are still entertained. and vice-versa to those who have seen the film...READ THE BOOK, TOO! it's wonderful and i had a lot of fun reading it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Last year my grandfather recommended this book to me. I snorted, thinking, yeah right, I highly doubt I'm gonna read a book like The Count of Monte Cristo any time soon. But after I picked up the novel and actually started to read it, I slowly became more and more fascinated with the plot. As a 12 year old reader I struggled with parts of the book, finding them dull and tedious, but the struggle is worth it in the end!Alexandre Dumas creates a fabolous tale of revenge and hate in which Edmond Dantes, a young sailor in love, is betrayed by three men of power. Edmond wastes 13 years of his life in the Chateau d'If, a terrible prison in which Edmond loses faith and all chances of ever being with his love again. While there, Edmond learns of a treasure buried on the island of Monte Cristo, and creates a master plan to seek revenge on his enemies, if and when he escapes.I highly recommend this book, and if you're too lazy to actually pick it up and read it, at least go and see the movie!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I was surprised how brilliant this book was. After the first few chapters the story was so compelling that I could hardly put it down. Dumas has the art of telling a story whilst placing it in the context of history and making the historical characters believable.Each character seems real wth flauxs and all. A wonderful story perfect for everyone to read and perhaps easier than the Three Musketers and the Man in the Iron Mask."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Everything about this book is good. I can't think of one negative thing to say about it.The story and charactors were fantastic. The level of the writing and mastery of the language are without equal.Alexandre Dumas writes and tells a story like no other.This is one book I can guarantee you will like."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book is excellent, the plot is captivating... I can't say enough about this book that already hasn't been said. I only regret that I haven't read the unabridged edition yet.My only complaint would have to be the numerous spelling mistakes. Examples would be, misspelling a character's name in the character list in the beginning of the book... and throughout the book simple words such as was or house are typos. These mistakes distracted me somewhat, because I had to stop reading and figure out what the word was supposed to be... but otherwise the book is great."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Probably the best story I ever read. It had just about every quality one could have in a book. Everything fits so perfectly, and it's almost as close as pure genius as it gets. There are many classics that can be compared, but sometimes there are certain books that appeal to one more than others......I guess this is mine."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"A great book, my favorite to date, full of passion, love, vengence, and insight into human nature. The reviewer who said it's the &quot;reworking of a true story&quot; may be factually correct (I personally don't know) but it is irrelevant. The story is good but the writing is GREAT! It could have been the story of anything. Dumas' insight into the human mind and his style of writing, and his use of suspense is what makes this book a five star, not merely the story."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Truly the best book that I have read in my whole life. I have been able to have so many nights in which I would lie in bed for an hour just pondering the great ideas about the human nature that this book inspires.

What else can I say? Well...I actually could go on and on, but I am sure if you are reading this, you know already how great this book is!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This novel by Alexandre Dumas is an amazing example of French literature. The way that Dumas weaves the story of Monte Cristo with those of his enemies leaves the reader spellbound at the end.

It is one of the best novels that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Other reviewers have noted, correctly, that this is one of the greatest novels of all time. So let me add a plug for this particular edition: Robin Buss's translation is the first in perhaps in century to render the _full_ text in English, and it sparkles from start to finish. Even if you own an &quot;abridged&quot; copy of this brilliant novel already, pick up Buss's translation and read the whole story for the first time."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I have just finished reading this, which in my opinion is the best book in the world. Everything about it is amazing. The plot is captivating and fulfilling. Dantes's intricately planned vengeance on the men who ruined his life is so detailed and amazing it leaves me speachless. I love how the book leaves hints of future events and things which at one point may not make sense. Later, however, their purpose is revealed and they help the reader to understand the current events as well as show the how the past, present, and future of Edmond Dantes's life is connected. All those who have given this book 1 star are simpletons who were forced into reading it and never even tried to appreciate it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"when i was 10 years i read this book. my auntie gave it tome as a present in my birthday. i read for five times then istill remember each part of that book.

Dumas brilliantly confronts themes pertaining to nearly all facets of human existence including that of justice, revenge, love, friendship, greed, jealousy, etc.Despite its vivid detail and striking character development, the novel reads rather easily and quickly. This story has been the inspiration of many great movies, most notably, that of The Shawshank Redemption (1994).Truly a classic and a must read."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is my all-time favorite book. I've read it at least 15 times. This book has something to offer to absolutely anyone that can read -- revenge, romance, betrayal, loyalty, friendship, political intrigue, history, etc. The cast of characters is unforgettable and well developed. The depth and breadth of the revenge plot in this book is unprecedented and unmatched. I wrote a paper on this book for my Revenge Literature class in college. Whenever I have been dissatisfied with recent books and need something really great to fall back on, I pick this book up again and love it just as much."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is my favorite all time book so I was excited to see a Kindle version. After reading it I'm very pleased as I only saw one typo (that I noticed anyway). You will enjoy reading this book thoroughly."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I am incredibly picky about which version of a book I buy. When I went to the bookstore to buy The Count of Monte Cristo, I poured through the text to see if I could find any trace of the word \\"abridged.\\" Since I did not, I purchased the book (Publisher--Enriched Classic--AVOID!!!!). This quickly became my favorite work of fiction, right up there with Les Miserables, the Three Musketeers, and The Phantom of the Opera (I find it interesting that all of my favorite books are 19th/20th Century French Literature...hm.) In any case, after seeing another version of the book and reading the various reviews, I find that my world has been turned upside down because apparently, my edition of this book IS abridged (It's sneaky about it--instead of \\"abridged\\" it says \\"series edited by...\\"). I am both appalled and furious. Having said that, I am quickly going to purchase a TRUE unabridged edition of the book and reread it. Why is this? Well, now to get to my point. This is one of the most amazing stories in the history of literature (behind Les Mis, of course). Mystery, adventure, suspense, betrayal, revenge, the battle and balance between vigilantism and justice, intrigue, romance, wit... what more is there to say about this novel? You truly will not be able to put it down. Now, having said all this, I would also like to say that I, personally, think it would be worthwhile to read it in the original French text--after all, if it is this amazing after it's been sorted through and hashed and translated (which is an imperfect process, I assure you), how mind-blowingly phenomenal must it be in its original languge, with Dumas' true intention and literary style? It is for this exact question that I am going for a Bachelor's Degree in Romance Languages. My life goal is to read Dumas, Hugo, and Leroux in all of their original glory.My point? READ THE BOOK! I also recommend the Three Musketeers and Les Miserables, which you might have guessed if you actually read this whole review."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I have spent hundreds of dollars on this site and have never been provoked to write a review...until now. The Count of Monte Cristo has got to be one of the greatest books ever written. I'm telling you now, read this unabridged version, and it will change the way you look at fiction for the rest of your life. I promise. I'm an avid reader (I teach high school literature) and made it to my late 20's without ever reading this unabridged version. Man am I glad I decided to pick it up and read it. Don't be scared by the number of pages (1245). I absolutely promise you will finish it in no time. I mentioned to the person who suggested I read this version this comment, \\"there is no soul on this earth who would not like this book\\". Pretty intense I know, but do yourself a favor...buy the book, read it, get lost in it, tell other people about it, and love literature. You will not be disappointed. Have fun...I DID!!!!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Wow, I listened to the 37 CD's (47 hours) and couldn't wait for the ride to and from work everyday. Awesome, and John Lee was the BEST reader ever."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Reading an abridged book is like eating cake without frosting. You don't really need the frosting, but the frosting is what gives a cake it's delicious flavor. The Count of Monte Cristo is a book which ought to be read unabridged, if only for the richness and flavor of the text. The evolution of Edmond Dantes from sailor to prisoner to Count of Monte Cristo is enthralling. Alexander Dumas's book is captivating. It is hard to set aside CoMC, as the characters are extremely interesting and well-developed. It's not like the antagonists are straight-up bad guys with no redeeming qualities, they are just people who make bad choices and act out of self-interest.Essentially, the moral provided in this HUGE tome is that revenge is a dish best served cold. In order to understand why I say this, I shall provide some backstory. Three men known to Edmond Dantes, all jealous of him in some way, one wants his job, the other wants his girlfriend, plot a way to put Edmond Dantes in prison. Their plan works and Dantes is arrested. He's thrown in prison without a trial. Dantes spends awhile in jail and thinks of nothing but his revenge. Eventually, Dantes escapes and becomes the Count of Monte Cristo. Luckily, for the reader we get to see the entire evolution of Dantes, we see him in his darkest moments as well as in his crowning glory. His revenge is most apt.I highly recommend this book for anyone who is looking to be transported into another time as well as for someone who is looking to fall in love with well-developed characters. There are many editions out there, I recommend the Robin Buss unabridged translation published by Penguin Classics. Buss's translation is fantastic and readable, the phrasing is not awkward at all, as in other translations. Also, Buss's translation includes all of the naughty bits - i.e. one sex scene, some drug use, and a dash of homosexuality."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This review is for the Kindle edition ASIN: B002RI9KL8. Don't get any other Kindle edition, even though they might be cheaper. This is complete and unabridged and with a superb modern translation by Robyn Buss."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I rarely read books because I am more into TV but my cousin lent this book to me when I saw about 16 yrs old and I could not put it down, I stayed up all night for 2 nights just to finish it cause I was hooked, it has so much suspense and its very very clever. Like i said I rarely ever read books but this one I actually read twice, maybe like a year later, and if I can find it again I will definatley read it now cause its been about 10 years or so. Oh and I was so excited when the movie came out but it disappointed because it left so much out and it was not as action and suspensed-packed like the book, which is usually the case I guess but it really left huge chunks out. Anyways bottom line....READ IT!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Who wouldn't want to be The Count of Monte Cristo? A god-like creature, master of disguise, wealth beyond the dreams of avarice, extremely handsome, expert marksman, expert swordsman, philosopher, apothecary, highly moral, (carrying out God's work of vengeance, not his own) unimpeachable manners, speaks many languages, can quote both Roman and Greek mythology and philosophers from Cicero to Plato, in fact is an expert on every subject under the sun, never lies and is never wrong. (p.1027) A perfect human being who loves young girls in a fatherly way, kisses his slave on her forehead, acted as guardian angel to 17 year old Valentine and go-between for her and her fianc&eacute;.I would not want to see the film of this book, no earthly creature could match up to the mysterious, romantic, mythical figure of The Count of Monte Cristo. Imagination is far far better. This wonderful man takes on all the various shapes and forms of his different disguises, he is so clever it takes your breath away. Oh, if only we could get away with that! Oh, if only we had half his skill to get back at our enemies the way he did. It makes one's mouth water to think of it. Delicious!Men are turned on by this book because it is full of adventure, the ultimate \\"Boy's Own\\" story. Women are turned on by it not only because it is thrilling but because it speaks to the fairy tale longing, (Cinderella) of finding the perfect man..... He doesn't exist girls and boys, sad to say, it is just a fantasy.In the beginning, even though far fetched, (the escape from jail, the treasure) one goes along for the ride, but towards the end of the book Dumas gets a bit carried away. The fantasy good as it is becomes a bit hard to sustain, the magic cure-all drops, the murderous step-mother nobody suspects, the crippled grandfather blinking in Morse code, and then of course the almost Shakespearean ending of the star crossed lovers. All stretching the imagination to the limit, but loving it being stretched, and rejoicing in the thrilling ride.I enjoyed the book enormously and found it almost impossible to put down for all the same reasons everyone else did. It is so well written and the pace never stops. I particularly enjoyed the scene described when Albert and Franz came to watch the carnival with Monte Cristo and Franz asked The Count if he could obtain a window overlooking the Piazza del Popolo where there were to be two executions at the start of the festivities. The coolness with which Monte Cristo explains that the program has been changed, in a \\"tone of voice\\" Dumas says, \\"as though he were reading the personal column.\\" (p.383).\\"Hum! The first will be mazzolato, the second decapitato. Yes, this is what was originally intended, but I think that since yesterday there has been a change in the order and conduct of the ceremony. .......they were speaking of some kind of stay of execution to one of the two men...... That means you will be denied a guillotining but you still have the mazzolata, which is a very curious form of torture when you see it for the first time - or even the second; while the other, which in any case you know, is too simple, too unvaried. There is nothing unexpected in it. ..... Ah come now, don't talk to me about Europeans where torture is concerned. They understand nothing about it.

After all those years, a new king has been crowned.Check it out for yourself. The Count is one of the greatest characters, so join him in this long gripping tale of revenge! My words cannot do justice! It's a shame it took me 30 years to stumble(blind luck) onto this gem."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"NOTE: I really hate that Amazon includes reviews from several editions of the same book under one heading. Some editions are abridged for this novel, and that truly is an injustice and the reviews show that. The Oxford Classics version - which I read - is an UNABRIDGED version, and my review is based on that.This story revolves around Edmond Dantes, a young man who seemingly has everything going for him. His employer has much regard for him and is about to put him as captain of his own ship, he is about to marry the woman he loves, all is right in Dantes world. Unfortunately, this type of happiness and success breeds jealousy and envy, and Dantes finds himselft falsely accused and imprisoned. He does escape, and therein the true tale begins.The story weaves back and forth and entangles lives - but central is the thirst for revenge. Dumas certainly has a way of telling a story, even a long one, and keeping it interesting a fresh. There are twists and turns and an entire host of interesting characters. One moment I found myself cheering for Dantes and the next I was hoping he wouldn't do what I thought he would. However, one can never be too sure of what might happen next or where the story might go.I had put off reading this novel because of the length for so long, and I now regret having done that. Although the tale of revenge is an old one, Dumas has managed to weave a story filled with mystery, adventure, and excitement with just a touch of romance - what more could a reader possibly want?"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is one of those classics that not enough people know about. It has all the great twists and turns that make reading exciting. I can't put it down!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"If Amazon allowed six stars, this book would still deserve seven. It is utterly enthralling, captivating, ensnaring (three words meaning nearly the same thing). I must not have eaten on the three days it took me to read the entire book (1344 pages, my edition), and I read slowly and deliberately. 'Nuff said!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I don't know if I read this exact edition since there are other translations. I read the one with the cliff on the front of it. So, poke around and find that edition. I think it was the Penquin classic.In any case, here are a few reasons why you should by and read this book:It's got everyting in it, imprisionment, big crazy love, nasty people and thrills a go-go.Never mind the fact that the book is very thick and makes you look smart.It's basically a soap opera with a French accent. Like the whole General Hospital Luke and Laura except slightly diffferent.This is a big story and you will find it hard to put it down once you get all the pieces in motion.So, read it. If you hate it, throw the book at someone you dislike. You're sure to do some damage."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Alexandre Dumas' novel The Count of Monte Cristo tells the story of a promising young sailor, Edmond Dant&eacute;s, and his transformation into the Count of Monte Cristo after being wrongly imprisoned for life in one of France's most infamous and brutal prisons, the Chateau d'If. The bulk of the plot follows Dant&eacute;s' life after his miraculous escape from prison, as he ruins the lives of each of those responsible for his torment.The story begins with a teenage Dant&eacute;s receiving the position of captain upon the Pharaon, a trading vessel stationed in Marseilles, France. This position allows him enough money to finally marry the love of his life, Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s, which enrages Fernand Mondego, a fisherman who is also after Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s' heart. Mondego, with the help of Monsieur Danglars, a sailor jealous of Dant&eacute;s' position as captain, decides to write a letter to Monsieur de Villefort, chief magistrate, denouncing Dant&eacute;s as a man guilty of treason, as he supposedly still supports Napoleon Bonaparte's regime as evidenced by a letter he was supposed to hand to Villefort's father. Dant&eacute;s is then sentenced to life in prison, where he meets the Abb&eacute; Faria who teaches him everything he needs to know to become an aristocratic Count, enabling him to execute his revenge. What follows is an adventurous tail of one man's story as he wreaks havoc on those responsible for his imprisonment.After seeing the movie based on this story and hearing from others how influential the novel is, I decided to give the seemingly enormous 400-page book a shot. Unfortunately for me, I accidentally chose the abridged version (the normal book is over 1000 pages) and could only enjoy the book for short time, as I finished it within a week. Dumas' unique writing style and uncanny ability to tell a story make The Count of Monte Cristo an easy and suspenseful read. Dumas excellently develops each character so the reader can truly understand the motives for their actions and combines each individual story line in a way that is, albeit confusing and at times hard to follow, amazingly interesting. Every character is somehow intertwined and each plays a unique role in contributing to the downfall of others within the story. More importantly, after finishing the novel, readers come away having learned a lot about human nature and life in general.Those thinking they will find the book similar to the movie be warned: it is much, much better. Whereas the Hollywood version of the story focuses on the love between Mercedes and Dant&eacute;s, the novel incorporates no such story line after Dant&eacute;s' escape. Furthermore, the novel is much more intricate in plot, as more central characters are incorporated into the story and tons of seemingly small details and side stories come together to play a crucial part in The Count's quest for destruction. The central story line, writing style, and themes of the novel all come together to make The Count of Monte Cristo a great read."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I have no words to describe this extremely well written book. After finishing this book, you will hopefully have the same feeling. That's how good this book is.It's not a brain teaser but none the less keeps the reader engrossed until the very end with it's well narrated story. If you are thinking about reading this book, go no further on reading anymore reviews. Simply pick up a copy of your own and start enjoying this great read. You will have difficult time putting it down....this much is guaranteed!!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Edmond Dant&egrave;s, framed of treason by some people he thought he trusted, seeks revenge. After becoming promoted to captain at the early age of nineteen, Edmond is envied by many, Mondego is in love with Edmond's fianc&eacute;e, Danglars wants the position of Edmond, and Cauderousse despises Edmond and his fortune. The men plot to have Edmond thrown in jail, and so he is. There he meets Faria, a priest who teaches him the secret to a treasure, hidden on the island of Monte Cristo. When Edmond breaks free, he finds the treasure, and with it he develops elaborate plans from what he finds out about those who betrayed him, and takes away everything from them, one by one. This is an excellent book, recommended to readers who enjoy examining complicated plots.This book did indeed have a very interesting plot. Edmond first finds Cauderousse and receives important information about the other two people who framed him. He becomes a great friend of Mondego who is very powerful and wealthy by saving his son from bandits. He learns that Mondego received his wealth by betraying a friend. His deceitfulness wrecks his reputation, his wife (Edmond's former fianc&eacute;e) and son abandon him and commits suicide.The characters are also very interesting, being very unique and realistic. Edmond at first is a young man having great honesty and friendship, one you would not expect to take revenge so severely. He almost develops a complete different personality as the Count of Monte Cristo, a grudge-bearing and angry man hidden under a mask of kindness. One of Edmond's targets, Danglars, may be described as greedy and selfish. It is through this trait that Edmond punishes him and makes him bankrupt.Aside from having an interesting plot, this book also is suspenseful in many ways. When Edmond attempts to escape from jail, he is thrown unexpectedly into the sea. Another suspenseful scene is when Edmond watches as a ship is torn apart in the storm. This story may also be suspenseful in other ways beside intense action. When Edmond follows through with his plots of revenge, it is exciting to see what will happen next.This book is an excellent and challenging work, good for almost any reader who enjoys classic novels taking place in the past. This particular classic is one which challenges the work of Edgar Allen PoeI. Leung"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"When I first started this book, I thought, \\"Oh, I'm never going to finish!\\" That was very wrong. This masterpiece of a novel is next-to-impossible to put down. I became so involved in the book that, when I finished, I felt sort of deprived. I wished the book would continue for another 1,000 pages. By the way, if you're going to read this book, don't read the abridged version. It is NOTHING like the unabridged, original copy."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Among adventure novels I've read, CoMC stands head and shoulders above the rest. A long book, I wish it was double its length. There is romance and jealousy here, yet not a mere meringue that takes up space without offering substance, but psychologically complex relations that contribute to, and are in turn enriched by, the plot. The character who seems too good to be true is changed by the injustice that befalls him into someone more complex and real. No character is a mere set piece or caricature. The swashbuckling needs to be there, and is wittily and strategically placed to serve the plot. Here are moral lessons and character studies that could keep a book group talking for a year, but Dumas never preaches, never resorts to being pedantic. Every character is precisely etched, memorable, and as necessary to the story's integrity as any in a Greek drama. I felt toward this book like one feels toward a new love: devouring the time together, resentful of the time apart. Time was measured by how long I could read, and when, and how long it would last. I can't think of a novel I've enjoyed more, on more levels."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Some time back, a friend recommended that I read this book. I am very glad that I have that friend. This book is perhaps the best I have ever read, and I have read A LOT of books.While an extraordinarily long book, I never found myself putting it down unless I had to. It is classic example of a book with every good literary element without unrealistic plots, characters, and events. Everything that happens is plausible (except maybe the Count's money).However, the book can be difficult to understand. I would advise rereading over what you have already covered, or just skimming over the pages you already read. Also, it wouldn't be a bad idea to take notes on who is who and what is happening, because it can get very confusing.Overall, if you want to read a really good novel, this is your best bet. It has something to satisfy everyone, from action to romance to revenge. Not only that, but all of these elements are cleverly woven together in such a way that everything from earlier on comes back to be of vast significance in the later parts of the book, etc. This work is nothing short of spectacular, so get reading!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo stirs the passions of everyone who reads it - so much so that it has been made and remade a half-dozen times in English, a fairly astonishing fact since the Dumas classic is originally en Francais. It is one of the most popular and best-selling novels of history and it is difficult to say whether this book or \\"The Three Musketeers\\" is the most popular novel by Alexandre Dumas, p&egrave;re.The story is set up perfectly by Dumas: Merchant ship \\"Phaeron\\" pulls into Marseilles in 1815. First mate Edmond Dant&egrave;s leaps onto the pier to report to owner Monsieur Morrel that although the ship has returned as planned with goods, Captain Lecl&egrave;re passed away on the journey, leaving Edmund as acting Captain.Morrel immediately promotes Dant&egrave;s to Phaeron's Captain, just before Edmund runs to reunite with his beautiful fianc&eacute;e Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s. Dant&egrave;s, the hard-working son of a commoner, can hardly believe his fortune. He has been promoted to ship's Captain at a young age and is about to marry the most beautiful young lady in town.But something is rotten in Marseilles...Jealousy prompts rivals Danglars (the Phaeron's purser) and Lieutenant Fernand Mondego (also desiring Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s) to conspire to write a secret note to the authorities accusing Edmund of being a Bonapartist traitor.Soldiers come to arrest Edmund at his engagement party. He is hauled before Villefort, an apparently sympathetic prosecutor. Villefort seems kindly until he realizes there actually IS a Bonapartist traitor around... the prosecutor's father. To protect the family name (and his career ambitions), Villefort has our hero put away.Edmond Dant&egrave;s goes from the heights of happiness to the depths of despair - without explanation he is thrown into the darkest, dampest dungeon of France's Alcatraz - the Chateau d'If.For those unfamiliar with the story, it may appear that I have given it all away, but you will find that this is only the setup for the most thrilling tale of hope and despair, vengeance and mercy, nobility and justice and revenge. The story comes complete with exciting sword fights, poisonings, secrets identities, kidnappings, last-second escapes, underground catacombs and formal balls. Especially for a character of two hundred years ago, Dant&egrave;s makes James Bond seem a dullard by comparison.If you have only seen \\"the movie\\" you have not at all had the pleasure of the layers and textures of this sublime story. The 1975 Richard Chamberlain is okay, if truncated, but the 2002 version with James Caviezel is practically an abomination.Are you a \\"book person\\"? Do yourself a favor and immerse yourself in this treasure, and perhaps no other book more deserves a reading of the unabridged version."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This was the first book by Dumas that I've read and I enjoyed it very much.

The 2,400 pages, combined, were read so swiftly,( for me !) I scarcely had time for anything else. I am going to read \\"The Three Musketeers\\"( Modern Library), next. I bought this edition before I knew about the recently published, Penguin Classic Deluxe Edition. I dont know, but I think the Modern Library edition is an abridgement.

Not this one. Sometimes I felt Dumas could have been a Russian novelist, intertwining the lives of noble families to the point where I needed a scorecard. The Count could have gone around with his rapier and pistol and gotten revenge in just a few pages but instead allows his enemies to hoist themselves on their own petards. In the end, their undoing is not just the fine planning and work of the Count but French society itself in the post-Bonaparte years. I didn't want the Count to sail away just like I didn't want the story to close, but his work was done, the virtuous rewarded, and the selfish and greedy punished."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I purchased the Tor Edition Count of Monte Cristo for the Kindle.

This is an abridged version with much of the flavor of the original edited out. I read several chapters and found myself missing much of the writing that connects the story's plot lines and makes the story coherent. Rather than continuing with this edition, I found a more complete, possibly unabridged, edition also for the Kindle.I would not recommend the Tor Edition of the Count of Monte Cristo but recommend to anyone wanting an excellent winter read to find an unabridged version and settle in for a great time."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Simply put, I love this book. What a great book to introduce to students interested in historical adventures, and this one is spot on. It's one of the great adventure novels, with lots of action, well-written characters, important issues, and can be read quickly because of its compelling storyline.

The translator gives good background on the translation, life of Dumas and great footnotes explaining both history of the period and cultural aspects not common knowledge today. This adds greatly to the enjoyment and understanding of the story.I recommend that anyone interested in reading The Count of Monte Cristo not be scared away by the length of the book and purchase an abridged version. The amount deleted results in a disconnected and not nearly as interesting story. I read an abridged version mistakingly bought before purchasing this one and knowing the story from a previous reading was dismayed at the amount which was eliminated. Buy the unabridged and enjoy Dumas' tale of betrayal and vengeance in all its brilliance."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas is an excellent book for people who like classics with an actual meaning to it. This book desribes a man's life and the friends who betrayed him because of their jealousy. As he makes a &quot;comeback&quot; as a completely different and sophisticated man, the Count of Monte Cristo gives no mercy to those who betrayed him. With all this merciless revenge, Dumas shows the real meaning of love and how forgiving may be the solution to your problems. The Count of Monte Cristo is my favorite number one book and I recommend this book to people of all ages!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The depth of Edward Dantes' revenge upon his betrayers is only hinted at in the recent movie. Read the book and you'll be treated to some righteous and yet truly diabolical methods of vengance. The ending in the book is also quite different from the ending of the recent movie adaptation."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"For the shear grandeur of the story, I don't think there's a better book to read than this one. And insofar as the Count is larger than life, he simply wants his life back. Does that give him a blank check on his actions and his morality? Perhaps the urge for revenge is as crippling as the pangs of injustice."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I must admit, I first picked up The Count of Monte Cristo about ten years ago because I liked the cover art (a different edition than this one). Within five minutes of reading it, I was hooked. The next 1,000 pages simply flew by and I literally could not put the book down. For someone who's never read it before, it's an enthralling tale of treachery, despair, hope, and ultimately a quest for vengeance. After finishing &quot;The Count&quot;, I immediately sought out every book by Dumas I could get my hands on (The Three Musketeers, Ten Years After, and The Man in the Iron Mask). They were all exceptional reads, but none of them matched the brilliance of &quot;The Count .&quot;Any reader who enjoys tales of adventure and has a taste for historical novels will love this book. I thought the recent movie version was excellent too, but I highly recommend reading the book first."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Superb, what a tale, I was riveted by the fascinating story, so deep so full of the deepest human feelings. The language is sophisticated and typical of the 19th century when it was written. It is an intelligent book and far more enjoyable than Victor Hugo's masterpiece \\"Les Miserables\\". I read it quickly, it was nearly 900 pages but how fast paced it was and how well the characters were outlined. Dumas is a master storyteller and apart from the authentic retelling of the story in the TV series with Gerard Depardieu there are few stories which compare. It is remarkable by how well they stuck to the storyline in the TV series and how well the characters such as The Count of Monte Cristo, Danglers, Villefort, Mercedes etc were portrayed.The story of a simple sailor who is soon to become a captain and his love for the beautiful Mercedes who he is just about to marry and the terrible circumstances which follow with the framing of the sailor by his supposed friends Fernand and Danglers and the hellish times to follow, he spent 14 years in a dungeon. The suffering which is portrayed so well, its almost as if Dumas himself had suffered so, somehow the book actually gives an inkling of what it would be like to be trapped within a tiny dingy, dark and stinking room for 14 years with no recreation no entertainment noone to talk to and simple the inability to leave the room, madness seems inevitable. The Abbe Faria saved him this, so much love to give to Edmond Dantes, he restores his life. His subsequent enriching and terrible revenge and the need for him to free himself of the suffering of others only to find it hidden in his own depths. It just doesn't get any better than this. Its not often I give 5 stars. Its a miracle, ... To say the least worth every cent and I would have paid four times as much for it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I read this novel a couple years ago, and was absolutely enthralled by it; Dumas' writing style is so clear and concise, and yet it still maintains the beauty of story, which is truly amazing. While poring over these fond memories, I decided I would purchase it, simply so I could keep around at my leisure; I will have to admit to you, this book only gets better the second time around (also an excellent trick any time you're reading a difficult text you can't quite get the hang of), and could truly appreciate the depth of this book. Alexander has definitely crafted one of the true classics of his time, and in my opinion it rivals any its cookie-cutter brethren that are churned out now, and I would strongly recommend this to anyone who is just starting out in classic novels, or who has yet to read it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is the finest piece of literature I have ever read without question. Dumas has a tremendous writing style that is also evident in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; as it is in this offering. This is an epic story of love, betrayal, revenge and perserverence. I could not put this book down at times, it kept me riveted and wondering what would happen next like nothing else I have read. You will not regret reading this novel."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"If you've ever thought life was unfair, you need to read this book. Revenge has never been so complete, and the avenger even has a spiritual awakening at the end. There's sword fights for guys and fancy clothes and romances for the girls. I first read the abridged version in the 8th grade, I read the full version a year later, and I'm reading it again right now. It's really that good. Any crime-ring or revenge themed book you will ever read draws references from this Dumas classic. And hey, there's a movie now too!(p.s. this is coming from a now 18-year-old actress with a very short attention span)"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Dumas' classic paints an engrossing tale of love, treachery, and revenge. This superb book begins quickly, drawing you in to the world of Edmond Dant&egrave;s, a world sacrificed for another's ambition. While he spent years in a forgotten cell, his lust for vengeance grew. When he finally escaped, he carefully and patiently exacted his perfect revenge.This book has many good qualities, some almost too good. Dumas created a fascinating, enthralling plot, complete in every detail. However, there were times when the plot became too detailed, and forced me to slow down and think about what went on. Also, the pace of the book is perfect: as the action unfolds, the book reads quickly, but then slows down again to give importance to the time Dant&egrave;s takes in his quest. For all this, Dumas' masterpiece ranks as one of my all-time favorite books, one I would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"A few years ago I saw the movie Sleepers with Brad Pitt, Jason Patric and Kevin Bacon. It was about a gang of pre-teens who are abused in a reform school, read Count of Monte Cristo in school and vow to take revenge on their persecutors, even if it takes years and years to put their plan into action. This led me to believe that Count of Monte Cristo glorified the concept of revenge. Dumas did so much more than that. He portrayed a life that was completely consumed by the need for revenge and in the end the true message was of regret, not revenge. For me that message transformed this book from an entertaining thriller to a powerful classic. As I have said in other reviews, I have young children and this will be a must read when they are teens. I can tell my children that I believe in turning the other cheek, but this classic illustrates why forgiveness should beat revenge on any given day."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Loved it, and when it was over, I wished it wasn't.

It's got betrayal, love, imprisonment, vengance, action, drama, and comedy. But you can read the synopsis for yourself.More important than the plot of the story is that the reader will learn to love Edmond Dantes, the main character. They will admire his strength, his wits, his arrogance, and the way he learnes from his mistakes.The reader will also learn to completely hate Danglars, Villefort, and Fernand. Every single horrible thing that happens to them, the reader will truly believe is justly deserved, even when Edmond believes it's too much.The writing is also wonderful. The reader will practically be transported to France as they read this novel. The word choice is so magnificent and the sentences flow so well that the reader will feel every emotion that the characters do, and will probably even taste the sweet Parisian air in their mouths.I first read the Signet Classic abridged version, and I thought this novel was great, but then I picked up the unabridged Modern Library version and enjoyed it even more.

That is, until he is accused of being part of the Bonapartist party. On the day he was to marry is fiance, Mercedes, he was taken to the worst prison in the area, The Chateau D'If. No one has ever escaped this prison. He is sentenced to life and spends over 15 years in a cell until he plans an escape. After escaping he goes on to find a treasure he was told about from a man he met in prison. After finding the treasure, he begins helping people around the world, being known as The Count of Monte Cristo.I loved this book, although it was a bit long. The storyline was very exciting and the characters are so real. It's amazing how a man goes from sitting in a prison cell for years with no money at all, to becoming one of the richest people in France. I would definately recommend this book to readers of all ages. If you're looking for a good, exciting book then this is the one for you. The only thing I can complain about is every few chapters it starts getting a little boring, but hang in there becuase it only builds to something even better!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo begins as Edmond Dantes lands in Marseille, ready to marry the love of his life, Mercedes. Within 24 hours his world will turn upside down; punished for a crime he did not commit, he'll be imprisoned in the Chteau d'If for life, stripped of everything he held dear. And so the stage is set for the greatest revenge novel ever written.Swashbuckling novels are a sub-genre of historical fiction. Too easily, the whole genre is dismissed as juvenile reading. The Count of Monte Cristo features two cases of infanticide, a serial poisoner, a stabbing, three suicides, torture, execution, drug-induced sexual fantasies, illegitimacy, transvestism, lesbianism, dramatic soliloquies, references to classical history, the effects of hashish, all in about 1300 pages. Juvenile? I don't think so....This is my favorite book of all time. The unabridged version is the only way to go. The movies have never done it justice. I can guarantee you won't put it down!Once you've finished it, check out The Three Musketeers... the unabridged version ;)"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I would give this book 4 1/2 stars if I could. It is truly engrossing. As many previous readers have warned it WILL keep you up nights when you should really put it down and go to bed to wake up for the morning meeting next day.This story is wonderfully imaginative and intricate. One third of the way into the book (and I'm talking about the Modern Library version with all chapters intact), you wonder why there are so many chapters that ostensibly have little to do with our hero Edmond Dante aka Count of Monte Cristo. The details of where Caderousse end up with La Carconte, the chapters on Luigi Vampa, the chapter on Franz d'Epinay's first encounter with the Count of Monte Cristo? I was slightly baffled as to why Dumas would include them? But I soon understood that every character, no matter how minor, plays some role in the story -- either because they become an important instrument later on in the Count's revenge or they serve to tell us something about the Count (as in Franz d'Epinay's case).From the beginning of the book until Edmond's escape and discovery of the treasure, the reader is well-involved in his story and his life. After he finds fabulous wealth, the reader knows nothing more about this character's inner life. Everything we know about Edmond (and the Count) from then on, is through others. There is a switch in perspective that should have been effective but I found it detracted from the story. Dumas does this of course to convey a sense of mystery surrounding the Count, mystery that is absolutely crucial to his success in gaining revenge. But this sudden break from a mostly single perspective (Edmond's) to many, many perspectives about the Count is distracting, and really breaks the story into two stories rather than one cohesive long tale.The other criticism I have for this book is the amount of repetitive descriptions. I was at times irritated in the beginning at the numerous \\"tremblings\\" and \\"pale with tremblings\\" written about Fernand. Later on, Dumas drums into our heads how \\"mysterious\\" and \\"cryptic\\" and \\"indecphirable\\" the Count is. OK, we get it!!Overall, though I can't criticize much a book that kept me up till 2am for 10 solid days. He certainly did something right! The story is well-thought out, intricate as the plot and subplots can be they tie in (sometimes TOO perfectly), and the characters are well-drawn. And just when I catch myself writing the story off as an action-adventure novel, I run across some of the most exquisite and beautifully noted observations on human behavior I've ever read.So suspend your disbelief (some of the hyperbole on the superiority of the Count and the heroism of certain characters made me roll my eyes), believe in love (for Mercedes more than Haydee (????)), forgive some of the incredulous moments (agree about others' questioning of Edmond's readiness to throw away his revenge plans when he was so close to suceeding and his sudden remorse at the end is also a stretch). Put all those little criticisms aside, do NOT see the movie that just came out, read this book! It is worth the time investment and sleepless nights."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is the abridged version of the Dumas classic.Having not read the original yet, I can only compare itto The Three Musketeers.

In this book they just pick some chapters and piece them together. So what you get is bits and pieces of chapters (and you miss a bunch of veeeeeery important chapters. Read the actual story not this thrift store jigsaw puzzle abridged version. In this book they leave out important characters like Jacapo who helped dantes find the treasure (which isn't even mentioned in this version), Danglars just magically disappears towards the end of this book but in the real one he still is quite critical to the end.

I've not finished yet but it is like reading a new story with some of the same characters. I often wondered how John Ford was able to fit all the excessive verbiage of \\"Moby Dick\\" in to a film of normal length. Then upon seeing the credits from the beginning I see Screenplay, John Ford and Ray Bradbury. That explained a lot.

If you pick the abridged, much shorter version, then you will miss countless secrets, meticulous acts of vengeance, and a great love story.

Yes, it is a long book, but they are pages well worth reading, each and every one."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is a book so famous that almost everyone has heard of it, and many people have read it - or so they think. Even \\"unabridged\\" versions have been abridged - specifically Eugenie's relationship with another woman. This edition is, actually unabridged. Translator commentary and footnotes are interesting, rather than intrusive. It's still a fabulous read."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all times. Definitely read the unabridged version if you have the time (I couldn't imagine what they would have taken out!). A classic filled with adventure, justice, and romance. The author's clarity really places you back in time with a front row seat. Many of the books lessons show that, despite technological advances, humanity's vices and virtues are timeless. Also it's very hard to beat the e-book prices!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The translated version of the Alexander Dumas classic, The Count of Monte Cristo is an engrossing novel of love, hate, revenge, and ultimate triumph. It is a surprisingly readable book, notwithstanding its length (some 1200 pages).

A very good read."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexander Dumas is one of my favorite books. I had to read it for English class and it quickly became one of my favorites.

Makes one reflect strongly on the emotions and ups and down of life. I wish I had realized the cross references were present at the end of the book as it may have clarified a few things.

I read reviews that recommended the unabridged versions and I am glad that I read it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"In short, after reading this book, I have to rate the movie at one star because there was a minimal amount of similarity between the it and the book. The book was brilliant and caused many late night readings when I should be sleeping. I suggest it to everyone that saw the movie first because you will like the book much, much more."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I really loved this book!

It's a classic that everyone ages 10 and up can enjoy. The storyline was great, and the main ideas were kept and recycled throughout the novel."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book is probably my all time favorite. The 1000+ were well worth the read for the amount of life lessons presented. The plot builds slowly and then picks up pace - the last 300 pages were so hard for me to fully appreciate because all I wanted to do was find out how it was all going to end. Try to read this during vacation because having to put it down is so torturous - I tried reading it on my daily commute but truly enjoyed it when I was on a beach and finished the last 600pgs without any interruptions. Beautiful story about love, revenge, patience and the ability to let go."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This novel artfully provides the best elements of any story: Revenge, adventure, love, action...it's all there. A little slow to start but worth giving a try if you love an epic read."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"And yet the workout,in the way of Anna Karenina, or the whole of the Potter series like most quests for agility and strength is one well spent; what Dumas accomplishes in over a thousand pages is an epic story spanning the breath of the human experience. Drenched in the saturated sweetness of the Romantic tradition, the story of intrigue includes conjectures on things from the stock market, to immunization. Serialized, much like any rampant edition of Order and Law in an SUV, it heralds the imagination, in an age before accessibility and technology. Do yourself a favor: read it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I have to say that I have seen all of the movies and I was skeptical that the book could be significantly different. I was very wrong, I listened to the audio book and the narrator was fantastic! The book is beautifully written and this is by far one of the best books of all time!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Even in the movie V for Vendetta, V was watching the Count of Monte Cristo. It was well worth the 3 months of on and off reading. With limited time I was able to squeeze in a 1% here and there. This writing of Dumas is absolutely amazing. His ability to captivate your mind and take you on a journey that involves so many personalities is without a doubt a stroke of genius. Now if we could only get Hollywood to make a movie that follows the book even if it was in two parts it would become an instant classic."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I think Dumas did a great job on this book. I am 16 years old and was given it to read over the summer by my English teacher and I couldn't put it down. I read it all in a couple of days.

I highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"It was one of the best books I've ever read, next to Tolkein's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;.

The magnificent story of Edmond's transformation from a love-struck innocent to a coldly calculating avenger elevated me from a sea of rumpled sheets and tissues to a place of high adventure. His story completely captivated me, and his methods of giving reward to his true friends and exacting careful revenge on his enemies enthralled me.

When he returns to wreak his terrible vengeance on the men who imprisoned him, he is no longer the naive, idealistic Edmond Dantes; he is the cunning, cynical, and fabulously rich Count of Monte Cristo.The complex plot of this book makes it slightly challenging, but the suspense and intrigue more than compensate.

It's the story of Edmond Dantes, who is imprisoned by his enemies. After a miraculous, but very believable escape, he plots his revenge.

This book is everything a modern day novel dreams of being. It contains murder, mystery, love lost and found, suspense, hope, suffering, happiness, sorrow, ...the list goes on.

Just wanted to add a few thoughts.This book was originally serialized in a French magazine back in the 1840s. As a consequence, there are repeated cliffhangers at the end of every chapter. Now I don't mind cliffhangers (hey, they move the plot along) but after 116 of these it got a little old. In addition, some of the character transformations seem implausible and Dumas gets some of his facts mixed up from the early part of the novel (I probably would as well).I could pick bones about some part. What was the purpose of the whole Cucumetto bandit story? Maybe Dumas was saving him for later but he never does. They plot also needs a miraculous set of confluences to happen in say, well, every part of novel. Entertaining, yup, but at times I just said, &quot;Oh come on now!&quot; The character of Monte Cristo is a very interesting one. If he could ever hook up with Hannibel Lector, another guy who has the highest level of expertise in nearly every field and endeavor, the rest of us would be in big trouble.Buy this book and enjoy it. It's really quite fun and you'll learn a lot about French history and culture."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book didnt seem like the type I would like, at the begining I hated it.

Classics do not only thrill and teach, they also live.The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas is a classic.This tale of accusal, love, betrayal, imprisonment, redemption, and retribution, defies genre.Recounting the plot serves no purpose, so I will simply surmise that most readers focus on vengeance at the expense of reward. Edmond Dantes could not have desired living just to kill those who wronged him; he expected to return to those who remained faithful. Here Dumas, using Dantes, Sinbad, Albert and Abbe Busoni, championed a nonviolent stoicism which exposes a person to death to experience life.The Count of Monte Cristo is a vivid potrayal of French life after the Revolution, an epic account of a man's quest for closure and an inspiration for the Shawshank Redemption.

His tone and description of the post-Napoleonic era is incredible. He tells a story that is a classic and in a way that anyone can relate to it.

Hurray for Edmond Dantes!!!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Dauntes a sailor on the verge of of marrying the woman he truley loves. Is betrayed by the people he trusts. And hate and vengance keeps him going throught his time in prison. Dumas describs in detail how he plots and scemes to get his revenge on those who wronged him. How it consumes him every waking hour of his life. He beleves he is doing gods vengence on those who wronged him. But starts doughting it all when little Edword dies unsuspectingly. and how he realizes vengence is for god to do not him, and that this vengence has cost him his happiness all those years.

Being the fact that I am a sucker for those love stories where the guy gets the girl in the end, it was only natural that I would enjoy this book. But the best part about it is the twist in the plot and how eventually The Count of Monte Cristo reveals himself to those who knew him before the self-appointed title.Its a classic by Alexandre Dumas and I do believe that this is one of those books (like \\"Catcher in the Rye\\") that you just have to read in this lifetime!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"It would be a futile effort to try to express in words just how excellent this story is. Stories that have been called &quot;classics&quot; have been labeled as such for a very good reason. I think anybody who has read and liked Tolstoy, Renault, Shakespeare, Leroux, Homer and R.L. Stevenson will enjoy this outstanding tale.I highly recommend that the reader keep a couple of sticky notes and a pencil handy. Be sure to compile a list of names and a brief description for EVERY character introduced...you'll need this reference as events unfold.The book cover/binding itself is rugged and can take a serious beating. For any story that's this compelling and 1400+ pages, the quality of the book itself becomes important since you don't finish such a long story overnight. My book survived the London subways, streets of Paris, German autobahn and my luggage to/from Ukraine--all without any problems.

The best book I've ever read; I'll miss it... I could not tear myself away from this book... My two year-old recognizes it as &quot;papi's book&quot; because I could not put it down.... I kept my wife up with the story and got a chance to relive it that way. She loved it too.Dumas makes you fall in love with his characters, with Mercedes, Edmond Dantes, Abbe Faria, Valentine, Haydee, M.Morrel.... and he makes you hate the bad guys, Danglars, Villefort, Morcef... But in the end you end up doubting just like M. Le Comte....

If for some strange reason you have not read The Count of Monte Cristo do yourself a favor and read it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"In this review, I'm not going to say anything that has not already been said.In a numbered list, I'm going to give my honest opinion, clear up some misunderstandings about this novel, and explain why YOU should read this book.Let's go.1. SUMMARYI wrote a good paragraph summary of TCOMC once, but it doesn't stand up to the official AMAZON summary, shown here:\\"Imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit, Edmond Dantes spends 14 bitter years in a dungeon. When his daring escape plan works, he uses all he has learned during his incarceration to mastermind an elaborate plan of revenge that will bring punishment to those he holds responsible for his fate.No longer the naive sailor who disappeared into the dark fortress all those years ago, he reinvents himself as the charming, mysterious, and powerful Count of Monte Cristo.\\"2. MISUNDERSTANDINGSOne reviewer [PurpleKat] suggested that you should ONLY read this book if you have 3 days to spare, since \\"you won't be able to put the book down, or if you do, you'll move zombie-like through your everyday tasks while your mind stays with the adventures of Edmund Dantes.\\"...I'm sorry, but this isn't a genre piece. It's just not. You WON'T be able to skim through it like a Dan Brown or Stephen King novel.It's just not happening. Too bad, PurpleKat....I guess the main reason young people ignore this book today is because of its length - something close to 1,500 pages of small text.The length may seem daunting to young readers, since the books we read today average in the 200 page mark, if even. But step back a century and the books are a LOT longer.Think of some great novels from the 18th Century: War and Peace, Madame Bovary, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, the Man in the Iron Mask. Those books are looong.They are daunting reads. I'm sure you know the feeling of holding a 4 inch thick, 3 kilo, size 8 print, 100+ chapter book in your hands, or reading all day on your Kindle to find the progress bar reads 3%. It's enough to put off anyone.But, once you get involved in the narrative, the length won't matter. I have NEVER heard of someone not liking a good book because of its length,Basically, this is the promise that Alexandre Dumas makes to you when you start his book:\\"Are you willing to take a leap of faith [and stick with the book through the slow parts]? Or become an old man, filled with regret [for not reading Monte Cristo], waiting to die alone [in shame and embarrassment]?\\"That takes care of length.P.S. Don't even think about buying the abridged version! Trust me, I have read it by accident, and NOTHING made sense. I started to ask myself questions such as \\"Danglars - what? Who is Mercedes?\\"The abridged version is a CHOPPY, CONFUSING, mess.(Like the 3rd Pirates of the Caribbean movie!)3. SHOULD YOU READ IT, WHY?At its heart, The Count of Monte Cristo is not JUST an adventure novel. It's not JUST a love story, or revenge tale, or historical novel.It's all of these and more.Do you want me to tell what it's about?The Count of Monte Cristo is:An epic. Historical fiction. An adventure novel. A mystery novel. An escape story. A love story. A thrilling tale. A cautionary tale. A happy tale. A tale of revenge. A tale of heartbreak and loss. A tale of love. A tale of corrupt officials, innocent maidens, murderers, bandits, prisoners, priests, good men, bad men, corrupt men, noble men, sad men, happy men, mysterious men, geniuses, assassins, lovers, and the man who tried to play God. It tells us that the past is never forgotten, that good men can do evil things, that evil men can do good, that love flourishes in the unlikeliest of places, that revenge is a dangerous and powerful thing, that love can triumph over evil, that your past will always catch up with you, and finally...the thrill of Revenge is sweet!4. CONCLUSIONThree words: Read this book.Thirty-four words: The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the greatest, most electrifying books you will ever read. Full of compelling, driven, and dangerous characters, thrilling adventure, heartbreaking romance, and moving sequences. If you are an accomplished reader, it will have you riveted.5. PRONUNCIATION GUIDE:These are all the accurate, FRENCH, translations of the words. Trust me - I know French, and this is how they are pronounced in the official audio-book from Books on Tape, read by Richard Matthews.Just say \`em how you read \`em.

Reading a 700 page book in size 8 font on tiny pages is a little daunting. This is going to sit on my bookshelf until I get a real sized book."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"First I will say if it was not for the Kindle, I probably would not have attempted to read this book as I tend to stay away from long heavy books in hard to read typeface, however with the Kindle it becomes much easier to read such a book. I will not try to explain the book as many other readers have already done so. The one thing I found a bit difficult was that the same characters had different names and titles, this plus the number of characters made it a little hard to follow in some parts what was happening. Also I am not used to the French terminology which also hindered somewhat my understanding. Nonetheless it is a deep and complicated work which comes together in an interesting and comprehensive manner. It also gives a good picture of Parisian society as it existed in the early nineteenth century. I found a lot of similarity between it and Russian society as painted by Tolstoy in \\"War and Peace\\". One thing that surprised me was the Count's treatment of Mercedes, if I was in his position I know I would not have treated her as a betrayer and do not in fact think that she was. It was also surprising to see that hashish was so romanticized in that period, I would not have guessed that there would have been any great awareness of it at that period of time."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Although viewers of the various movie versions may think that they know the story, the novel takes numerous twists and turns which are far too complex to be told in a couple of hours. The subplots are as exciting as the main plot, and Dumas weaves them together into a seamless whole.The Kindle edition is one of the better transcriptions that I've seen, with consistently good editing, no typos, and the placement of the footnotes does not distract from the flow of the text."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"There are two criteria for a review here, the book, and the actual story itself.The story is 5 stars out of 5 no doubt. It's a literary masterpiece. An absolutely compelling story of revenge with an amazing character dynamic.The book, which is unabridged ( what's the difference? About 500 pages; fairly significant ), is the best. I wouldn't recommend the abridged version, you don't get the feeling of satisfaction of reading the actual book and abridged is like reading a really long summary that actually makes less sense than the book because of the random introduction of characters.So we've established that the story is fantastic and a timeless classic, and the unabridged version ( which this particular penguin classics is ) is the best to get. Now I must talk about the elephant in the room, the actual book. I have a lot of Penguin Classics, The Epic of Gilgamesh, The Consolation of Philosophy, and Sir Garwin, etc. These books are extremely short, 2 - 300 pages max. Well, As we all know, The Count of Monte Cristo is a bit longer....about 1000 pages longer to be specific. So what's the result? A publishing company that specializes in smaller to medium sized books trying to bound a 1300 page monster. The binding is absolutely terrible! I feel like every time i pick the book up it's going to fall apart. I've been a long time fan of paperback books, but I really wish I had not bought this book as a paperback. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Penguin Classics and their books, but they definitely should have used a different binding method for this particular book.Overall:5/5 stars on the story, and plot2/5 stars on the actual book and binding"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I was impressed when listening to Bill Homewood abridged version and often wished that there was an unabridged version (by Bill Homewood) and there it was. I'm very lucky as my son Darin and his wife (Caroline) gave it to me for Christmas. It was incredible. He (Homewood)does, BY FAR, the best job and although I have listened to many versions Bill Homewood does the most outstanding job. As you see I can not say enough about his presentation, I have many other audio versions of the Count of Monte Cristo. It's a great book made magnificent by Mr. Homewood.

The description on the back cover misleads the consumer into thinking that one is getting so much more than the full text (the edition includes a brief introduction of the author, critical analysis and explanatory notes). I'd rather do without the side commentary and get the full original manuscript. The problem isn't that the editor decided to abridge the book, but that they chose to conceal this fact from the reader.The removed portions are integral to the storyline and I was left baffled by how disjointed the novel seemed, so uncharacteristic of Alexandre Dumas. Then I found out it's not the author's fault.Book is highly recommended, but I would also recommend that readers invest in more trustworthy versions out there."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I thought this story was very difficult to follow. I even restarted it after reading the first hundred or so pages. Now I know why...there are several chapters intentionally omitted in this version, making it impossible to make sense of the text.

Do not buy this book, or any other \\"Enriched Classic\\"."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I strongly recommend readers to buy this version - the unabridged version with the excellent translation by Robin Buss. It was thanks to Amazon readers that I first found out about this version -> I had just read the Club Dumas by Arturo Perez-Reverte (which I also highly recommend) and I was curious to read novels by Dumas. I think I had read the abridged version of Monte Cristo back in high school (over 20 years ago) - but I learned from Robin Buss that the version most of us have read was an antiquated Victorian English translation which doesn't reflect the style of Dumas and omits key parts of the novel due to Victorian-era censorship. Here's what Robin Buss has to say on page xxv of his intro: \\"Anyone who has ever read The Count of Monte Cristo only in the \\"classic version\\" has never read Dumas' novel. For a start, the translation is occasionally inaccurate and is written in a nineteenth century English that now sounds far more antiquated than the French of the original does to a modern French reader.\\" I'd like to share that I thoroughly enjoyed this amazing tale with this excellent translation. I found it to be a gripping story and I had no problem sticking with this novel - all the way to page 1,243 - which I finished reading moments ago. Also - I found the detailed notes provided by Robin Buss to be incredibly valuable. In the notes, all the \\"nuances\\" and even \\"inside jokes\\" within the novel are explained. Some things that contemporary readers would simply understand (due to recent events, and the French revolution, etc) that are unlikely for most modern day reads to know.I whole-heartedly recommend this -and I will look for more classics that have been translated by Robin Buss, because I feel like I discovered a treasure."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is a must reading for any reading lover. It easily ranks among the best 20 novels ever in any language. Just one piece of useful information for kindle users. This is NOT the Modern Library edition. I downloaded the free sample from my kindle and I am glad I did. This is a mobile 'cheap' edition with the text only that I can get for free some place else. Amazon should be careful in listing books, because not all editions are the same. If this was the Modern Library edition, I would happily pay the $0.99 they are asking for."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Bottom Line: Blackstone's audio version is the Lorenzo Carcaterra translation.

What I *did* want to do, however, was share some information with others who are interested in which translation they are reading. I learned from Wikipedia that a new translation was done for the 2006 Penguin Classics version of this book. Since this audio version was published in 2008, I wanted to know whether it followed the new translation. I looked here on Amazon, on BN.com, on BlackstoneAudio.com, and on Audible. None of them have the information. By combining \\"Search Inside this Book\\" with Audible.com's audio sample feature, I was able to listen to a portion while following along with the text on Amazon.

However, having plowed my way to the end, I am tempted to classify this along with \\"Dracula\\" as a \\"classic\\" novel whose reputation rests more on its great beginning than on its middle and end. It was great up to about chapter 30 (describing the betrayal, imprisonment and escape of the hero, and the reward of his friends). However, once the story starts to sink in to the prolonged revenge, it starts to lose its way for me.After chapter 30, the hero becomes a sort of divinely inspired madman, who imagines himself to be, and apparently is, a mere tool and agent of God's justice. His behavior transcends moral laws, his plans transcend human intelligence, and he becomes impossible to identify with as a character. Fortunately, there are plenty of other characters, and the story, from this point on, is rarely told from the mysterious Count's point of view. If you are willing to settle in and be patient, you can have some fun watching the weaving, interacting sprawling plot threads. Even so, when it was all said and done, it was wrapped up in a way that left a bad taste in my mouth.I would not, however, recommend reading an abridged version. Too many threads intersect, and you cannot trust an abridger to like the same parts that you will like."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"In this romanitc novel events do not develop quite as quickly as in another very famous Dumas classic, The Three Musketeers. A young Catalonian sailor, Dantes, is unjustly accused an imprisoned--his enemies believe for life. However, he gets an education in prison from Faria who also reveals to him the secret of the enormous treasure hidden, of all people, by Ceasare Borgea. The young sailor miraculously survives his daring escape, obtains the treasure, and uses it to inflict dreadful punishment on his enemies and to reward those who tried to remain loyal to him. Dantes, who morphs into Count Monte Cristo and, along the way, into a cast of supporting characters, sees himself as an instrument of vengeance in the hands of God, whose name he constantly invokes (too often perhaps). But his faith is peculiarly non-Christian, since he harbors earthly hatred and a burning desire for revenge, and has no intention of forgiving his enemies, until they have been reduced to utter misery. Hence all the trappings of the Orient in Monte Cristo's retinue, his furnishings, and even his eating habits--remember he refused to eat when he met his once beloved Mercedez. He is not ready to be merciful and forgiving. Dumas mentions, kind of warily, that Dantes at one instance, toward the end of his vengeance, did reflect that perhaps he has gone too far, but overall, it's still a nice romantic story of love, hate, and ambition where God and faith intervene on behalf of Earthly justice."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Judging by the reviews here, criticizing this book is like criticizing Shakespeare -- anything less than full throated praise is dismissed. Let me be clear: I loved this book and it was well worth the time it took to read. It is deservedly considered a timeless classic.Nevertheless, it definitely has a pace that is not seen in modern books. If this had been created by a contemporary writer it would probably be about 25% shorter. I'm not saying that would make it better, it would simply make it a book created for modern sensibilities.If you like fast-paced modern writing, you will definitely need to recalibrate your expectations. Once you accept this book on its own terms, it is a very rewarding read."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"After having let this book languish on my TBR pile for over a year, intimidated by the sheer size of it, about a month ago I found myself in the mood to read a \\"chunkster\\", and so gave it a go. And now, having made my way through all 1462 pages, I can best sum up my opinion of the book by simply saying - it is very long.Alexandre Dumas' classic tale of revenge tells the story of Edmond Dantes, handsome young French sailor. The story opens in Marseilles in 1815 when he is in his early twenties; having just been promoted to captain of his own ship, and about to marry the love of his heart, his life is full of promise. But alas, in his circle of acquaintances are three people whom he considers friends in some degree or another, but who are actually enemies. Motivated by jealousy and simple, pure hatred of the enviable Dantes, they frame him for treason and he is thrown in prison for life without even the benefit of a trial. After 14 years in prison, through a series of providential events he manages to escape, finds himself in possession of a vast fortune, and begins the long, slow process of enacting revenge on all those who caused his wrongful imprisonment.The first 500 or so pages, which recount the story up to Dantes' escape, were well-paced and interesting. Likewise the last 300 or so pages, in which his elaborate schemes of revenge are finally realized and his victims fall like so many dominoes, was fairly interesting (although by then I was mentally through with the book and so sped-read much of the ending). It is the 700 or so pages in the middle where the story lags, sags, and drags on endlessly.This is not a tale of redemption, forgiveness or any other noble human trait -- although at the very end Dantes (now the self-styled Count of Monte Cristo) does feel a bit of remorse as he finally realizes he has gone too far. This is a tale of a man whose life becomes consumed with seeking all-out revenge, pure and simple. It is also a tale of adultery, murder, betrayal, depravity and numerous other ugly human traits, played out by a large cast of characters whose relationships are more intertwined than a plate of spaghetti (making the story, for me, the equivalent of a 19th century French soap opera). At the center of it all is the Count of Monte Cristo, a totally unrealistic and over-the-top character who is a master of disguise, omnipresent and omniscient, and who has a masterful command of seemingly every topic from the arts to finance to arms to soldiery to you name it. Just how he came to possess such varied knowledge and talent in the 10 years or so between his escape from prison and when his elaborate schemes of revenge began to play out is never really explained. Nor is the reason behind his vampire-like paleness and aversion to eating, although it seems to be important since the author has various characters commenting on it throughout the book.If you just want to read an over-the-top tale of elaborate revenge then I suppose you would enjoy this -- obviously many people do since it is such an enduringly popular classic. I would highly recommend an abridged version, however, since there is much that could be cut out of this doorstop of a book without losing any of the meat of the story. If, however, you are set on reading an unabridged version then I do not recommend this particular one (published by Modern Library Classics). It is full of typographical and punctuation errors and it doesn't have any annotation or notes, which I would have found very helpful in understanding many of the comments and references throughout the book.I don't totally regret having spent four weeks on this book, if only to be able to say I've read it. But this will probably be my first and last work by Dumas."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"What I'd like to write to Blackstone Audio Classic is 'why did they leave out the chapter towards the end when Edmond returns to the Chateau d'If?' This is so important to the story and I was so disappointed when I listened to the audio version. I felt cheated, even though John Lee's narration is excellent."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is a great read for those of us who need to escape the realities of life to enjoy a romantic tale."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I love this book. I saw the movie when it first came out in theaters and I just now finished the book. I really can't say that one is better than the other, I enjoyed both of them. This book definitely kept me engaged, I never wanted to put it down."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is a very, very nicely done book. I've read many of Dumas's works, and this far surpasses each of them. The characterization, the way that each of the \\"bad guys\\" had their own reasons for being bad, and Dumas forces us to understand, the way that the Count is caught up in being (forgive me) torn away, the way that he believes himself unable to move on without revenge, and yet he has already in body. The wonderful Haydee (who is very similar to the Haydee in 'Don Juan' by Lord Byron), both passionate and demure, both constant and painless. She gives the Count a life he lost in the Chateau D'If. (Oh, the Chateau actually exists, so look it up on the 'net while readin that part for a visual, or, I should say, a secondary one.)And NEVER forget Luigi Vampa, the lord of the Count's underworld! The embodiment of careless mockery! Oh! Even Franz could love him!DO NOT ASSUME THAT YOU KNOW THIS BOOK IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE. Do not give credit to the terrible abridgement the movie attempted to call The Count of Monte Cristo. All the \\"bad guys\\" were all rolled into ONE person, the Count himself was not nearly so evil, and many other terrible changes that destroyed the darkness of the book... The one that takes the cake is the AFFAIR between the married Mercedes and the Count! I couldn't believe it! The Count DESPISED her after she married his nemesis!Anyway, this was a really cruddy review. Read the book!she who is no longer the Angel of Music"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Excellent version of this book. The Count of Monte Cristo has never had a better translation."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I'd never read it so I decided to tackle the unabridged version - all 1200+ pages. It was worth it. There was a lot going on in this book. I got tired of the revenge angle after awhile. While I could understand it, it seemed a shame that such a rich and talented character couldn't have done more with his life than getting back at those who'd hurt him. It was kind of sick after awhile."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book has been quoted extensively and has remained a part of the literary canon for centuries and with good reason - it's simply a phenomenal work of art. The kind of dense fiction with multiple storylines and huge casts of colorful characters has sort of disappeared in this day and age, which is why works such as this one will always continue to engage and inspire us. Dumas' novel of revenge paints a wonderful picture of what high society was like in Paris at the time, all while following Edmond Dantes' plans to exact revenge upon the people who put him behind bars due to their jealosy and greed. He was simply a good man who was too trusting of those around him and this trust got him locked away for 14-years. Everything that happens in this novel flows so smoothly, and although the 1400+ pages is daunting, it is certainly worth your while. I'd love to see writers today try to write again with this kind of density. I really can't say enough how fantastic (I'm running out of superlatives) this book is and I know that anyone who reads it will agree that Dumas is a literary genius. This book is \\"Infinitie Jest\\" if Wallace's book made sense all the way through, \\"Atonement\\" if McEwan branched out and tried to fully flesh out the personalites and traits of all of the characters, and \\"The Corrections\\" if it had a more exciting plot (All of these books rank up as some of my favorites, but each succeeds in only a few ways, while I feel this book does it all).Just make sure you're ready to commit a few weeks to this one. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"dumas as evidenced by books like the count of monte cristo and the three musketeers has no peer when it comes to the adventure novel category. if you are sensible and believe that all those crappy nytimes-recommended-boring-serious novels are not all that constitutes good fiction, well you are on the right track with this one. 'made up stories' don't get any better than this."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Don't be afraid of the length of this book.By the time you are done you will be wishing this story would never end.This book will satisfy everyone,the adventurer,the romantic,the young and the old,It is everything you want in a great read."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Truly one of the great classics. I've read Le Comte de Monte Cristo 4 times now and each time it gets better. This printing was nice that it included endnotes to help explain some of the finer points of Dumas's epic tale of love and revenge. No matter how many times I read this I find myself wishing I could step right into Dumas's tale and take part. The power of Dumas's writing is best when you re-read the book and find yourself just as engaged and more than that you find yourself trying to will Le Comte to alter his course of revenge. A great book that is very difficult to put down until the final word."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"While it doesn't indicate it, this is a heavily abridged version of the story, and pretty much just deals with the elements contained in the 2002 film. It's still a good story, but gets 2 stars for not indicating that it's abridged, and because even at 1400 pages, the full unedited story by Dumas is MUCH richer and makes for a much more satisfying story. Do not cheat yourself of that satisfaction by settling for 1/3 of the story."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I started this book with some reluctance. I already read and enjoyed the abridged version and was concerned that the extra pages in the full version were taken out for a reason. I'm happy to report that the full version is even better than the abridged. It fills in the abridged version's gaps, adds some exciting chapters, and provides more background on the characters. My only quibble is that Dumas wrote the original story for a series published in a periodical. He was paid by the line and in some conversations it shows.An added bonus is the introduction and footnotes provided by Robin Buss. The footnotes explain Dumas' historical and literary references. The introduction provides good background and analysis. The book is loosely based on a true story.Those who have only seen the movie versions will enjoy the book. Because of the book's length and complex subplots the movies can't do it justice. Hopefully someone will do a miniseries based on the book. In the meantime, new readers are in for a treat."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is the best book I have read. I am young, and yes I have not read many classic novels, but the immense amounts of joy I have recieved from finishing this story is far better than any other written material I have read!!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo was a Superhero long before Superheros were cool.A 19th-century cross between James Bond, Batman, Zoro, and Dirty Harry, the title character is a seemingly all powerful and all knowing master of all trades, whether languages, art, chemistry, disguise, psychology, philosophy, theology, international relations, literature, protocol, diplomacy, or combat. But he is also deeply conflicted and brooding man who builds his life around a dramatic quest for revenge against the men who ruined him early in his life, but who along the way darkly questions his decisions and motives.As a young man, Edmond Dante had the perfect life: a beautiful fiance, a promising career, and dedicated friends. But the jealously of a few people around him combined with some unfortunate circumstances, ruined him, and he ended up jailed for life on the harrowing island prison Chteau d'lf. After an apprenticeship with learned co-prisoner Abb&eacute; Faria, Dant&egrave;s makes a daring escape from Chteau d'lf, finds millions the then-dead Faria had hidden away, and then changes his name -- Monte Cristo is the name of the fictional island where Faria's treasure was hidden -- and begins his epic quest for vengeance.It is not inaccurate to look at The Count of Monte Cristo as a novel about revenge, but it is much more than that. It is a story about love and anguish, about sin and redemption, and about light and darkness. It is also an extraordinarily captivating read, the rare example of important historical literature that is also a good fit for reading on the beach or during airport layovers, and an appropriate read for anyone in his or her early teens and onward into old age.The book is also a great conversation piece: while I was reading it, at least half a dozen people stopped me to ask what I thought of the story, often with nostalgic and wistful looks in their eyes.There are some flaws to The Count of Monte Cristo that are common with 19th-century literature: a complicated cast of characters, for example, means the reader must keep up with many names and relationships. And the reader must also employ a willing suspension of disbelief, not only to accept that the protagonist can rise from such humble origins to become so good at everything he does (this is the case with almost all Superhero stories), but also in order to believe that the cast of nefarious enemies in mostly modest circumstances who wronged him at the start somehow rose to become the wealthiest and most powerful group in early 19th century Paris. The neat ending in which no evil-doer is left unpunished and almost no worthwhile personage is not left standing seems too neat and pat, even by today's Hollywood standards. But are these really flaws in the book or of the times?I choose to think it's the latter, which is why I believe this dark and fascinating story is so important and worthwhile, a real thriller that puts modern representatives of the genre to shame."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"'The Count of Monte Cristo' is, in my opinion, the greatest book ever written. The first time I read it, I was 13. I was at summer camp and read the book in 3 days. I'm 19 now and I have read it around 15 times. I never get tired of the story. I love how Dumas writes subplots that all get entwined all through the book. I've read the abridged version, too. It's not even close to being as good as the original. If you only read the abridged one, you'll miss a lot of the plot that is very important. Anyways, I love this book so much and I want everyone else to too!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Think of the best movie you ever watched, multiply it by 100 and then you might be able to understand how great of a book this is. I have favorites in literature, but to be honest, this surpasses them all. This book is...perfect in every sense. It is something all people should read. BUT, be warned, you must read the UNabridged version. I just read it and cannot fathom reading it any other way. My advice: read The Count of Monte Cristo, read it ALL."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Hi, I am from Glendale, California and I attend school at Clark Magnet High School; anways, I started reading The Count of Monte Cristo when my Mom refereed me to this book and at first I was kind of skeptical about the fact that this book was really long and was translated from French. Then really got into the book and finished reading it, in a week. This book is filled with philosophy, ideology, divinity and almost every other kind of study that has to do with our everyday life. Dante, who is the main character and the hero of the book is a mastermind of planning his attack though he waits for years and years and trusts god as his usher through the process of him taking vengeance on the people who have done him bad. I know that there are many translated versions of this book, but I have read the one translated by Robin Buss. The font on this book is very small and hard to see, but still if you can not find others, I would advise anyone to read this book. I personally think that this book is a little bit too complicated for a teen audience, but don't let my words stop you if you want to try this book. Alexandre Dumas has written many fiction novels including The count of Monte Cristo , but a think this one is his best novel and one of my favorites also. If you really want to read this book and comprehend every detail, I suggest that you take notes and write down all the names because there are people who bounce from section-to-section and some of them have many identities."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"There have been many heroes in the classics. None, however, equal Edmond Dantes. He is the most inspirational character in literature. Left for dead in a horrid French prison, he rises up and becomes a man of incredible means. Once a worthy ship captain, he comes to master such arts as chemistry, medicine, swordplay, gunplay, language, and disguise. Once an honorable young man, he now seeks vengeance from those who wronged him. Edmond is a calculating man in his ventures. However, he is not cruel. When he exacted his revenge on the lawyer who wronged him, he realized that he had gone to far in allowing the death of the lawyers child. His thoughts were &quot; God is no longer with me. I have gone to far. We shall spare the last&quot; (meaning Danglars, another man who wronged him). Noone can equal him in his prowess. His mastery of the duel is truly scary. He became a distinguished noble in French society, by using his charm. However, he always had a plan, and that plan was payback to those who ruined his young life. The Count of Monte Cristo describes his payback, in all his glory. The book shows that the world still has justice. A very thought provoking yet highly entertaining masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"One of the VERY FEW books I've ever read more than once and still found myself drawn into.

Brilliant!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is a moving, spectacular piece. It is the greatest novel that I have ever read and I hope others will give it a try. The novel is full of twists and turns, providing for a captivating story, as the reader follows the Count through countless changes and metamorphoses. It is a wonderful, creative story that is, in my books, heralded as one of the greatest of all time. However, as it is a complicated and long story, one should not choose to read the Count if one is looking for an easy read. I read it in my freshman year of high school, for the first time, so I think that the novel is appropriate for many different age levels in all its complexity. The story, in certain editions, comes with a table of characters, which makes the comprehension of the novel simpler, yet I think that it is much more fun to discover on ones own the outcomes in the book. What a wonderful literary classic! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I was absolutly intrigued from the very first page. The rapid sequence of events makes it impossible to put the book down. I particullarly favor the part when Edmond is in jail and befriends, and later gains immense knowledge, from the Abe. I was panicked when Dantes attempts to escape (and succeeds) after being hurled into the ocean in place of his dead friend. I love the genius character (Edmond Dantes)that Dumas has created. Dumas' wonderful way with words leads the reader to feel an array of emotions through the coarse of the novel. ~15 yrs."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I have never read a book filled with such great plots of vengeance and justice!

Edmond Dantes is a sailor who is fasly imprisoned by 3 men, and after 14 years avenges those three men. This book is wonderful, and kept me on the edge my seat until the end.I suggest you read this book"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is the best work of fiction I have ever read. You can make a good argument that this is the best novel ever written. The storyline is compelling, the character development first rate, the images of the tumultuous France of the early 19th century are real, and the historical context is accurate. Do yourself a favor and read this book, you will not regret it, I guarantee it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I can't decide whether I like this book or not. I suppose I should start with the bad, and finish off with the good.The first thing that bothered me about this book was the improbability of the events. How an ignorant, nave sailor could have become a powerful, knowledgable man with deep human understanding is beyond me. Admitedly, he did learn for many years from the Abb&eacute; Faria and later studied in the east, but I do not think that it could have turned him into the sudden enigma of the Count. The careers of most of the other characters, perhaps excepting Villefort, were improbable, too. For example, Fernand was a poor fisherman, and while he may have earned his fortune in the war, he could not have recieved enough knowledge and standing there to become a Peer of France.I also found this book bothersome because of the romanticized and unrealistic descriptions Dumas wrote. I know you will have accused me of extreme realism and cynicism by now, but in my defense, I do like many Romantic novels. This particular Romantic novel was pushing it, however. For example, in the oficial document that tells how Franz's father was killed, he dedicates a paragraph to describing how dark and stormy the night was and how there was snow on the banks next to the river, although technically it was a legal testament. The everyday converstation between the characters is similarly stilted. The love affair between Maxemilien and Valentine was so teary, fake, and idealized, that I wanted to slap them by the end of the book.And yet, despite all this, I cannot help but admire the book as a work of literature. The psychological twists and turns of this book are amazing. I love the way Edmond is convinced that he is an agent of Providence by doing justice, and how this \\"justice\\" goes out of control. I love the fact that the protagonist is in many ways an antagonist, and that this seemingly supper-human man can make mistakes. I always hated how the movies glamorized Edmond and his revenge. The book, instead, makes the revenge all the more profound because you feel a lot of sympathy for his victims.This book also has a great deal of mystery, and it is fun to guess what is going on behind the scenes. As one person once told me, it is very much like a chess game, in which Edmond is laying out all the pieces but you can never be sure what move he is going to make next."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Sorry to disappoint the previous reviewer, but when Dumas wrote this book, the ideas and plot were not new, not fresh, and certainly not original. Robert Wilson clearly outlines the history in his introduction to the book. &quot;In 1838 a police archivist named Jacques Peuchet published six volumes of crime stories taken from the files of the Paris police. In one file was the story of a young shoemaker from Nimes who in 1807 became engaged to marry a rich and beautiful orphan, but because of a despicable practical joke played by four jealous friends was falsely arrested as a spy for the English against Napoleon and imprisoned until the empire fell in 1814. While in prison he had met a dying Italian priest who told him where a great treasure was buried. Upon his release he found the treasure and, using various disguises, cold-bloodedly wreaked his vengeance on those responsible for his misfortune, one of whom had married his fiancee. When Dumas read the story, he knew he wanted to retell it. That real-life melodrama is, pretty nearly, The Count of Monte Cristo in outline.&quot; There is also an island named Montecristo that Dumas found enchanting, so very little of this novel is &quot;original&quot; or &quot;creative&quot; material. On the other hand, this should not deter anyone from reading the book because the story itself is fascinating, easily holding the reader's attention. A movie of this tale was made several years ago, starring Richard Chamberlain, and complements the book nicely. I enjoyed both the book and the movie and happily recommend both."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I like the book, I can read it whenever I like on my ipad. I don't really know what else to say. Ok."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I like it. You people should not require me to use a certain number of words, it just doesnt make sense. I only wanted to say it is good."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I am in awe of The Count of Monte Cristo!!! From the first page to the last, it is definitely a page turner. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"A good translation from the nineties, but a definite product of the intellectually stilted academic elite, i.e. the translator takes pains to correct the \\"benighted\\" errors of the author by inserting common vulgar usage such as (and here I am quoting from memory) \\"We were surprised by him answering us,\\" \\"...he or she\\" rather than \\"his\\" as the gender comprehensive, \\"...as if it was\\" (rather than \\"as if it were...\\"). I guess we all can be thankful for the translator's avoidance of the awful \\"their\\" as the gender comprehensive.I found the annotations in the back surprisingly difficult to work with, considering the fine annotations extant in the other Penguin editions of Dumas. The weakness here is that the annotations are by chapter heading rather than page number, hence making their lookup much more difficult.A good read overall, however."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Alexandre Dumas does an amazing job in book with in depth descriptions of characters and settings. He takes you away from characters only to work them back in later in the novel. Easy to read for a classic book. I would definitely recommend this to any lover of books."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Written more than 160 years ago, this amazing book still retains a freshness typical of immortal books. A great adventure novel that inspired other books dealing with overcoming and revenge. \\"Tiger, Tiger\\" aka \\"The Stars My Destination\\", a SF novel by Alfred Bester has the same strucutre and plot. A \\"must read\\" book."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"My favorite book of all time. Dumas was a master storyteller and knew how to create a cast of tremendous characters. He put together everything you need in one marvelous story. The setting is perfect, and though a little too detailed for today's writing, it was necessary at the time when people didn't travel and see the world.Conflict permeates the book, and Dumas dishes out the suspense like a master, tossing a dash in just when needed.Every character has depth, lots of depth, and the plot is not only intricate, but devious. The mother of all revenge books. And who doesn't love a good taste of vengeance?Edmond Dantes ranks high on my list of greatest characters in literature, and Alexandre Dumas as one of the best writers."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Undoubtedly one of the classics, The Count of Monte Cristo, in this edition, spans some 600 pages and takes us on a tale involving, love, revenge, high-society, intrigue, evil, greed and a few other facets that make for a grand tale.Written in the 1850's, the language in the book is of the verbose form wherein, 10 words would be used where, today, 3 would do. At first the reader may have to read, then re-read many of the sentences in an effort to garner the true meaning as, for most of us, this wordy text can be a little confusing and somewhat overwhelming. Not to far into the book, it becomes easier to handle and, in all honesty, it's a delight to read. Personally, I would enjoy being able to use words the way Dumas portrayed in his characters.Edmond Dantes is the main character who is falsely imprisoned due to a mixture of jealousy and self-preservation by others. He spends some 14 years in a dungeon where he is befriended by another inmate who schools Dantes and informs him of a fortune in buried treasure. Dantes escapes and sets out to garner revenge. In a nutshell, that's the very basis of the story.It's fantastic stuff and a welcome change from most modern text."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This isn't a review so much as a warning; I never read the book once I found out that it is an abridged edition. It says so across the back of the book, but there's nothing about it on Amazon's page. I sent the book back and received a refund. If you want to read Alexandre Dumas's complete masterpiece, find yourself another edition."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is definitely a must-read. One can be daunted by the length of this specific translation and the sheer thickness of the paperback, but do not be faint-hearted! It is worth the wait and effort.The story is loosely based on a true account, but this fact doesn't take away from Dumas' genius. He not only reveals to us the eccentricities and fashionable trends of the period, but also uses the protagonist to criticize the obvious faults of the upper class Parisian society. The novel touches on the defects of the society at large, ranging from the lack of accountability in the \\"justice\\" system, which condemns him to lifelong imprisonment through trickery and cover-up, to the philandering and adultery, which are rampant and almost EXPECTED among the rich. Edmond Dantes (the Count) is an especially useful tool for Dumas' purposes, because he leads a life of many facades. At one turn, the Count seems to fit right into the gossiping and brokering of influence, but in his private moments he despises and holds those around him in contempt. And with good reason, for most of those folks are his enemies.Like Victor Hugo and his Jean Valjean, Dumas creates a protagonist who is marred by society and abused to the point of no return. The grace (or miracle) of God provides the escape from that point, and both characters use their faith to build new lives. But we see in Edmond Dantes a very different path taken, compared to Jean Valjean. Dantes and Valjean use their faith to opposite ends, one toward revenge and the latter toward reform.The greatest challenge in this book is to go along with Dantes on his quest to destroy his enemies. Edmond Dantes firmly believes God gave him a divine purpose, to bring justice and judgment, and to execute vengeance as the instrument of God. His life after discovering Abbe Faria's fortune is wholly dedicated to this goal. He is a man obsessed, to the point of losing his humanity, and in danger of destroying himself in the process. Dantes does go through at least two situations where he doubts himself, but does not relent until he goes too far; his actions lead to deaths of those who are not his enemies, and he realizes his hubris. Near the end, he is able to forgive his last-remaining enemy; in addition, he becomes a blessing to his friends Maximilien and Valentine. For a man whose entire life has been dedicated to hatred and anger, Dantes is finally able to find hope and love, again. This book is certainly about the fascinating details of vengeance, but ultimately it is about the redemption of one man, Edmond Dantes, and the realization that without mercy, love, and humility, justice cannot be meted out.Finally Dumas includes relevant historical context (such as the return of Napoleon which provides the backdrop), as well as filling out the personal history of some of the characters. This adds much to the story, literally and figuratively. One can appreciate the intricacies of family history and the flashback-style stories, and we applaud Dumas for his brilliance and hard work, but the overabundance of names and historical references can be tiresome at points. It is also slightly annoying to be constantly flipping back to the Notes section in order to find out the significance of certain Italian phrases, when it might be better served to put those references in the footnotes.Overall, this book is highly recommended! I greatly enjoyed it, cover to cover. As great novels usually are, this work is intended not only to entertain, but it also raises questions of justice, faith, and divine purpose. It achieves a balance of social criticism peppered with nostalgic and chivalric romance, perhaps the reason why this book is one of the beloved classics."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I keep hearing that The Count of Monte Cristo is a great swashbuckling book of vengeance. I keep wondering if same said \\"readers\\" actually read the book. Au contraire, Dumas' serialized story that we now receive in a 1200+ page novel is actually an intricate waltz of a character study, that when read with patience and expectation almost feels as if the reader has been supernaturally imbued with the wisdom and experience of the 24 years that the novel covers.The story opens with an innocent Edmond Dantes who is brutally betrayed by those who abuse their positions, and it continues with ever increasing progression of Dantes' understanding: his understanding of suffering, of evil; his understanding of wisdom from the dear Abbe; his understanding of the abuse of position that originated his personal hell, his understanding of others' human natures, both good and evil; and finally, his understanding of his own self. After multiple sub-plots that orbit the Count and illuminate both the characters that revolve around him, as well as himself, Dumas wraps up the novel with a fitting and satisfactory conclusion that flirts with the philosophical.The novel's pace more than makes up for its daunting length-there are rarely slow moments. If it seems like Dumas is about to do something predictable, keep reading: his follow-up is always unexpected. I can only criticize Dumas for trivial concerns, which I won't get into here, but his handling of the plot is beyond reproach.What sticks beyond the reading itself, however, is the study of people that Dumas puts forward, replete with a sweeping spiritual hypothesis on the nature of humanity itself that can only be proposed using the method of the adage, \\"show, don't tell.\\" There are so many characters that we get to know well, who stay with us, reinforcing Dumas' observations. From the evil, such as Fernand and Danglars, to the pathetic, like Caderousse, to the unexpected--in Nortier, Albert, Eugenie--and even the angelic, Morrel, Haydee, the Abbe, we see a great slice of humanity parade before us in the vivid pages. And every one of them is somehow kindled by Dantes, the sparkling youth, then the supernatural catalyst and demigod, and finally, simply and totally, the man, soul bared and naked before his God. It is a breathtaking epic far deeper than the adolescent revenge romp that its literary reputation has been reduced to.Robin Buss' translation, notes and introduction are essential and very well done, worthy of the work itself, and sure to be the preeminent English version for a very long time. In short, this is not one of those books that you check out from the library and return: this is a work to be bought in hardback, to be read, re-read, and passed down."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Nowhere in the description of this item or in the book itself does it mention that this is an abridged book with a number of plot resolving sections omitted. Amazon - you must state in the listing for these \\"Enriched Classics\\" books that they are abridged and therefore are useless as school books, etc. Very misleading by the publisher!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is getting 3 stars because the story is GREAT, but THIS EDITION IS ABRIDGED. Nowhere on the book does it say it's abridged, but it is. It is approximately 600 pages long, while the original is over 1300 pages --- that is some SERIOUS EDITING.There are some pretty important words in the half they ripped out; including some major developments for specific characters -- a murder, a family leaving one of the targets of the Count's wrath, etc.This is a GREAT story, just not this edition."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I read an abridgement of Count of Monte Cristo several years ago and enjoyed it immensely but wondered what I had missed. Later after I discovered Everyman's beautiful editions I searched their titles on their website and found they had nothing by Dumas. I wrote them a letter suggesting that they publish some.Apparently, enough people wrote in: They published what I feel to be his best novel. As soon as I was aware of it I obtained one of my own. As I expected the unabridged version was far better.Another reviewer said that the translation in this edition was one of the worst. I didn't notice it if it was. The story flowed and held my interest so that I could not put it down for the last third. It's definitely one I will go back and read again.The Everyman's edition is just beautiful with creamy paper, cloth cover and sewn binding. I carried it around with me in the few days it took me to read it.If you buy it from Amazon you will save a significant chunk of change. It's much spendier in the bookstores.I do hope they will publish more Dumas."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Listening to these 37 CDs seemed like a daunting task at first but once I started this enthralling story - I couldn't get enough. Actually, I loved the story so much that I listened to these CDs whenever I was in the car and read the bookThe Count of Monte Cristo (Penguin Classics)at all other times, by picking up where I left off with the CDs. I was able to finish the story in about a week by doing it this way, which is really something, since I had never read or listened to a book of this length before. The translations are a bit different between these CDs and the aforementioned version of the book translated by Robin Buss, but they are similar enough that it was not hard to go from CD to book and back. The man who voices this book is simply amazing. His accents, voice modulation, and pacing are all top notch and this kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the story. I would highly recommend this set to anyone who wants to really get to know this story. Be warned though, its about 40 hours long...but worth every second!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Although I have not read any other translations of The Count of Monte Cristo, I can attest that the Modern Library Classics version is one that was scripted so beautifully that I had to reread many passages twice: once for the content and a second time for how the words just flow into your mind. When I checked this book out from the library, I was completely engrossed. Upon returning it, I ventured to bookstores to find the same exact version. Many different books had another translation (I read the same passage which was vividly engraved in my memory from the first read through!) and found that other translations do not pack the same emotional energy this version has.Enough said about the translation. This book is a sheer masterpiece. I may go on to read other of Dumas's works, such as the Three Musketeers 5 book series, but upon reading varied reviews, about half of the 3000 pages in that series is a huge miss. I'm still unsure if I want to begin the series. On the other hand, the Count of Monte Cristo has no boring passages whatsoever. Every page, every paragraph, every sentence was poetry to feed the mind. Everything flowed smoothly.The romance, drama, REVENGE, religion, suspense... everything you wanted is in this book. Some pages left me heartbroken, others made me rejoice. It is truly something that can be read again and again and you will find something new each time. This is by far the longest book I have read, and I truly enjoyed every minute of it. Sometimes you empathize with Edmond, at other times you question his actions. But overall, this book just packs so much into one. Just leave some time to read it all the way in one go. To leave it to finish it later will only make you confused when you pick it up again because there is just so many key characters in the novel."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I thought I liked the movie, until I read the book. Now I realize the movie was pathetic, and that the filmmakers could not have been more wrong when they decided to make it a \\"happily ever after\\" kind of movie. The book ends on somewhat of a high note, and certainly gives you a warm, fuzzy feeling, but isn't exactly a feel-good book. But it's so much better that way, and more realistic. It left me feeling staggered.Another thing about the movie: it left out some of the best characters. Where was Haydee, Monte Cristo's slave and adopted daughter? Or Valentine and Maximilian, probably the sweetest couple in the book? I know the movie would have been more complicated if they were included, but come on.But enough about the movie. I can certainly see why this book is a classic. It's deeply moving, surprisingly easy to read for an old book, and has one of the most amazing fictional characters of all time in it: Monte Cristo himself. Edmond Dantes is the character every author wishes they could create. What else can I say? It's a thick one, but give this book a chance."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Alexandre Dumas, author of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and the &quot;Man In the Iron Mask&quot;, has given the literary world the adventure novel, forever bringing it to the level of the classic. The Count of Monte Cristo is mainly a story of revenge. The Romanticism in which the novel is characterized and the Napoleonic France for the setting, sets the mood for this nearly psychologically thrilling story that only a great French master like Dumas could create. Edmund Dantes, wrongly accussed of a crime he did not commit, taken to a prison of which there is no escape by his enemies, his only love taken by his best friend, spends years of suffering and harboring hatred in a rotting prison cell. But he also plans his revenge, how he methodically desires to bring upon the fateful end to his enemies and win back his love. He successfully manages to escape from prison and discovers a vast fortune. Assuming the identity of the Count of Monte Cristo, he extracts his revenge. What moral theme does Dumas really want to convey ? In the end, we discover how unfulfilled and how miserable our hero is, even when he has had the satisfaction of punishing his enemies. Dumas should be credited for such a marvelous work. He writes in the highest French Romantic fashion, and should be hailed with as much praise as Gustav Flaubert. The Three Musketeers, the immortal adventure story that made him famous, has been made into numerous films, and even The Count of Monte Cristo has had a terrific film version starring Will Chamberlain. A new release of the novel is set for January 25th of this year. Dumas may have died penniless, and he may not have been considered an excellent voice of the romantic age, but it is 2001 and we are still enthralled with the tales of intrigue, suspense, romance and adventure that this wonderful French writer conceived. Viva Dumas! Five stars for his terrific revenge story the Count of Monte Cristo"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I am a full time adult college student. I had to read this 1,200+ page book for a class. I had three weeks to read the book and do a report. The audio version (unabridged) was a life saver. I was able to study in the car, while cooking, or during household chores. The pronunciation of the French names were clearer to me than if I would have read them. I followed along in the book when I could. My teenagers even enjoyed the classic while driving."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"If you're going to read The Count of Monte Cristo you must read the unabridged version. I just loved this story and found the book not long enough. A great story the needs 1000 pages to be told correctly."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I'm not much of book reader so i dont know what i was thinking when i first picked up this book of over a thousand pages... but i do not regret it at all. I read the whole thing and i never lost intrest in it! The main character is wonderfully made, the the plot keeps moving, and i loved seeing how all the characters conected. The only thing that i didnt like was one character Eugenie Danglars, she is minor character but in the few chapters that she is in, the book seemed to slow down in pace and i found myself skimming those chapter. If it wasnt for her a think the book would be much better but w/e she isnt a major character so its not that big of a deal. I highly suggest that you jot down notes on the characters as you read the story since there are about 40 characters more or less also if you dont have any knowledge of The Arabian Nights you may want to consider at least reading a summary or movie on it because Dumas frequently makes camparisons to it towards the middle of the book.So as i said before this book is truly wonderful! dont be scared by its large size!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I first read \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" in fifth grade. I started with a five hundred or so paged version, knowing that it would be too hard for me to take on the entire book. I fell in love instantly. Unable to rip myself away from the book, I actually got yelled at by my parents for not coming to eat dinner.Two years later, in seventh grade, I decided that it was about time for me to read this entire, unabridged version. I sat for days, doing nothing but reading, and when I reemerged, I found that I was just as much in love as I had been two years before. I also found that this was going to be a long, wonderful relationship between myself and Dumas.\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is a wonderful book for several reasons. One is that it is exciting. There is constantly something going, and the story never fully stops (though it certainly slows at certain points in comparison to others). Another reason is that the characters are beautifully made. You have a wonderful main character; a young man who seems to have everything, but then everything crashes on him, and he is instead left a slightly sinister, frightening man. Another wonderful thing is that every character has their virtues, and their flaws, including our main character, whose need for revenge leads him to do not-so-noble things.There are few books that top \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\". Read and enjoy. There's no way you can't help but fall in love."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I am a student, and I was recently asked to read this book for an assignment. When I first began reading the book I was stumped by the first couple of pages. I had to go back and do a bit of re-analyzing, because sometimes they call the characters by their first name, at times by their last, and some gain a specific title throughout the book. That really threw me for a loop, and if you don't pay attention to that you'll be confused the whole way through. The first couple of chapters moved a little sluggishly for me, but after I got to a point of interest this was a quick read for me. The thing that makes this book so interesting is the underlying theme. The whole point is someone will double cross anyone if they think they'll benefit from it in the long run. It also shows just how much revenge can cloud a person's mind. This was one of the first books I've been given to read for an assignment that I actually found meaningful. Much better than the \\"Oeidipus,\\" or \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" by far. Although this book is a classic, there is a very modern feel to it because much of the things menchined in this book happen today in different ways. Overall it was a wonderful book. I don't regret reading it at all."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Review for THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTODumas' 1844 novel about passion, betrayal and justifiable vengeance provides exhilarating reading even in the 21st century. Opening in February of 1815, when France was polarized into either Bonapartist or Royalist camps; society risked reprisals as the pendulum of power shifted capriciously; personal fortunes and careers rose and plunged until the Emperor's final imprisonment.Nineteen-year-old Edmond Dantes, capable first mate for the Morrell Firm, is poised to enjoy life to the fullest: promoted to captaincy despite his youth and engaged to his beloved Mercedes. Betrayed by three \\"friends\\" with private grudges or weak natures Dantes falls an easy victim to the conspirators. Accused though innocnet, Dantes is not even tried, but thrown into a miserable prison on a rocky isle in Marseilles harbor--the dreaded Chateau d'Yf. Victim of the relentless wheels of political fate the young man languishes there for some 14 years.During his imprisonment Dantes undergoes a metamorphosis from desiring death to living for revenge against his unknown foes. With the help of Father Faria-a priest considered mad by prison authorities because he insists on possessing a vast fortune-he realizes the names of his unseen tormentors, how and why he was betrayed. Since time was in abundance Faria undertook to educate the embittered youth; eventually this passionate mentor considered Dantes his son and together they planned their escape. Ultimately Dantes reached the rocky islet of Monte Cristo, recovered the treasure and was able to live a luxurious life as the Count of Monte Cristo.The bulk of the novel chronicles Dantes' personal odyssey as the self-appointed hand of providence; he devised complicated schemes to enact ruin upon the men who destroyed his career and happiness and who allowed his elderly father to starve to death.Dantes' privately likens his power and justice with God's. Asself-appointed avenger he carefully schemes and patiently waitsto savor his moments of triumph.Dumas' style includes swashbuckling action, extensive dialogue and frequent flashbacks on the parts of various characters. His clever schemes and surprise counterfoils keep readers alert with literary suspense. A connoisseur of the darker side of human nature, Dantes often relies on the baser instincts of his targetswhich facilitate their ultimate downfall. Yet even he cannot always predict the feminine factor. Himself mentored in prison, Dantes treats two young men as his sons, and acts as guardian to two young couples. Despite this, does one mortal man-emotionally scarred---have the right to claim divine privilege?"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This one of my all time favorites. Great drama, mystery, and suspense. Also a fascinating portrait of an era. The age of this book (amazingly) does not dampen the excitement and intrigue. Get the unabridged version, its worth it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo, written by Alexandre Dumas revolves around the life of a young man living in France in the early 1800's. The novel begins with the handsome young sailor Edmond Dantes. He has just returned from a journey aboard the Pharaon, which is owned by a man named Monsieur Morrel. The ship's captain died on the voyage home, and Dantes assumed the post with admirable skill, so M. Morrel made him the new captain.Not only that, but Dantes is also abut to marry his beautiful fiance. Unfortunately, all of Dantes's good fortune causes some men to become jealous and they begin to plot his downfall...The rest of the story is about the 13 years Dantes spends in prison and then how he exacts his revenge on those who betrayed him. The story is much more than that however, it is also about a love and a man who must rediscover his soul after all goodness has been ripped away from him. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read, even if only the slightest bit. From pirates to prisoners, love to war, this book has something for everyone."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The synopsis on the back of this book doesn't at all do it justice, it's the equivalent of describing the aurora borealis as a buch of lights in the sky. The Count of Monte Cristo is truly a masterpiece, don't let it's immense size deterr you Dumas' smooth style and this particular translation carry you through every page almost effortlessly, not to mention it being a thoroughly enjoyable and engaging read. I won't get into the actual plot here, if the writers at peguin couldn't do it justice with their brief summary on the back cover I doubt I could. Just read it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I am a student who rarely reads \\"classics\\" in her spare time outside of school, but this one was totally worth my time! I took this book to the beach with me (i know, an unusual choice to bring to the beach) and i could not put it down - it is such a seamless story, clearly written and with so many twists and turns in the plot to keep you fully engaged in the novel. lucky you if this novel is on your summer required reading list for school but even if you are just looking for an intense and unforgettable beach read, this novel is for you."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The only way to get through a monster of a book like this is if the author grabs you by the collar on page one and doesn't let you go. This is really a unique combination of sheer size and whizbang storytelling. Otherwise you would have no chance of reaching the end.For the last several hundred pages I withdrew from the world into my den, emerging occasionally for a bowl of gruel and crust of bread before returning to the chore of finishing...this...leviathan!I recently finished A Tale of Two Cities, which though a classic in its own right of course pales by comparison to this in terms of complexity and grandeur. Though shorter, it took longer to get through than the Count. Not in number of hours, but in number of weeks. Once hooked you keep going back to the Count to get through another hundred pages.Buy it, read it, live it! But let your friends and family know you won't be around for a while."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The first week, I'm 200 pages in. Two weeks later, I'm 500 pages in. Three weeks after that, I'm 900 pages in. Another three weeks, I'm 1300 pages in. Another week, I'm 1400 pages in, and it still hasn't ended. It will go on forever. It's like a round trip from North Carolina to Amsterdam (I've never been to Amsterdam, but I'm sure it's a long trip).This is a huge book. Fifteen hundred pages: that's huge. I thought David Copperfield and The Brothers Karamazov were tomes. They're not. They're toddlers. They're babies in the shadow of Cristo. But you know something, it's a heck of a story. With the incredible girth of the book, Dumas still has the talent to keep you immersed in it. There are some 200 page books that can't hold my attention. This is why I rated it 5 stars. If you are going to write a LONG book, you better be a good storyteller who can make the reader's investment and commitment worthwhile.I originally bought the abridged version of Cristo, read it and enjoyed it. Then I found out about all of the stuff that was cut out. Entire storylines about the main characters totally discarded. So I bought the Modern Library Classics version. I guess I'll eventually have to do the same for Les Miserables.Regarding the actual plot, I don't like the Count. I like Edmond Dantes, but not his altar ego. He's evil. I know many fans may not agree with that assessment, but it's the truth. The Count of Monte Cristo has to abandon every ounce of decency and morality to exact his revenge. And is it just me or does the most despicable nemesis of Dantes get a much lighter punishment than the others? I mean, Danglars orchestrated the entire plan to bring down Edmond, yet Dumas has him redeemed and forgiven.The story is entertaining and narratively and morally complex. It's worth your time, even if that time will clock in at 2 minutes before eternity."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is one of the most popular adventure novels ever written. Its story of the wrongly imprisoned Edmond Dantes who after four years in Chateau D'If prison where he is schooled in the wisdom of life by Abba Morio, makes the plunge into the ocean to escape and rebirth. He takes the instruction given him by Abba Moria and goes and finds the Renaissance treasure that makes him rich. Then as the Count of Monte Cristo he is able to exact revenge on those who have wrongly imprisoned him. He does so with great skill but when his actions lead to a great injustice he somehow understands the limitations of what he has done. His famous confessional words are.: \\"Tell the angel who will watch over your life to pray now and then for a man who, like Satan, believed himself for an instant to be equal to God, but who realized in all humility that supreme power and wisdom are in the hands of God alone.\\""},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"When I was in fourth grade I read an abridged version of the count of monte cristo, and I loved the story. I was determined to read the original when I was older. Now after finishing my junior year in high school, I have finished the full version. Once again, I was thrilled with the story. Though the length of the novel may appear daunting, don't let this stop you from reading the book. This truly is one of the best books I've ever read, and I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Compelling Description of Human Nature and MotiveThere is really no way to accurately review The Count of Monte Cristo. A simple review of its plot would be unfair to the genius of Dumas and to the profound insights into human nature and motivation that this book contains. Likewise, to approach this book merely for its psychological and anthropological value would be to ignore the imaginative flights of fancy and vistas for the mind's eye that this tome affords. Similarly, to approach The Count of Monte Cristo merely as a fable or a fairy tale is to forget that it is an accurate historical novel portraying the Franco-European mindset, as well as a crystal-clear exposition of the many social issues, conventions, and commonly-held fancies that characterized France throughout the post-Napoleonic era. However, for purely literary purposes, and due to constraints of space and time, a brief sketch of Dumas' masterpiece will have to suffice. Ideally, however, you will stop reading right here and get your hands on the book, thus skirting my woefully inadequate attempt to review this masterpiece fairly and coherently.Dumas' narrative follows the story of a virtuous young man struggling to come of age and find his place. However, in the classic battle of good versus evil, he is imprisoned unfairly and robbed of all that was dear to him. Eventually, he comes into great wealth and knowledge, escapes from captivity, and single-mindedly sets about to be the instrument of Divine vengeance on those who had previously denied him life and love. Along the way, he re-learns the value of friendship, and, having seen justice brought upon his enemies, finds unexpected love in an ending that is a triumphant, crescendoing testimony to the indomitable quality of the human spirit - and the mercy of God.Throughout this tale, Dumas teaches us of forgiveness, of love, of anger and hate, and reaches out to the reader with an intensity that can only come from a spirit that itself drank deeply of such emotions. Indeed, the story of Edmond Dantes - from the lowly but principled pauper to the rash, vengeful yet popular prince - smacks at times of Dumas' own rise from obscurity as an unknown mulatto to the powerful and respected literary force that he became.Granted, there are times when Dumas' heroes - like all heroes - take on superhuman qualities. However, they are not the indestructible supermen that mar much of today's literature. Instead, they are all too human - flawed sufficiently that their exploits are believable, and human enough that the reader often finds himself dialoguing with them, arguing for or against their intents and actions. In this way, it is the enduring human quality of the book - the ability for us to reach out across the better part of two centuries and dialogue freely and coherently with them, and to recognize the players and actors as fellow humans above all else - that makes it so compelling. Likewise, it is that essence of humanness that stands as the greatest tribute to Dumas.An insightful, powerful, fast-paced, and moving read, The Count of Monte Cristo is one of those books that does not end when the last page is turned and the book closed. Its imaginative power transcends the written page with timeless force, calling us to a greater, more vivid plane of existence and self-expression.Now get the book!- Benjamin Gene Gardner"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Edmond Dantes is a young sailor about to marry the daughter of the shipping company's owner. Two rascals, one for pure envy and the other because he also loves the girl, accuse him falsely of political conspiracy. The judge, a coward named Villefort, sends him to prison, trying to cover up on his father, who really is a conspirator. Edmond stays 14 years at the prison-island of If. During that time, he gets in contact with the Abbe Faria, a wise churchman who converts him into an educated man and, by listening to Edmond's story, discovers the treason and the gulity. Shortly before dying, Faria tells Edmonmd where to find an enormous treasure. When he dies, Edmond substitutes for him in the body-bag. The guards throw the bag to the sea and Edmond rips it open with a knife, goes to Montecristo and yes, the treasure is there. For ten years, he travels the world, becomes an enigmatic and cultivated man, and then sets to his goal in life: take revenge on those who damaged him, and reward the people who were good to him. And he does it in the grandest style you can imagine. The reader is pleased at the revenge and reward Montecristo brings on all the people he knew. The scenes are lush, brilliant, luxurious. Memorable ones are: the Venice carnival, where he meets the children of some of his enemies, and his entrance into the Paris jet-set. Unlike some reviewers, I don't complain about the length; if anything, I would have liked more adventures. It is hard to imagine a more colorful and brilliant novel, with a better plot and characters."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"&quot;Dantes stood up and looked in the direction the boat was moving. Several hundred yards ahead rose the steep black rock on which stood the somber Chateau d'If. The unexpected appearance of this dreaded prison, with its ceturies-old tradition of terror, produced the same effect on Dantes as the sight of the gallows on a man condemned to death&quot; (26). Just imagine the fear and loneliness that Edmond Dantes was experiencing as he looked up and realized that for no reason at all, he was condemned to a notorious prison. What would it feel like to know you may never see the people you love most again? How great would the frustration be of not knowing why you were being punished? The Napoleonic Era, an almost frightening time period to be living in, is the time in which this magnificent novel takes place. At any moment an innocent person could be convicted of a crime they did not commit and be thrown into a prison never to be seen or heard of again. Edmond Dantes, a youthful and happy man whom is soon to be married and live out a wonderful life, suddenly has his dreams of raising a family and being captain of a ship cut short by three selfish men. An oath of vengence is made on these evil men and a story of this vengence is told through such words that it seems almost as if Alexandre Dumas had experienced these events and thoughts in his own life. The Count of Monte Cristo is a novel which is so powerful, heartbreaking, and satisfying all at the same time that anyone who makes the decision to read it will certainly be changed by the time the fulfilling conclusion comes. The characters, especially Edmond Dantes who plays many different roles in the novel, are some that the reader will almost feel they could relate to or else despise in such a way that you wish you could be inside the novel to take your own revenge on them. Many of the characters, although living 200 years earlier than us, are very easy to relate to. Mercedes, who is so in love but is faced with a situation where she could either lay down and die or try and ease her loneliness, chooses the latter. Many people would probably do the same thing in this type of a situation and therefore makes this novel easy and enjoyable to read. Alexandre Dumas, as well as doing many other things, uses a very simple yet very impacting theme throughout his novel. Most everyone who reads this book has probably heard the saying, &quot;what goes around comes around&quot;. This one old sayng can pretty much sum this entire novel. It lets people appreciate the good and helpful things we are able to do for others instead of wasting our life with hatred and selfishness. Many people may object to reading this novel on the basis that it looks too long and would be too time consuming to read. If only everyone would give this book a chance they would see that this book is really a very good length in order to fully enjoy and feel the action and suspense that one should feel when reading a good book. Never in this novel is there a dull or boring moment, instead every word and sentece used is to keep the readers attention and keep them wanting more and more. From beginning to end The Count of Monte Cristo is a non-stop page-turner. If only Alexandre Dumas knew now what an extremely well constructed and entertaining novel he wrote. By the way he speeds up and slows down time he is able to focus his book on the parts that are important for the reader to know. The message that Dumas chose to get across in this novel is very important. Everyone should read this novel if not for the entertainment value then for the underlying themes of the novel. Everyone must take a chance and see what this wonderful novel has to offer."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I must say, after seeing that the length reached nearly 1500 pages, I was a little concerned about the content, however, I found this book to be the best book I have read. I recommend it, unabridged, to everyone and anyone. The story draws up to a great climax, and doesn't bore you at all.

Robin Buss skillfully translates 19th century French into 21st century English without compromising Dumas' prose. Ample footnotes have been provided to help the modern reader with the details of French history between the Revolution and the rise and fall of Napoleon that are an important part of this novel. Yes, this is long but it will be time well spent! I purchased this as a Kindle download and found it quite easy to access the footnotes and return to the story. Unfortunately, there are a couple of places in the novel where Dumas includes some Greek text that renders poorly on the Kindle."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This was an unbelievable book. I had read shorter versions in school and seen diferent versions in the movies over the years but now that I have read this unabridged version I feel truly slighted. The size of this book put me off at first but once I got into the book I couldn't put it down.Dumas manages to capture probably the best account of human emotions that I have come across in a written form in a long time. Love, jealousy, hate, despair, revenge, remorse, pity, grief, and the list goes on and on. Through our beloved Count, Edmond, we see all of these thing that make us human. We find by each turn of the page that it isn't these emotions that are bad or good but how we put them to use in our lives.I was truly stunned by this book and all that is contained within...and as the Count said in his last words I am left to \\"wait and hope\\".This book is a must read for everyone."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I love the classics, but for a long time I held off on reading this due to its length and the ordeal of carrying around such a heavy book. Well, the Kindle version has made the second reason a non-issue and pretty much taken care of the first as well. For anyone who does love the classics or simply a rippingly-good read, this spectacular tale of love, politics, 19th-century hypocrisy (by the boatload) and plain old revenge is a must. Dumas, the son of a black slave~~whose last name he took~~and a father he barely knew had few compunctions about showing the sanctimonious sham that was much of post-Napoleonic France at all social levels. And seeing as how many of the same injustices and favoritism of the well-connected are still very much with us today, this makes The Count a very modern novel. As others have already pointed out, this translation by Robin Buss puts everything back that was apparently left out in previous translations, and does so in a way that is true to the language of the time, but still sounds more or less natural to us today. There is something for everyone in this wonderful book: for those who love fantasy, there is the island of Monte Cristo itself, where time seems to stand still; for those more into politics, there is post-Napoleonic France, with all of its intrigues and power-plays at all levels of society; and for those who just love a great story well-told, it is on every page. Not to mention that there is also a fairly hefty erotic charge through much of the book. So if you love adventure, romance, intrigue, great characters and enough plot twists to keep the tension ratcheted up almost nonstop, consider spending a few weeks or however long it takes~~with The Count. I guarantee you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I just recently finished reading this 600+ page novel and was very disappointed in it. With the Count of Monte Cristo being considered such a classic - I was left asking \\"why\\" after reading this version? Apparently, it is not the entire book and that would explain some of my confusion with the relevance of many characters who are introduced and then left out.I'm very disappointed that this book is not listed by the publisher as \\"abridged\\" (nowhere on this book does it say abridged). After spending all the time to read 600 pages, I feel obligated to go back and read the recommended version, so I can find out what makes this a \\"Classic\\" and so many people's favorite book.I find it very beneficial that Amazon provides the reviews - this is an excellent resource that I use before I purchase almost anything. My wife purchased this book at a local bookstore and now I am purchasing the full version from Amazon after reading the reviews to see what I am missing. The version I read can't be so many people's favorite book, so they must have left out some important information. Thanks for the reviews, Amazon."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I read The Count of Monte Cristo a few months ago, and it took me two months to get through it. It was the best reading experience I've had since reading The Lord of the Rings almost twenty years ago.Initially I wanted to read an ebook version of the novel -- I wanted to be able to carry it around easily in an ebook reader. So I loaded one of the free versions in the public domain onto my ebook reader and started in ... but it was no fun. The translation was very old, and latinate sentence structure and archaic words made it difficult to understand. After doing a little research I found that the only fully modern translation is the one by Robin Buss in Penguin Classics. And I actually had a copy sitting around my house, but I was reluctant to carry around a fat paperback as big as a Bible for the time it would take to finish the book. Yet I wanted to read this novel, so I gave up and started in on the paperback edition. (I see now that amazon carries a kindle version from Penguin that appears to be the Robin Buss translation. But I don't have a kindle.)As other reviewers have noted: don't bother with any other version than the one translated by Robin Buss. Seriously -- don't waste your time (unless you know French and are going to read it in the original language). The suffering quotient is just too high. And that would be true even if you read an abridged version. Yes, this is a very long novel, but any abridgment is going to have to leave out some of the most truly wonderful things in the book, because again and again, the things that make The Count of Monte Cristo such a pleasure to read are things that don't really advance the plot. So just resign yourself to slogging through the whole thing. It's worth it, believe me. Not only is the style of writing infinitely easier to understand, but the book is, as they say, \\"unexpurgated.\\" Earlier translations apparently leave out some of the weirdest and most fascinating parts of the book. In one section there's a lengthy description of a drugged, erotic reverie. In another section one character is portrayed implicitly and (by modern standards) humorously as a lesbian. And in yet one more section, we get a truly fascinating and horrifyingly detailed description of a brutal execution. Someone looking for things to cut from the book could easily cut any of these. But I know you'll want to read them.My impressions of the Dumas' novel overall are that it creates a whole world that's both remarkably similar to our own, yet remarkably different, and very strange. In fact the book creates several worlds, including the world of the young Edmond Dantes, before his incarceration; the world of the prison, the Chateau D'If; the world of Monte Cristo, Dantes island paradise, the world of carnival season Rome; the world of high society Paris; and several others along the way, drawn quickly and then not seen again (e.g., the world of the telegraph operator). Linking all these worlds is Edmond Dantes, aka the Count of Monte Cristo (and many other aliases), in his journey from innocence, through suffering, to vengeance and final repentance.From what I knew of the book before reading it, I assumed the greater part of the novel would be taken up with the adventures surrounding Dantes' arrest, imprisonment, and escape, with vengeance plot being somewhat secondary. But this is completely wrong: the section leading up to Dantes' escape and his finding of the treasure is all prelude: by a great degree, the book's main plot deals with Dantes secretly returning to the world and insinuating himself into the lives of those who victimized him. He does this over a period of years, and his essentially infinite wealth turns him into a kind of God, pulling the strings for almost everything significant that happens in their lives. Admittedly much of this very long part of the book is slow ... too slow. The plot becomes quite convoluted, and sometimes you wish the writer would just get on with it. But then, suddenly, when you're almost ready to give up, a big action scene will take place, and the suspense will be ratcheted up for another two hundred pages.One trick I used to make myself keep reading through the slow parts was to remember how the book was originally published: as a serial. Dumas had to produce a certain number of words for each installment, so even if he wasn't ready to make use of a planned plot development, he still had to write X number of words. This means some installments have little plot development. But at other times, the plot seems to move very quickly, and some action scenes seem oddly compressed -- again, probably because Dumas was limited in how many words he could write for each section.A significant flaw of the book is that the major characters who plotted Dantes' downfall in the early part of the book, and who disappear for several decades while Dantes is imprisoned and then while he is planning his return -- these characters seem hard to connect to the villains who appeared in the early pages. For the most part their characters seem unrelated to the people Dantes later tracks down. Since they also change their titles, this makes it hard to keep track of who's who. And the extremely complex plot makes it even harder. So, another suggestion: as you read, keep a little chart of the major characters (including ALL the villains, as they appear, and their families). As the book progresses and more details are revealed, you can add to your chart. Of course you can find this information in many sources -- wikipedia, CliffsNotes, etc. -- but these all contain spoilers. It's best to discover these things for yourself.In the end, The Count of Monte Cristo is not very deep, in the way Tolstoy or Flaubert are deep. To put it simply, what it is, is the most fun you can have in reading for the sheer pleasure of reading. Some scenes stay strongly in my mind even now -- for example the Carnival scenes in Rome, and the gruesome executions that follow it.I only wish I had this book to read one more time, for the first time."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I did not get the opportunity to read this book in High School, which is probably for the best. As a teenager, being forced to read a classic, I would never have appreciated was a great story it truly is."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Obviously the story is excellent, as many others have stated. Yes, the print edition is 1300+ pages, but don't be scared off: it will draw you in.Also, the unabridged Penguin Classics translation looks great on the Kindle. It would have been nice to have chapter markers, but other than that, this is the best digital edition of the book I've seen."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Love the story and the Count of Mote Cristo is one of my all time favorites. If you do not like to read large books or do not have time, the abridged will do. But you will be missing out on some gripping story lines and plot twist. This is the ultimate story of revenge and Edmond seems to stick it to creep bags more in the unabridged version. For me there is no comparison to the two so I would recommend the unabridged. I made the mistake of not paying attention to weather this book was abridged or unabridged so if this is important to you, keep that in mind when you order. So the abridged gets 3 stars were as the unabridged gets an easy five stars."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"When I paid for this book, I ordered the ADULT version of The Count of Monte Cristo.

I'm not sure which version I read, it had a lot of French in it, and it was not an easy read. But worth it. I might get an easier version and read it again.The writing style is like poetry.Edmond Dantes\` is wrongly imprisoned from accusations made by people he trust. When he escapes, he seeks revenge, one of the best revenge stories ever written.I do have one complaint; I read this after seeing and loving the movie (2002, Jim Caviezel and Guy Pearce). The movie didn't quite follow the book. I hate to say this, because it does not happen often, I liked the movie better than the book. But definitely a must read. If you haven't seen the movie or read the book, I suggest you read the book first, and then see the movie.

Nice story line and it caught me and I couldn't stop reading it!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book is considered one of the best works of Dumas and is included in the top 100 novels at [...].... But, it's a very, very long read. Not that the twisted (often convoluted) story isn't intriguing. Most of us are probably aware of the story and most of us have probably seen one (or two) of the hollywood versions of the book. Just like most movie-adaptation/written-word works, the book far exceeds the film(s). Differences are as small as location details and as large as, \\"That's how it ended?!\\"One of the things a book can do that a movie can't is give you a depth to its characters. And character development is what really lets us know (and love/hate) the heroes/heroines and villains in a story. I think if you take the time to read this original version, you'll find a new side to Edmond Dantes and many of the other literary mortals described in the pages of this complex classic."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This translation has me captivated.

The version I had was the free amazon. I read another review stating that this version is a repackaged version of the gutenberg version which would be the way to go since it is unabridged and free. You can save yourself the. 99 cents if that is the case.The book itself is by far one of the best I have ever had the pleasure to read. The story revolves around Edmond Dantes and his multiple personalities (the Count of Monte Cristo to say the least) and how he embarks on a personal vendetta against those who had him falsely accused and imprisoned for some 20-30 years of his life.Even the part when he is in imprisoned is crucial to the story as that is what really sets things in motion as he realizes the true reason behind why he is there.If you have never read any classics this is the one to start with. It is a lenghty book but one well worth the experience. If possible, get the book directly from project gutenberg as it is free. Amazon's free version is jo longer available."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I'm having trouble putting it down. I know now that I will be reading more classics. Excellent stories of each character. Like reading a history and a how to on revenge. It keeps you wondering."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is my favorite book: The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas (published in 1840).This 1200 page juggernaut is a story of one Edmond Dant&egrave;s, a young sailor on the verge of being promoted to captain, and starting a life with his longtime love, Mercedes. Plotted against by jealous rivals, Dant&egrave;s is implicated as a Bonapartist traitor and thrown in prison. Revenge ensues!Dumas writes revenge like no one I've ever read. Though at times the main character seems needlessly ruthless and not particularly likeable, I just could not put this book down - well, except when it got too heavy to hold (Whew ... 1200 pages is heavy!). This is a book that will remain on my bookshelf forever (though probably not one I'd read as a bed time story to a kid).Pick it up (if you're strong enough) and give it a go - I don't think you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"It is not quite true that the publishers hide the fact that this is an abridged edition - it is printed under the title but is difficult to notice. After the 30 introductory pages you'll find a \\"Translator's Note' that tells you that \\"a distinct prejudice against length now exists\\". Well, in my view it is a poor taste to shorten a classic book. The book is excellent but get the full version."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"If Edmond Dantes was a contemporary character he'd probably be running amok through France dismembering his enemies, uttering stupid one-liners (&quot;Consider that a divorce, Fernand!&quot;), carrying a big gun, sleeping with a reluctant-how'd-I-get-involved-in-this-great-big-mess-unbelievably-gorgeous-female-protagonist and heading out to his luxury, bullet-proof yacht never to be heard from again at the end of it all -- unless the gross is high enough to warrant a sequel.Luckily, Dantes is not a contemporary character and in the quite capable hands of Dumas we have one of the most hell-bent on revenge characters ever born from the pages of literary fiction. The revenge is slow, coldly calculated and deliciously deviant. It is both refreshing and encouraging to read a story that is properly developed not just a book-waiting-for-a-movie-deal plot. If you're a fan of contemporary mysteries and thrillers, do yourself a favor and read this book. You'll never look at a 90-minute action flick quite the same."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is an excellent book. I love the classics and had somehow managed to have never read this one until last year. Amazingly, it feels like a story upon a story upon a story. It has the beautiful quality of building anticipation from beginning to end and continuing the story when you are afraid it is about to end!

I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The greatest story of revenge ever told! The un-abridged version is the only way to go with this book.

For instance, the romance is very played up in the movie and mostly incidental in the book. You'll notice that some of the villains are far more menacing in this book than you'd expected as well. I think that this book is a good book and really the movie seems as if it's from a completely separate story that just happens to have some connecting points. My only real criticism is that this book, like many from its time, is very long and you can get bogged down in details.

However, I had time to kill, and so I read the first three pages from several other translations: it really made a difference. I opted for the Penguin Classics edition trans. by Robin Buss, which I found to be both clear and faithful. This frickin book is well over 1,000 pages, so it may be worth your while to sit down in the bookstore and investigate for a few minutes.p.s. Look out for the sneaky abridged versions, too. I wish I could burn them. Just kidding."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Look, if you've seen the movie, it's a good adaptation, yet, as often with movies, it is diminished when compared to the book. THis is even more so with Monte Cristo, the book is quite long, but filled with intrigue, if you think Dantes could be cruel on the film, just read the book. Also, it has a less corny ending, which I appreciate.Truth, the book is quite long, but it is completely absorbing, I just couldn't put it down, I finished it on 12 hours of straight non stop reading, just couldn't stop until the end. I most definetly recommend this book, and would consider it as a Must read for anyone who claims to be at least moderately knowledgeable."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is my favorite book of all time.

Together with the Priest Faria they devise a plan for his escape and Edmond sets forth to seek revenge.There is so much suspense I could hardly put down the book.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Just a great book. I like this better than The 3 Musketeers.Edmund Dantes, wronged by a rival and sent to prison on trumped up charges, escapes, &quot;inherits&quot; a treasure, and then... plots his revenge.Get the unedited version. Yeah, it's about 1300 pages, but it goes by quickly. Dumas was a master of the page turner. He put the &quot;swash&quot; in swashbuckler!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is the book of the classical type by the writer Alexandre Dumas. It is the book that is mentioned in the movie \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" and the author is called in that one \\"Alexander Dumb-ass\\" Which is a joke in that particular movie. I have read this book and seen that movie and seen the movie that is based on this book. I like the book but not the movie. Not the movie where they call him a dumb-ass, the other one that is based on this book, that is not very good compared to the book. If you like words more than pictures, I would say to you to buy this book and to read it. If you like the pictures more then I don't know what to tell you. I would also refer you to one of the other great works of this great writer, called \\"The Three Musketeers\\" I know you have heard of it. These books were written in and around the Napoleonic era. I don't know if they are fair stories that talk about that time in reality. I wasn't alive then so I don't know what reality was for them. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Greatest book ever written. Don't wimp out. get the unabridged edition and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Truly a marvelous classic, the Count of Monte Cristo is a challenging tale of vengeance and love. Having been thrust suddenly from a life he loved to a world he cannot call life, Mr. Edmond Dantes spends fourteen incredibly long years in a prison not fit for rats or cockroaches. While there, his mind fills with nothing but thoughts of vengeance, and even the most brutal of situations takes Edmond Dante deep into the recesses of his mind, where he recalls with hatred and and anger the bitter trap he fell into unjustly, the people behind it, and how he will avenge. No book I have ever read has expressed the soul of man with a spark of life against all odds as this one has. Edmond believes he will one day return to overtake all of his enemies, and it is that belief which gives the strength of the book real power. All Edmond has to do is wait. And hope.Don't miss this one."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I have just returned to the land of the living, having hidden from the world to read all 1276 pages of &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; in just under five days.

Revenge is sweet!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Although Count of Monte Cristo kept me on my toes wondering what would happen next, it seemed to drone on by without a certain explanation. I loved the book, it just had parts that i thought Dumas could have easily done without. Besides that, Count of Monte Cristo was a wonderfully written book that deserves full credit on itself. It had such passion and devotion inside it; it's as though Dumas himself was feeling the same imprisonment as Dantes."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Many would argue against the title I have just given this book. They would say that Crime and Punishment or even such Shakespeare plays such as Hamlet would allow further insight into the main character's soul. But these books only showed the torture, and are not complete. The Count is shown to have a very brooding conscience, and though it is tainted by revenge, the involuntary hurt he gives to the innocent brings out both his tortured soul and his contemplative soul, taking each problem as it comes instead of all at once. This is how most people's trains of thought work, for as bad as a problem may become, we are always working around it."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"when i read dumas's Count, i was enthralled by the storyline and the characters, especially the quality of Dantes(after the transition into the count)of being one step ahead of his advesaries.i only rated it at four stars because i read the abriged version, and therefore cannot judge with impartiallity."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This a really crummy translation. No one is credited anywhere, though there's some worthy who contributed an introduction."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I agree with everyone else when I say that the story of 'The Count' is gripping, exciting, etc. The translations, on the other hand, especially this one, leave much to be desired. The English is stilted and uninspiring, and many times it seems like the text was translated word-for-word without necessary changes in sentence structure.Alexandre Dumas is much better in the original French."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"What a book to cherish, this is one count who simply will not give up on what he believes is right, and what he believes is true justice, this man will do anything, and he is simply the kind of person that is so influential as his hidden self is shown, though the abbe helped him out, it was still mostly to himself. He is way too two-dimensional.Okay, that was a little fast for you, perhaps, but that is basically everything this book is amazing in, and lacking in. But you can't miss either if you want such an age--defying novel. Now, to start, I can't think of any other French novels worthy of being compared to it. Jean--Christophe, comparable if not better, The Wandering Jew, a breath--taking novel that might be the only other French novel that can say is better than this one without hesitation. Les Miserable, comparable, and the musketeers, surely rival the count. However, this novel is very singular, and though there are several novels in its class( betrayal then revenge ), this novel, in some incredulous way, pushes the rest away( sorry Kidnapped, but you'll have to understand ), and gives itself more room, more space. It deserves a genre of its own.The lenghth and added strenghth of this heavy book, both physically and spiritually, gives it more room for flourishes, for explanation, but most of all for perfection. Let's compare this book to a cake, like I normally do, and we'll see that the cake, as I shall refer the book, needs the ingredients. Add a little something not that good, the bad guys fits that perfectly. Now add something unreal, but truly something of your dreams, Edmund Dantes fits that description without hesitation. Now add the creamy stuff, for example, the romance, the ignorance, the jealousy, and the stubborness. Of course, the last ingredient, the most important thing you need on a cake, or else it's an amateur's work, is the CHERRY( if you eat yours with a cherry )! That, is the Count of Monte Cristo's ace in the hole, it's plot. This book takes a humble old--fashioned genre in fiction to a whole new level, it's got more details, its got more flavor, it's more of a good cherry. So now you see how expertly Alexandre Dumas picks his ingredients.Having the ingredients is one thing, but how to make it, I don't know how to bake a cake, so I'm just guessing, you would want to notice how the chronicle of Edmund Dante is actually an interesting one if you read it as a map, instead of reading it like: enemy beats you, face consequences, got a helper/mentor, survive, and get revenge, you read it as something like this, like on a map: face a dangerous cliff, fall, get a life--saver, with an effort climb up from the bottomless pit, seek, goal, go back to dangerous cliff, master it. If you observe it that way, you will see an even moreold--fashioned style, brought to another genre, and becomes something completely new. Thus, I conclude by saying that Dumas did something, whether he knew it or not, or did that through another pass with his genius, like that, which is kind of making a cake based on a hypothesis, using a new way with a little bit less risk, and being successful! Dumas did just that, except in literature, it's not so risky( I wouldn't do that for a cake though, one: it's too risky, and two: it might ruin the cherry! ). So Dumas successfully manuverered through the \\"baking\\" process.Alas, the cake is made! Now for the critics to make their comments/harsh and absolutely unfair remarks, or criticisms. The book might be better if Alexandre Dumas had just made the character more three dimensional and still be able to master all the harshness in his way. Then, the book will be even more the genius it is, and if Alexandre Dumas doesn't have the genius to do that, then leave it to Romain Rolland, or some other better unknown chef in the near future! And second of all, this should've been done more old--fashioned like, make the lady stay true to Dantes all the story long. If the reader look at it that way, that might be able to leave more space for stories for times gone by than before! Man, not old--fashioned when not supposed to--and old--fashioned, never!Oh, whoever said the above, and especially the last sentence, tell me, I'll go give him a piece of my mind.The text is wonderful, barely or never any spelling errors, the paper is thick for classics of its size, and it's still able to fit the entire book in one volume. Able to rival the Modern Library Giants or the company that published Harry Potter. Really!So, this review ends. I hope it's not too long for the reader, and I hope you like THIS small cake. Alexandre Dumas was a great writer of many novels, and The Count of Monte Cristo is not his only masterpiece. No doubt people at that time is calling The Count of Monte Cristo a \\"coming of age--story\\", like their calling Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix right now! He had a lot of literary friends, and many of my French favorites. So enjoy! And if you've already done that, enjoy again! Read more about his life. Trust me, it'll be worthy of your time. All in all, Alexander was a coming of age author, and he is one of the greatest novelist, etc. right now. His novels are timeless, pure arkenstones, never to be forgotten, leading leaders in literature right now, and have the words: big classics written, engraved/burned all over it.

Dantes returns to his native soil as Count of Monte Cristo and exacts revenge on those who were responsible for his misery.Alexandre has displayed his skill in mapping out the rather elaborate manner in which Edmond reduces his opponents to near despair but at the same time ensuring that no innocent bystanders get hurt. the episode in which he bribes a telegraph clerk to deliver a wrong message which ultimately bleeds one of his opponents by millions of francs is very reflective of his understanding of human nature.overall, a book that is a must for anybody who is keen on understanding human emotions at play."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Alexandre Dumas, one of the greatest romance novelists of all time does it again in this post - Napoleonic swashbuckling tale of adventure, love, betrayal and revenge.

Highly recommended!!!!I find it unfortunate how much the book differs from the movie, especially Dantes' attitude towards God. I feel that in the movie, Dantes exhibits a hatred toward God throughout until perhaps the end. However, both the book and the film give examples how the love of God is shown (in spite of all the suffering) in the end of the book.Two words, \\"wait and hope.\\""},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is a very dated but enjoyable romp. If you just want to be entertained and to enjoy a simpler time than our stressed out world, step back into this novel. Nothing deep, just pure escapism."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book is amazing! and nothing bad happened to my kindle when i downloaded it, i think the other reviewer just had a malfunctioning kindle...i've read it for the past two days with no problems."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I have read thousands of book - more than I care to count and I am never without a book - my hands don't feel right if I don't have a book to hold. This is my favourite book of them all. No film or TV broadcast has ever done this book justice. The depth of Dantes revenge and the fine detail that Dumas gives had always enthralled me. I challange every lover of the written word not to find themselves hooked by this dark tale."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book is one of the greatest novels of all time. I read the Signet classics abridged version of Count of Monte Cristo but have yet to read the unabridged version. Not knowing the difference between the abridged and unabridged, I found that the Signet abridged was fairly well done. There will be a few holes when you cut out about half of the book, but this abridgment didn't make it seem so obvious. I was drawn into the story from the beginning. The middle part of the story was a little slow, but the denouement was so suspenseful and compelling that it made me emotional. Everyone should read The Count of Monte Cristo once in their life."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I just read this for the first time. Oh my, I feel like I've watched or been through an epic experience and felt the highs and lows of Edmond. I am heartbroken to find that his fiance is unfaithful, and that they can never be together. Yet, what a master writer Alexandre Dumas is not to make me hate him, for I can see now why it had to be so. How do some writers do that? Twist what you would normally hate into something so powerfully moving? Wonderful story, based on fact. However, there is one plot inconsistency, and that is when Mercedes tells Edmond that he is still so handsome. Tell me, do you know of anyone that has been through a major trial in their life? Divorce, death? How does their face look? Do they have more lines around their eyes, or maybe a deep wrinkle or two on their forehead or cheek? Bad habits that destroy their looks? Try 14 years in the worst prison and I cannot imagine it would leave anyone handsome. True, Mercedes might have said such a thing out of her love for him, but throughout the story the hint of his looks are that of a handsome gentleman. Wow, what a great story though. My heart bleeds for Edmond and I wish that he and Mercedes would have made a couple at the end, and even though Edmond says he will find peace, it is not enough to make me think his torture has ended. Revenge is the thread in this story, white hot, unstoppable, self tormenting revenge. The things he confronts is what we all confront when faced with betrayal. Do we become what we despise? Turn the tables and exact revenge? Do we have the right? Can we live with ourselves afterwards? Edmond overcomes his doubts as to his purpose by reminding himself of all the tortures he faced. He becomes the thing created from his experience. Once set on this path, he cannot undo it. Thusly, suicide crops its head as it should. No easy task, to slowly destroy those who ruined you. It seems with each success he destroys some of his self, too. The old Edmond. What amazed me is the author placed such realistic thoughts in Edmond's head about how he felt he'd gone too far, the guilt...it makes you wonder whether you would choose to be wise and forgive in order to move on or follow the same path...which shaped Edmond because he spent so much time in that hellish cell. Recommended reading, but don't expect happy endings, just an amazing rollercoaster!@"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I just finished this book, the Modern Library Classic, and I must say it is the best book I've ever read in my life. What a thrilling tale of adventure, revenge, romance, spirituality, and morality. Dumas takes us through the European countryside, cities, and islands, setting the stage for the one of the best-crafted plots ever written.There's not much more I can say about this book that has already been written other than that one should get the long version. Yes, it took me awhile to get through the 1,462-page book, but I really don't see how the abridged versions could eliminate 900 pages of this masterpiece. This is truly a work of spendid prose and story telling. It's a must read for anyone who enjoyes adventure, drama, and history."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"The pages come off. Do not purchase this book. I spent the first week of school trying to prevent the pages from coming off."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This is the quintessential book about revenge!Edmond Dantes has everything going for him - a promising career and the hand of the girl he loves. Yet things go disastrously wrong when he is set up - accused of being a Bonapartist he is sent to Chateau D'If...a prison on an island with no chance of release, and not even being told of what he is being charged.At first first it seems he will go mad, yet he is befriended by the Abbe Faria, who is thought to be mad. The Abbe teaches Edmond about a myriad of subjects, and informing him of a secret treasure. When the Abbe dies (14 years after Edmond's arrival at the prison), Edmond siezes the opportunity to escape and, after locating the treasure, sets out on a patient, complex, course for revenge against those who had ruined his life.Ever since I first read The Three Musketeers, I have been a fan of Alexandre Dumas, but never had a chance to read this book. I'm glad I finally had this opportunity as it's well worth the time, and I highly recommend reading The Count Of Monte Cristo."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I bought this book without a picture, but by the description written. It turned out great. It got to me in a timely manner with no problems and was a book in excellent condition."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"I ordered the used version of the Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas and the book had said it was in \\"good\\" condition, but I felt like it was in very good conition. The cover had no knicks or bent edges to it and the inside was just fine. There were no markings or folds in it at all, and I'm pretty sure there weren't ripped pages."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book is incredible! I watched the movie that came out in 2000 or 2001 and really enjoyed it but after reading this book, I think I would really HATE the movie. If you're looking for an incredibly intricate plot line then read the book and skip the movie. The movie takes pieces of the plot and twists it in such a way that leaves the viewer with little to know surprise or suspense. Alexandre Dumas writes in such a way as to put the reader right in the very scene that is being played out. As I read this book I felt like I was sitting in the conversations taking place amongst the characters. I don't know how he does it (I'm not a writer!) but he does it quite well.Believe it or not, I've not been much of a reader until recently (I'm 30, if that tells you anything). When I found this book and saw how long it was I thought I was jumping in over my head, however, I quickly found that this was a book that I could NOT put down and one that I did NOT want to end! One of the highlights in the book (at least for me) is how you'll be cruising along with the story and tracking pretty well with it when all of a sudden you take a hard left turn and can't figure out who is who and what is what. Just when you think Dumas has lost his mind and can't write to save his life, he pulls out this magic thread that pulls these mystery pieces together and out of nowhere you have a new and amazing concept introduced in a way you didn't expect. Understanding that these threads are intertwined into the story helps the reader get through chapters that may not make sense at the time but have a huge payoff in the end.One last thing, I have only read this version which is unabridged (nothing has been cut out). I've not read the abridged version (pieces of the story have been cut out to shorten it) but I can't imagine that it holds a candle to the unabridged, of course you'll have to determine that for yourself. I'm an all or nothing individual and so of course I wanted every aspect of the story included, I'm so glad I did! Buy this unabridged version, you will NOT be disappointed and please don't let the size of this book intimidate you. You'll be amazed (especially if you're not a fast reader like myself) at how quickly this book can read.Buy the book, you will love it!"},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"Dumas is the king of drama and the swashbuckling hero with a broken heart. The Count of Monte Cristo blends all the horrors suffered by a wronged man in a time of a country's turmoil, due to an unexpected betrayal. Still a good read, even after all this time."},{"Title":"Count of Monte Cristo","review":"This book is far and away the most entertaining I have ever read. It will not make you think in the same way that a book like 1984 might, but Dumas has an incredible skill when it comes to storytelling. If you think that you would enjoy a book that is packed with adventure and emotion, read this one."},{"Title":"Luxury Houses Country","review":"With room to spread out; often a view of the ocean, valley, mountain or lake; fewer restrictions on things like building codes, the opportunity to develop fantastic houses away from city life has long been popular. At one end of the scale is a crowded campground or small house in a crowded area. At the other end are the houses shown here.In this book the author has selected twenty-two houses that I believe any of us would call luxurious. From a 16,000 square foot house in upstate New York overlooking a valley to homes with a view of the sea in Hawaii, Italy and other places, the homes here are fantastic. Each house is profusely illustrated with color pictures.This book is produced by teNeues. The teNeues books are truly beautiful. The company is headquartered in Germany and they bring a sense of quality to their books that is not common. The books are printed on heavy paper using very high quality printing techniques. While this is essentially a coffee table picture book, or perhaps an idea book for the house you are planning, it is beautifully done, almost a work of art."},{"Title":"Luxury Houses Country","review":"This book in my opinion is the best in the \\"Luxury\\" series. I rarely buy a book sight unseen and have sometimes been very disappointed doing that BUT I had not seen this book until I received it in the mail today and was very impressed, it truly is a masterpiece. I usually find some of the houses in these kind of books not to my taste but every single house in here is excellent and intriguing in the quality of the design, and color and texture. If I had to zero in on my favorites in here, I would say I love Southern Charm (on page 32, Atlanta, Georgia)that includes a very charming flamingo poster. Then there is Calm and Exotism (on page 100, Ibiza, Spain) with contrasting textures. Also wonderful was Perfect Hosts ( page 110 on the Big Island in Hawaii) with lushness that makes me want to go to the Big Island. Another winner was Elegance in the Alps ( page 126 in Megeve, France with wonderful paintings Terrestrial Paradise ( page 144 in Bali, Indonesia) has exquisite indoor and outdoor spaces and great plantings. Residence in Pasadena (page 154, Pasadena, Ca.) is gorgeous with wonderful fabrics and an amazing carved canopy above the bath tub. The outdoor photos are somewhat reminiscent of Maxfield Parrish paintings. The four poster bed is very impressive with wonderful carpet underneath. Also good was A Noble Residence (page 190 Oxfordshire, UK ) with whimsical childrens room with doll house at the foot on one of the beds that also has a fabric draped over it from the overhead beam. This book certain will not disappoint the most discerning eye and I would place it in my top 5 interior design books that I have ever seen. Enjoy the feast for the eye !!! A thousand stars !!!!"},{"Title":"Pirates, planters, and patriots;: The story of Charleston, South Carolina","review":"I mistakenly thought this was an adult book, and based on the title, thought there would be a lot of info about pirates - but there are only two pages.This book would be a good primer for kids who aren't in S.C."},{"Title":"Civil Wars : Women and the Crisis of Southern Nationalism (Women in American History Ser.)","review":"The thesis of this book is that Confederate women were slow to challenge the class and gender roles of their society, even though the Civil War exposed them to hardships that required them to temporarily take on the roles of men. George Rable uses a variety of sources, including women's diaries from the period, official Confederate military records, and family papers and correspondence from women and military leaders from the period. Rable shows how the plantation women stepped up and ran the plantations in the absence of most men, who were gone off to the war. He also takes the reader back to a time when the Confederacy was being overrun by Union soldiers. By showing how Conederate women suffered as a result of the thieving and looting carried out by Union soldiers, Rable gives the reader a good insight into why women longed for a return to their traditional and familiar lifestyles. War and ruin would naturally make anyone long for the past, even if the past meant a return to submissive status. If the book has a weakness, it is the fact that Rable limited his study to white women. He did not discuss the roles of African American or Native American women in the Confederacy. However, he did discuss women from wealthy, yeoman, and poor backgrounds. This book is very informative. It is one of my personal favorites. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!"},{"Title":"Civil Wars : Women and the Crisis of Southern Nationalism (Women in American History Ser.)","review":"Short and to the point: The only work today that looks at the &quot;past&quot; civil war through the writings and lives of women. The civil war is often dismissed today because it involves &quot;dead white guys&quot;. Not true. And in his meticulous use of diaries and letters Rable puts flesh on the bones of other casualties of the war, the women who suffered and died for their beliefs as well. This is a book which concerns the &quot;home front&quot; which entails fighting only slightly different than that of the battlefield. The leading champion for civil war readers today concerning the role and status of women during the civil war."},{"Title":"Civil Wars : Women and the Crisis of Southern Nationalism (Women in American History Ser.)","review":"Ignore the boring title -- this is a fascinating read! Hoopla about the Civil War's 150th anniversary inspired me to search for topics I was less familiar with, and I was richly rewarded by this well-written, insightful book about the experiences of southern white women by George C. Rable.Rable does a marvelous job of setting the stage, describing the culture and ideology of the antebellum south with special focus on the positions and expectations of three classes of white women: wealthy plantation mistresses, the wives of yeoman farmers and poor women. He then follows these women through the war years, tracing their efforts to support the war effort, to deal with the extra burdens at home, to maintain faith in an increasingly lost cause and to battle for survival when the Yankees finally prevail.Quotes from diaries and memoirs capture the excitement and trauma of the war and its destructive impact on southern homes and home life. Despite women's passion for the Confederate cause, their war work was channeled into limited and \`acceptable' feminine activities. One interesting section describes the problematic relationships between plantation mistresses and slaves as the war progressed and emancipation dawned. Some mistresses were bitter and vindictive. In other cases, the tables were ironically reversed, with well-off women reduced to the childlike, dependent state mistakenly ascribed to slaves, unable to cook, sew or even tie their own shoes without assistance.Despite the immense changes wrought by the Civil War, traditional notions of southern womanhood survived. Indeed, one of Rable's central themes is that white women themselves were the instruments for maintaining the racist and sexist order before, during and after the war. Fascinating read."},{"Title":"Civil Wars : Women and the Crisis of Southern Nationalism (Women in American History Ser.)","review":"Professor Rable has produced an excellent book describing how the Civil War affected the women of the South and detailing their role in the conflict. He did not pursuing his topic from the fradulent perspective of women fighting for &quot;gender&quot; equality and power, which is so popular amongst women historians nowadays."},{"Title":"Absaroka Ambush (First Mountain Man #3)","review":"The book was not in as good shape as expected.

It covers nearly all the fundamental and practical aspects of stochastic hydrogeology, with emphasis on both the theoretical and practical aspects of the discipline. The language is simple, with many examples and case studies. The book is a great reference for scientists who are familiar with stochastic hydrogeology as well as for students and/or practitioners who may get informed about the discipline and learn how to implement the various tools available. The book is at the same time a very good introduction to the matter and a reference book for people who are already familiar with stochastic hydrogeology and want to keep updated with the most recent developments. This is the kind of book to keep on the desk."},{"Title":"Applied Stochastic Hydrogeology","review":"Applied Stochastic Hydrogeology is easily the best book of this century in its field.
