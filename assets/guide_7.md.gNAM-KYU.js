Brotherton's unique Southern sense of humor compliments the stories he tells. From the crazy ideas of a child while growing up, to the adventures of an adult working the rails, Brotherton captures your attention from cover to cover. Excellent read.Ken Lothridge: Author of, \\"A Conductor Tells Unauthorized Train Stories"},{"Title":"Burlington Northern Adventures: Railroading in the Days of the Caboose","review":"This book grabbed me right away. It is less about BN specifically than an adventure story about working as a brakeman at the end of an era. My stepson has zero interest in railroads, but he loved this book as an adventure story, because railroading terms are explained enough for the non-expert to follow. My husband and I are railfans, and we loved the \\"insider's view\\" of railroad work - from cooking a hamburger on the locomotive hood to a cranky engineer who WAS entering the mainline NOW, whether or not the block signals were against him. This was a quick, fun read that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Burlington Northern Adventures: Railroading in the Days of the Caboose","review":"Railroad fans will love this book. It is a good look into railroad life without getting too bogged down in the authors personal issues like some books out there."},{"Title":"Burlington Northern Adventures: Railroading in the Days of the Caboose","review":"The local newspaper ran a couple of stories from this book and they were pretty interesting so I bought the book. Unfortunately the newspaper didn't mention the frequent use of profanity because I intended to pass it along to other folks who love railroading but would be offended by the language. There are many colorful characters that the author encounters and their favorite expression seems to be the F-bomb. Mr. Brotherton has a law practice so is not an ignorant man who is incapable of conveying the excitement of a story without quoting everything word for word. Overall, the book is like a delicious hearty soup with bugs scattered through it."},{"Title":"The Mystery Of Metropolisville (With Thirteen Illustrations and Frontispiece)","review":"The novel is based on an actual town. The author, describes the long gone village of Traverse des Sioux, which was located along the Minnesota River just north of the City of St. Peter in Nicollet County, the buildings described as having been moved were in fact moved to St. Peter. Traverse des Sioux was at one time the seat of Nicollet County until 1858 when the county records were moved to St. Peter thus the beginning of the decline of Traverse des Sioux. It was the location where the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux was signed between the United States and the Dakota Indians in 1851. Rev. Eggleston served as pastor of the Methodist churches in Le Sueur, Ottawa, Mankato, Traverse des Sioux and St. Peter. You can in fact see the historic Methodist Church in Ottawa in Le Sueur County located between Le Sueur and St. Peter. The City Hotel is now known as the Bornemann House in St. Peter, the Store is now the Swanbeck Building also in St. Peter, both located on Minnesota Avenue. And you can visit the Treaty Site History Center located in what was Traverse des Sioux."},{"Title":"Turkey Handbook (Footprint - Travel Guides)","review":"I am an American who traveled last year to Tukey and Tunisia. I discovered the Footprint guides first for Tunisia, and must say they are the best guidebook I have used for travel. They provide not only the info on where to stay and eat, but hands down have the best historical information I have seen in a travel guide. When I travel someplace new, I want to learn about what I am seeing and Footprints does not dissapoint. With few exceptions, the book gave much better information than the guides we were with. From now on, any time I travel, I will check and see if Footprint makes a guidebook for the area. I woulnd't even bother with the offers to get other books if you get this one. The footprint guide is all you need."},{"Title":"Turkey Handbook (Footprint - Travel Guides)","review":"If you are a history buff, you'll like this book.

You can start as a beginner and gradually progress towards becoming first chair in a concert band. It has a variety of exercises, and teaches the clarinetist good techniques. It also includes a fingering chart. When I was a 13 year old kid, my teacher started me with this book. By the time I was 17, he said I was good enough to audition for the Boston Pops. (My teacher played clarinet with the Metropolitan Opera). The only negative, it doesn't have many solos for performance. But then again, it's for learning technique. My original book came in two parts; it was pretty torn up.

There are so many people out there in our spiritual community that do not believe in the existence in Ritual abuse. It is refreshing to find someone with some sense of what it's like and how, with the help of God that we can be helped.In all honesty I believe that this book should be in the hands of spiritual leaders that counsel people. Especially when they find out that their client could be or is someone that is from a ritual abuse back group.The book did not go into a lot of detail about Mkultra or Monarch programming, but the basic structure that is there is helpful, not only to the client but to the one/s trying to help the individual.One of the chapters was written by a friend of his, Pastor Jim Casey, there are some things that I personally disagree with, and neither does the author, one such being that the \\"personalities\\" should die. No part of a multiple should die or can die in my beliefs. They blend in to each other and they can become a total whole individual or stay separate but still function in the \\"normal\\" world.We were put on this earth for a purpose. What the reason is I can't say but I don't believe that God wants any to suffer. That's one of the reasons that he gave us this gift of disassociation.I would recommend this book to any that would like to work on healing in a faith based system. Reading this book yourselves can be helpful but there is much more to it than just what one person can do. We need teams of support people with us in our healing. So if you are in or thinking of having some type of spiritual counseling I would get this book and also let your therapist or counselor read this and then discuss the type of treatment and goals that you can reach together.John and I have written to each other during my reading of his book and he would answer questions that I had about this book. This man takes the time to listen."},{"Title":"The Healing of Satanically Ritually Abused Multiple Personality Disorder","review":"This book addresses a real problem in a real way. In the present climate of disinformation, that merits 5 stars for that reason alone. Yes, the media has convinced many that satanic abuse is a myth. On the other hand, many experts, including former FBI Agent, Ted Gunderson, would disagree with the contention that there is no evidence of SRA. On the contrary, Gunderson has claimed that satanism remains a huge problem with tens of thousands of human sacrifices performed every year. Look his videos up on youtube, for more information. As for so-called \\"false memory syndrome\\" - this cannot account for many hundreds of SRA survivors who actually display physical symptoms of their abuse in their physical bodies, as has been observed by countless qualified therapists, counselors and ministers. It is highly unwise for those who have no experience with these matters to essentially claim that since they haven't seen it, it therefore does not exist. It does exist, but is vigorously hidden, as the word \\"occult\\" means. One example isThe Franklin Cover-up: Child Abuse, Satanism, and Murder in Nebraskawhich involved suppression from names in very high places. Read the book and you will understand why you aren't hearing more about this in the media. And if you are an SRA survivor, read this book. You may not agree with all of it, but it will help."},{"Title":"The Healing of Satanically Ritually Abused Multiple Personality Disorder","review":"During the &quot;Satanic Panic&quot; of the 1980's, investigators, even the FBI scoured the nation for evidence of SRA, and found nothing but silly teens who were soon arrested. There had been no genuine ritual abuse of children. MPD's suffer from false memories, often put there by their own therapists. While they were certainly badly abused, they were not abused by Satanists. This absurd witch hunt has ruined many lives, both of the accused and the mentally ill victims. Stay away from this nonsense book. It is pure sensationalism."},{"Title":"Someone's in the Kitchen with Dinah","review":"I loved this book! The zany characters were a delight, albeit a bit &quot;off-the-wall&quot; (not unlike reality in the Keys...) and truly kept you guessing. As a native Floridian, I have experienced many hurricanes. I can tell you with absolute certainty that I would not want to be stranded on the Keys during one of these Big Blows. This of course, only added to the suspense and intrigue. A very good read. I hope there will be more of the same, forthcoming from this Author."},{"Title":"Someone's in the Kitchen with Dinah","review":"Someone's in the Kitchen with Dinah is a very well written mysery--a gread read--highly recommended. You don't have to be on the beach to get the full pleasure of the local color of the Florida Keys. And you don't have to be a cook to enjoy the culinary references which are fun and skillfully woven into the story. Barbara Arau, where have you been? Is a sequel on the way?"},{"Title":"Someone's in the Kitchen with Dinah","review":"Someone's in the Kitchen With Dinah is a great &quot;whodunnit&quot;.Humphrey Bogart's &quot;Key Largo&quot; is the setting for this adventure on fictitious Webb Key. It's well written with subtle clues that keep you guessing! I was unable to put it down because I just HAD to discover who the real villian was.Barbara Arau has an uncanny ability to put you in the shoes of her protagonist; you can smell the ocean, see the palm trees, the docks, the boats...her descriptions really transport you to the Florida Keys. I think it would be a wonderful movie: a fast paced nail biter during the hurricaine scene. Get it. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Someone's in the Kitchen with Dinah","review":"I couldn't put it down. A real page-turner. One of the most entertaining books I've ever read. I definately would like to read more from this author. Very sexy!!"},{"Title":"Someone's in the Kitchen with Dinah","review":"All Dinah wanted was some time and space to pull herself together. She got a hurricane and a couple of murders instead.Dinah earned my respect almost immediately. She demonstrated admirable strength and resilience after the death of her father and the collapse of her marriage by setting out on her own and moving on with her life. Even when her smooth talking ex-husband makes an unexpected and unwanted appearance, Dinah puts him firmly in his place. She is certainly not the sort of woman to let others run over her. As with many well rounded characters, Dinah has a softer side as well. She is a very compassionate person who makes friends easily no matter their background or what other people may think. Her relationship with Amanda, a young girl who doesn't speak, is especially sweet.Webb Key is home to many colorful characters, but Rena is by far the most developed. She has a larger than life personality and is very bold and brash. Rena is the sort of person who has no qualms about poking her nose into other people's business. I'm not entirely sure that Rena and I would get along well if we were to meet. I think I'd find her personality a bit overwhelming. However, Rena is a caring soul and she generally means well. At first I thought that Rena and Dinah might not get along, but I was pleasantly surprised to see how quickly they bonded and how well they worked together to solve the murders.Someone's in the Kitchen with Dinah contains not one, but two mysteries. Dinah first begins looking into the murders, but as she begins digging up dirt on the inhabitants of Webb Key, she discovers a second puzzle surrounding her young friend, Amanda. As I read, I was constantly kept guessing as to whether or not the murders were connected to Amanda's situation. I thought both mysteries were wrapped up well, if a bit too quickly for my taste. I especially wanted to know more about the plot surrounding Amanda. I felt that some events of the past were glossed over a bit too quickly and I was left wanting a bit more detail.Dinah and Joe's budding relationship adds just the right amount of romance to this tale. Joe seems to be the complete opposite of Dinah's ex-husband, so it was easy for me to see why she would be so attracted to him. I do think Joe could have been a bit more rounded. All I really know about him is that he is a very down to earth man with amazing blue eyes and a passion for architecture. Dinah and Joe develop feelings for each other quickly and it isn't long before their relationship is on the fast track. I was a bit worried that things were moving too rapidly between them. However, Ms. Arau put together a wonderful \\"happy for now\\" ending that fit Dinah's situation perfectly.Someone's in the Kitchen with Dinah is certainly a fun book to read. Dinah was easy to like and I truly enjoyed watching her tackle her first mystery. I look forward to reading about her adventures in the future.Originally posted at LAS Romance Reviews"},{"Title":"Someone's in the Kitchen with Dinah","review":"Wonderful read, brings to life quaintness of Florida keys, local color, its unique characters, always present hurricane threat, great mouthwatering recipes and lots of mystery suspense!

My only comment to the contrary is that, as a 300-pounder myself, weight shouldn't necessarily be a hinge for humor."},{"Title":"Gumshoe Gorilla","review":"The year is 2025. Scientists have discovered the gene for homosexuality, the Cherokee are suing the US government for their rights to large tracts of Georgia (with China's support) and the Baptist News Network is struggling to survive in the face of Reverend Stonewall's infamy. Keith Hartman paints a remarkably plausible picture of the United States 24 years in the future, full of humanity and rife with startling glimpses of humor. Gay private eye Drew Parker and his Wiccan partner Jen Grey are hired by Skye Phillips, the Plot Coordinator of the hit show Czechmates. Skye wants to know what her boyfriend, the hunk movie star Charles Rockland, is up to. Although she fears she won't like the answer, she is more afraid that he is in trouble over his head. Meanwhile, Drew's old friend Daniel believes he has met the love of his life in the shadowy character of Vincent Jett. While _Gumshoe Gorilla_ lacks some of the brilliance of his first book, _The Gumshoe, the Witch, and the Virtual Corpse_, it is nevertheless a very good book. First, it's a well-written mystery that kept me guessing to the very end. Second, it's a fascinating view of things to come if current trends continue in American society. This book contains very little violence. It has &quot;adult situations&quot; but they aren't explicit. While this book is a sequel to _The Gumshoe, the Witch, and the Virtual Corpse_, it does not contain all of the same characters and can function as a stand-alone novel. It also leaves some plot lines open, so there will probably be another book to follow."},{"Title":"Gumshoe Gorilla","review":"I read this book in about 2 days. It's a good, fast read. The plot moves quickly and the character development is just enough to make you really like them. There are some parts of the book that touch on some deep, intense subjects, such as testing for a &#65533;gay&#65533; gene, and political/religious ethics. I like the fact that the author doesn&#65533;t spell everything out. He assumes the reader is of average intelligence and can put 2 and 2 together. Although the mysteries aren&#65533;t that hard to figure out, the fun is in how the characters deal with them. My favorite character is \\"Jen\\" the witch. Not just b/c we share names... but she is Wiccan and has a wicked sense of humor. I would love to see a book just about her. My ONLY complaint is that some of the story lines were left hanging at the end of the book. Maybe that was on purpose to pursue them in the next book. I am definately doubling back to read his first book, The Gumshoe, the Witch, and the Virtual Corpse."},{"Title":"Gumshoe Gorilla","review":"When momma had the idea of cloning five children from the cells of a well-known actor, she knew exactly what she was doing. In 2025, the Rockland Brothers are hot property, especially since they make it possible to film five scenes at once. This is important when the average television show must be instantly available at all levels of sex and violence. So when Skye Phillips shows up in the offices of private investigators Drew Parker and Jen Gray worried about some 'trouble' that Charles Rockland may have become involved in, it gets their attention. Soon Jen is on the set posing as an acting intern and Drew is digging up trouble in the background.Drew has another problem. Daniel, a not even slightly reformed prostitute and good friend has started to use drugs and has gotten into serious trouble. He has become entangled in a relationship that seems to be leading him into places even weird people shouldn't go. Drew is more than a little worried, especially when he finds that some of Daniel's new friends have a strong taste for fresh blood. Between the brothers Rockland and Daniel Drew is getting very little sleep. Just to make things a bit more complicated Drew finds himself nursing a two-week-old kitten and arguing with the Cherokee Nation.This is a complicated tale that never unravels, full of a rich stew of ideas of what can happen in the future with only a few twists. Witchcraft works and large gaps divide the various religious segments of the population. Fundamentalists have their own schools and cry out publicly about the International Satanic Conspiracy. Homosexuality has gained general acceptance, but the ability to test for the gene involved has had major social repercussions, which add much of the punch to the story line of the 'Gumshoe Gorilla.' If you like science fiction, fantasy and mystery in a heady concoction with a good dose of tongue-in-cheek social commentary, Keith Hartman is the author for you.Hartman manages his story by telling it from multiple viewpoints. Unlike 'The Gumshoe, the Witch & the Virtual Corpse,' where no one was in charge, Parker and Gray are clearly the stars. But expect to see the action from the viewpoints of most of the rest of the caste, both victim and bad guy. Normally I do not like this style of writing, but Hartman manages to make it work, building great rapport between the reader and the characters. Occasionally things get confusing, but no worse than it must be like to live in Hartman's novel new world."},{"Title":"Gumshoe Gorilla","review":"Let us begin this review with a renewed claim on the publisher (there was one in my review of the first episode too): not only the editing is lousy, this has already been pointed out by the other reviewers, but how is it possible to let such a fun book go out of print? Again? Just like volume one?This second episode is vastly different from the first one.This time Mr Hartman employs less points of view, nearly always Drew and his partner Jen, which is an extremely fine thing because he still has not found out the way of giving each character an individual personality through his writing. As in the first episode this is particularly noticeable in the use of puns and witty remarks which are alike.Another remarkable difference is that this time we are faced with two unrelated intrigues, far less complex and involving less characters and a more straightforward plot. It may seem a loss and maybe it is, but the book gains proficiency and focus.This time the supernatural gore though still present leaves more room to a classical mistery.The novel is quite long but such a page turner that you hardly realise it. It is funny and keeps you laughing silly but it has an edge, a hard one. No major villain this time, less attention to the town's complex melting pot, but if you do not get to much distracted by the wit you still notice the issues of mass media and that of the selective abortion of gay kids. Once again there is no direct statement about them, Mr Hartman leaves it to his reader to do the the ethical math, he simply displays -all too- believable facts that are likely to take place in our globalised future.The general tone seems lighter but it is not. Once again we are lead to wonder about this future Atlanta of religious intolerance, where so-called Christians throw away the life of their gay children, where corporations globalise tastes and individuality and where the government of the biggest democracy of Planet Earth does nothing to preserve the right to happiness of its citizen, their cultural development, their well being; it prosecutes crimes such as drug using and adult prostitution (involving after all consenting adults) but allows gross social injustice and corporated crime.Characterization is simple but well done. The matter of Drew's being a shaman and Justin Weir's death are hinted but not developped, calling out loudly for a further episode I am most eager to read."},{"Title":"Gumshoe Gorilla","review":"Enough already! I loved the first book, and the second is no exception . . . but several plot twists, hooks, thingamignies - what ever you want to call them are not explained. So where does that leave me? Desperately wanting book three!For those of you who may not have read Keith's first book (I take some sort of pity on you, as you obviously live on a desert island some where in the pacific) this second installment takes off like a marathon runner and shows no signs of stopping, right up to the last page.Very nice Mr. Hartman, I'm looking forward to knowing more about Daniel."},{"Title":"Gumshoe Gorilla","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the first book in this series and equally enjoyed this sequel. The new edition is really fantastic. The editing is much better and the interior illustrations are a neat surprise. The storytelling is the same high level. I love Keith's visions of the near-future, the interplay between the characters and the fun, involving story. Keith has a gift for characterization and dialogue and I find myself drawn into Gumshoe's world. The interior illustrations really are top-notch and add to the overall enjoyment of the novel."},{"Title":"Gumshoe Gorilla","review":"I'll say this: I was hooked by page two. Some of the characters from the first book have been cut out, or their roles downsized, and several characters have been added. I was pleased to find that Jen, Drew's Wicca partner has a larger role in this one. OK, to be fair, I still havn't finished it, but so far, so good. I'm already hoping for another sequel."},{"Title":"Gumshoe Gorilla","review":"Quirky, well written and a lot of humor. The plot has some interesting twists and I enjoyed the mystery. I wished the author would write more in this series."},{"Title":"Gumshoe Gorilla","review":"The first book about Drew Parker's adventures as a detective in the futuristic world was easily one of my favorite mystery novels, so I was excited to see that there was a sequel. Once again, Hartman managed to write another great story, and I found it hard to put my kindle down.I was first attracted to this series for the GLBT themes, and I am happy to say that homosexuality is treated reasonably well within the story itself. My only complaint is that I'm not 100% comfortable with the thought of gayness being genetic. My problems with this are actually brought up in both books, and the series tries its best to show how this medical advancement affects society. So even though the subject itself was a bit troubling, it was handled realistically.My only complaint is that the kindle edition is in dire need of an editor. I counted at least a dozen typographical errors within the text as I read this book."},{"Title":"Gumshoe Gorilla","review":"Keith Hartman's next novel should feature a really bad copy editor who is horribly killed because he simply couldn't recognize an error, even to save his skin. It would be partial revenge for the work - or lack of work - done on Gumshoe Gorilla. Almost every page contains an error, and almost every error in the grammar book is made more than once. Capitalization, font, spelling, and every element of punctuation known to the English language (especially apostrophes) - each and every one gets horribly mangled in this novel. So, if you can read English reasonably well, don't expect to be able to read this book without cringing and moaning in pain.Despite that, though, it's a fairly good book - it'd be worth four stars without the editing problem. The characters are still fun, the writing is still funny (even if it would make Strunk and White foam at the mouth), and Hartman still has a deft hand with social satire. Unfortunately, the plot isn't quite as intelligent as The Gumshoe, the Witch, and the Virtual Corpse's was - it's too easy to put the pieces together. Readers who are looking for a puzzle to solve will be finished well before the book is over.But readers looking for a light, enjoyable book with lots of humor will really like Gumshoe Gorilla. They'd just better bring their red pens with them."},{"Title":"Gumshoe Gorilla","review":"This is the follow on toThe Gumshoe, the Witch, and the Virtual Corpsea really outstanding book. But if you don't read it first this book is very confusing as situations and characters are carried over from the previous book and explained late or not at all.The Gumshoe Gorilla is Drew's (he's a seer as well as gumshoe) totem. The Totem is Monk Malone a character from a TV series. Totems are more powerful than traditional and are taking on their own characteristics from TV etc.4 1/2 Stars if you read the first book first. The plot here is exceptional with a villain who is quite mad but the madness is not the cause of the villainy but rather is the reason that the villain sees his behavior as acceptable.You down load TV and can chose ratings and content; i.e. more sex, more nudity etc. A possible future concept, however the author makes fun of himself with the ecco friendly Hindu lesbian version with extra car chases..Some good humor as the nude version of Oklahoma. And the SMOF (Secret Masters of Fashion). The characters are vividly and well drawn and the plot is convoluted and exceptional. There are a few pieces that never get resolved; for instance Drew is assumed to be looking for the Poet and he is not. Then there's the bird who recites a poem to Drew and is then eaten by some jaws that form out of the pavement. This just adds interest.The Poet using the highway status signs for his poem like the old Burma Shave adds (see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma-Shave for explanation and examples).Two minor bobbles: encryption is not the protection that the author thinks but hey it's a fantasy and he's entitled. The other is a matter of fact; copyright is created when a work (poem) is fixed in a tangible media (the traffic signs). And runs for 95 years from publication. But the Production guy probably doesn't know that."},{"Title":"Gumshoe Gorilla","review":"Keith Hartman is a national treasure--I love his view of the near-future, I love what he does with characters, the details and sly cultural references make 2025 Atlanta feel very real to me.There are some frustrating things about this book, though. As other reviewers have mentioned, there are plot threads that get brought up and just dangle, forgotten about. There are also typos every three or four pages, and the font size keeps changing--who proofread this?!?"},{"Title":"Gumshoe Gorilla","review":"I think this was a great story. It was fun and engaging. It didn't seem to be as serious as the previous book, but I still loved all the characters that return for this book. I find any complaints about the \\"gayness\\" a bit over done. I suppose those people would rather there was nothing gay at all. The book never comes near a pornographic level as atleast one reviewer suggests.All and all a great deal of fun. That said, I wish he would choose a new publisher as the place delivers crap du jour once again. Typos that stop the flow of the reading. I find myself having to stop and reread sentences just to figure out what the writer actually meant. Font sizes change from page to page causing me to wonder if there is something signifigant being said but alas no, it's just a very poor printing of a really fun book."},{"Title":"Gumshoe Gorilla","review":"While I enjoyed Gumshoe Gorilla, it didn't have quite the impact of the first novel. I guess sequels are often like that. The idea of telling the story from different perspectives have a greater sense of uniqueness the first time round.

I would love to read more by this author."},{"Title":"Gumshoe Gorilla","review":"I've read \\"The gumshoe the witch and the virtual corpse\\", and enjoyed it so much. It was one of the most fun books I've read in a long time.I went ahead immediatly and bought the sequel...which was such a dissapointment.It seams like it takes more then the same charecters in order to make a sequel work. For starters, you should have an interesting plot, one that will hold on through the hold book. This book, on the contrery, has a plot of a nine-year old writer.Keith also took all the Gay subject, that was like a far echo in the first book, and made it a fundemental isue here. In some parts, i felt like I'm reading a soft gay porno book. Way too much for my taste.And last, as mentioned by others here, all the typos and font changes. Who ever edited this book should be fired immediatly.So, for those of you who didn't read any of Keith's books, run and buy the first part.And for those seeking a good sequel - I suggest skip this one and maybe wait for his next book."},{"Title":"Two Year College Student Guide to Creating a Great Resume","review":"My title seems very appropriate, as after i read this book, it really motivated me.

It doesn't get much into mastering the techniques until later in the book.The book is VERY easy to follow, and is organized well. I had a hard time putting down the book, as it's really interesting and doesn't discourage you with the too much information at once. I've bought a few books on memory, and I would definitely recommend this as a starter.The only complaint I have with the book is how he doesn't show all of the techniques used by the memory champions in great detail. He seems to much prefer the 'Roman Room' method, than the 'Journey Method'. There isn't anything wrong with this, but he didn't seem to mention the 'Journey Method' much, if it all.If you're looking for a beginner book getting you into having a better memory, I would highly recommend this book. Though, if you've had an advanced background on mnemonics and memory, most of the information in this book will not be very beneficial to you.I hope you too will find this book a great starter to your new memory."},{"Title":"Memory Power: You Can Develop a Great Memory - America's Grand Master Shows You How","review":"I've read other books describing The Roman Room and other techniques.

He favors \\"SEA\\" which means using sensory, emotions, and actions to create an active combined image based on terms you are trying to learn - finding associations and using personal interests to make them even more memorable. He advocates journaling and provides a list of questions to ask yourself. He explains how memory deteriorates and what repetition learning strategies we can use to prevent that. And his favorite is clearly the Roman Room. Considering how much he uses it for the competitions, I'd say his expertise proves the value of this method, and I'll be using it for school, memorizing vocabulary I've always wanted to learn, etc. I think his version of ten items/room is a bit limited, so would recommend doing more research on it.. Some of the book goes into detail about his life and how to avoid stress, etc. Those were skim chapters for me. And I thought the exercises for memorizing names were boring. I think that unless you have a real passion for memorization, writing lists should still be used, b/c memorizing everything if you're as busy as I am would pack alot of clutter in the brain, and time wasted memorizing versus doing. But for meaningful projects, this book is useful."},{"Title":"Memory Power: You Can Develop a Great Memory - America's Grand Master Shows You How","review":"There were several tips that I incorporated into my classroom lessons and in which students benefit from.

This book is very easy to read. Scott has a gift for narrative writing. As for the effectiveness of his techniques, I can't really say if they work for me or not. I have a very good memory, so a lot of his suggestions were not really useful to me. The Roman Room did not help me, as I have a great eye for detail. Scott provides a lot of charts and a way for the reader to implement the techniques.

Dr. John Finley Williamson was one of the giants of choral music. He founded the Westminster Choir College in Princeton, New Jersey (still going strong as an arm of Rider College). And he created the fabled Westminster Choir, which under Williamson's direction was the choral ensemble-of-choice for the likes of Arturo Toscanini, Bruno Walter, and Leonard Bernstein. The book brings together for the first time a collection of Dr. Williamson's writings, drawn primarily from articles and lectures spanning some four decades.There is much practical advice here on the basics of singing and conducting, from proper pronunciation, to planning and running a satisfying and productive rehearsal. Of particular interest is his detailed discussion of the physiology of singing, of how the well-trained singer engages the entire body in the service of his or her art.Reading the various pieces that make up this volume, it becomes apparent that Dr. Williamson was not only a gifted musician, but also quite skilled at putting his musical ideas into words. An especially pleasing example is his discussion of how to achieve the optimum balance of voices in a choral ensemble. He compares the process to building a New England church -- from the \\"strong, firm foundation\\" of the bass section, to the first sopranos who provide the \\"glistening point of the spire.\\"A detailed discography of the Westminster Choir rounds out this portrait of a man Bruno Walter described as a gratifying combination of \\"artistic idealism and cheerful faith.\\" The book was a labor of love for its compiler and editor, Joseph G. Beck. A Westminster alumnus, Beck studied under Dr. Williamson, and is an accomplished singer, voice teacher, and choral conductor in his own right. We owe him a debt of thanks for sharing with us this man he knew so well as teacher, mentor, and friend."},{"Title":"Selected Writings of John Finley Williamson","review":"Dr. Beck's compilation of the writings of John Finley Williamson is a valuable addition to any choral director's library and would be useful for choral singers as well. In the essays included, Williamson \\"talks shop.\\" His explanations are succinct and very pertinent to real rehearsal and performance situations.Dr. Beck's capable editing arranges Williamson's essays in a useful order for reference and the biographical material provides incite into the career of a single highly motivated choral artist who, by vision, energy and imagination, built a local choral group into a national institution.Robert Howard, conductorBelleville Philharmonic Orchestra and ChoraleWebster University Concert Choir"},{"Title":"The lives of the twelve Caesars (Half-title: Bohn's classical library)","review":"In historical study there are two types of literature. Secondary sources are written based on the original writings which are known as Primary sources. If you want to lern about the earliest Roman Emperors this source is indispensable. True, some of it is not historical and Suetonius is somewhat of a gossip monger at times, seeing as he explains in detail the various sexual appetites of each Caesar as well as other deviant behaviour. Still, this is one of the foremost primary sources about those famous Romans and most of the history books written on the Caesars are standing on Suetonius' shoulders."},{"Title":"The lives of the twelve Caesars (Half-title: Bohn's classical library)","review":"Not much is known about the life of Gaius Suetonius Tranquillis. He was probably born in A.D. 69--the famous 'year of four Emperors'--when his father, a Roman knight, served as a colonel in a regular legion and took part in the Battle of Baetricum.Suetonius became a scribe and noted secretary to the military set, eventually ending up in the service of Hadrian, who was emperor from A.D. 117-138. He was dismissed for 'indiscreet behaviour' with Hadrian's empress, Sabina, but not before doing sufficient research to complete many books of a historical nature. His attempts at philosophy were much less well received, and most of his history has been overlooked by all but classical scholars, but this work, 'The Twelve Caesars' has held the imagination of more than just the scholarly set since it was first written.Suetonius had the good fortune of speaking to eyewitnesses from the time of the early Caesars. Much of his information about Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero in fact comes from those who observed and/or participated in their lives. Suetonius is in many ways more of a reporter than an historian--he would record conflicting statements without worrying about the reconciliation (this set him apart from Tacitus and other classical historians who tried to find a consistency in stories and facts.Suetonius has been described as the tabloid journalist of ancient Rome, because not only did he not appear to check facts (which in fact is not true--he did check, he just didn't try to smooth over the conflicting facts), but he choose to concentrate on the private lives, motivations and personality quirks of his subjects rather than their grand plans, policies and military/political victories. Thus, many details of the lurid scene appear. Suetonius, and this volume in particular, formed much of the basis for Robert Graves as he wrote 'I, Claudius' and 'Claudius the God', which in turn pulled up the popularity of Suetonius in this generation.Suetonius had first hand knowledge of many of the Caesars who followed the Claudians, and ready access to the archives of the imperial family and the Senate, given his imperial posting.This translation is not intended to be a faithful rendering of the language (which might well result in a stilted English construct) but rather a faithful account of the stories Suetonius tells. Graves has taken the liberty of changing monetary, date, and technical terms into standard English measurements of close kinship of meaning.For the record, the twelve Caesars, about whom Suetonius writes, are:+ Julius Caesar+ Augustus+ Tiberius+ Gaius Caligula+ Claudius+ Nero+ Galba+ Otho+ Vitellius+ Vespasian+ Titus+ DomitianSuetonius held nothing back in writing about the personal habits of the emperors and their families, nor did he hold back in his moral judgement of them. Of Tiberius, for instance, he wrote that Tiberius did so many other wicked deeds under the pretext of reforming public morals--but in reality to gratify his lust for seeing people suffer--that many satires were written against the evils of the day, incidentally expressing gloomy fears about the future.... At first Tiberius dismissed these verses as the work of bilious malcontents who were impatient with his reforms and did not really mean what they said. He would remark: 'Let them hate me, so long as they fear me!' But, as time went on, his conduct justified every line they had written.Graves' edition of Suetonius is available under many covers, from hard-back study editions to Penguin paperbacks, including a wonderful, finely printed edition by the Folio Society. Take a step back into the seemier side of ancient Rome, the side most history courses overlook in favour of more traditional historical events, and hie thee to the bookstore for this work."},{"Title":"The lives of the twelve Caesars (Half-title: Bohn's classical library)","review":"Seutonius did the world a great service when he wrote his \\"The Lives of the Twelve Caesars\\". This was one of the first primary sources that I read, and it remains a favourite of mine.Seutonius tackles each of the first twelve Caesars in chronological order, with a section on each one. He claims he has used many sources, and has even included some hearsay or otherwise unconfirmed information. He certainly was not shy about airing their dirty laundry.Unlike a lot of ancient authors that get translated into English, Suetonius' style is very relaxed and very easy to get absorbed into. Even in translation, the book maintains a brisk pace and has enough to keep one interested until the last page.Suetonius' \\"The Lives of the Twelve Caesars\\" is a fascinating book, written with access to sources long lost to us. This is a great book to read and enjoy, simultaneously being good for those interested in serious study of the period."},{"Title":"The lives of the twelve Caesars (Half-title: Bohn's classical library)","review":"Suetonius book covers the lives and works of the 12 leading Romans of the periode from ca. 70BC to 96AD: Julius Caesar, Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Vespasianus, Titus and Domitianus. He describes their commendable achievements first an then goes in depth into their not so nice qualities too. The account he gives is lively and alive with quite private details of the 12 men. It's a fascinating read that also gives the reader an insight into Roman live in the first century AD"},{"Title":"The lives of the twelve Caesars (Half-title: Bohn's classical library)","review":"This is a very comprehensive study of the 12 Caesars, and not just a fun reading book. If you are at all interested in Roman culture and leaders, then this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"The lives of the twelve Caesars (Half-title: Bohn's classical library)","review":"Our human nature drives us to want to know the \\"real story\\" behind great historical personalities. Much like \\"People\\" or \\"Us\\" magazine, Suetonious gives his readers back curtain access to the lives of the rich and famous. No salacious story nor tantalizing scandal is ignored. While many of his portaits are interesting, most of the biographical sketches are ultimately mere fluff. Enjoyable but disjointed if you do not know your Roman history. Finally, the great British actor Derek Jacobi's audio performance really lifts what is really a three star book."},{"Title":"The lives of the twelve Caesars (Half-title: Bohn's classical library)","review":"I find this book essential not, as most readers see, a simple history of Rome, but rather as a grim example of the excesses possible when democracy fails and absolute power is contained in one human being(Rome beginning its career as a wonderfull Republic). Although most see Suetonius' vivid descriptions of lust and other deviant vices as mere gossip, I propose that is exactly what he is trying to elucidate for the ages to see. These same excesses gave rise to almost the entire fundamental ideas of the religion known as Christianity and their whole hearted opposition to orgies, torture, crucifictions, feeding to the lions and the like, all due to the whims of deranged monkeys who called themselves Caesar. Read for yourself, for example, the history behind St. Valentine's day."},{"Title":"The lives of the twelve Caesars (Half-title: Bohn's classical library)","review":"This book is wonderful and MUST be read by anyone interested in Roman history. It's focused on emperors life, reported annedocts and facts.Just beware: not all the facts are considered to be true."},{"Title":"The lives of the twelve Caesars (Half-title: Bohn's classical library)","review":"Reading this book is a bit like being on scene in ancient Rome. The style is not what we are used to in contemporary biographies and that adds to the charm of this volume. The Caesars are exposed for inspection, warts and all. Suetonius breathes life into them as they strut across the stage of the Roman Empire."},{"Title":"The Unadjusted Man","review":"\\"Without inner psychological liberty, outer civil liberties are not quite enough...a new liberator emerges, a bad mixer and scandalously devoid of 'education for citizenship': The Unadjusted Man... [He] is the final, irreducible pebble that sabotages the omnipotence of even the smoothest-running machine...\\"The forward and the first chapter go on in this vein, and so I think I can be forgiven for assuming, after finding this book by accident in the mid 1990s, that the whole would be focused on building a life of inner fortitude against the various insidious types of conformity that can smother a man and rob him of the best chances to see through to the world and experience life direct and raw.I was eager to read this book from the moment I came across it, but waited, then forgot, then waited. Now I am disappointed. Rather than being about the inner life, most of the book is focused on politics, and the politics of a narrow slice of post-WWII history.The author begins with chapters defining (see above) what the Unadjusted Man is, as against the maladjusted man and two types of the Overadjusted Man (essentially the low-brow and high-brow). To be unadjusted is not to reject conformity itself but to see above the horizon of the current age and look for antecedents throughout history and across culture.The Unadjusted Man is the inheritor of freedom, but freedom did not develop as a theoretical inheritance of \\"the people\\" but as an institutional inheritance of the aristocracy, born from the conflicts between despots and nobility. In America, an anti-populist like John Adams is the closest model.But after these few chapters, we get a long digression on politics in which we learn that neither political party is a truly conservative preserver of freedom. Labor unions are conservative, quasi-medieval institutions. The New Deal is a conservative political development that is to Marxist revolution as the Glorious Revolution of 1688 is to the French Revolution. And McCarthy was the worst thing to happen to America.The last section of the book is a collection of disconnected essays on the arts and ethics.Although agreeing at various points with the author, the book is too immersed in time. I don't have much interest in the political wranglings that concern over half the book. The reflections on living in overadjusted times that I thought would compromise the subject matter appear only sporadically, as in a brief discussion of amateurism in the arts and retaining the ability to have insight.I only just noticed that there was a2006 editionreleased, and it will be interesting to see what revisions and redactions have been made. For those who are interested, the most interesting and foundational chapters from this 1956 edition can be found online."},{"Title":"Play it Again (From the Files of Madison Finn, Book 3)","review":"I loved this book BTW (MF humor). I know how Madison feels to want something and tries to do it and then chickens out at the last minute so I didn't par-take in her regret in not trying out for a show part in The Wiz.

A must for anyone who likes flowers and wants to know what kind they have."},{"Title":"The National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Wildflowers: Western Region","review":"The book is well organized, comprehensive, and fairly easy to use. Flowers are organized by color, like the Audubon bird books. The only problem I find is that the pictures of foliage are not always clear because the focus is on the flowers. Unfortunately, most wildflowers have a fairly brief period of bloom. The difficulty of identifying a plant by foliage limits the usefulness of the book slightly."},{"Title":"The National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Wildflowers: Western Region","review":"This relatively small, plastic-covered guide is a gem - easy to use and far more comprehensive than any of the dozen region specific books I own. It contains 660 flower pictures; the photographic technique and printing quality are excellent. Wildflowers are grouped first by blosson color and then by one of five basic blossom styles. The system makes quick work of identifying new plants. Cross reference numbers link to a second section which has descriptions sorted by botanical family. It's the most useful guide I've come across."},{"Title":"The National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Wildflowers: Western Region","review":"We live in Arizona so we chose the guide for the Western Region.

Nowhere in that book is there a picture of one. There is a slight mention of centaurea cyanis on p. 364, but that's it.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Wildflowers: Western Region","review":"As with all the Audubon Field Guides, so too with this one. The color plates are the best in the \\"field\\" of all the field guides; these photos are indispensible for any one who needs to identify any of the more than 650 species of western wildflowers.The durable leatherette cover, as well as the heavy duty (turtleback) book binding, make this a book that can easily withstand much wear and tear.The descriptive information is good; where the text starts to show deficiencies is in the Range, Habitat, and Comments sections of each species. The information tends to be vague and merely glosses over critical facts that should be included. I can only assume that it's the usual story of the editors not having the space to include more relevant information.The index is cross referenced to the color plates; this is a big plus when out in the field attempting to do identifications.

Unfortunately, this calendar did not meet my expectations. First, it's three dimensional which I hadn't realized. It fits together with two notches and is not very sturdy when set up. I was expecting a wall calendar style which I could just put on the fridge. This tree shaped style is nice to look at but something that my toddler wants to play with all the time. It's really too flimsy to play with since it's just thin cardboard. Also, the thing is loaded with gold glitter which comes off on the hands whenever you touch it to open the windows. This is very annoying to me, a contact lense wearer, and it gets all over clothes and everything! Third, the pictures inside the windows are not very interesting (granted I've only seen two so far...) and the illustrations are all a bit fuzzy and muted in style. It's not the kid-pleaser I had hoped for."},{"Title":"A Christmas Tree Advent Calendar","review":"This is really more than just an Advent calendar, it is a lovely addition to your Holiday decor too. I was thrilled to see this was not just your average old flat Advent, but one that can stand alone on a table or shelf. Very nice!

I'm planning on using this one again next year!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Tree Advent Calendar","review":"i thought a 3D tree would be fun - and it is. it sits on our counter, very cute, pretty coloring. I gave it four stars instead of 5 because any way you put it together, two sections of the tree are duplicated i.e. the two quarters face each other and have the same pattern. the other two sections look different. from far away you wouldn't notice it, but if you begin to look at how the tree is decorated, then it is very clear (two airplanes, two dolls etc. facing each other). also, you should know that the windows are on one face of the tree only (which was fine with us)."},{"Title":"A Christmas Tree Advent Calendar","review":"everything was great. the calander arrived in plenty of time and the price was good."},{"Title":"Radiant Health The Ancient Wisdom of the Chinese Tonic Herbs","review":"Great book,lot's of wisdom for rebuilding your lost energies.

It is laid out in a logical categorical order, which makes it very easy to compare different herbs. Ron has rated the herbs with a star rating that indicates how many treasures each herb will affect. Then he goes on to rate actual patent tonic formulas. It is a wonderful reference book, something you will refer to again and again for information and reinforcement, but it is written in very down to earth layman's language. It has an incredible amount of information, even down to some chemical descriptions and cellular activity, but if you aren't interested in going that deep, the descriptions are arranged so that you can skip whatever you don't want to read and go straight to the pertinent parts.

And, in the formulas section (which was the main reason I bought the book) the formulas just list the herbs and not their proportions! WHAT!?! How unhelpful.To know that herbs are in a formula is great, but it is not a formula without the proporation of ingredients.

In his easy-to-read book, Ron offers an introduction to the ancient philosophy of radiant health and provides an in-depth information about Chinese tonic herbs, many of which have been in use for over 5 000 years. Ron first covers the theory - principles of Yin and Yang, the Three Treasures of life, and the five main organ systems. Then he describes the individual herbs, complete with pictures and detailed descriptions of their properties, and includes herb combinations and formulas with their specific benefits. The book also includes mail-order resources. Overall, it is a very user-friendly reference, highly recommended to anyone interested in learning how to improve your overall health, increase energy and promote longevity.I have a personal experience with Ron's herbs - I visited his store in Santa Monica, and based on an advice from his herbalists started using some of his adaptogenic herbs that are described in the book.

Max Wilk has assembled facts, memorabilia (including original ads, costume designs, etc.) cast photographs, interviews with the authors...in fact, everything that has anything to do with this musical (including short, contemporary comments by no less than director/producer, Harold Prince and composer/lyricist, Stephen Sondheim) which became a theatrical, historical phenomenon.Wilk has an easy, very readable style and the story of how this show came to be and how, in fact, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein ever came to work together (this WAS, remember, their very first collaboration), how the musical was cast, rehearsed, directed, choreographed, had its title changed from &quot;Away We Go!&quot;, how theatre-goers begged and bartered for impossible-to-purchase tickets, and how this truly inspired musical &quot;took off like a prairie wildfire&quot; is exciting and a real page-turner.If you have any interest in live theatre, in musicals, in America during WW2, I urge you to, somehow, find this fascinating and handsome book."},{"Title":"Ok! the Story of Oklahoma!","review":"This is the kind of book that used to excite me, books all about the Broadway musical. Has there ever been a musical with as much to offer as OKLAHOMA? It wasn't always a surefire hit, for before it began, people thought, oh well, this is a pretty slow show, no girls, no big numbers, and livestock on the stage. The powerful imagination of Oscar Hammerstein II caught that cornsilk and lit it on fire with the poetry of his lyrics. Who can ever forget \\"All the cattle are standing like statues.\\" Mr Max Wilk evidently knows his OKLAHOMA and he has had great luck tracking down OKLAHOMA memorabilia. There are ticket stubs, photos of people watching the show, and the memories of those who first went to Broadway's \\"St James Theater\\" in March 1943 and made theatrical history.Richard Rodgers had been a topnotch Broadway composer for twenty years or more before OKLAHOMA but for one reason or another his music never really got under the skin of the mass US public. He had been partnered with the divinely talented Lorenz Hart for most of that time, and perhaps Hart had been caviare to the general? At any rate it took Oscar Hammerstein to begin Rodgers' incredible parade of shows with a heart. Rodgers wanted Charlotte Greenwood to play Aunt Eller but she was so busy she didn't get to play the part until the movie version many years later. (And she was great at it, still doing her trademark kicks with her elastic legs.) American soldiers in New York made the show a hit. Those hard men would sit in the back rows of the St James and weep like babies for love of the great land. In London, too, when OKLAHOMA travelled there, American soldiers sold out house after house, for when you're an American GI overseas there's nothing like a heaping dose of \\"We know we belong to the land\\" and the attending flagwaving.Wilk has it all on the ball, including the circumstances that led to the hiring of Agnes de Mille, top choreographer, to do the dances and ballets for this groundbreaking show. She was a strange creature, half magnet, half steel, but she brought something original to the Broadway stage, and her best dances have a unique poetry distilled out of a particular time and space. The movie version of OKLAHOMA preserves their flavor well."},{"Title":"Ingles para Latinos (Spanish Edition)","review":"I orignally bought this book for a friend who was trying to learn english.

The book is an anthropological study of three tribal cultures in New Guinea. The book still creates controversy, since Mead very explicitly connected her observations to a feminist and left-wing political agenda. Mead believed that human nature was malleable, and that the patriarchal gender roles in modern America were cultural constructs, and therefore could be changed. This still rubs many people the wrong way (see some of the other customer reviews).\\"Sex and Temperament\\" is very well-written, almost captivating, and gives you an eerie feeling that you are present in New Guinea together with Mead and the somewhat strange peoples she was investigating. From a purely literally point of view, it's a tour de force. Mead's political message is also crystal clear: she criticizes authoritarian childrearing practices, male dominance, and discrimination against \\"deviants\\". I read the book from cover to cover over a week-end.The book describes the way of life of three quite different peoples in the northeast part of New Guinea, then under British control. The Mundugumor and the Tchambuli lived along the Sepik River, while the Arapesh dwelled in the hills further north. In Mead's opinion, the Arapesh were a gentle people who promoted peaceful co-operation among both men and women, while the Mundugumor were cannibals and head-hunters, who promoted aggressiveness among both sexes. The Tchambuli, most sensationally of all, lived in a kind of matriarchy where the women were dominant and the men submissive.Critics of the book usually attack Mead's descriptions of the Arapesh and the Tchambuli (called Chambri in later sources).Despite the criticism, there is nothing inherently implausible about Mead's descriptions of the Arapesh. Mead does idealize them, but she nevertheless reports the facts so objectively, that a dispassionate reader can question her own interpretations. The Arapesh turn out to be a patriarchal society that practices infanticide of female babies, treats people with skin disease as out-casts, and have an almost \\"Straussian\\" view of their own religion. The initiated men of the Arapesh know very well that their tribal god is a fiction whose function is to keep people in line. On a more positive note, the Arapesh emphasize consensus, co-operation and sharing. Their chiefs have a mostly symbolic function, and violence between the villages is never allowed to escalate beyond a certain point. Anthropologists have described relatively egalitarian cultures in other parts of the world as well, and archeological excavations prove that at least one ancient high culture was peaceful, the Indus Valley Civilization, which incidentally also had strangely egalitarian traits. So what's the big deal about the Arapesh? It's also obvious from Mead's description that the co-operation among this people is to a great extent enforced, rather than voluntary, and that their society is less efficient because of it. Arapesh society gives the impression of a controlled chaos. Nobody has any incentive to learn new hunting skills, since everyone is expected to share the game with everyone else, and there are no innovations in agriculture or house-building, since everyone works on plots and houses belonging to somebody else. The best hunter in the village was ostracised since he refused to share. Many necessities are imported rather than locally produced. There is also a strong degree of suspicion between members of each village, and all Arapesh at some point consult sorcerers from the Plainspeople to cast magical spells on their fellows. Why the Arapesh are peaceful and co-operative is never really explained, but living in a poor region in the hills might be the reason. It's a survival strategy. Nobody is allowed to rock the boat, or else disaster might follow. As for being peaceful, perhaps the head-hunters of the plains simply aren't interested in raiding the mountain villages of the Arapesh?The Tchambuli are described as a people where the men are subordinate to the women. A later anthropologist who visited this people failed to confirm Mead's sensational findings. Mead apparently misinterpreted a temporary crisis situation during which traditional authority structures had broken down, enabling the women to challenge at least some of the men. This would explain certain curious anomalies in Mead's description of the Tchambuli. Mead points out that the Tchambuli are patrilineal, and that all land is owned by the men. Despite this, women wielded a lot of influence when Mead studied their culture. For instance, the women chose their mates, and controlled the household economy. There seems to have been a lot of tension between the sexes, between the legal power of the men (a husband even had the right to beat his wife!) and the extralegal but real power of the women. This doesn't sound like a \\"matriarchy\\" but rather a society moving in the direction of complementary gender roles without really succeding. Of course, \\"complementarian\\" societies have been described from other parts of the world. The most famous example of such a culture are the Iroquis, where men were chiefs and warriors, while the women owned all land and had legally recognized political power. Among the Iroquis, this system was stable. The Tchambuli never reached such a stable situation. It seems the men quickly regained the power after Mead had left New Guinea, perhaps due to their land ownership? The fact that further research has failed to confirm matriarchy among the Tchambuli has lead some to the rather rash conclusion that all societies are patriarchal, as if the only alternative to patriarchy is a situation where women oppress the men. In reality, there are many examples of cultures where men and women have equal influence.Ironically, the culture that really challenges the credulity of the dispassionate reader are the Mundugumor. They were supposedly affluent and owned rich lands, but nevertheless spent most of their time attacking other peoples and even each other, for no better reason than cannibalism. Further, the Mundugumor were neither matrilineal nor patrilineal, but organized in a kind of pseudo-clans known as ropes, which pitted a man against his wives, and sister against brother. Yet, members of conflicting ropes nevertheless lived in the same compounds! Somehow, *this* challenges our deeply held convictions about human nature. Why would an affluent people risk war or civil war, simply to eat human flesh? Why did the ropes pit family members against each other? In all other societies, some kind of family is the basic social unit! Yet, the conservative critics seem to have no problem with the Mundugumor. Why not? Presumably because they look like White middle-class philistines expect \\"primitive\\" peoples to look like: they are polygamous, aggressive, Hobbesian, know nothing about family values, and like the taste of boiled human meat. And, of course, they are patriarchal! Perhaps the aggressive sexual intercourse between Mundugumor men and women wet the appetites of a certain kind of androcentric males in our own society? My guess is that Mead and her associates encountered this people during an advanced stage of crisis or even dissolution. Indeed, several of the informants claimed that the Mundugumor ropes were not at each other's throats in the past.How does Mead explain the different gender roles in these and other cultures? She denies that there are any mental differences between men and women. Instead, she believes in individual differences of temperament. It's left unclear whether these are inherited or acquired at a very early age. Each society promotes some kinds of temperaments and attempts to suppress others. This is done mostly through childrearing. Most people, regardless of temperament, are successfully socialized and espouse the \\"right\\" temperament, at least in public. A few refuse and become deviants or out-casts. I consider the question of the exact relationship between nature and nurture to be complicated. However, the large variation of gender roles around the world surely means that social constructions and individual differences are more important than average genetic differences between the sexes. Also, it's unclear how effective the socialization process really is. All socities described by Mead seem to be torn between the official ideology and conflicting invidual interests, not just those of a few deviants. The Arapesh aren't perfectly peaceful - they have peace because they actively suppress the conflicts that *do* occur among their villages.Opposition to Mead comes from two quarters: patriarchal conservatives who believe woman's position is prone, and sociobiologists who consider patriarchy, hierarchy and war to be human universals. The former criticism is uninteresting. The Tchambuli may not have been matriarchal, but please note that the women did challenge male dominance when given the chance! This, of course, is what patriarchal conservatives fear might happen in their back yard, too. The sociobiological case relies heavily on the fact that later research failed to confirm matriarchy among the Tchambuli, plus sheer incredulity towards the Arapesh. That's an argument? Both anthropology and archaeology strongly suggests that patriarchy, hierarchy and war are *not* human universals. This doesn't stand or fall with the Tchambuli and actually confirm the Arapesh. Incidentally, the sociobiologists never discuss the Mundugumor, who seem to disconfirm kin selection. Questioning matriarchy is a more pressing problem, it seems. I leave the conclusions to the reader.\\"Sex and Temperament\\" is a flawed book in many ways. But it's not a book that can be willfully rejected either. Mead wasn't always right, but the errors are on the level of interpretation. The empirical facts themselves seem reasonably correct. Human nature may not be \\"infinitely\\" malleable, but it can construct societies that are peaceful, egalitarian or have other gender roles than the ones we are used to. It can even construct... the Mundugumor."},{"Title":"Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies","review":"Margaret Mead provided the foundation for many of the attitudes and philosophies of the mid-century's women's movement. Her insights into the culturally-based gender roles was a cornerstone in our understanding of humanity. This profound study of three very different societies, seperated by geography in remote New Guinea, clearly showed that culture can control our behavior. We can only conclude by her research that we must allow freedom for the individual, first and foremost, if we are to fully reach our potential as individuals."},{"Title":"Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies","review":"This was one of the most influential books in modern history, but unfortunately for Western society, it was a pseudoscientific fraud. Mead claimed that women were dominant in the Tchambuli tribe, without causing problems. This statement was used as the intellectual cornerstone of the later Women's liberation movement. However, reliable modern references such as Encyclopedia Britannica make no mention of female dominance or power in those tribes, except for infrequent taboo ceremonies by female witches. (That tribe is also called Chambri or Chimbu in modern references.) Mead also described the Arapesh people as pacifist, cooperative, happy folks, and that was used by later Columbia University students such as Kerouac and Ginsberg as the philosphical basis of the Hippy Revolution. Modern references describe the Arapesh as having been just as competitive and warlike as other primitive peoples.

Or does this kind of fictional writing ultimately undermine the cause?Weston LaBarre wrote: \\"When I was a graduate student in anthropology at Yale in the late '30's, Mead's Sex and Temperament came out. Puzzled that even a big island like New Guinea should have had three tribes waiting to be discovered to prove her point about the non-biological nature of gender, I went to Edward Sapir with my puzzlement. He said laconically, 'She's a pathological liar'. I was startled as much by what he said, as by the fact that an eminent anthropologist and chairman of a department should say this to a mere graduate student.

Guaranteed. Triplett's first collection demands her readers full attention and then delivers with finely accomplished and fiercely intelligent work.There are no delineated sections or subject headings in Triplett's book to separate autobiography from mythology, or divide religious questions from those relating more explicitly to carnal desires. For the reader, the result of this borderless poemscape is that the voice of the prophetic eventually becomes one with the voice of the everyday. In this way, Triplett echoes the accomplishments of the renowned Irish poet, Eavan Boland. Both women seem to insist on the intermingling of myth and memoir, of the ordinary with the ordained. Both women take on the blockbusters of literary tradition - - The Bible, The Iliad and The Odyssey in order to infuse the female characters - Eve, Queen Dido, and Persephone with seemingly more complex roles than they enjoyed in the original telling.However it is in the smaller, more personal poems: a young woman mourning her grandfather, a daughter imagining her mother's miscarriage, a lover caught in the too bright light of morning, that a more interesting voice appears on the page. In these poems, &quot;On Pattern,&quot; &quot;Stillborn,&quot; &quot;Spectral Dues,&quot; and &quot;Portraits at the Epicenter&quot; Triplett is at her best giving us a world of form &quot;and &quot; feeling. In &quot;On Pattern&quot; the following lines are not confined to the rituals of mourning. &quot;the family at your death keeps to form, having to act out that love of endings.And again, in these lines: &quot;. . It's the formal silence we love. The hush that's planned, the good answer.&quot;Poems and funerals are peculiarly similar in that they attempt to contain the uncontainable. Both construct a vessel for grief. Certain patterns of words, structures of lines, specified silences present themselves in both practices. These stanzas reverberate throughout &quot;Ruining the Picture.&quot; Triplett is clearly concerned with a multitude of forms -- art, myth, photography, and religion. All are considered and framed in her work. There is a compulsion to see beyond the forms, to discover the spaces and silences hiding within accepted traditions and by the same token a fear of 'ruining' what Triplett keeps close to the heart with too much 'light.'In &quot;Portraits at the Epicenter&quot; light is again under scrutiny. The dim light of memory, the camera's flash, the overbearance of bright sun, and the grotesque bomb light of Hiroshima are all juxtaposed. Again and again these images are snapped, cut, and flashed across the page. How to hold on to memory, how to tell the story, frame the photo, are questions posed without any comfort of answers. In &quot;Stillborn,&quot; perhaps the most emotionally charged poem of the collection, the narrator re-tells the story of her mother's stillborn child, &quot;the phantom child you also would have named Pimone.&quot; The voice is equal parts rage and despair, a wounded cry begun before birth.&quot;I wish we could tell one another what it is the stubborn flesh asks of us. For now all the issue I can offer is to dedicate the silence of this night to you and the shadow child that wasn't let to swim for the shore of his own voice the one who taught how little you could get from the botched scrawl of matter ...&quot; Sometimes silence is the best we can do. And yet the craving for communication remains, even if it is only scrawled matter, even if it is 'only' inscribed in the formal beauty of poems such as these. In &quot;Ruining the Picture&quot; we are introduced to an agile and adept new voice. A poet we can expect to hear more from. Pimone Triplett teaches in the Program in Creative Writing at the University of Oregon."},{"Title":"Ruining the Picture","review":"Pimone Triplett's work is well-crafted and crafty, graceful in its execution and stunning in its display of an imagination that is large and powerful. The language in these poems is beautiful, and there are poems here that make one swoon. This collection reads more like a third or fourth book; it is difficult to believe it is her first. It isn't often such a poet arrives. I suspect we will continue to see such striking work from Ms. Triplett in the future. One can only hope for such riches. // C. Dale Young, Poetry Editor, NEW ENGLAND REVIEW"},{"Title":"Ruining the Picture","review":"Pimone Triplett's poems defy easy categorization. Perhaps this is because she allows her poetic subjects to evoke different aspects of herself. Her identity shifts as it is wed to each poem's subject through a highly idiosyncratic relationship that is, in the end, about language. If you are tired of poems that scream for attention like spoiled children, or ingratiate themselves to you like abused dogs, then here are poems whose language and musicality invite you in as an equal welcome guest and tend to your mind and heart."},{"Title":"Ruining the Picture","review":"Pimone Triplett's poetry is like a really beautiful, really smart girl you fall for...at first you are so in awe of her beauty and the wonderful things she says and does that nothing else matters. Then you realize that you don't understand most of the things she says, but she's still so beautiful and they are wonderful things she's saying. Then you realize you're not really connecting with her well, though maybe you're learning something by being around her.You know how it goes. Eventually, you have to break it off, because you're just not right for each other. You're not really relating, you're just pretending for the sake of beauty and profundity. It might work for someone more beautiful and smarter than you are, but you need someone more on your level.It was fun while it lasted, you learned some stuff, but definitely not your best love."},{"Title":"Kat's Cradle","review":"The third book in the Kat Colorado series has, in my opinion, the most exciting scene.

Think Coward was an incredibly versatile, multi-faceted genius. Can well understand his sobriquet \\"The Master\\". I liked the story, the very interesting characters, the dialog, the wonderful acting and all the funny lines. I'm glad I heard it and obviously I enjoyed it. That said, the underlying idea was so much middle class schlock, without which there would have been no play. I also liked the way it was set up (Coward's idea or the director's?) - the musical interludes between scenes (each scene being in a different time period, the whole play spanning some 20 years). Each musical interlude was a song from the time of the scene played by a small orchestra. The songs BTW were American.In this play, the father, Frank, who gives more sermons than Marcus Welby, is an Atheist (so was Coward despite the fact that he was named Noel because he was born a day or 2 before xmas), said something I've thought for years and never heard anyone (not even Russell) say - that he doesn't want a god that singles some people out for special treatment and lets the rest go rot (said when he talks about the people who were killed or injured in WWI (the end of which is when the play begins, he's just home from it) and his wife counters with all the people who weren't)."},{"Title":"This happy breed","review":"Just want to simply say that the used book/script I ordered was in much better shape that I though I was going to get.Thank youOvi Vargas"},{"Title":"The Supreme Mystic: A Biographical Novel of the Early Years of Lord Krishna","review":"&quot;The Supreme Mystic&quot; by Amal Bhakta is a biographical novelised version of the story of Krishna, Vishnu's incarnation on the earth plane towards the end of Dwapara Yuga. The book follows the story as told by Krishna Dwaipayana Vyasa in the Tenth Canto of Srimad Bhagavath, written by Vyasa and a few other sources, given by the author at the end of the book.Vyasa means diameter, spanning and by extension, who spans. Vyasa also is an Amsa (part) of Vishnu and a great sage takes on that role in every Maha Yuga, which is one cycle of four Yugas. Krishna has one meaning, dark colored. Dwaipayana was added because he was born on a small island in a river. And since he divided the Vedas, that is spanned them, he was known as Vyasa. So, Krishna Dwaipayana Vyasa. The author could have explained this so that readers know the author of Srimad Bhagavat and other Puranas, epics etc. better. In fact, Hindu literature effectively started with Vyasa.The book is very interesting to read. Though written by a western devotee, it follows faithfully the Hindu text in major details. The style is easy to read and holds the reader's interest. If you are interested in other lands, people and cultures, you will find the book interesting.This particular book traces the story from birth of Krishna upto about 11 or 12 years of age when He killed Kamsa, His demonic maternal uncle. It is being followed by another book which covers Krishna's later years and which details His Bhagavad Gita, Song of God, given to His friend and disciple Arjuna on the battle field of Kuru Kshetra.Amal Bhakta writes with sincerity and devotion. He succeeds in making the reader visualise the situation being described. Line sketches at the beginning of each chapter additionally help the reader visualise the ancient times to which this story pertains. A praiseworthy effort.The author uses Hindi and Sanskrit terms without explanation, which may confuse the reader, not familiar with those words. A glossary at the end of the book, or a footnote explaining the terms as they occur, would have been better. A few names have been mis-spelt. The book also has a few minor editorial glitches, but is otherwise well-produced.This type of story lends itself well to a Multi-Media presentation. A companion CD, giving animated scenes, explanation of terms and references for a particular incident narrated etc. and a few scenes from the movies which have been made referring to these events in history would have greatly added value to this fine book.I commend Amal Bhakta's praiseworthy efforts in bringing Krishna closer to the Western World."},{"Title":"The Supreme Mystic: A Biographical Novel of the Early Years of Lord Krishna","review":"Spiritual, soulful Amal Bhakta, author of The Supreme Mystic, spins an appealing portrait of a god reincarnated as a young boy, beloved by all, with talents that often baffle many, a gifted singer, dancer and musician.

I highly recommend this book for everyone, young or old, believers or non-believers."},{"Title":"The Supreme Mystic: A Biographical Novel of the Early Years of Lord Krishna","review":"This story is absolutely amazing--it has more plot twists and turns than is found in most fictional books. Yet it is based on India's Vedic scriptures. Amal Bhakta's writing style is moving and suspenseful, with a cliffhanger at the end of each chapter. So you're delightfully compelled to keep turning the pages until you come to the explosive and fulfilling climax. Also, you learn about the playful, sportive side of God's personality that is generally unknown, so God becomes extremely relatable and accessable, showing both his divine and human qualities. This is a book to be read many times because each reading brings you closer and closer to God--a wonderfully uplifting and enlivening experience!"},{"Title":"The Supreme Mystic: A Biographical Novel of the Early Years of Lord Krishna","review":"Adventure, love, courage, excitement--all have their perfection in the reality of spiritual life.

He wrote this book that contains about 30 short stories of the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna from his childhood years. The stories are so beautifully written that it is hard not to be (emotionally) moved by them. In writing these stories, Amal Bhakta strikes the right balance between not providing too much detail and providing enough of the context and antics to make you want to read this book repeatedly. The stories are written clearly and crisply with so much love and devotion that I recommend this book as a must read for anyone who wants to learn about the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna."},{"Title":"The Supreme Mystic: A Biographical Novel of the Early Years of Lord Krishna","review":"MIDWEST BOOK REVIEW(used with permission)by Sherry RussellThe Supreme Mystic magically swooshes the reader up in tornado fashion as you experience and discover the astonishing early years of Lord Krishna's life.

The rest are just mediocre stories or those that make you think \\"What the hell was that all about?\\" Along with stories featuring all 8 doctors, you'll find the return of the Krynoids and the Master.

This collection is full of examples of this. Fetuses being sucked from aliens? Bisexed water-apes? I just don't see why these concepts were important enough to be roughly married to DR. WHO. However, as with any collection, there are diamonds to be found. In my opinion, these include the 7th Doctor adventure with Krynoids, the characters are depicted to perfection. The curious &quot;Model Train Set&quot; offers an interesting comparison between the 7th and 8th Doctors.

It covers a variety of topics, from preference maximization through existence and stability of eq'ia, to optimal control and growth models.However, I'm not sure what its niche is -- what this book provides that others don't, or that it covers more thoroughly. If you want math, read Simon and Blume or a math book. If you want micro theory, read Mas-Collel or Silberberg. If you want neoclassical macro theory, read Sargent. For optimal control, read Kamien/Schwarz or Seierstad/Sydsaeter. This book covers selected topics from each. Though it covers them well, much is left out.Noticeably absent from the book is any uncertainty, randomness, or probability. There is also no game theory. These seek huge omissions for a book which seeks to show the usefulness of mathematical techniques in economic analysis.Notation is also a bit unusual. I was a bit confused by some of the author's own notation for partial orderings and Cartesian products."},{"Title":"MATHEMATICAL ECONOMICS.","review":"This is an excellent book for every economist who want to learn more than what is taught in classic courses. It is true that its lecture demands solid knoeledge of the topic, but the author gives full explanations and foundations after each teorem or development, and it has helped me to get the necessary mathematical skills for building models.

The challenge of reading this book is something that no good economists can avoid."},{"Title":"MATHEMATICAL ECONOMICS.","review":"Akira Takayama's MATHEMATICAL ECONOMICS is one of the finest texts in the important field of quantitative economics. It is a highly referenced text, and I recall it being quoted by a number of instructors in my days as a graduate student in economics. Takayama meticulously combines mathematical models and techniques with economic concepts and proficiently demonstrates the relationship and relevance of quantitative analysis to the study of human behavior known as economics. Each chapter is coherently organized in a systematic and a structured manner. The author starts with basic concepts and progresses to more advanced techniques carefully and methodically to maintain the structure.Akira Takayama's text remains a work of treasure even though it was written more than twenty years ago. The information contained in this book is priceless and invaluable in the study of mathematical economics. The applications presented probably will never go into obsolescence even two decades from now. I would highly recommend this book to any graduate student in economics whose area of study requires the utilization of advanced quantitative techniques. For those who are less mathematically inclined, it can serve as a useful reference text."},{"Title":"Tough Enough To Be Vikings","review":"Tough Enough To Be Vikings is a comprehensive book that cronicles the history of the Minesota Football Vikings.

Not only were they clearly born enemies, but Lord Douglas was captivated by a sultry Roman beauty, while Pamela's head was turned by a dashing Italian revolutionary.

The good stabndard books that are out there for teachers (greenberg, millman and parker) mostly spend a huge amount of time filling in logical gaps that euclid omitted.but these gaps, being too subtle for mathematicians to notice for 2000 years, are also too subtle for students to appreciate. so the effort is kind of wasted, dwelling on niceties in a subject whose basics are big news to todays students.the present book does not do this, but presents interesting things even a seasoned mathematician may not know, like Pick's theorem for the area of a polygon in terms of the lattice points inside and on its border, and gives fun an d challenging exercises, like asking the student what the theorem of concurrence of altitudes for a triangle becomes after inverting the tringle with respect to a suitable circle.the question is, can you teach the more advanced and interesting stuff succesfully to people who do not know even the basic stuff. can you quickly give them enough of a feel for it to go on, or do you have to get down in the nitty gritty details? i.e. the problem with thsi book, is how long do you have to spend on the 2 page summary of high school geometry in appendix 5.oh, and the new higher price just made using it unfeasible to me, in the 5th editiion."},{"Title":"Modern Geometries","review":"I Love math so I loved this book (and the class it was for).

As I began reading this book I wanted to strangle her for some some of her opinions but as I went further I found her to be a very caring individual and one with a lot of personal courage. Frances is the mother of Anthony Trollope the prolific novelist but she too has some claim to prolificacy as she had 7 children in 9 years - no wonder she left England and husband (at least temporarily) for America!My overall impression of 1828 America as she presents it is (as the French say): \\"The more things change the more they are the same.\\" A good example of this is found on page 63 re the proposed building of a hog slaughter house close to some Ohio farm homes. The prevailing attitude then was that since money could be made why should there be any problem with building them! We have the same thing going on around our city just now where introduction of factory farms (hogs) are being bitterly contested by local farmers."},{"Title":"Domestic manners of the Americans, (The unit books)","review":"All I can say is: what a great read! Who knew? Quite frankly, upon first sight of this book I must admit a bit of dread as the puritanical artwork does not smack of fun and games. Of course, as a literature student, I should know better than to ever judge a book by its cover.Had I been Fanny Trollope writing such an account of America in the 1820s, I would be hardpressed to say that I would have changed a single word. Trollope has been the victim of many mean spirited caricatures and accusations by Americans and it still continues today, but what is interesting is that no one can do more than attack her person. In other words, no one seems to be able to refute her claims.Trollope's \\"bitchiness\\" seems, for the most part, merited by my standards and while she finds much to complain about concerning an American democracy in its adolescence, she certainly discovers just as many things that she likes or finds beautiful.Plain and simple, Americans collectively have a hard time taking criticism, especially from an outsider...and at that time, political criticism from a woman was deemed absurd if not audacious.Last but not least, Fanny Trollope is always sure to preface anything she says with the conscious realization that she can only speak for what she has seen/heard personally and is thereby not judging ALL of America.Trollope is witty and anecdotal and I think anyone interested in what an outspoken Englishwoman had to say about the New World should certainly pick up a copy. I found particular interest in gender/religious issues but got the most laughs out of her descriptions of American manners (or the lack thereof).It is always interesting to see how much things have changed, and better yet, how many things have remained exactly the same!"},{"Title":"Domestic manners of the Americans, (The unit books)","review":"For those of us who are curious how previous generations of Americans lived, the comments provided by foreign visitors can be invaluable. Oh, to see oursel's as ithers see us!Frances Trollope spent three years here, mostly in the Midwest, circa 1830. At the time, Ohio, while certainly no longer a frontier, was far from being a mature settled area. In fact, it was in the early stages of city-building. Cincinnati, while not a one-horse town, did not have very many!Ms. Trollope was a middle-class Englishwoman who came to America in hopes of developing a prosperous business. She was disappointed in this, which may have colored her views: she did not like America, and she did not like Americans. Since Ohio first received its first major influx of whites shortly after the Revolution, it is not surprising that Cincinnati still lacked paved streets and sewers during her visit--or, indeed, most of the accoutrements we expect of a city, or even a town. She despised the uncouth manners of the populace, particularly the universal practice of spitting tobacco juice everywhere.

Additionally, she was forced at the age of 50 to become a writer since her own husband was an intellectual failure. Her abusive tone about America was greatly contrasted by Alex De Toqueville and perhaps potential readers should balance Mrs. Trollope's caustic remarks with those of Toqueville's. John Finley, an Indiana poet, rejects Mrs. Trollope's remarks and took a swipe at her in his poem &quot;The Hoosier's Nest&quot;. Thus the first true CULTURE war from international authors was underway. The theme of culture was very much in vogue during the 1820s to the 1840s."},{"Title":"Domestic manners of the Americans, (The unit books)","review":"This is both a great read and an important historical document. Fanny Trollope was the mother of Anthony Trollope, perhaps the most prolific English novelist of the nineteenth century and my favorite. Fanny's husband was ineffectual in the breadwinning department, but fortunately for the family, Fanny herself was energetic and enterprising. She took one of her sons (not Anthony) and an artistic young man to the United States. She was planning to join a friend of hers who was a mover in setting up the utopian community in Harmony, Indiana, but the place turned out to be squalid, and she didn't stay long.Fanny spent most of her time in the U.S. in Cincinnati and in her book is very hard on the city and its inhabitants. She especially objected to the pigs' role as garbage collectors. (In those days, pigs roamed the streets freely, like sheep grazing.) Fanny felt most of the people she encountered were loud, dirty, vulgar, and fanatically patriotic. It is her vivid descriptions of the physical conditions and the people that give this book its historical and entertainment value.While she was living in Cinci, she opened a retail emporium and filled it with rather shoddy merchandise sent from England by her husband. She also attempted to bring culture to the inhabitants. Not surprisingly, both ventures failed.After Mrs. Trollope returned to England, she supported her family by writing novels that were quite popular at the time, though they haven't become the classics her son's have. She spent her final years living in Italy with another son and his wife."},{"Title":"Domestic manners of the Americans, (The unit books)","review":"Very entertaining read of the author's trip through 19th Century America, full of wonderful description and enlightening observations. Despite the griping below, Mrs Trollope simply reports what she sees - men spitting tobacco on the floor, ladies off in another room while the guys have a good time, etc. She reports accurately on our forefathers' rugged pioneer spirit, but points out the lack of education everywhere. We want to shout &quot;lies!&quot; but Mark Twain wrote about the same thing, and the aspects of our society that haven't changed much are still being commented on with the same frankness by writers like Saul Bellow, Gore Vidal, Dawn Powell, Paul Theroux and Joan Didion.

Her perceptive and caustic insights into the American character remain fresh and surprisingly timeless, as well as being lucid and elegant. The book became a best-seller in England; Mrs. Trollope's son Anthony was so inspired by his mother's success that he became an author himself.

I agree, however, with Mrs. Trollope's son, Anthony, who commented that Mrs. Trollope is a keen observer but she understands little.

Topics discusse"},{"Title":"Domestic manners of the Americans, (The unit books)","review":"In 1827, at age 48, Frances Trollope arrived in New Orleans en route with some of her family to Fanny Wright's utopian community, Nashoba Commune. When that residence din't work out for her, she contunued up the Mississippi by steamboat, then up the Ohio to Cincinnati, where she stayed for roughly two years, waiting for her depressed and bankrupt husband either to join her or to find the wherewithal to support the family in England. Life in Cincinnati was utterly dreary, and Trollope was gravely ill for an extended period. Finally she fled to the east, over the Alleghenies to Baltimore and to rural Virginia where it would seem that she survived chiefly by the support of friends. She managed to visit Washington and Philadelphia, then removed to New York City. Her final adventure in America was an excursion to Niagara falls, partly via the Eerie Canal. She must have kept ample notes, which enabled her to publish \\"Domestic Manners of the Americans\\" in 1832, very soon after her return to England. The book was an immediate success and established her career as a writer. Her husband, however, never found his economic footing; he fled to Belgium with some of the children in 1834, and he died there. Fanny's eldest son, the literary giant Anthony Trollope, had not accompanied her to America, but he also would eventually write an account of his travels there. Neither mother nor son were enthusiastic about the society through which they traveled.Unlike her son in later years, Fanny Trollope came to America not as a celebrity but as the most ordinary of economic immigrants. She had some introductions, and a few old friends from England residing here and there, but largely she was on her own, with little money, no marketable job skills, and children to care for. Thus she saw America from the bottom, from the level, you might say, of the dirt that hold the grass roots. She didn't see much that she liked, except the wild flowers, not until she reached New York anyway, and she saw even less that she respected. The America she described was a land of crude, bigoted, hard-drinking, money-grubbing louts and vulgar, silly, oppressed women. The staunchly independent western farmers lived, as she saw it, less comfortably and far less cheerfully than the least well-off of English peasants. Americans had few diversions, few pastimes, few entertainments, and seemed to have no sense that they were missing anything. They ate dismally -- bacon, onions and beef steaks thrice a day -- and worked themselves to early death, often just ahead of the fevers and agues that would have killed them soon enough anyway. They practiced the most odious sort of fanatical religion, virtually segregating their women from their men in all situations except under the quilt, yet the men showed little attention to church or morality while the women did little else beyond their household drudgery besides go to church, preferring the most hysterical forms of 'devotion'. Worse than their manners or the ugliness of their domestic arrangements, however, were their insufferable chauvinism -- their incessant boasting about their free institutions -- and their rampant hypocrisy in ranting about \\"equality\\" while sustaining slavery and brutally exploiting immigrant laborers from Ireland.Mrs. Trollope's book, needless to say, was not well received in America. I'd venture to say that she'd have been tarred and feathered if she'd returned to Cincinnati. Her indignation at slavery was both heartfelt and fully justified. Her outrage at the brutal exploitation of the Irish was entirely proper and accurate also; in fact, just in recent years, archaeologists reported in the Smithsonian journal the discovery of a mass burial of Irish workers on the Chesapeake canal, precisely the sort of shameful occasion Trollope reported.What I haven't yet mentioned, what probably matters most to a modern reader, is that Trollope's accounts are uproariously funny and entertainingly written. She's at her best and funniest when she's denouncing American barbarities and debunking American sanctities. Her style is relaxed and plain, surprisingly like that of her prolific son, and eminently readable. There a hundreds of delightful discoveries to be made in her descriptions: her astonishment at the multitudes of butterflies in Virginia in the summer, for instance, which brought tears to my eyes since such clouds of butterflies are gone today; her account of the liveliness of New York in comparison to other American cities even then; her bold curiosity in observing everything from revival meetings to all Black theater productions in New York. She was one unflappable \\"old English lady\\", as most Americans labeled her.By the time she wrote this book, she was also a genuine Conservative, her conservatism having been honed by her impressions of America. She may have expected to favor that Utopian community in the backwoods, devoted to the education of African slaves, but she went home to England an avid supporter of the established church, the peerage, and the monarchy, along with the social hierarchy of British life, the stiffer discipline of British education, and the general concern of Europeans with refinement and culture. Reading Trollope's \\"Tory\\" reflections on society, one can't help recognizing that modern America utterly lacks a sort of true Conservatism, unless we are to understand that all the ill-bred barbarisms and hypocrisies of 1830 are what \\"we\\" want to conserve. From naive \\"exceptionalism\\" to the overweening regard for ill-gotten wealth to a willingness to ravage nature for short-term profit, nearly everything Trollope found odious in America has been \\"conserved\\" at least in sections of the country. The one exception, bless our hearts, is the disgusting habit of chewing tobacco and spitting voluminously, a habit that revolted dear Fanny to the soles of her shoes. I'm sure she'd be delighted, if she were brought back to life to revisit all the scenes of this book. that chewing and spitting are no longer tolerated except on baseball diamonds. Otherwise, I suspect she'd write much the same book about travels in 2012."},{"Title":"Domestic manners of the Americans, (The unit books)","review":"Fanny Trollope (1779-1863) wrote over 35 novels and several non-fictions books in her effort to rescue her family from poverty. However, the most read of all her books is \\"Domestic Manners of the Americans\\" which she published in 1832. It was in that distant year that Fanny and two of her children traveled across the Atlantic Ocean. Her purpose was to join a utopian community in Tennessee whose denizens were freed slaves.Fanny left her impecunious and feckless husband the barrister Thomas Trollope back home in England. Her famous son Anthony did not make the trip as he was a student at Harrow School. Fanny knew her husband would join her in the USA when money became available. Later the family would flee to Bruges to escape creditors. Fanny eventually lived out her life in Florence near her son Thomas Trollope.After leaving Tennessee the Trollopes settled for two years in the Queen City of the West Cincinnati, Ohio. Fanny did not like America or the American people! She found us xenephobic; boastful, prideful and violent.She hated the hypocrisy of life in Midwest Ohio although she did attend such cultural attractions as opera, plays and lectures. She favored the state Anglican Church of Great Britain not caring for America's separation between church and state.This book could well be read alongside Charles Dickens' \\"American Notes for General Circulation\\" based on his 1842 six month trip to the USA.Both Trollope and Dickens found the Americans crude, lacking in mannersand eager to make a quick buck. Listen to Trollope at her most scathing:\\"..among the rich and the poor, in the slave states, and in the free states...I do not like them. I do not like their principals, I do not like their manners, I do not like their opinions.\\" (p.314).Fanny Trollope's book is more interesting than Dickens since she discusses colorful characters and shares anecdotes about her sojourn in our young republic. Like Dickens she hates the odious practice of tobacco chewing and the mangling of the English language. Trollope found us Yankees to be too serious and viewing us as poorly read. Unlike the wealthy and famous Dickens, Mrs. Trollope was a middle-aged woman fighting off poverty with her pen. I enjoyed her descriptions of nature such as those she paints of the Potomac River, Northern Virginia and the Niagra Falls area in New York and Canada. She is aware of flora and fauna and describes them with knowledge and in beautiful prose.Dickens and Trollope give us the eye to see America in the days prior to the Civil War when the curse of chattel slavery ruled the land. Since those days America has granted freedom to all citizens. I wish both Fanny and Charles could visit us again in the 21st century.

While tart and condescending, it is also an interesting document about the early republic, filled with descriptions of towns, customs, manners, and politics.Mrs. Trollope had no love for America and its rough, democratic citizens, although she made some shrewd observations. She was repulsed by the institution of slavery, and her story of comforting an ill young slave to the disgust of a little white Virginian girl of the same age rings true.On the whole her disdain for Americans was that they were not English, nor seemed to wish to be. Mrs. Trollope gave her highest praise to the Canadian children who came to the shore when she travelled by boat up the Saint Lawrence River to give deep bows and curtsies, something she considered far more proper than American handshakes.Mrs. Trollope is witty and observant, and if her perspective is skewed by her birth and circumstances, it is a refreshing antidote to purely American perspectives which saw only the good and glossed over the troubling."},{"Title":"Domestic manners of the Americans, (The unit books)","review":"Frances Trollope was, as Mark Twain put it, \\"handsomely cursed and reviled by this nation.\\" Yet she did no more than tell the truth as she knew it. Dame Trollope came from England in 1827 to make her fortune by opening a department store on the American frontier. She settled in the booming town of Cincinnatti, Ohio, then with a population of 20,000, where she thought a fortune could easily be made. Failing to see the real needs of the settlers she didn't yet know, she didn't make that fortune and was made all but destitute by the experience. Her disparagement of America is thus suspected by many of her critics to have rooted in malice. Such motives are futile to prove, however, and it is sufficient to consider her criticism stems from her reputably refined sensibilities as and Englishwoman, one who observed with some disconcertion the comparatively unbridled ways of Americans. Whatever her prejudice, her scrutiny of life in the new world nonetheless equals that of her exceedingly more favored contemporary from France.The reproval she elicits from Americans in part has to do with how her book, Domestic Manners of the Americans, was received in England. Released to the public in March 1832, it auspiciously concurred with debates in the British Parliament over democratic reform, when agitation for a new Reform Bill modelled on American government feverishly gripped the Whigs and the Tories. The Tories, seeking to curb democratic privileges, seized at Trollope's belittlement of American democracy, what she painted as no more than the pretense and propaganda of the economically endowed landower. The Whig supporters of the Reform Bill countered by denouncing her undemocratic cast. Ordinary Britons, meanwhile, were eating her book up for its lurid account of American life. Mrs. Trollope had found her success at last: at the age of fifty-two she became a literary sensation, thereupon setting her course on the writing of travel books and novels. The fact is, Domestic Manners outraged most contemporary American readers because they saw it as irresponsible and unfavorably disposed in its reporting. Still, newspapers all over the country quoted long sections from her book along with reviling commentaries. Today we value her vivid picture of travel and accomodations as much as her opinion on postcolonial American politics and society while keeping in mind that her experiences were not, by and large, fortunate.What counts here, however, is the detail with which she embroiders the records of her travel. After leaving Cincinnatti, Mrs. Trollope and her party traveled by stagecoach over the Alleghenies. A harsh journey, Trollope vividly describes it in what may be one of the more surprisingly favorable passages of her entire two-year visit. Commencing at Cumberland, Maryland, in 1808, it was in nine years to stretch some 130 miles across the Alleghenies to Wheeling, Virginia. In 1833 it extended to Columbus, Ohio, and twenty years later to Vandalia, Illinois. Trollope makes this sometimes perilous and turbulent ride sublimely picturesque. Trollope gradually progresses from rancor to rapture, though, of course, always retaining her faculty for precision and minutia and her talent for enunciating what most people only vaguely sense."},{"Title":"Twists and Turns","review":"Teesha and Keeba Washington have finally graduated from Brooklyn High School and are wondering what they are going to do with the rest of their lives. Although Teesha is a year younger, she graduated right along with her sister and the two of them are as close as any two sisters could be. Their mother is proud of her daughters' accomplishments thus far and only wishes that she could provide more in the way of their future, but life in the inner city isn't easy. Unlike their lifelong friends who have moved from the projects into college, or jobs such as TV commercials and computer programming, Teesha and Keeba haven't found their niche yet. The only thing they do is braid hair -- and they do hair quite well.Twists and Turns is a book that illustrates both the power of sisterhood and teamwork. On many levels this book is written for young adults, yet older readers will enjoy the story as well. Belief in each other, the skills of their craft and cooperation amongst friends and family, the Washington sisters rent a storefront in the neighborhood and open up TeeKee's Tresses.The elements of a good story are present in Twists and Turns as the girls experience jealousy and envy, political scheming and landlord greed. Through it all, the reader wonders if the girls can sustain themselves or will their hardships break their entrepreneurial spirit. While reading, one might question their resolve to overcome the stereotypical nature of their living and business surroundings. The plot takes many twists and turns but the journey chronicling their action is fast paced and energetic.Not a street fiction book, but certainly bringing it home that life in the inner city isn't easy, Twists and Turns captures the environment and the reality that everything in a supposedly bad environment isn't really as bad as it seems. Belief in yourself is one of the central themes from which everyone can benefit. Though this book is fictional, teenagers can picture themselves in the vulnerability of the Washington sisters and find strength in the positive outcome perseverance always yields."},{"Title":"Twists and Turns","review":"Keeba and Teesha Washington know that living in the projects is not easy.

Shortly after the celebration the girls are confronted with the question of their plans for the future. They don't have an answer.They consider the routes their closest friends have chosen but believe those paths don't apply to them. A librarian who lives in the projects by choice suggests to the girls that they can use their hair-braiding talent to make a success for themselves without leaving their own community.At first the girls are reluctant to take the idea seriously because of what it takes to get such a plan off the ground. But when a close friend agrees to provide the financial backing, the girls have no choice but to take the idea serious. And they do.They discover that a lot of hard work is involved in becoming business owners and they are willing to put forth the effort.

The rumor that some of the housing project residents would be moved to make room for \\"outside people with money\\" becomes a reality.

However, the slums of the Hillbrook Houses projects does not lend itself to a thriving business as the two young ladies cope with few customers, an unexpected rent increase and vandalism.This is a strong inner city character study that uses street slang to provide insight into the life of a new high school grad struggling with the changes of adulthood. The two sisters, the support cast, and Brooklyn are well- written and believable charcaters whose message is to work hard on what one does best. However, though entertaining and teens will appreciate the novel due to the protagonists and their friends, the story line lacks a center so that it feels like electrons without a nucleus.

There were places where it took me a day to absorb just a few pages, but the time was worth it."},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Reader","review":"It is at this point in the Balme and Morwood series that we finally can break away from the children's books. Up until this point the users have been forced to deal with cartoons, which are disgustingly badly drawn, and end chapter questions fit for a monkey. Now, however, real literature is set forth and we may all rejoice.Ceasar, Cicero, Catullus, Virgil, Livy, and Ovid now replace the story of Quintus, which surely had become dear to our hearts.One problem with this freedom, though, is that it is quite the leap of knowledge. As I had said, we jump from children's tales to literature and it is not without great effort that we may do so successfully. Be aware that this book is like the prior book squared. Buy a dictionary and make sure it is a good one. Also, in this book you will realize that though you thought you could read Latin by sight, you are now proven wrong. But, it is worth the hard work and this realization to get through this book.(P.S. the teachers' book is no help!)"},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Reader","review":"These four books make a great introductory course. They many not be the easiest, by any means, but they are far and away one of the best and most rewarding. While on one level it is definitely a \\"reading course\\" (i.e., it has you reading extended narrative prose from the very beginning) it really does combine the best of the modern and traditional approaches. The course develops reading skills as much as any \\"inductive\\" textbook (even one at the end of the spectrum like Cambridge Latin Course), and yet it teaches grammar explicitly and from the very beginning. Furthermore the grammar is presented in manageable amounts (though not in dribs and drabs), and authors tend to present things in a more sensible sequence than a strictly traditional textbook. Thus someone who finishes this course will have very strong reading skills and yet will have as solid an understanding of grammar and syntax as someone who has used an old-fashioned grammar-translation textbook like Wheelock.The premise of the course, which follows the life of the Roman poet Horace, is absolutely brilliant. We know a fair amount about the personal life of Horace through his Satires and Odes, and Horace lived through (and was even an active participant in) some of the most interesting events in Roman history. Hence, the entire course breaths Roman history. Also, the Latin of the narrative passages -- almost from the very beginning -- feels like real Latin (much more so than almost any beginning Latin book), and at times can be quite lovely. Book III (the last third of course that presents basic Latin grammar and syntax) introduces extended excerpts from the poetry of Horace and Vergil. This is a bit of a stretch for the beginner, but it's well worth the effort. Someone who has completed this course, unlike most other textbook, will have had some significant contact with the grandeur of Roman literature.The Reader (the fourth book in the series) is a bit of a stretch for beginning students. There are no long marks (though an argument can be made that this is a good time to dispense with them), and the selection of authors, on whole, is a bit tough (Caesar being by far the easiest). An easier author like Eutropius or Nepos might have been a good addition to this reader (of course, it could be supplemented withWar with Hannibal: Authentic Latin Prose for the Beginning StudentorCornelius Nepos: Three Lives -- Alcibiades, Dion, Atticus, or the like). On the other hand, perhaps the students' exposure to Horace and Vergil in Book III prepares them for the tougher literature.There is also a very good teacher's manual that gives both historical background to each chapter (remember this course is absolutely saturated with Roman history!) as well as a full answer key to the exercises and reading passages. This would make the course very user-friendly for the independent learner."},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Reader","review":"In their preface, the authors say, &quot;The transition from adapted Latin to unadapted Latin texts is always traumatic and many courses fail at this point.&quot; They surely succeed in this difficult task.

It is great for continuous reading in Latin and learning some history, which we never would have learned in any school in the USA. You need continuous reading in Latin to prepare yourself for more real prose and poetry later. I still would use Wheelock's Latin to supplement this course. This course also has audio which is wonderful to listen to.

Brown was the chief test pilot for F.G.Miles - a little-known manufacturer of aircraft in the UK in the 30s and 40s.

The direct ancestor of the popular BAE Skyvan, canard designs, cheap easy-to-build bare-bones fighters for when the UK was in peril of German Invasion, the standard Intermediate and Advanced Fighter trainers for the RAF, there's a long list. Most interesting is the story of the M52 project, that would have had the UK break the Sound Barrier in 1946-47, had it not been cancelled in what's now called &quot;Ben's Blunder&quot;. This is the current definitive work on the subject. It could be better by being longer, and in more detail, hence 4 stars not 5. But it's not short or superficial, it's clearly written, and gives a Test Pilot's clear insight rather than that of a dry aero-historian.

My son asks every time we are on those pages---&quot;where's the train?&quot;. But that small flaw in our eyes is not enough to make him not like this book very much!

I heard about this book on NPR and thought it would be right up my alley. Unfortunately, it turned out to be one of the most frustrating, boring reads of the last several years. The book is well-researched. The author writes well. The subject COULD BE inherently interesting. But jeepers -- I kept wondering whether the author had ever actually been farther than 20 feet from an light bulb. The book goes on an on about walking unpaved paths at night and how rough uneven ground made the going tough except under bright starlight or a full moon. Uh.... OK. This is maybe dramatic to city-folk or those who've never even made it as far as a weekend camping. But to the rest of the world, it's kind of obvious and boring. Similarly, the author talks about loss of inhibition and night-time revelry with the awe of of someone who's never been out for an evening to a bar or party. This book holds no surprises or even very interesting anectdotes for the vast majority of us who don't go to bed at 6PM or live in Manhattan."},{"Title":"At Day's Close: Night in Times Past","review":"I first heard about this book from Fritz Lanham's marvelous review of it in the Houston Chronicle some weeks back. As usual, Lanham makes you curious and excited about the books he likes and, though he had some reservations about Ekirch's prose style and sometimes cumbrous way of writing, he still made the book sound great. I have to agree, AT DAY'S CLOSE is one of those books which, once finished, you can't stop thinking about and which you want to tell all your friends about. For anyone who has thought much about the world before the modern era, it has a particularly magical touch, for it asks us to re-imagine what life was like before the electric and gas light came to be, when once the sun fell people were plunged into mostly inpenetrable darkness. No wonder they made such a cult of the moon! It must have been a blessing to them. \\"Ill met by moonlight\\" indeed.Ekirch reports that the ordinary householder spent more on his bed than on anything else in the house. People must have been confined pretty much to bed. It made me think of the way Shakespeare's will leaves his \\"second best bed\\" to his wife, a bequest biographers sometimes take to mean that they didn't have a very good marriage, but now that Ekirch's reportage is in, I think of it in a different way. In A MIDSUMMER'S NIGHT DREAM, which takes place almost entirely during the night, the audience is allowed to \\"see\\" things it could never have seen even in moonlight and thus this must have contributed to the \\"magical\\" factor of the play for contemporary audience, a feeling we have long lost.For us moderns, day and night are pretty much the same. Perhaps that's why our belief in elves, fairies, trolls, etc., has diminished. Thanks to Freud even our dreams have become more understandable. Imagine living back then and feeling that the dreams were part of a larger, evil force that took control once the sun was down and that dreams were forced on you!The book has something startling on every page. How many other books can make that claim? Besides that, it brings the past to us in a nearly visceral way. I found myself looking at the sun, a-feared as I watched it near the earth."},{"Title":"At Day's Close: Night in Times Past","review":"What a great book, absorbing, thought-provoking and totally unputdownable. I have been waiting for so long to read this book and when I finally picked it up I just couldn't put it down. It is amazing. Culturally, we still have a fear of night, of the dark, and of what might happen. It is what makes horror movies so successful. Yet previous centuries, without the benefit of electric lighting, had a far deeper cultural attitude to day and night, and this is ably explained by Ekirch.He explains just how pervasive night and dark was. Of people lost off dangerous roads, of streets hidden from daylight and moon light at night - and of falling into ditches, (or the kennels as they were then called) and having to chose the risk of falling into coal cellars on one side, or slipping into the kennels on the other. Of footpaths so ill formed that they were dangers in themselves. Of the distrust of anyone abroad at night, women not carrying candles were thought to be prostitutes and generally treated as thus. thefts at night were deemed burglaries and therefore viewed much more seriously than daylight thefts - indeed they were punishable by death.The cultural icons of night were the devil, witches, werewolves and other nasty images, and in Italy they had a saying that dusk was when you couldn't tell a hound from a wolf. Interesting imagery.The book suffers in some ways from not following a time line, or indeed a country, so quotes from the 14th century might easilyl follow a roman anecdote or something from 18th century England.thematically it works though. It follows the general concepts of how night affected human psyche, of fires that were lit, and how they threw light. Of the types of lighting available, of curfews to prevent people being abroad. Of gradual municipal responsibility.I found this book so good I read it through again to pick up what I missed the first time through. Truly extraodinary work and very enjoyable. My highest recommendation."},{"Title":"At Day's Close: Night in Times Past","review":"This book has done more to improve my understanding of pre-Enlightenment Western civilization, than, quite possibly, any one other work I can think of. The influence of the church on daily life, giving both fears (demons, Satan) and saviors - both of which were imminently more pressing when the only remedy for darkness was a candle whose poor light you could ill afford. (By the way, \\"burning the midnight oil\\" doesn't quite mean what you think it does.) The spread of disease, which was thought to be a result of the \\"bad night air\\", yet fear of it caused people to sleep, often all in one room, with the windows closed - thus practically ensuring that infection would spread to the whole family. One of the most surprising facts in the book is divided sleep, a phenomenon that the author maintains occurs in all primitive societies without electricity. People apparently become so well-rested that, going to bed near the fall of night, they have their \\"first sleep\\", awaken about midnight, lie awake (or find something to do) for 2-3 hours, then sleep some more. Ekrich points out that the body's hormones had completely adapted to this pattern. Thus, the aberration is our modern 6-8 hours at a stretch, something humans have not been doing that long really. This book is full of ideas like that. They are the kind of every day things that people think every one knows, so they are not written down, and, therefore, a bit of a challenge for the historian to unearth. (We all have these sort of \\"everybody knows that!\\" assumptions; just try coordinating a wedding. You'll soon find out both families have certain, largely unspoken, ideas of what a wedding should be.) Ekrich has written an enlightening book about a topic that has, amazingly, escaped scholarly light until now. A wonderful study of the dark half of our past."},{"Title":"At Day's Close: Night in Times Past","review":"At Day's Close is a wonder of a book. Every page is full of dozens of interesting facts covering every aspect of the night. From fear of monsters to fear of fire to the actions of the night watch, the author leaves no aspect of the night, ahem, in the dark. His methodology is unique in that this book is really a mosaic of sources. Ekirch isn't so much an author as a compiler as every paragraph is full of quotes or paraphrases of some historic source speaking on a particular topic. While this makes him unimpeachable, its also lacks authoritative cohesion. Its as if thousands of snap shots have been taken of the topic and organized and categorized to tell the history of people dealing with night. This makes for entertaining reading yet I'm left with a slightly vacant feeling: there should have been something more, something to tie everything together. The book still deserves 5 stars. Its highly readable and packed with information. I've never read anything like it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"At Day's Close: Night in Times Past","review":"Most creation myths open with light dispelling the dark. Night and day are the most fundamental divisions of time in human experience, and so reflected in many myths. The lack of light brings thoughts on the unknown, usually fearful ones. We don't understand what we can't see and impart threatening purposes to shadowy shapes and subtle sounds. Ekirch, in an outstanding compendium of the history of night in Western Europe, describes the feelings about after-sunset hours and how people reacted to night.Night-time, Ekirch says, wasn't simply a reduction or hiatus in the sequence of daily activities. Night bred a distinct cultural milieu of its own. Many operated well in the dark hours, but not always for productive or socially acceptable purpose. Those who coped well with darkness, he suggests, did so because they needed to shun the light. As Europe emerged from the Middle Ages, a new social structure classified society in new ways. Attempting to cope with the changes, some found the night the best time for acitivities legal and otherwise. For the rising middle class, the onset of night was a threat and an opportunity. From their poverty-stricken ancestry, the new rich often turned to \\"bedfellows\\" to quell fears of burglars or arsonists. The poor still crowded beds for warmth, but the newer wealthy also turned to friends for common protection, conversation and security. When alone and not terrified, these new, educated aristocrats might use the night for thought, reflection and writing.The threats, however, were real. The new commercial and pre-industrial society fostered a new class of displaced or disadvantaged humanity. Women were particularly imposed upon as the need for income in poor households led them to assume extra tasks. Spinning and weaving, clothing manufacture, husking corn or boiling syrup, took place in countless households in the dark hours. The women competed in a highly variable market and the income was minimal. In frustration, many men took out their resentments in burning houses and barns of the landlords and entrepreneurs. Some burnings were simple animosity, while others used the distraction of fire to rob houses or wharves. The \\"highwayman\\" rose supreme in this age in men who knew intimately the patches of country to strike at the right time and place, then escaping easily.An interesting division in Ekirch's narrative is the distinction between religion and commerce in this period. The Roman Catholic church saw advantages in the night as the time for prayer and meditation in cloisters. Commerce, however, needed daylight for the proper transmission of goods and maintaining inventory security. In the early period of this era [17th and 18th Centuries], shops were usually banned from maintaining operations past \\"curfew\\". The shutting of city gates reduced trade opportunities. Threats to homes and shops after curfew led to the beginnings of city police forces. Ekirch's denies prostitution the primacy of longevity as \\"the world's oldest profession\\" to grant that status to the nightwatch [Pratchett fans take note!]. Although hardly effective, the nightwatch laid the foundation for today's constables. While some nations like France and Spain attempted to impart status to the nightwatch, the British resisted them as a \\"junior\\" form of autocracy. The rising middle class, especially, objected to the watchmen's mandate to sequester anyone on the streets considered \\"suspicious\\".Graced with numerous excellent renditions of paintings and drawings of the night's environment and activities, Ekirch lifts this book above a purely academic study. His \\"Notes\\" concluding the book are a research jaunt for the reader. Thinking of what the author endured to bring this mass of material together and present it in a coherent volume is almost staggering. He manages the task skillfully, imparting a wealth of records, diaries, poetry and letters in an easily readable, if not light-hearted style. His theme is the change of views of the night at the beginning of the pre-industrial era. He concludes by stating that the rise of artificial lighting revised again our view of the night. Sleep patterns, often broken among all classes in that era, have now, at least in the West, settled into a new form of long hours of continuous sleep. Does that mean our view of the night has truly changed? [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]"},{"Title":"At Day's Close: Night in Times Past","review":"This is a good book for someone without a lot of background in pre-modern history, who may be completely unfamiliar with much of the material. The author is clearly trying hard (with mixed success, as other reviewers note) to write something that is both solidly based and yet readable and enjoyable. He makes heavy use of anecdotes and statistics from clearly marked sources, which I think is a Good Thing from a historian's point of view.He also gives a good many of his own opinions and generalizations, sometimes footnoted, sometimes not. Some I would question, such as (to take a random example) \\"Pre-industrial folk, in facing the natural world, drew on a deep reservoir of rural culture, one fed by many wellsprings, including both pagan and Christian traditions.\\" I wish he had given some examples of pagan and Christian practices used to navigate the nightscape (the subject of the chapter), but he doesn't. Many sections are loosely written like this, throwing out a lot of ideas without really following any of them up. (My question in this case is whether anything truly pagan, as opposed to merely traditional practices for \\"luck,\\" existed this late in Western European history.)Since I do have a background in history, I was actually disappointed in this book. Here's why: because it told me a good many things I already knew, but the one idea that was really news to me wasn't expanded on as much as I'd like: the idea that pre-industrial Europeans regarded sleeping in two sessions per night (routinely waking for awhile around midnight) as the norm. This insight was promoted as something new and different about this book (which it is) but in fact it gets less than ten pages in a 340-page text before veering off into a discussion of dreams. I would have liked to hear much more.All in all, this looks to me like an author trying to cram too much material into one book. A lot of what's in there is interesting, but the material could have been pared down, tightened up, and then expanded in selected spots, to make a much better book that discussed fewer topics in more depth. There's enough in here that is NOT generally known to most people that a fascinating book could have been constructed."},{"Title":"At Day's Close: Night in Times Past","review":"This is a truly wonderful book.

At last, it's here."},{"Title":"At Day's Close: Night in Times Past","review":"A. Roger Ekirch's book is a well-written, rich exploration of the experience of night through the ages. It's remarkable that not more has been done in this area, so it's to Mr. Ekirch's credit that he has created the \\"after hours\\" niche market. Unfortunately his exploration does not include much on the 20th century. True, he recognizes that we're in the 24/7 century, but the nightlife of that century has changed over-time, as illustrated in books like, \\"Steppin' Out,\\" which surveys the evolution of night clubs and the like in early, 20th century urban America. Readers will have anticipated much of what Ekirch documents (which is not to diminish the significance of the documentation). Thus, we find that \\"night\\" was a time of increased opportunity for criminal activity and violence. The typical thieve in the night hated a the \\"full moon,\\" known as \\"the tattler.\\" But there are some real surprises. At least this I learned for the first time that: bedroom furniture was for a long time the single-most expensive asset in the home (it could be 1/3 of the total home's value), not unlike today's automobile in some instances; families, or large segments of them, slept on a single-bed and visitors to the typical home \\"climbed in\\" and shared the arrangement and; although criminal activity was highest during the evening hours, the official police force tended to \\"take the night off,\\" leaving the job of protection to \\"hired hands\\" of varying quality. Finally, Ekirch discovered that a \\"full night's sleep\\" prior to the early part of the 19th century did not entail uninterrupted sleep. Rather, he found that many people experienced segmented sleep; that is, going to bed early and waking up in the early a.m. hours for some period of time (perhaps multiple hours) and then resume sleep. That interlude of awakeness is, regretably to Ekirch, a phenemona lost to the modern sleeper -- although alcohol prior to bed is a good way to re-experience our ancestor's segmented momentes."},{"Title":"At Day's Close: Night in Times Past","review":"Ekirch has produced a unique piece of scholarship.

This is a serious-minded, scholarly work that lay-readers might see as hopelessly encumbered with statistics and repetitive exhibitions of factual evidence. There are overarching concepts, but there's no spellbinding narrative--this is not a story, it's a study. A such, it reads, at times, like an encyclopedia.I'm a professor and scholar myself (author of a few equally tedious tomes), so this shouldn't be taken as a criticism of Ekirch's book per se. If I were on a tenure board reviewing this work, I'd say it's an extremely cogent, well-researched book that does exactly what it should do. But if I take off my prof hat and play the part of the bookstore browser, looking for a titillating read, I'd say find something else.

I've been a student of history for many years, and never really gave a thought to the social, safety and cultural impact of nighttime.I watched a documentary about this subject--how people dealt with nighttime before the advent of electric lights. The author appeared and I found his subject matter so intriguing that I rushed to purchase the book! While the content matter was interesting, the author presents it in such a way that it takes you from one century to the next in a flash, (rapid time travel), and from country to country in no cohesive manner. It feels like a trivia book with an interesting point here and there, but the confusion of trying to determine what century and country you are in spoils the content. I couldn't \\"get my teeth into it\\". At times there was commentary about a certain city, without any reference to what country it was in. I was stationed in Europe, and did a lot of travel in my time there, but some of the references were to places that the author doesn't ground in geography. I was very disappointed, and disoriented. The subject matter is interesting, but the tangentiality strips the book of the ability to carry it's reader into the past. I was expecting to be able to feel what it was like to fear the night.

It is so well researched that the last 70 pages of the book comprise a bibliography of the sources Ekirch quotes throughout the book. Herein lies my problem with this work. Its principal matter lies in quotation followed by cumbrously segued quotation. In other words, until the last few pages, there's no authorial voice to speak of, and it makes for disparate, humdrum reading. The best thing about it, by far, is the wealth of illustrations, mostly by Flemish artists, which shed more light, if you'll excuse the expression, on things than do a hundred quotations.Summing up: A carefully researched, scholarly work that takes no risks.If the reader is truly interested in this sort of thing, Robert Burton's age-old The Anatomy of Melancholy (1621), a study of such things as went on in the night and other matters pertaining thereto, is the far more engrossing and erudite read."},{"Title":"At Day's Close: Night in Times Past","review":"I finished reading \\"At Day's Close\\" this evening, and want to share with everyone how much I enjoyed this extraordinary, well-written book.I can't even imagine how long it took Mr. Ekirch to research and write it. The number of sources cited gave me the impression that he read everything published prior to 1900 before writing the first word. That he managed to make a nonfiction book (about darkness and nighttime, no less!) so visual, so vivid, and so alive is a testament to how gifted he is.It's a book that will stay with me forever. I can easily imagine reading it again. Also, I just ordered three more copies to give to friends who I feel confident will also enjoy it.Thank you, Mr. Ekirch, for writing such an amazing, informative, and fascinating book."},{"Title":"At Day's Close: Night in Times Past","review":"Without electricity illuminating darkness how did our ancestors manage?

I thought Kurlansky did better along those lines with \\"Cod\\" and \\"Salt\\". Another thing that bothered me about \\"At Day's Close\\" was his focus on Europe and North America.

I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The encyclopedia of witchcraft and demonology","review":"Rossell Hope Robbins massive 1959 work \\"Encyclopedia of Witchcraft and Demonology\\" has been reprinted many times but is currently out-of-print. It is indeed a fascinatingly horrible compenidum of information regarding witches, demons, devils, demonologists, inquisitors, judges, hysterias, torture, and murder. It has served for the past 40 odd years as one of the most read and referenced work on the history of witchcraft and demonology, especially by many popular witchcraft authors and historians who continue to use and cite the work today.The trouble is that much of the scholarship contatined in this work is sadly outdated and lacks information on much of the recent work done in the field of witchcraft studies in the past 20 years. Also, Robbins' work suffers from the same problem that afflicted many other similar early witchcraft histories: bad translations and historical forgeries. It has been shown that many of the early translations of a number of Latin works on witchcraft (particularly those translated by the Rev. Montague Summers) are suspect. Also, several 19th century histories of the witchcraze and the Inquisition that have been used as source material by countless authors, including Robbins, have been proven to be forgeries, particularly the works relating the early 14th century Inquisitorial witch executions in France. Robbins' work has also been criticized by scholars for its lack of objectivity in its history. But this work still remains popular today and understandably so, as it contains many lurid and engaging articles on just about every aspect of the witch hunts from the 15th to the 18th century in Europe and North America. Despite many of its flaws, it is still a useful reference and for that reason it still gets 3 stars, plus I must admit, it maintains some of the mysterious aura surrounding the history of witches and demons that much recent scholarship has tried to dispel, and that makes it fascinating reading, if for the wrong reasons."},{"Title":"The encyclopedia of witchcraft and demonology","review":"This book is perhaps the most important reference work in its field. If you have interest in the occult, witchcraft or details not much mentioned in standard history books, I urge you to buy this one. Although its author relies a bit too heavily on documents of the time, the information given in this book is valuable. Also, there is a passage about witchcraft in specific countries, so you might also find out something about your home country that no one bothered to tell you. Read this book, and I can almost guarantee that you'll see the last four centuries in quite a new light."},{"Title":"The encyclopedia of witchcraft and demonology","review":"A long time ago I (by accident) saw this book carried by Terry Gilliam in the 'Spanish Inquisition' sketch by Monty Python. You can spot it under his arm as he gets up from his seat in the bus at the end. Realizing that this has very little do to with the actual review of this book, it nonetheless will tell you that I recognized the cover of the book when walking around in an old bookstore in Boston, grabbed it, and within 2 minutes of reading and skimming I decided that it was worth the $18.00 it cost. It was probably one of the best bargains I ever found, and opened my eyes tremendously.As the title implies we're talking about an encyclopedia, not a detailed and chronological book, but this did not hamper the book's ability to get inside my head, and touch it in a way that redefined the medieval picture I carried around with me. After spending a few hours going through the book, and picking out specific passages, I realized that I knew nothing about how people were treated not THAT long ago, when someone else accused them of witchcraft, and how hard (impossible) it was to prove ones innocence. A story in the encyclopedia tells of how a woman, owning a black cat was hanged, accused of witchcraft, for 'making' her neighbour's tea taste bad.If you wish to have just some idea of how impossible it was to prove your innocence, once you were thought a witch, Luc Besson's 'Messenger: Joan of Arc', and the Blackadder episode 'Witchsmeller Pursouivant' will give you an idea of the hopelessness some of the accused must've felt.The most horrible aspect of the book is the descriptions of how people were tortured back in those days. The only thing we can do is learn from books such as these to insure that such stupidity and ignorance won't be allowed to occur again. The book also has information on specific European and other countries, so you can locate your own country to see just how bad things were in Europe several hundred years ago. That these things are still happening in many other parts of the world, is something we should do something more about, since many of the uneducated countries still practice torture and inhuman deaths. Not that any death, ordered by other sentient beings, is human, in my opinion.The people who refuse to open books such as these, because they, among many other things, tell of the instruction manuals inquisitors could consult when dealing with witches (the Malleus Maleficarum is one), must ask themselves if they are doing so, because they find such information irrelevant and frightening. Of course it's frightening, but hardly irrelevant. It's when you turn your back on these things, that they have a chance of happening. So educate yourself about how not to behave, when someone sitting close to you is stroking a bad cat and your tea suddenly tastes bad.I'm not saying that we have to be paranoid at all, but a good portion of common sense, spiced with decency and awareness, will no doubt yield a mix that will prevent such terrible events from happening again.And if you can't find this book at amazon.com, try older bookstores. Where I found mine in Boston, another copy was also present!"},{"Title":"The encyclopedia of witchcraft and demonology","review":"I first stumbled onto this book when I needed reference material for a paper on witchcraft. I've gone back to re-reference this book too many times to count! It has information on almost every aspect of witchcraft and demonology; terrific for the beginner interested in this subject. You can feel the hopelessness of the accused; I felt very thankful to be living in this day and age. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The encyclopedia of witchcraft and demonology","review":"I actually found this book at a garage sale when I was in high school in the early 80's.

It offers a brief history of bamboo rod and somewhat less than comprensive list of current makers of them. (But geez.. try and find the magazine he mentions on your local newstand though! ) No it is not a large detailed book nor will it allow the rank beginner to go out and build himself (or herself) a bamboo rod. (At least I would not want to try it on Gierach's book alone). But what it is is a wonderful, very readable book on a often forgotten piece of fishing equipment that every angler should try once. Like upland hunting with a fine double, fly fishing with a bamboo rod just &quot;feels right&quot;. Its an &quot;unexplainable&quot; and no one comes closer to explaining it that John Gierach...."},{"Title":"FISHING BAMBOO: One Man's Love Affair with Bamboo Fly Rods","review":"Well, i\`m a bamboo rodbuilder and also a bookseller. I think Gierach wrote a very good book, for rodbuilders ( also not profs) and for all who like to flyfishing. He tells in short words the history of &quot;bamboo rods&quot; and workmanship. Gierach tells the difference betwen bamboo and &quot;plastic&quot; ( he means graphite rods). Shure, this book has mabye a touch of &quot;golden age&quot;, but don\`t we all need and live with dreams? Look at the funny,new catalogs of the modern angling industrie - every page a &quot;dream&quot; - and most time not reality! Bamboo rod makers don\`t produce for a &quot;mass market&quot;, and often work in small places like garages behind her house, an this over decades. And some &quot;big names&quot; are still alive, like the growing numbers of her customers. Yes, this book is sometimes poetic and has no glossy images, but some fine etchings - think thats we call &quot;feeling&quot; - and flyfishing with bamboo is just feeling! Second - books about bamboo rodbuilders are seldom and quick out of stock, this past and present. I think this book will be soon a &quot;Classic&quot;."},{"Title":"FISHING BAMBOO: One Man's Love Affair with Bamboo Fly Rods","review":"John Gierach writes what I like to read, quick and clever(not cute). There is a lot of good stuff in this book, but I would have liked to see real pictures of the old rods and a description of the building process. I'm thinking that what this book really is is a public explanation of a passion that really needs no justification. Either that or the rent is due. For some guys it's motorcycles or guitars or cars.

Thanks John."},{"Title":"FISHING BAMBOO: One Man's Love Affair with Bamboo Fly Rods","review":"I must say that I was not looking forward to reading this book as I had heard it was dry and lifeless.Well, true enough. It is really not a typical \\"Gierach\\" book full of interesting stories and insight about the fly fishing life.However, it is a very readable book about the story of the bamboo fly rod and I must say, it is full of interesting history and personal insight. For example, Gierach points out that you can feel a bamboo rod load on the back cast which is something that is difficult to feel with graphite. He is right and I had never noticed that before. His gift is to be able to identify those subtle points in life that we don't normally notice easily. Now I let my bamboo load up before the cast.I may be biased though, with this whole bamboo stuff because I just won't buy anything else now. Graphite is great and it gets the job done but it is like comparing finger painting to a monet hanging on the wall.-John"},{"Title":"FISHING BAMBOO: One Man's Love Affair with Bamboo Fly Rods","review":"Very readable, as you would expect from gierech.... but also very short.

Also check out, by these same authors, &quot;Life in a Medieval Village&quot; and &quot;Cathedral, Forge, and Waterwheel.&quot;"},{"Title":"Women in the Middle Ages","review":"Frances and Joseph Gies, singly or as a pair, have cranked out one or two dozen short primers on topics in medieval European history over the last four decades, and they are used, I suppose, primarily for the classroom. This one, summarizing nearly a millennium of \\"women,\\" is a mixed bag.The first part of the book covers the period to the year 1100 and \\"summarizes what is known about woman's situation in that fascinating and, to the historian, frustrating era\\" and describe \\"the principal attitudes toward women that prevailed.\\" It's an impossible task for fifty pages: much of this section is filled with a string of unavoidably vapid generalizations (\\"medieval marriages often developed into closed and loving relationships\\") and context-free anecdotes, spiced with the occasional factoid or randomly selected quote from medieval sources. The lack of focus makes for incredibly boring reading--akin to making sense of a professor's lecture notes. Fortunately, this section has been superseded by Lisa Bitel's recent \\"Women in Early Medieval Europe,\\" which covers the same period in much greater detail.The meat of Gieses' book can be found in the seven chapters on individual women who lived during the High Middle Ages (1100 to 1500). A trio of chapters spotlights the aristocracy: Hildegarde of Bingen serves as the example for female monasticism; Blanche of Castile and her daughter-in-law Marguerite of Provence for queenship; Eleanor de Montfort for noblewomen, with an excellent synopsis of the siege of Kenilworth Castle. The best of these is the last: the authors recast the familiar story of Simon de Montfort (Eleanor's husband) and King Henry III (her brother) from the equally pivotal perspective of the powerful woman in the middle of their egos.A chapter on the peasantry uses the fictional wife of Piers Plowman as a metaphorical stand-in and examines scattered evidence from local court and tax records. The final three chapters survey what might be termed the rising middle class: the fascinating Agnes li Patiniere and her mother, cloth dyers in Flanders who (fortunately for historians) sued their employer--and won; Margherita Datini, a merchant's wife in the late 1300s outside of Florence, whose story we know from a cache of business papers discovered in a stairwell in 1870; and Margaret Paston, the matron of a nouveau riche family whose surviving letters have served in recent years as the basis for a BBC dramatization and a number of books--including one published a decade ago by the Gieses.These seven quasi-biographical chapters give a far better sense of what life in the medieval period may have been like than do the random simplifications offered by the earlier portion of the book. Still, readers would probably be well served avoiding the scattershot approach offered by this book and instead choosing among the abundance of more recent titles that concentrate on specific lives, topics, regions, and periods."},{"Title":"Women in the Middle Ages","review":"This history book is very readable and opens the door to contemporary readers on a world that is quite different from ours, yet remarkably similar in some ways. The discussion of a student protest in Paris in 1229, which was brutally crushed by the police under orders of Queen Blanche of Castile, was particularly memorable.The seven chapters that deal with individual women -- a merchant's wife, a commoner, a queen, and so on -- are mistitled a bit, because they deal just as much with broad issues such as the legal disabilities of women in the Middle Ages, their occupations, family life, and land holding."},{"Title":"Women in the Middle Ages","review":"I love anything written by this couple; always entertaining, always educational, they do their research, combine it with their sound knowledge of the era or people they are writing about and produce something that history buffs, writers, or just those with a healthy curiousity about the past will thoroughly enjoy.Women in the Middle Ages is no exception. A concise book it starts with a working definition of the Middle Ages (around 600AD to the end of the Fourteenth Century) before explaining popular misconceptions and some facts about the role women played in these fraught and fascinating times. They then explain the primary models against which women were measured &#8211; Eve and Mary &#8211; sinner and saint, mother and whore, basically. Reductive they might be and yet they set the framework against which women lived, worked, loved, worshipped, ruled, and died.The second part explores specific women, using contemporary sources, in more detail. We are introduced to (or reacquainted with) Hildegarde of Bingen, one of the most highly educated and clever women of the Middle Ages, an Abbess; the magnificent Queen Blanche of Castille a canny ruler who, despite enemies seeking to capture her throne managed to rule beside her husband and later, as a regent, handling the power thrust upon her with courage and intelligence; Eleanor of Montefort, sister to Henry III, devoted mother, wife to the courtier and warrior Simon de Montefort (their relationship is beautifully and sympathetically explored by Sharon Kay Penman who, though working in fiction does extensive research and she paints a softer portrait of Eleanor), and someone very aware of and prepared to fight for her rights. We also meet Agnes Patiniere of Douai, a woman who lived in a city and who had a successful trade, negotiating the politics of the guilds. Then there&#8217;s Margherita Datini, an Italian woman who became literate later in life, helped run her husband&#8217;s business and avoided succumbing to the plague. Finally, there&#8217;s Margaret Paston, member of one of the most successful families of the Middle Ages who rose from crofters to wealthy landowners (and later, Earls) and who are survived by abundant correspondence (the book of their letters, The Pastons, is enthralling) that reveals their daily lives, enmities, private and more public relationships and even their ambitions for themselves and each other.While it seems sad that there are so few women to draw on in order to explore their diverse roles over such a long stretch of time, when considering the division that occurred in medieval lives &#8211; men = public, women= private, and the fact most females were confined to domestic space, it&#8217;s fortunate we have anything. The Gies&#8217; also ensure they compare and contrast the women they discuss in relation to place and class and draw analogies with literature (eg. Chaucer&#8217;s Canterbury Tales) as well demonstrating how women&#8217;s role altered (for better and worse) over time.The contradictions in women&#8217;s roles are evident in this book, as is how women worked within and against popular and religious expectations, how they managed, sometimes against impossible odds, to find and create their own spaces and lives &#8211; some more successful than others.Overall, this was an interesting and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Women in the Middle Ages","review":"Clustered around each woman's biography are descriptions and facts about the time.

I was hoping to find information specific to the African Grey, but instead found a very simple book that was a guide to basic parrot care. Most information in this book applies to any parrot species. I did not find any useful information unique to African Greys beyond the description of the species and the Eurocentric history of parrot keeping.This is not a helpful book. Try the Guide to a Well Behaved Parrot for general information, and African Grey Parrots, by the same author.This book was an utter waste of time and money. I feel the title is misleading.It was also upsetting that the author outright discouraged adopting preowned parrots, and encouraged play with dangerous toys - nuts and bolts and rope. If you get nuts and bolts or rope toys for your parrot please make sure they are made from bird safe material so your lovely parrot companion doesn't die from metal poisoning or strangulation."},{"Title":"Muscles: Testing and function","review":"I only received on respone stating he didn't have the item I purchased but he could still get it. 1 month later I still haven't received the item purchased and requested my money back.

This book is written by Brendan Fraser's (The Mummy) wife. This book has 15 chapters. Some of the chapters are Must See, Drama, Suspense, Comedy, Romance, Tearjerkers, One of a Kind, Musicals, Westerns, and Screenteams. Also on each new chapter she has on the side of the page a list of movie stars' picks of classics. It's their must-see list! This book even has a preface by the \\"Million Dollar Mermaid\\" herself, Esther Williams. The book includes a lot of never before seen photos. Another great thing about this book is on each movie, Mrs. Fraser includes info on Oscar awards, gossip, info on the leading stars, quotes, and info on screen teams (it shows info on what other movies the stars did together). This book is great for beginners who want to see old movies or just great as a gift for that special movie lover. Afton Fraser did a great job on this book and I hope she does another one!

In terms of coverage, there aren't many surprises; all the \\"usual suspects\\" are here but as an introduction to some ageless films, it's a nice piece of work.Author Afton Fraser divides the films into various chapters: Must See, Drama, Suspense, Film Noir, Good Guys & Bad Guys, Comedy, Screen Teams and so on. Each film typically gets two pages of coverage, a mixture of text and four-six photos. Aside from a short plot summary, brief production notes, information on the stars and tidbits on the movie are given. Each section is preceded by a one-two page summary on why Fraser picked the films found in that section.The book is sub-titled 'A Guide for the Beginner and the Afficionado.'

While it should be very good for students who feel the need to consolidate the material studied during the previous year, my own children felt that there was little new here and they asked me to skip the Algebra Half and go to the full Algebra One, which is what we are about to do.We had a very good experience with this set but, thanks to my kids being such godd students, we've decided to skip it.Even though we had to abandon this course after the first half-dozen lessons convinced us that we didn't need it, I will grant the package 5 stars for Saxon's proven effectiveness but be aware that this should be skipped by the more advanced students.THE SAXON METHODWe've been using Saxon's books to teach our kids math starting with Math 3/2 and we've been very happy.Algebra 1/2 (it means ALGEBRA HALF not \\"Algebra One and Two\\" is comprised of 123 lessons, 31 tests and a number of Topics labeled from A to J. Unlike the previous Math courses, there are no 'Investigations' and the lessons no longer begin with drills and warmup activities. Also, unlike prior math cycles up to Math 8/7, tests are administered after every four lesson rather than after every five.Each lesson begins by explaining and illustrating a number of new topics - one, two or sometimes three. That is followed by a small number of practice exercises that are related to the new topics. Finally, there is a 30-item problem set (what the prior volumes were calling 'mixed practice') that asks students to answer/solve 30 questions that could be on EVERYTHING covered by Saxon up to that point. Each individual question has references to the lesson(s) which the students may want to review if they are having trouble with the answer/solution.After every 4 lessons there is a 20-question test.The problem set and the multi-topic lessons are what makes the Saxon method so effective as new concepts are introduced incrementally and each problem set keeps revisiting prior topics and many of the problems require the student to combine skills and knowledge aquired in more than one lesson.THE KIT's CONTENTSA complete kit should include the following:- The Algebra 1/2 textbook that includes the 123 lessons, the extra topics, index, glossary and an answer key to the odd-numbered problems.- Test forms that include the 31 tests plus reproducible test answer sheets.- Answers and tests solutions booklet that is just that. It only includes the answers not the ways to get there - for that an optional 'Solutions manual' can be obtained separately."},{"Title":"Algebra 1/2: An Incremental Development Homeschool Kit(Homeschool Algebra)","review":"We homeschooled our kids over a period of years, and Saxon Math, including Algebra 1/2, was always our choice for math texts. I also teach in a classical Christian school where we use Saxon Math as well. I find that for most students, if they will take the time to read the lesson well, do all of the problems, and then rework any problems they miss then they will achieve a high degree of mastery of the material at hand.This book will adequately prepare math students for Algebra 1, which has proven to be the mathematical Waterloo of many a student. With adequate preparation, it doesn't have to be. Advanced students may be able to move from Math 76 directly to Algebra 1, especially if it seems (as it has to some) that this book moves to slowly or contains too much review.The greatest advantage of Saxon Math is that each lesson provides practice not only for the new problems but also built-in review for every kind of problem the student has previously encountered. Algebra 1/2 is no exception to the rule that Saxon Math texts help students learn math well. After Algebra 1/2, all of my kids who have taken it were definitely ready to move on to the next level.In general, Saxon Math, including Algebra 1/2, is highly recommended. It is especially ideal for homeschooling families."},{"Title":"Edmund Dulac's Fairy Book: Fairy Tales of the Allied Nations.","review":"I have the original published in 1914.

The book provides a crisp and very informative view on the problems and steps related to analysis and design of interactive systems. It covers most of the core topics relevant to the analysis of interactive systems (problem definition, task analysis, models, system analysis, system evaluation) and those related with user interface design (interaction styles, mental models, conceptual design). These topics are dealt with sufficient detail to get a reasonable understanding both of abstract and concrete aspects. The few complete examples guide the reader through most of the issues. Some topic (like experimental evaluation) is very detailed. Treatment is extremely clear and vivid. I definitely recommend this book to anybody interested in design of interactive systems."},{"Title":"Devotions upon emergent occasions;: Together with Death's duel (Ann Arbor paperbacks)","review":"First published in 1624, this series of meditations on illness were published following John Donne's sickness during late November and early December of 1623 (when he either had typhus or relapsing fever). Each of his ruminations are recorded in groups of three: meditation, expostulation, and prayer. Donne's insights about the &quot;variable, therefore miserable condition of man&quot; will always be pertinent as long as humans continue to fall prey to disease. The reading is a little slow at times, but there are some fine pieces in this book, including his famous meditation XVII, &quot;No man is an island&quot;, that Hemingway quoted when he wrote FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS. Even if you don't read all of the essays, this book is worth obtaining just to pore over meditation XVII."},{"Title":"Devotions upon emergent occasions;: Together with Death's duel (Ann Arbor paperbacks)","review":"John Donne, Anne Donne, Un-donne - This is one of the most famous comments on marriage, from the husband of the pair himself. Donne wasn't referring to his wife, but instead, referring to the cost of the marriage, for he and Anne married without permission, resultling in a brief imprisonment and povetry. John Donne's marriage was such a scandel that his first real biographer, Izaak Walton saw it as a huge error and glossed over both it and Donne's love poetry as if in shame. Even today, when Donne's love poetry is more accepted, most people still know Donne for his Holy Sonnets. His love poetry, beautiful and powerful, gets treated totally seperately with the suggestion, unspoken, in some classes that it was written by a different person or, worse, critics try to shoehorn it into devotional poetry. To disregard, downplay, or slight Donne's marriage does a disservice to both the couple and the whole opus of Donne's work. Donne's marriage cost both him and his wife much. Much is made of his frustrated ambitions that occured in the years following his marriage, but she to must have suffered, constantly in childbirth, including one horrific still birth that occured when her husband was a way. Yet Donne wrote love poetry to his wife, including some, like \\"The Cannonization\\" that must have been written after his marriage.It is important to know this about Donne when reading his holy work such as his sonnets or his book. The reason why this holy work stands the test of time, how it has contributed so many quotes to the world is because Donne is the most human of holy writers. One reads Saint Augustine and is seperated but a vast difference in time and culture. One reads Donne and that difference seems so slight for in many ways Donne was ahead of his time. For instance, he says in DevotionsIf man had been left alone in this world at first, shall I think that he would not have fallen? If there had been no woman, would not man have served to have been his own tempter?\\"There is no hubris in Donne, just questing that tells the reader that even holy man suffer the same up and downs, the same feelings and fears as everyone."},{"Title":"Devotions upon emergent occasions;: Together with Death's duel (Ann Arbor paperbacks)","review":"Even though the language is a little laborious to navigate, it was worth it going through the devotions - especially #17."},{"Title":"Devotions upon emergent occasions;: Together with Death's duel (Ann Arbor paperbacks)","review":"These devotions have many quotations of scriptures. The Expostulation numbered 23 is on relapse into spiritual sickness. John Donne compares himself to the \\"glorious nation of Israel; and yet how often, how often did they fall into relapses?\\" Donne mentions \\"embracing the Idolatries of their neighbours.\\" The dynamic started with murmuring:Thy people were fearful examples of that:for, how often did their murmuring against thy Ministers,end in a departing from Thee?when they would have other officers,they would have other gods;and still to daies murmuring,was to morrowes Idolatrie;As their murmuring induced Idolatrie,and they relapsed often into both,I have found in my selfe, O God,(O my God, thou hast found it in me,and thy finding it, hast shewed it to me)such a transmigration of sinne,as makes me afraid of relapsing too. . . .Why, O my God,is a relapse so odious to thee?Not so much their murmuring,and their Idolatry,as their relapsing into those sinnes,seems to affect thee,in thy disobedient people.American society would rather be blind to its past than allow religion publicly to declare:know for a certainty,God will no more drive out any of these Nationsfrom before you;but they shall be snares,and traps unto you,and scourges in your sides,and thornes in your eies,till ye perish.

Talk about a mess. Exley apparently lived most of his adult life in bars, when he wasn't running around trying to borrow money from friends or family members. But despite his difficulties, Exley wrote one terrific novel and the real value of this biography is its numerous discussions of the value of one book writers. Not everyone has a series in them or even several good books, but writers like Exley, who have that one good book in them make a tremendous contribution to our literature. Sure, Exley was self-absorbed and could only write about his own life, but he did that with excellence. Yardley's biography presents a sad story, but nevertheless adds an important chapter to America's literary history."},{"Title":"Misfit:: The Strange Life of Frederick Exley","review":"Most of this book is Yardley's reflections on Exley: his work and what his life meant. It is not much in the way of hard biography. I get the feeling that Yardley, though he admired and was fascinated by Exley, was not up to the task of a serious biography.In the preface Yardley demurs that this is not possible because Exley left so few traces of himself behind.Ha! An unconvincing excuse. There be other authors who have left a lot less, and that didn't stop hordes of biographers.I think Yardley found it easier to surmise than actually do the legwork. However, 5 stars because the book is so exquisitely written.Do yourself a favor and skip p. 29."},{"Title":"Misfit:: The Strange Life of Frederick Exley","review":"I'm divided on &quot;Misfit.&quot; I'm relieved that the book isn't an 800 page hagiography, relentless detailing every awful event in Exley's life. What a candidate he would be for that kind of treatment, apparently! Yet in abandoning traditional biographic approaches like chronicling dates and places and keeping it freeform, Yardley goes up against some awesome competition for chronicling Exley's life: Exley himself, in A Fan's Notes, Pages from a Cold Island, and Last Notes from Home. I enjoyed this book but it seemed a little breezy, an homage to the elusive Exley rather than any definitive tackling of his &quot;strange&quot; life. A Fan's Notes still rules!"},{"Title":"Misfit:: The Strange Life of Frederick Exley","review":"I have not yet read any of Frederick Exley's books, and after reading Jonathan Yardley's Misfit, I have very little understanding ofExley's personality, what apparently made hima fairly charming person (at least to some),andso forth. While I think Yardley set a difficulttask for himself in attempting a biography aboutan alcoholic, mooching, nonconformist, practicallyunemployable (the list could go way longer)personsuch as Exley, it would have been helpful to meto have seen more of Exley's actual writings (andsamples of his famous drink-fueled monologues!)andless of Yardley's theorizing aboutjust what caused him to be such a failure insociety in general. Also, perhaps I have read onetoo many memoirs about or by someone affected byalcoholism (or some other form of self-destructivebehaviour), but I have a hard time feeling sympathy or much of anything else for Exley as aperson, since he never really seemed to care muchfor himself, and seemed not to feel the need tochange. (I also do not understand why I keep reading reviews describing Exley's life as &quot;shortand unhappy&quot;, or words to that effect. He wassixty-three years old at the time of his death!).I will admit that Yardley's biography has stimulated me to seek out A Fan's Notes, in anattempt to better understand Exley's reputedwriting talent."},{"Title":"Misfit:: The Strange Life of Frederick Exley","review":"Frederick Exley was perhaps the quintessential one-book wonder, though he did write a few decent magazine articles along the way. A Fan's Notes is a terrific read and deserves the accolades it has received from Yardley and others. But Yardley is the wrong guy to write a biography of Exley. He is so obtusely literal and middle-brow that he does something I would have thought impossible: make Exley boring. Maybe Nick Tosches should have a crack at this subject. His hallucinatory method would be far more apt than Yardley's plodding fact-after-fact approach."},{"Title":"Misfit:: The Strange Life of Frederick Exley","review":"Jonathan Yardley's book isn't a great one, but having stumbled upon &quot;A Fan's Notes&quot; like a hungry man at a banquet, &quot;Misfit&quot; was that last after-dinner drink I just couldn't refuse. Yardley helps us decifer the hazy border between fact and fiction, and ponders the enigma of how a loser like Exley could write a novel of such penetrating power. For those who finish &quot;A Fan's Notes&quot; wishing for more, this short bio is probably preferable to Exley's unsuccessful later works."},{"Title":"Misfit:: The Strange Life of Frederick Exley","review":"exley managed to write, amidst the tumultuous and chaotic uncertainty of his own life, one legendary and immortal book, which everyone who cares about modern american literature must explore. yardley, here, gives us a portrait of the man, who must have been among the most exasperating creatures ever to walk the earth. yet his goodness and talent shine through, and i can't say that i wouldn't have been one of the willing multitude sucked into his web. if you hold 'a fan's notes' sacred, as i do, this is a necessary bookend."},{"Title":"Misfit:: The Strange Life of Frederick Exley","review":"I find Yardley's -Washington Post- columns and book reviews entertaining, even when I don't agree with them; but -Misfit- suffers from something I don't find in his newspaper work, much less in Exley: numbers. Thus, themes are three-fold, Exley's marriages failed for these two reasons, these two contrasting incidents demonstrate first, this, second, that. This doesn't make Misfit a bad book, just too often a schematic one, unfortunate especially considering the rich, tangential schemelessness that was his subject's wont.Yardley faced what seems a real dilemma for a biographer: how to portray a subject known for autobiographical work? To parallell Ex's real life with his not always corresponding literary life, and to fill the numerous gaps, is how. But I'm not sure how someone unfamiliar with Exley would find it; excerpts from the oeuvre are revealing enough, but by my fan's assessment one needs to be immersed in Exley's voice for some time before his magic begins to rub off. I'm not sure Misfit accomplishes this, though as a fan I was more than happy to learn what was behind the literary mask."},{"Title":"Misfit:: The Strange Life of Frederick Exley","review":"Any fan of Exley's A Fan's Notes will be disappointed in this book. Exley spoke informally to so many people for so many years, but few of those words seem to remembered by anyone. There is too much speculation as to Exley's sex life that adds nothing to our understanding of this marvelous writer. Instead we get the standard biographer's suppositions that just hang there without justification. That people loved Exley is obvious. That he was self-destructive has been documented by his writing. Yardley apparently had a good idea to write about Exley, but a good idea and a publisher's contract is a flimsy excuse for the appearance of this book"},{"Title":"Misfit:: The Strange Life of Frederick Exley","review":"Yardley does some wonderful spelunking here, using the standard tools of the biographer--along with some truly skillful analysis of Exley's own writing--to plumb the depths of this interesting, tragicomic, and quintessentially American personality. Readers smitten by Exley's prose in *A Fan's Notes* (and his other two books and sporadic journalism) will find much of interest in Yardley's readable account of this writer's strange life and times."},{"Title":"Misfit:: The Strange Life of Frederick Exley","review":"Yardley has done the impossible - his vivid account of the forces that shaped Exley's sad life are fascinating. Yardley has captured the very essence of Watertown, New York - a town 350 miles north of New York City where the winters are long and cold, employment opportunities are limited, and geographic isolation encourages the cult status of small town high school heroes. As a native of Watertown, Exley's writing always struck a very personal note with me - But Yardley succeeds in translating the many sad themes of the North Country into a very readable thesis."},{"Title":"Misfit:: The Strange Life of Frederick Exley","review":"Mr. Yardley admits at the outset that he was, in a telephonic way, a friend of Exley's. This gives you the immediate expectation that you are going to get a kid-gloves treatment of the late author. That expectation is borne out completely by this brief book.In _The Culture of Narcissism_ Christopher Lasch used _A Fan's Notes_ as Exhibit A in the development of a narcissistic culture in late 20th century America. Lasch defined a narcissist as someone who has no real self, but instead cobbles one together based on the continually and desperately solicited approval of others. This project of manufacturing a self is all-consuming and leaves the narcissist with little energy to direct toward paying attention to the existence of other people. In _A Fan's Notes_ Fred Exley attempts to construct a self that is &quot;not-Frank Gifford&quot;; he is a nobody. That he was able to get this down on paper in a coherent form was the achievement of his lifetime and he deserved all the recognition he got, but of course the recognition merely fed his narcissism.Yardley mentions Exley's famous monologues (given in person and over the phone) many times and says only that they consisted of disjointed stories of people that Exley knew and interacted with. He hints, but never states, that these narratives were more real to him than his own life. Yardley also mentions the negative review by Alfred Kazin of _Pages from A Cold Island_, the second Exley book; Kazin nailed Exley for living his life solely for the purpose of having something to write about. That is, Kazin outed Exley as a narcissist. Yardley completely misses this dimension of the Exley character and therefore his &quot;analysis&quot; of the man goes nowhere.If you were unfamiliar with the basic details of Frederick Exley's life, then this book will supply them for you. The interpretive aspect of this book is too kind to an old friend and allows Exley to remain an enigma when, in fact, he is has been explained better elsewhere by Christopher Lasch."},{"Title":"Misfit:: The Strange Life of Frederick Exley","review":"Jonathan Yardley has scored with this very readable story of a very different man's life. Frederick Exley (author of A FAN'S NOTES)is someone who would normally be hard to write three paragraphs about - but a whole book? Yes. And with style. MISFIT isn't a full-blown biography, it is a story of a man's life without learning where his grandparent's were born, etc. Yardley gives us much insight into an author who hit the long ball with A FAN'S NOTES and then well.....after reading this book, you'll know why that was the only book in him. Exley authored two other novels, but they are hardly worthy to be mentioned in the same review as Yardley's MISFIT. My suggestion - unless you are a huge Exley fan, read A FAN'S NOTES and then read MISFIT. Then if you feel you must, read the other two - but don't miss this one."},{"Title":"Misfit:: The Strange Life of Frederick Exley","review":"A FAN'S NOTES has long been a favorite book of mine, one that I pressed on a number of close friends when I first read it over thirty years ago, so I was quite excited to find MISFIT, Yardley's bio of Fred Exley, in a thrift store in Nazareth, PA, a few weeks ago. Sadly, reading this admittedly subjective look at Exley's screwed-up life was not exactly an uplifting experience. I guess I never realized exactly just how autobigraphical A FAN'S NOTES was. Finding out what a charming drunk and inveterate sponger off family and friends Exley was didn't really enhance my opinion of him. What an ultimately SAD life this guy lived, as a MISFIT in so many senses of the term. Given the paucity of actual materials he had to work with, due to Exley's nomadic and disorganized life, I think Yardley did an admirable piece of work in offering a peek at a tormented 20th century writer's life - a writer who may well have suffered from bipolar disorder and/or schizophrenia his whole life. Thanks for your efforts, Mr. Yardley. A FAN'S NOTES will still remain on my list of all-time favorites. - Tim Bazzett, author of Soldier Boy: At Play in the ASA"},{"Title":"Misfit:: The Strange Life of Frederick Exley","review":"This, despite claims to the contrary, is a conventional chronological biography. There's little that's illuminating or even interesting in this book. Exley's life is described as a child, as a successful novelist, and as an inevitably deteriorating drunk. Maybe Exley was simply not a good subject for a biography. He seems to have been nothing more than an irresponsible mooch. The attempts to explain Exley's behavior are very weak. Why does Exley wind up in an insane asylum on two occasions? Does one go to insane asylums because they are inherently lazy and irresponsible or is there something about them that explains why they are so troubled. The few stabs at explaining Exley are meaningless shots in the dark. For the most part this book just chronicles, without any explanation, a life that I'd guess was more complex than it's made out to be in the biography. According to MISFIT Exley was one of the most unattractive reprehensible persons ever to appear on the planet. Maybe that's the truth."},{"Title":"Proper Distinction Between Law and Gospel","review":"Even though the lectures given in this book were spoken over a hundred years ago, in the 1880s, it impressed me how well they address the current state of affairs in the Christian church. In many instances, the situations Walther describes fit exactly with today's. Although the 39 evening lectures were originally given and directed to men in training to become pastors, I believe all Christian laypeople can greatly benefit from reading this volume.The primary goal of the 25 theses laid out in the book were to clarify the two distinctive teachings of the Bible: the Law and the Gospel. The Law, as summarized in the 10 Commandments shows our sinfulness and the punishment we deserve for violating the law. The Gospel, however, is the joyous proclamation of Christ resurrected, and His conquering of sin and death. In this we find our comfort as Christians, knowing that although the wages of sin is death, the gift of God is eternal life in Christ our Lord (Romans 6:23). The significance of what Walther discusses in these theses, is that when we confuse Law and Gospel, try to separate one from the other, or only teach one of these doctrines, we invariably distort the true teaching of Scripture and lead people astray despite our intentions. When applied to our daily study of the Scriptures, church teaching, and other aspects of the Christian life, the distinction of Law and Gospel provides profound insight into the Bible. Many confusing parts of the Bible, especially parts that may seem contradictory are clarified when we see the distinction of Law and Gospel.Overall, I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in a clearer understanding the teachings of the Bible. Although the book may seem intimidating (its ~415 pages long), it is broken up into 39 lectures as I mentioned before, and each is about an hour's worth of reading. The lectures were also given in an informal style, so it's not overly difficult reading (occasionally the English is a slightly different from today's usage since the translation isn't very recent, but it isn't archaiac by any means). And finally, what really makes this an excellent book is that it is Christ-centered."},{"Title":"Proper Distinction Between Law and Gospel","review":"Walther's book is an excellent book and must read for every Christian, especially Lutherans. In this book, Walther discusses the distinction between Law and Gospel, and how these affect people and how God uses them. While the Law is truly from God, it terrifies the individual and points out their sin, it is God's alien work (Isaiah 28:17). The Gospel shows our Savior, and shows how we are forgiven, and how we live in thankfulness. The core of Christian and Lutheran theology.Walther's story about what happened to him in college, in meeting the Pietistic Candidate of Theology to teach him the \\"real\\" way of being a Christian is something that resonated with me. Walther approaches this subject with first hand experience of the danger in not properly distinguishing Law and Gospel. One can find echoes of Walther's story among the throngs of thoughtful Christians in modern Evangelical, non-denominational churches where the Gospel is preached infrequently.No one should preach, teach, or try to care for souls in the Church unless they have read this book and come to grips with the difficult things Walther brings up. The Christian may never master them in their life on this earth (Luther admitted he never did, but sure did try), but understanding the distinction aids one greatly. Read it.Note: The book is long, and *very* insightful. I tried to sit down and read it through, but after reading one lecture I felt mentally \\"full.\\" So much is said in each lecture I needed time to digest it. Read a lecture a day, and you'll finish the book in a little over a month... and have no end of wonderful things to chew on. :)"},{"Title":"Proper Distinction Between Law and Gospel","review":"In the never-ending human struggle to determine right and wrong, to live the golden rule, to live in peace with our fellow man, we often forget what the basic message of the Bible really is. C.F.W. Walther, president of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod and also president of Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, MO, presented a series of &quot;lectures&quot; on the proper distinction between Law and Gospel. This book is the compilation of those lectures. Walther never intended that these be published; however, his students felt that the contents of Walther's lectures was too good to be ignored. Gathering together their notes, they put together this volume which is still a primary resource for pastors today. It is worth your while to read this book and to look at the basics of the Christian faith."},{"Title":"Proper Distinction Between Law and Gospel","review":"The book is not about separating the Old Testament from the New Testament, but about distinguishing justification from sanctification by observing the difference between God's demands for holiness and his promises offered in the good news. It answered most of the objections and misconceptions I had had about the topic."},{"Title":"Proper Distinction Between Law and Gospel","review":"Walther gave a series of lectures a century ago that were meant to be an explanation of some essential Lutheran teachings. These lectures were so insightful and true to the spirit of Luther that Walther became the most important American Lutheran theologian and his book became a test for orthodoxy. Walther seems to have drunk deeply from the well of Luther's writings; his mind appears to be so at one with Luther's that this book is of the highest quality and one of the handful of books that would be essential to a scholar after the Bible, the Book of Concord, and Luther's writings. A gem."},{"Title":"Proper Distinction Between Law and Gospel","review":"This book is a compilation of speeches given to seminarians as they prepared for ministry, but it is a wealth of good theology for the laymen as well."},{"Title":"Proper Distinction Between Law and Gospel","review":"This book is a must read for every Christian whether they are Lutheran or not. This is a very clear and concise presentation of the most important doctrines in the Bible."},{"Title":"Proper Distinction Between Law and Gospel","review":"CFW Walther has come to be known as the American Luther and rightfully so. In this work, probably his finest, Walther discusses with great care how a preacher-pastor should distinguish between the use of Law and Gospel in his sermons. (For non-Lutherans one should understand that \\"Law\\" comprises the commands and the wrath of God whereas \\"Gospel\\" comprises the promises of God. Luther himself, perhaps unwittingly, borrowed indirectly from St. Augustine's treatise \\"On the Letter and the Spirit\\" as he formulated this dichotomy.)These lectures were given over a period of time and Walther is something of a \\"Zitatentheologe\\" such that he provides a great deal of citations from Luther and other early Lutheran theologians such as Martin Chemnitz and Johann Gerhard in order to prove and or demonstrate his point.I cannot say that all of his particular arguments are air-tight or that he himself actually went on to apply all of his own rules in his own sermons, but this is a very helpful look into how a great confessional Lutheran seeks to handle this important distinction with great care. Non-Lutherans may not realize that Calvin did indeed embrace the Law-Gospel distinction as well, though it has never occupied as prominent a place in Reformed theology.An American Lutheran Classic. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Proper Distinction Between Law and Gospel","review":"I learned so much from this book. My copy looks as though it has been through a war with the highlighter army,and then a hurricane.It is a series of lectures given to students who were studying at Concordia Seminary, so, you have to keep in mind as you read that the original audience was people who were becoming pastors, and this lecture series intended to tell them how to handle and teach while being mindful of the distinction between law and gospel, and how both can help people to grow in faith, when applied to the right situation. It covers how to tell which situations require preaching of the law and which require preaching of the gospel, and it covers the effects of each.The language is academic, and to the average reader it is quite 'chewy', but it is VERY rewarding to muscle past that and really give this book a thorough going over. It is not very long, and the way it is separated into discrete lectures divides it into readable, understandable bits better than something that had been perhaps written for the purpose of being in book form. The lecture divisions work better than chapter divisions is what I mean, and they form complete thoughts on their own, which makes for easier understanding of the intended meaning.This book has been very helpful to me also in my personal bible study, and looking at what I read in the bible while keeping what I learned from this book in mind has definitely brought me to a stronger understanding of the personal temptations I experience, and also the sweetness of the grace of god."},{"Title":"Proper Distinction Between Law and Gospel","review":"I have long used Dau's (originally published, 1929)\\"Proper Distinction Between Law & Gospel.\\" While it is an excellent reference, the translator took a few liberties in translation (IMHO). Also, it is more attuned to the academic and has therefore tended to restrict readership. But, it is not a \\"bad\\" book. However, a new translation from CPH (Concordia Publishing House, St. Louis, 2010) titled \\"Law and Gospel: How to Read and Apply the Bible by C. F. W. Walther, A Readers Edition\\" is now available. I have only heard the most positive reviews from both pastors, theologians, and the laity that have obtained the work. I will not throw my copy of Dau out, but I will tend to look more closely at this new translation that includes many helpful features."},{"Title":"Proper Distinction Between Law and Gospel","review":"Walther's Law and Gospel is one of the most practical preaching texts available. The book is a series of lectures delivered to seminary students in 1884-5. C. F. W. Walther (The first president of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod) shows his great love for his students and his concern that they be the best preachers they can be through his insightful comments. He begins with a series of thesis designed with the preacher in mind as a preventative to confusing the proper distinction between law and gospel. Thesis IV sets out Walther's concern.Thesis IV: The true knowledge of the distinction between the Law and the Gospel is not only a glorious light, affording the correct understanding of the entire Holy Scriptures, but without this knowledge Scripture is and remains a sealed book. (Walther, C. F. W., Dau, W. H. T., & Eckhardt, E. (2000). The proper distinction between law and gospel : 39 evening lectures (electronic ed.) (1).

This one has a place in history and should assist anyone who is serious about learning about Scripture."},{"Title":"Proper Distinction Between Law and Gospel","review":"The Law-Gospel distinction in this book is exaggerated. This book is useful to understand the views of Lutherans but of very little practical use. There is no interaction with difficult texts such as Revelation 14:6-7 and Galatians 3:21.

So far I have not been disappointed in the collection but I haven't finished it."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Connor is a fantastic writer but her short stories can be hard to understand if you don't know certain details about her life and philosphy.

We are left to discover her as we can."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I've read Everything that Rises Must Converge and A Good Man is Hard to Find.

Read these stories."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"It is important to know that Flannery was a faithful Catholic and also a conservative. She was widely read and thought deeply about her faith. Some important influences include Weaver(Ideas have Consequences ) and Jacque Maritain. Her stories spring from her faith and from the reality of being a catholic living in a bible thumping red necked south. Read Habit of Being.

Iqhope, did you not know that Virginia is a Southern state?"},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I read this book on and off for more than a month. It is well written and Ms. O'Conner is a talented writer. But is this book a classic? I say no. Some of the stories I felt were to short, others to long, and some made absolutely no sense. some ended without any real ending, leaving me dissatisfied and in some cases, frustrated. Her writing kind of reminds me of Stephen King's short stories with all the details but, without the creepyness. Her stories seem to border on horror? without ever actually getting there.In fact her book is kind of creepy in other aspects.She has this strange fascination with relationships between small children and old people. The one I think of off hand is, the one were the grandfather takes his granddaughter off into the woods to spank her, and she ends up killing him. Maybe it is that the stories were written so long ago, but there is a strange, almost sexual vibe to some of these stories, that maybe no one in the 1950's would sense, but I found somewhat disturbing. Also, any one who is upset by the use of the 'N' word, beware. Ms. O'Conner uses it repeatedly in almost every single story in this book.Maybe I am being to tough on this book, but I just don't feel it deserves 'classic' status. I was left disappointed to often."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Since I couldn't afford to go back to school to get my Masters, I thought it might be wise to obtain the required reading list and read myself through an alternate education. One on the list was Flannery O'Connor.After reading through this book, I had an epiphany as to why so many writers win the big prizes such as the Pulitzer for fiction--you take average or stupider than average people, throw a common sense question or decision (to be made) in the mix, and watch the characters make the wrong decision and come out at the end either wiser, still stupid, or scratching their heads not knowing what the hell hit them.In many of Flannery O'Connor's stories, this is essentially the plot. Many, if not all, of the characters are from the South, call African-American's the 'N' word without apology or hesitation, defines the era in which the story was written, and certainly perpetuates the myth folks from the South are illiterate, stupid, and don't have the common sense God gave a gnat.A critic praised her (quote) 'stories that burn bright, and strike deep.' Flannery O'Connor wrote stories where stupid people make stupid mistakes and I was pretty disappointed in the whole set of stories overall. While her story-telling abilities are a little higher than average, I don't agree that her plots or story lines are as valuable as the kudos give her from other literary critiques.If you are interesting in 'entertainment' type reading, this book is definitely not for you. If you are interested in The South as it used to be, from a native Southerner's point of view, and some interesting stories (overall) with deep literary and moral undertones that you have to re-read more than once to grasp, then this type of book will definitely appeal to your academic standards.While her stories may have been 'important' half a century ago by reflecting the sad, uneducated, and prejudiced thinking of the people of the South, I believe that the world has made broad strides in their thinking, education, and literacy and has moved beyond her stories and her way of thinking."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I highly suggest that if you wish to enjoy this woman's stories you follow the advice of an earlier review. Read them one at a time. If you don't you'll figure out the same thing I did, it's really basically one story about a woman who screws up everything for her family over and over again with the names changed.Whether it's the dead daughter in &quot;The Artificial Nigger,&quot; the too astute grandmother in &quot;A Good Man&quot; or the embarrassingly incompetent farm women, or the despicable mothers and their even more flat and dreary college educated children, Flannery can't seem to do anything other than recycle herself and the people that annoyed her into the same drek over and over. (Yes, I realize that was a run on sentence).Just remember, the writer being dead doesn't mean their work is great."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Her stories always bring some level of discomfort, particularly when you grew up around some of the archetypes. Like a Single Malt Scotch after the blended stuff, she brings that well-refined dark humor with Southern characters she no doubt plucked out of life in rural Georgia. She is the definitive Queen of the American Short Story. The Yankees will try to minimalize her by placing that \\"Southern Gothic\\" label on her. Don't buy into it."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"O'Connor captures something essential about Southern spirituality, something which cannot be summarized, something with roots in antebellum, but which flourishes still today long after she wrote. She once wrote that the South may not be Christ-centered, but it is certainly Christ-haunted. If you wish to comprehend the Christ-haunted South, there is no better place to begin than these stories."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Although the book isn't made in the most sturdy fashion, it does have most all of Flannery O'Connor's short stories. She's one of America's finest short story writers, by far. A great story write in general, really. However, her short stories are were she shined brightest. All fans of the southern gothic style MUST have this book in their collection. The stories are smart, captivating, imaginative and fun. The price is so low that you really can't go wrong here."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I had not read this author and have enjoyed her short stories. I was surprised at her insight and sly humor. She has a sense of justice that cuts through the southern \\"charm.\\" She tells in many subtle ways the lesson that pride leads to a downfall. Flannery also captures the dialect and settings that define the culture of her time."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"There's a famous saw (that some attribute to the English evangelist David Watson) to the effect that, \\"The Holy Spirit is a gentleman.\\" One will not get that impression from Flannery O'Connor. Thomas Merton allegedly said she didn't belong in the same class as Faulkner and other great American writers, but that she was up there with Sophocles. I think he probably had it right. I am convinced that anyone who classifies her as merely Twentieth Century, or Southern, or American, or Catholic, or woman, does not fully appreciate her, though it no doubt helps to be (or try to understand) all of these as well as what Jesus might have thought when He heard, \\"all the people,\\" say, &quot;His blood shall be on us and on our children!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'connor's writing is a realistic nightmare of what could go wrong in trusting strangers. Her own vulnerability through her isolating illness gives her a projective voice of unexpected violence. Her writing is often shocking, with modernesque twists, brilliant imagery that puts the reader in the short story. Her love of plotting the grotesque, freakish Jeffrey Dahmer meets girl-next door, makes her work revolutionary for her time and unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"No matter how often I read one of Ms. O'Connor's works I'm reminding that while some things in the south have changed, many others have remained the same. While written decades ago, these stories could have very well taken place in what we now call the New South. All that is needed is the token transplant from the North to add an additional dynamic.For Southern Gothic, no one can beat Flanner O'Connor and the way she weaves the human fabric into the soils of society. This collection is worth a read at least once a year."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I afixed Joyce Carol Oates' acrid response to a NYTimes review of O'Conner's work in the front of the collection that I newly purchased. Oates upholds the idea that any artist worth his salt is indeed seen as being \\"peculiar.\\" I'm pleased to own a collection of this \\"peculiar\\" author's best work."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Miss O'Connor had the distinction of being (like Scarlett O'Hara) an Irish Catholic from Georgia. In her short life (she passed away from a rare cancer in her thirties) Flannery O'Connor produced an amazingly full output of novels, short stories and poetry. This collection of her major short prose is southern Gothic at its finest. From Pentecostal preachers half-drowning converts while baptizing them in the river, to old ladies paranoid about meeting murderous bank robbers on the road during a cross country vacation-and then actually meeting some-these stories are unforgettable and brilliant, and can't help but make anyone wish Flannery O'Connor were still alive, a youthful and imaginative seventy-something, today."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"A good low-cost collection of O'Connor's works, perfect bound and paper not too flimsy (could be heavier). Rather small format. Definitely worh the few dollars I paid for it online, saving the search at used book sales, etc."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"At the risk of violating the First Commandment, I bow down before the art of this woman, an art which has launched a veritable industry of English grad-student theme papers. O'Connor was a practicing Catholic in a stretch of the Bible Belt where there were few of her faith. No less a commentator than Thomas Merton compared her to Dostoyevsky. The comparison is just: both authors were unapologetic Christians who used shock, sensation, and violence to get their message across. O'Connor's stories are grotesquely Southern Gothic, but with a subtle, non-proselytizing theological bent. I first read \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find\\" in the 12th grade, and in spite of the fact that I didn't \\"get it,\\" it blew me away. The way the humor segues into absolute horror is remarkable, especially when you consider this story was written in the 50s, well before mass murders and serial killers became fodder for the mass media. \\"Good Country People\\" is a satire of sex, religion, and nihilism in which an armchair anarchist is victimized by a good ol' boy pervert who is a manifestation of what anarchism really means. (The situation is similar to that between Ivan Karamazov and his half-brother Smerdyakov). \\"Everything That Rises Must Converge\\" features the conflict between a faded Southern belle right out of Tennessee Williams and her guilt-ridden, resentful adult son. \\"Parker's Back,\\" a nice pun for a title, is about a fellow who adorns his back with the tattoo of a religious icon. \\"The Displaced Person,\\" a tale of post-WWII refugees in rural Georgia, is the only story of O'Connor's in which some of the characters are Catholic, but as immigrants they are total outsiders in the world she depicts. These are all sophisticated stories that can be read over and over again. Many of them are violent, some irrationally so. Many of them depict vile and despicable characters. Many of them have a mad streak of black humor. Only one or two of them misfire and come across as preachy, didactic, or over-the-top satirical. O'Connor writes about the redemptive workings of grace in the lives of the most wretched of us - in other words, in the lives of all of us. Read this book from cover to cover; it will have the same effect on you as reading a profound novel."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"This book contains everything an aspiring writer needs to know. Forget books ABOUT fiction writing. Buy this book; read it; then read it again; then write. There is no better road to the world of fiction than the one which winds through O'Connor country."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Unless one has had the privilege of reading Flannery O'Connor, then one might be considered illiterate when it comes to great American literature. She is one of the best, if not the best, writers of short stories ever, not only because of her mastery of language, mood, description, and character, but because her stories provoke the reader to think about life's deepest and most vital and complex issues in a fresh way.O'Connor ushers the reader into places the reader sometimes fears to tread, and often carries with her a sense of spiritual awareness that is both troubling and comforting. Yet, always lurking behind the weightiness of subject matter is her sly sense of humor, which can provoke laughter at the oddest and most unexpected moments.With O'Connor, you journey down red dirt roads under mossy oaks past tilting old homes rotting in their decaying glory...a landscape filled with colorful and oddball characters being navigated by seekers and dreamers and schemers and thinkers and fools and frightened lonely souls.It's all about the South and all about American gothic and all about post-depression blues. It's about a young nation coming out of adolescence and into adulthood. It's about bitter old folk still fighting the Civil War in their heads and hopeful young folk looking ahead to a sunnier future.Writing a review on O'Connor is intimidating. One reaches for the quiet majesty of language that she so easily mastered. I give up...just do yourself a favor and pick up this wonderful collection of her stories."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Alice Walker said it best in her brief essay &quot;South without Myths,&quot; O'Connor's characters have &quot;nothing of the scent of magnolia about them (the tree wasn't probably even planted).&quot; When I began to read her stories, I was terrified because I found yet ANOTHER relative in each one! (I found myself in the son in &quot;Everything that rises must converge.&quot;) No one--NOT EVEN FAULKNER (God help me!)--hits me where I live so consistently! For ANYONE who seeks a narrative starting point from which to attempt to understand that weird mess called &quot;the South&quot; can do no better than to read O'Connor."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I enjoyed every one of the stories in this volume -- and together, they create a nearly perfect whole -- but my favorite had to be \\"A Late Encounter with the Enemy.\\" The story, to my mind, captured everything I think about when I ponder the \\"Old\\" and \\"New\\" South. O'Connor writes the story at a dizzying pace and yet gets to the heart of real emotion. All of the works in this book are excellent and will keep a reader engaged throughout."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"This is one of my favorite short story collections. If I ever decide to sell any of my books this will be the one I keep. The Complete Stories of Flannery O'Connor is Southern Gothic at its finest. Each of these stories are grotesque and funny at the same time. Some are darker than others which keeps a good balance because those that are darker are truly disturbing (even while you are snickering at the circumstances). The characters are all quirky and bizarre and the violence is shocking. The freaks and criminals abound and many of these stories contain a great deal of horror in their outcomes. The stories that gave me chills were The Lame Shall Enter First, Circle in the Fire, Greenleaf, and A View of the Woods. Give yourself a treat as well as the creeps. Read this book and enjoy each of these creepy and unsettling stories and laugh and shudder at each and every one of them."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"A great many people are familiar with Flannery O'Connor, and she is universally regarded as one of the best American short story writers. Her novel Wise Blood was made into a cult classic film by John Huston. Reading her inspired Bruce Springsteen's best album, Nebraska. One could go on and on. I would add that she ought to be a hero of the civil rights movement (read any story to find out why). Instead she was unceremoniously kicked off the Catholic recommended reading list for the language used by some of her characters. But being forbidden might make her more attractive for some readers.The Complete Stories combines two previous collections, A Good Man is Hard to Find and the posthumously published Everything That Rises Must Converge. Nothing against the first set, but the stories in Everything are among my favorite. All her stories are about so-called fundamentalists in her home of Georgia or the deep south. The title of the volume is an ironic inversion of a phrase by Teilhard de Chardin (who meant it optimistically). There is only one story in which she plays her hand, and could thus be considered a Catholic story, \\"Parker's Back\\". As the recent book, Flannery O'Connor and the Christ-Haunted South points out, she doesn't mean to mock her characters,but to immortalize them."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I never get tired of reading O'Connor. Vivid, wry, tragic and shocking, these stories are keenly observed revelations of human foibles and spiritual failure. O'Connor, a devout Christian, was especially good at evoking simultaneous cruelty and comedy, e.g.,when the Misfit in \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find,\\" looks at the dead body of the manipulative grandmother and says, \\"She would have been a good woman if there had been someone to shoot her every day of her life.\\" In the hands of a lesser writer, O'Connor's sort of violence might have come across as heavy-handed and contrived, rather than thought-provoking. Too bad she had to leave us so soon!"},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"This is my favorite book of short stories. I am amazed at how the author can blend such a diverse mixture of feelings into a story. Each story is humorous and heartbreaking. O'Connor has a knack for examining the thoughts in her characters' minds, and although they seem to be a little over the top, the characters are grounded in reality. I enjoy the fact that you can read this book for the pleasure of the crazy stories, or you may read it to delve into an examination of the religious themes uncovered. I would start with Flannery O'Connor by reading this book and then move on to reading Wise Blood or The Violent Bear It Away. It will be somewhat hard to understand those novels if you are not familiar with her short stories first. I think you will find this book fascinating."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I have never before spent all that much time with O'Conner's work. I was pretty damn impressed.Her observations on race were spot on--not dated in the least. Compared perhaps to certain writers who write of an experience that is only (most often) echoed today. There seems to be a certain timelessness to O'Conner's perception. Similar in ways to Twain, and perhaps to a lesser extent, Faulkner. I wonder if her Catholicism has anything to do with it, and the fact that she was a woman--these markers giving her an insight and subtlety of understanding that Protestant white men wouldn't necessarily have.It was interesting that both O'Conner and Richard Yates do not shy away from multiple points of view in a short story. Many if not most of the Yates stories shift POV. I have always inclined toward shifting POV, but was warned (scolded) away from it in my first writing workshops. I tend to like the way O'Conner handles shifts, it is more seamless than Yates. In O'Conner's work it is almost imperceptible (I am thinking particularly of \\"The Artificial Nigger\\" and the shifts between the grandfather and the boy). Yates tends to use paragraph breaks and will give entire sections of a story to a particular character's POV. O'Conner moves from perspective to perspective through brief paragraphs, shifting within the narrative line of the story without pause.And I have a soft spot for the gothic. I appreciate O'Conner's use of the physically maimed and the mentally disabled. I like her use of religion. Some of her stories read almost as twisted parables--sort of a Biblical Twilight Zone or Old Testament Alfred Hitchcock.But for my own work, I paid especially close attention to the intimacy O'Conner creates between her characters. I am thinking at the moment of \\"Good Country People.\\" She does such a brilliant job of showing the tension, desire, misinterpretation and intimacy between Joy/Hulga and the Bible salesman. O'Conner holds Joy/Hulga's anger and ugliness and even her intellectual aggression in contrast to the unexpected vulnerability she shows the Bible salesman. It does indeed bring life and complexity to her character. And then of course when the Bible salesman reveals his motivation and his true desire, something really remarkable happens--it is as though in these moments I can see the story take a breath.\\"Good Country People\\" is such a good story--there are so many elements of craft, elements that I am working on in my own writing. O'Conner does a spectacular job not only with complexity of character, but also with complexity of circumstance. She creates a situation in which a seemingly immobile Joy/Hulga is poised on the precipice of change. The reader feels as though she really could--or might not--fall in love with the Bible salesman. There are moments of living possibility when anything (or nothing) can happen.There are many remarkable stories in this collection that demonstrate similar mastery of craft--The Barber, The Life You Save May Be Your Own, Greenleaf, Everything That Rises Must Converge, A Good Man is Hard to Find...And along with these excellent stories, there are others that do not quite shine, stories that read as slice-of-life vignettes, interesting and pleasant enough to read, but not quite living: Wildcat, The Crop, Turkey, A View of the Wood, Revelation.I would like to read O'Conner's novels. And I am sure I will reread her short stories. And should I ever have the chance, I would love the opportunity to introduce her work to students."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"A group of seniors from our church were planning a visit to the author's childhood home. I thought it would be a great idea to purchase this book as a little prize for the trip.I read a couple of the short stories and found them to be a bit disturbing. Not at all what I expected. I do not need to have a \\"happy ever after\\" ending to stories but I read as an escape into anothter world. I did not enjoy visiting the world through Flannery O'Connor's eyes. Sorry."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Ordered 2-14-2007 and just rec'd. 3-19-2005. Have not had an opportunity to read this book due to the long delivery time.Book arrive in very good condition as described."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"\\"Grace changes us, and change is painful.\\"O'Connor, a delicate Southern Catholic who lived a third of her life ravaged by lupus, was certainly acquainted with pain. Her stories reveal this much. Many readers and reviewers may wonder if she doesn't take a bit of artistic license with her definition of \\"grace,\\" though. Considering her religious ideologies (which aren't hard to figure out, even after reading just one of these deliciously dark little tales), her unsubtle brutality isn't so unexpected. Look God directly in the face, the Bible says, and it completely and utterly destroys you.It's safe to say that even if her characters don't always get an unobstructed view of their Creator, they all at least catch a glimpse. O'Connor is not shy about her beliefs, and in fact, her unswerving social sensibilities are part of what make her writing so delectable. Read closely, because every single detail is important and potent. And just like the Bible she adheres to so fervently, the endings to her stories are forecasted unapologetically by every word that comes before them.This in no way ruins the power of those conclusions. Read a hundred interviews with a hundred writers, and I guarantee you that many of them will mention, as inspiration, \\"A Good Man Is Hard To Find.\\" Sit down for twenty minutes with the hilarious and heart-breaking \\"River,\\" and ask yourself if your foreknowledge didn't rob the final lines of their shuddering ferocity. Visit \\"A Displaced Person,\\" meet \\"Enoch and the Gorilla,\\" stay for awhile with \\"Greenleaf,\\" and take a good long look at \\"A View of the Woods.\\" You may find yourself wondering if there is any compassion and hope in O'Connor's world, but you'll never doubt that it is full of meaning, full of necessity, and full of heavenly fire.There's a legitimate beef some may have with this collection. \\"O'Connor has written an amazing story,\\" one of my friends once said. \\"I just don't know why she chose to write it thirty-one times.\\" It's fair to say that O'Connor doesn't stray much from her predictably gruesome formula. But while her themes never change much (purification through fire, self-knowledge gained via self-destruction, and the immolations brought on by racism and doubt), her telling of them is so fine and so stark, the details themselves are what really showcase her writing's true brilliance and beauty.This collection is arranged in chronological order, and it is part of the treat to see her ideas age as she does. Her final story, the aptly titled \\"Judgement Day\\" is a revision of her first story, \\"The Geranium.\\" The differences between the two show most openly where O'Connor hides the hope and faith and love that many feel is missing from all the works between. O'Connor, like the God in which she believed, seems too ready to expose her characters to an amazing amount of pain and degredation. But if you look close enough, if you read every sentence carefully, you'll see that she makes necessary every sacrifice, every drop of blood, every harsh, scalding ray of sun. In an era now where authors tend to shock for shock's sake, O'Connor stands out as a timeless reminder that as senseless and vicious as life's stories may sometimes seem, there is still the chance that behind it all lies a deeper, knowable truth. That truth may come at some great costs, but, O'Connor seems to say, it is better to buy with your flesh something lasting and real, than to sell your soul for even a whole world of lies."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I studied Flannery O'Connor in college and wrote a thesis on her works. Her stories were mesmerizing and riveting, and I have re-read them many times since. She was firmly rooted in the Southern grotesque, but she was able to transcend the stark terrain of the South and present remarkable studies of human foibles and the self searching for meaning and redemption.O'Connor had the uncanny gift to describe people, surroundings and life with astonishingly spare prose. Her genius was that she could reveal the mystery and manners in us all. Of particular note are \\"Revelation\\" and \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find.\\" You must read this collection, and I promise that her stories will speak to you for years to come."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I read this collection during college, in my senior literature seminar. I find O'Connor's stories to be the best, most brutally honest, thought-provoking and attitude-altering work out there. One piece deserving of mention are the classic &quot;A Good Man is Hard to Find&quot;, the last line of which reasonates long after the reader closes the book. O'Connor craftily delivers messages about racism, elitism and other problems of the deep South in her stories, and beautifully maintains the Southern Gothic texture in each one. I can't recommend this book any more enthusiastically!"},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I was lucky enough during one semester in college to be forced to read several works by Flannery O'Connor. After hearing her stories, I fell in love with her, so I read this collection. This is probably the most amazing collection of short stories I have ever read. O'Connor presents Southern people at their best and worst. Adding a hint of religion, O'Connor conveys the idea of salvation and how life affects those who do and do not have this. My favorite stories include: \\"A Good Man Is Hard To Find,\\" a shocking story about a criminal and an unusual family; \\"Revelation,\\" a humorous work about people who view themselves as superior to others; \\"The Life You Save May Be Your Own,\\" another hilarious and shocking piece describing how a woman decides to seduce a Christian man; and \\"Good Country People,\\" a story describing how people fulfill their wants and desires at others cost. These stories are easy to read and fairly short! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"The first half of the 20th century. Ask yourself about the short stories. Everybody wrote them. Ask yourself abut the best: Eudora Welty, Fredric Brown, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Carson McCullers, Dorothy Parker, Ernest Hemingway. And there is one name that is simply the best, against any competitors, against any subject matter, against any sex: Flannery O'Connor. I only hope that she knows that 35 years after her death her &quot;The Complete Stories&quot; is still is a best selling compilation and one of the most recommended books I have ever seen. They try to tie her to the south. They try to label her a woman's writer. They haven't read her. Flannery O'Connor is the best 20th century short story writer. Period. AND, she also wins the prize for best final lines in her stories. Didn't know there was a prize for best final lines? I have invented it.&quot;Then she recognized the feeling again, a little roll. It was if it were not her stomach. It was if it were out nowhere in nothing, out nowhere, resting and waiting, with plenty of time.&quot;&quot;The sherrif's brain worked instantly like a calculating machine. As he scrutinized the scene, further insights were flashed to him. He was accustomed to enter upon scenes that were not as bad as he had hoped to find them, but this one met his expectations.&quot;&quot;Mr. Paradise's head appeared from time to time on the surface of the water. Finally, far downstream, the old man rose like some ancient water monster and stood empty-handed, staring with his dull eyes as far down the river as he could see.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I cannot praise Flannery O'Connor enough. Though I have read a couple of her novels, I find her most effective in her short stories. This collection of short stories by Flannery O'Connor is one of my favorite books. She is unquestionably one of the best American authors of the twentieth century.Each story gives insight to another of humanity's secrets. O'Connor investigates the very nature of humans and paints a disturbing picture. Her stories look at what makes us tick, what haunts us, and how we give meaning to our lives. Each account gives another glimpse into O'Connor's mind. Some stories, particularly &quot;A Good Man is Hard to Find&quot; make me shiver to even think about.A highly recommended book that contains memorable stories and a beautiful writing style."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Fans of O. Henry and other short story writers would do well to read the collected stories of Flannery O'Connor. Though the stories are as rural as O. Henry's are urban, the sense of irony and tragedy remains the same, as does the sense of comedy. O'Connor was, beyond a shadow of a doubt, a superbly gifted technical writer.However, what takes O'Connor beyond the works of O. Henry is the theology behind so many of her stories. Raised in the deep South with several religious influences throughout her years, O'Connor struggled relentlessly with questions of faith, mercy, grace, forgiveness, and justification, especially in connection to social and racial prejudice. Readers will be hammered time and time again with O'Connor's understanding of what it means to be a sinner and what it means to stand under grace, and it is not for the faint of heart.Among the many stories worth mentioning are &quot;A Good Man Is Hard To Find&quot;, &quot;The River&quot;, &quot;The Artificial Nigger&quot;, and &quot;Revelation.&quot; These four stories by themselves would be worth the price of this collection - the rest simply add to the value. Any collection of 20th century fiction is incomplete without something from O'Connor, whose life was tragically cut short just as her work began to be truly appreciated."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Thirty-one stories and 550 pages rest within this collection. Each story has its own merit, but I would like to take a moment to describe the ones that have best remained powerfully glued to my mind.Revelation - This tale deals with a smug, pious church-goer (of which many of O'Connor's find similarity). The woman is happy she is not black or white-trash, and thinks herself a candidate for the front of heaven's lines. Of course, O'Connor has a tasty ending for her in the story's last pages.The Lame Shall Enter First - A story about loving when it's too late. The last words of this tale still haunt me.The River - A young boy wishes to find the kingdom of God but finds tragedy instead. I think O'Connor was attacking how some things are best not taught to children because they will not be able to comprehend them.The Peeler - A pre-teen searches for cleansing after his first experience with lust.Wildcat - an old black man's greatest fear ominously grows closer and closer to him with each new night.The Enduring Chill - the Holy Ghost, depicted as a purifying terror, descends madly upon a reluctant intellect as he waits for death.A View of the Woods - an old man is not above the things he hates as he turns on the one thing in the world he swears to protect: his ten year-old granddaughter.A Late Encounter With the Enemy - a Civil War veteran finds that his moment in the sun is actual nothing more than his first day among the devils.Good Country People - considered a classic by most, this tale deals with the ironies of a devious mind and those who fail to recognize it.The Comforts of Home - a female nymphomaniac is taken off the street by a kind-hearted old woman. The old woman's son, however, refuses to accept the new house guest and sets a plan in motion that will destroy everything he holds dear.O'Connor's stories are often filled with fringe-lunatics in the raw pursuit of grace as they battle pious church-mice, the racism of the day, and their own feeble place in the world. She exposes the harsh prejudice of those who claim an outward perfection, and often times the righteous and smug are given over to the very things they claim to be above. O'Connor takes on a literary trip that features corruptive minds, freakish hermaphrodites, hopeless nymphomaniacs lurching for any form of grace, and wild-eyed country folk who doubt both faith as well as admire it from afar.She spares us nothing and when it's all said and done, what we have witnessed are the rawest forms of grace being sprinkled on those who most would never imagine worthy, while those who seem to have it all together are thrust into their own personal hells. If you are interested in grace for the rugged, vexed, slob and slut, her tales are for you. Enter with an open mind and you will unearth something more intriguing than you can imagine."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Do yourself a favor, treat yourself. If you've never read The Complete Stories of Flannery O'Connor, read it now. If you have, read it again this summer. Winner of the 1971 National Book Award, these are mighty strange stories of broken people in a fallen world: hermaphrodites who proclaim themselves visible, inscrutable sign of God; physically maimed men and women, tormented by spirits and passions they can't fathom; landowners, poor whites and blacks colluding in nameless, unspeakable guilt.O'Connor's work, at its best, made manifest and palpable abstractions such as sin and redemption. Her work shouts of a world of spirit that is larger than all our categories and schema, encountered in experience but never contained or mastered. Only through difficult and painful revelation can the Kingdom be realized. Writing about the South in the middle of the twentieth century, her work is suffused with the divisions and nuances of race and class. She was a master of the short story form, as well. You get the solid setup, the telling character detail, the punch at the end of the story. Especially good are \\"Parker's Back,\\" \\"The Displaced Person,\\" \\"The Life You Save May Be Your Own,\\" \\"A Temple of the Holy Ghost,\\" \\"Good Country People,\\" \\"The Comforts of Home,\\" \\"The Lame Shall Enter First,\\" and the classic \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find.\\" This is a wonderful anthology of work from a powerful writer. Again, do yourself a favor."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Many white writers have tried (and continue) to capture the black experience, the oppression of the blacks in the South, but none come close to Flannery O'Connor. I did not have any idea about Flannery O'Connor's race when I started reading her some years ago and after a few books, I still did not know. Her writing is not subjected to any race or country of origin. It is on such a subconscious human level - just change the names and physical descriptions of the characters and you have a story that will take you inside the minds and bodies of the oppressed and the elite from every/any culture and before you know it, you will see yourself in a different light. Shakti Gawain and Deepak Chopra try to teach lessons that Flannery O'Connor presents to us - take from her books what you can, read them again and take more. Maupassant's short stories were unsurpassable, atleast I never thought anyone could come close to making strong statements in such few words, but I had yet to introduce myself to Flannery O'Connor. If you haven't read 'Everything that rises must converge' and 'A good man is hard to find' you are missing out on self growth and the tie that binds you to other humans."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Todd Sentell is a Georgia native and author of the social satire, Toonamint of ChampionsDear Flannery,Forty-three years after you died too young, a Georgia historical marker was stuck in the ground across the highway from the end of Andalusia's driveway. On a boiling hot Friday morning in July, in the shadow of the Badcock & More furniture store sign, just before the dedication ceremony started, a suntanned fellow in a red pick-up truck drove past and honked his horn. For an instant, I thought Parker was back.The mayor of Milledgeville spoke about you in his Milledgeville accent. And then, a priest with an Irish name in a huge white robe from your old church, Sacred Heart, got up in front of everybody and moved his hands around and read some things from out of that book that's not exactly the Bible. He said some things that a few of your fellow Catholics repeated with him and then the priest flicked the historical marker, while it was still covered with an official Georgia historical marker blue cover, with holy water. He flicked his wood water wand six times. I counted. The first time he flicked it at the cover you could see the cover quiver but it never did again. If there was a moment you would have loved the most, other than that redneck in the pick up truck blasting the earnestness out of the hot air, it was that holy water business. I'm not Catholic, but these were some moments I deeply understood anyway, especially since we were across the street from where you made literary history because of those hard, perpendicular intersections you designed in your stories and two novels ... the perfectly timed crashing together of personalities and religion in all its strange forms ... and its haunting aftermath. We were having some near crashing together of religion and personalities right there ... right by a loud highway in a modern time as we quietly stood in the grass that belonged to your marker and a discount furniture store.After that priest blessed your marker, the fellow who's in charge of the Georgia Historical Society got up there and said he was pretty sure that was the first time in the history of Georgia historical marker dedication ceremonies that one's been flicked with holy water. Everybody laughed and nodded at each other. God ... did I think of you right then. I'm sure I wasn't the only one who got the literary and personal importance ... to you ... of that moment. I saw you smiling down at this one, too: after everyone stopped laughing I wanted to shout out, like Hazel Motes would at discovering a blasphemer ... that the feller who's in charge of the Georgia Historical Society is wearin' a tie covered with the logo ... of the state of South Caroliner!After the roadside ceremony, we were invited to come across Highway 441--very carefully--for a reception in the main house. Your house and yard were populated with people speaking in only Southern accents and they were talking about how they knew you and when. Or how and when they knew your mother. On your front porch an old woman grabbed my arm and asked me if I was in church Sunday ... that she saw me. I said I wasn't ... I live one hundred miles from here ... but if my evil twin was there then good for him. The lady, tottering on feeble pegs, told me her name but I didn't get it because she spoke in an accent so rich her words came out like syrup. She said she had moved onto the farm when she was fifteen and that you and her were opposites. She said she lived in that building over there. She pointed at it with a crooked finger ... at the old shed where Andalusia's caretakers keep an old donkey named Flossie. I wondered if she was drunk. Who cares. We were all drunk on you. Standing in your bedroom doorway gawking at your crutches, your bed, and your writing table. I'm sure you think that's repulsive--a bunch of people crowded at your door like that. But I'm a respectful hick. I gawk with misty eyes but I don't point.I'm not going to go on about the condition of the house and the buildings around the property. Just to say they'll be back in better shape soon. There's a man in charge and a foundation has even been developed and the man in charge works hard to preserve you ... your place. Still.Heading back home up Highway 441 in my truck, I passed a couple of Georgia roadside markers of another kind--those homemade crucifixes people stick into the ground near where a family member was killed in a car or truck or motorcycle accident. You never know. When you see one, and you see a lot of them in the South, all you know is that death happened right there and somebody wants you to by-God know it.But it's never at that intersection you write about. You always see those crosses on some long, straight stretch of highway or country road. I think of you as I travel my long stretch of road and across fields of living fire, sometimes in a straight line and sometimes real crooked ... as your voice strikes up in my mind ... your voice climbing upward, on key, into a starry field ... and those who love you so much come to that moment of your grace on that road sooner rather than later if we're paying attention and we thank you for it ... battalions of freaks and lunatics shouting and clapping and leaping like frogs and those who have always had a little of everything and the God-given wit to use it right ... your devoted readers, wrapped in barbed wire ... we honk our truck horns in your honor and shout hallelujah.Todd Sentell is a Georgia native and author of the social satire, Toonamint of Champions"},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"This collection of short stories is one of the best around.

Although some readers may find her creations a bit odd, the genius inherent in her work is always evident."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Connor is one of the best short story writers of the 20th Century. Every story in this collection is a gem and you'll want to read them again and again."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"You don't have to be Southern to enjoy these short stories , although it certainly helps to understand the peculiarities of the Southern way of thinking - which has sadly all but died out in today's homogenized society - so richly on display in this collection. And perhaps the very best thing about this book is that the stories indeed ARE so short. Perfect for those strapped for time or short on attention. Every time I pick this book up ( and I have read some of these shorts dozens of times each, especially the hilarious \\"Revelation\\" and the grotesquely fascinating \\"A Good Man Is Hard To Find\\" ) it's like going up into my Grandmother's attic and finding something new to discover. These stories are filled with laugh-out-loud moments, great one-liners and unforgetable characters. Certainly what would be called \\"Black Humour\\", but without being high-brow or pretentious. Essential American literature, and VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Connor is the best short story writer I have ever encountered. Some of her best stories include &quot;Everything That Rises Must Converge&quot; (which might be the best short story ever written), &quot;Revelation,&quot; &quot;A Good Man is Hard to Find,&quot; &quot;The Enduring Chill,&quot; and &quot;The Artificial Nigger.&quot; Some of the stories in this collection are not as good, of course, but they're all well worth reading. This is a book that everyone should have in their collection."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Read these stories--all of them--at once if you can. The previous reviewer seems to have them all figured out, and maybe he or she is right in a narrow and inaccurate kind of way. The question to answer for yourself is what these stories are *also* about--and that is where much of the fun starts in reading O'Connor."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"One does not read Flannery O' Connor for feel good endings. The characters feel incredibly real, in that their innate psychology is so easy to realte to. Whether it be the old man who lives vicariously through his granddaughter and tries to shape her to be just like him to the proud intellectual who gets outmaneuvered by a crooked Bible salesman, it's disturbing in the fact that you've felt some of the same feelings as some of the despicable people that populate her short stories.The prose is incredible, and vividly shows that South in a time of rampant racism as well as transition to a more technological age. If there was one complaint, it would probably be that almost all of her stories have a tragic ending, and becomes a little predictable after a while. I consider myself pretty jaded, but a lot of the time it was cynicism for cynicism's sake, even if the underlying message spoke something all too true."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Genius! These stories remind me how much we can learn from people very different from ourselves. A Southern American white woman, O'Conner offers invaluable gems on American culture, racism and classism. When I read newer stories by our best young writers (people like Sherman Alexie), I am reminded of her. She writes the truth. It is often funny, sad and ugly at the same time-but it is the truth, and it is beautiful to witness. She is a true master of the short story."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Connor is an amazing writer. Please, buy her work and read it. But do NOT buy this book.Whoever compiled this has a love for Flannery that I can appreciate, but the book itself is horrible. It's full of typographical errors; it doesn't get the name of one her novels right half the time (it's Wise Blood, not \\"The Wise Blood\\"); it seems self-published, judging by the back cover blurb and the fact it's published through CreateSpace. I'm not sure it's even legal. I would be shocked to find out it is.I never bother writing negative reviews, but I found this book highly distressful."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"This book was tough reading for the most part--O'Connor's material can be disturbing and I often found myself feeling impatient with her repeated use of similar character types (widows who run dairies, dysfunctional thirtysomething-age daughters who are treated as children, angry artistic young men). However as I went through story after story (31 in all) I became more and more impressed with the structure of these pieces and how the development of the character and the plot are woven so seamlessly they appear to be one and the same.The story \\"A View of the Woods\\" describes a country store called Tilman's whose owner has posted a series of signs along the highway alerting drivers to the store as an upcoming destination: \\"...Tilman's was only five miles away, only four, only three, only two, only one; 'Watch out for Tilman's, Around this bend!' and finally, 'Here it is Friends, TILMAN'S!' in dazzling red letters.\\" O'Connor moves the reader through her stories in a similar fashion. The work has an energy that drives the stories. The characters are moved clearly, determinedly, to a destination that is often horrifying, but the reader isn't necessarily shocked by it. Why? Because in developing her characters O'Connor has planted signposts all along the way, much like the signs to Tilman's, that hint at how each character's flaws is leading to their destruction. In this way the stories also take on the feeling of a Greek tragedy: these characters have within them the seeds of their own doom and though they claim to resist what they don't want, their personalities draw them to their fates just the same. By making her characters' flaws the basis for action, O'Connor is able to create intriguing, engaging plot points born naturally of the people populating her stories."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Of the 31 stories included in this short story compilation, only seven have not been included in her other three books, including five stories that were revised and included in her novels. It is easy to see why the five of the seven stories in this anthology were not included in previous books; they are indeed lesser works. But, it is worth picking up this book for one of the two previously unpublished stories: \\"The Partridge Festival.\\" A note to those who may be squeamish about this topic: There is considerably more racist material in this book than in her other works."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Connor is truly one of the greatest American writers and this novel is evidence piece #1. Stand out stories include \\"Revelation\\" and \\"Good Country People.\\" These are two of my favorite short stories of all time. O'Connor is a brilliant satirical author and I highly recommend her to anyone who is a fan of Southern Gothic literature. If you like Eudora Welty or Carson McCullers, don't miss out on O'Connor."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I almost didn't buy this product because a few reviews wrote how terrible this particular publication was, but the price was so low that I didn't care enough. This collection is perfectly fine, however. Although another review wrote that the pages were thin and the titles poorly marked, neither is true; the paper is normal, and the titles are marked clearly in both the table of contents and the beginnings of the stories. The stories are organized chronologically, but the index carefully notes the original publication for each story, so you know which story goes with which original collection (or which story was not included in one of her two published collections). This information all seems obvious as you'd expect basic quality from every book purchased online, but a few reviewers mentioned that this collection seemed self-published. I disagree; it is completely typical and not at all amateurish.O'Connor's work is extraordinary, as other reviewers have already detailed, and anyone interested in this (very inexpensive) edition should not worry about the quality of the book, whatever you've read on other reviews. It is a perfectly normal physical publication of a completely abnormal and wonderful writer."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Conner is an absolutely wild and bizarre and scarry story teller.

This is one of the best stories that I've had the good fortune to read, and I look forward to pursuing Ms. O'Connor's works in full. Wonderful writing style and deep personal insight."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I got into Flannery O'Connor when I was at the moody Goth (without the black wardrobe) age of 13. We had her for a reading assignment in school: A Good Man is Hard to Find unnerved me. I could relate to all of the Southern hypocrisy due to the heavy southern count in my family and all my time spent in \\"The Belt\\". The queen of the \\"Banality of Evil\\", Ms. O'Connor anoints characters that are at peace with their darkness to prey particularly on those whom are comfortable living a lie.Ms. O'Connor exposes those whom want to hide behind their title, money, beliefs, etc. like someone shining a flashlight on a rat hiding in a sewer corner, and exterminating it. Her works came to mean to me the grotesque creature that the masquerade turns a person into, the creature that then must ultimately expose its true self in some unsettling way. San Francisco (aka \`psycho') in the 80's and \`90's and probably now, definitely brings Flannery O'Connor to mind. A beautiful and vertical natural landscape of sea, animals, sheer cliffs. The Euphoria of hot surfer boys in wet suits, with their sunshine smiles surf boards and an extended thumb asking for a ride down the coast to Santa Cruz (reminding of The Doors' Riders on the Storm, except they're better bait as \`killers on the road'; almost making you stomp on the brakes of the beat up '71 Beetle that you borrowed from your friend. Instead, you just return the smile as you putter past. But the peace, love and hippie, innovative hardcore music, political anarchy persona that the world heard about was ultimately just another freak show, fueled by drugs and people publically debasing themselves in retaliation against the lack of acceptance they suffered in their place of origin.I think of Flannery O'Connor whenever I meet someone and they put their facade between themselves and someone else; and when someone debases themselves by putting someone else's facade of celebrity, title, money, or whatever above their own self-worth. I know the ugly truth will eventually manifest itself, and it'll become a freak show spectacle for all to see (You Tube, reality TV, plastic surgery, etc.)The antidote to becoming an O'Connor casualty is to just accept and be your honest self, with all the human blemishes that make you beautiful. Putting make-up on a pimple only makes it fester until it ruptures into an ugly mess.I think Flannery O'Connor took things too far in her characters actions; and her works, in general: but that's what makes her Flannery O' Connor. But most of the bad deeds done by characters in her book were in private. I think that we are in an overt age of Flannery O' Connor now, destructive public acts in politics, in art, in media, in the world; and things are going way too far."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"O'Connor's is not well known among the general public, but reveredby those who know her work. Tragically, she died at 39, who knowswhat she might have done with another 20 or 30 years. This bookcontains all of her work except for her one novel. At a great price,too.Earl Schmitter,Concord CA"},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I personally like her novel Wise Blood better than the stories, and would suggest that the casual reader check out 3 by Flannery O'Connor which contains the novel and several short stories. It is a bit cheaper and will let you know what you're getting yourself into. But by all means purchase this book also, which contains my favorite story, &quot;Good Country People.&quot;Perhaps she did recycle her material, but so did Faulkner, Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and Joyce. I guess they're all just anthologized because they're dead too."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"The other is Neil Gaiman's Fragile Things. I know this may seem odd to have O'Connor, the genius of revealing the inner workings of the human, beside Gaiman, but if you read Gaiman the connections are there. I'm all about getting readers from different disciplines and genres to connect with other fields. O'Connor's work, as most know, is as perceptive as it gets. Reading her work is a pure revelation, an ongoing epihpany as to what makes humans human (especially the southern religious human). Read, re-read and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Thomas Merton said of O'Connor that when he thought of her, he did not think of her in terms of her peers in contemporary fiction (i.e., Hemingway, Faulkner, Steinbeck) but rather, he thought of Sophocles or Aeschylus.This compendium more than validates Merton's assessment -- after the American Empire passes, O'Connor's achievement will remain as its literary zenith. It's doubly strange, too, both for the form in which she specialized, and the content of the works. Americans (always poor judges of their own culture's worth) normally speak in terms of \\"The Great American Novel\\" --\\"The Naked and the Dead,\\" \\"Ravelstein,\\" \\"Moby Dick,\\" \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" even newcomers like \\"The Bonfire of the Vanities, \\", \\"The Corrections\\" and \\"Infinite Jest\\" are mentioned as contenders for the title. And the content of most candidates for anything \\"great\\" or \\"American\\" must always involve wealth, splendor, orgiastic sex or consumption of some kind. O'Connor's characters, for all their supposed grotesquerie, are far less exaggerated or caricatured than any others in American fiction.Furthermore, unlike the other authors mentioned above -- particularly unlike Tom Wolfe -- she was never in search of the \\"thousand-footed beast,\\" that all-consuming rig veda of a novel. And yet, in her own, simple, steady way, she outpaces the Mailers and Franzens and their febrile journalism. O'Connor is the consummate artist craftsman, who sees her art for what it truly is -- \\"reason in making\\" -- who finds reason in the created world, and informs her creations with a parallel, answering reason. Her mental eye is unwavering, like the beam of a lighthouse -- it is always pointed at truth.For that reason, O'Connor will probably never have the same popularity in this land of artifice and subterfuge that those others listed above will enjoy. History, nonetheless, will give her the laurels."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I suppose Flannery O'Connor has her own genre, and the reader gets it aplenty in The Complete Short Stories of Flannery O'Connor (550 pages of it). Even if you do not share her version of Thomistic philosophy, or care too much for the unique American southern fixation with exaggerated characterization, there is much to enjoy here. Some stories, like the heavily anthologized A Good Man is Hard to Find, is heavy handed and obvious. It is the less known stories where the punch is packed, like Enoch and the Gorilla and The Displaced Person. O'Connor has an uncanny way of making the obvious and banal evil; she takes the Catholic fixation on the fall of humanity and its need of redemption seriously, and in this collection the state of this state is unusual, exotic, page turning."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Connor is, in my humble opinion, the greatest. This book is my favorite single work that encompasses the breadth of what short story writing is all about. &quot;A Good Man is hard to Find&quot; is both chilling and laugh out loud funny. Greenleaf is a great example of irony. &quot;A View of the Woods&quot; is a much overlooked story. Flannery O'Connor viewed a world that included religious zealots without any real faith, frustrated liberals who couldn't make the world malleable into their world view, so-called intellectuals, big-mouth simpletons, and violent outcasts. She had a great ear for southern dialogue. I know, being a southerner, this is the way it really is."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"O'Connor's work is the South-- through a glass darkly. I remember in a literature class being read a letter where O'Connor wrote of some klansmen who spent the night in her hometown giving out baskets for the poor, dressed up in their white gowns riding in convertibles decorated with Christmas lights-- she then added &quot;I don't make this stuff up.&quot;Having grown up in the south and actually seen folks walking down the highway with a big wooden cross on their backs, I am always amazed by the fact that though O'Connor paints a story that is funny, she isn't laughing AT anyone, rather, she is showing more how we all can be ridiculous, especially without self-awareness. Moments of grace, of dark awareness, of sudden self-knowledge (and sometimes that's not what we think it ought to be). O'Connor is a genius of Southern Gothic, and of American writing. These short stories should be devoured, then re-read over and over again."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I am not a literary scholar nor have I ever studied Flannery O'Connor's works. As a high-schooler about to enter college, I have always struggled to identify the symbolism or realize the message of many literary works. Nonetheless, I was absolutely floored by this book, and it may be my favorite of all time. I did not pick up on the stories' less obvious meanings, but I found that the stories' plots are compelling enough and their language intense enough to be enjoyed on those merits alone. Although some of O'Connor's earliest short stories are sub-par (according to the Intro, O'Connor herself hated them), I loved the rest of her stories, especially \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find\\" and \\"Revelation.\\" I highly recommend this book to anybody who may be interested in it, especially if that person enjoys \\"darker\\" (i.e. realistic) stories or stories with Southern characters (although, as other people have said before, O'Connor was writing about the world, not just the South)."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I purchased this book for an advanced English course this semester. I had never heard of Flannery O'Connor. Now that I've read a few of her stories, I can't wait to sit down and read the rest of them--they're hilarious! O'Connor had a gift for creating vivid, idiosyncratic characters. Her stories are set in the South (of the USA) and have a religious theme; she shows how the characters get \\"mugged by grace\\" (those are her words). If you've never heard of Flannery O'Connor, or if you already love her, you are in for an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"The thing that really impresses me about O'Connor how she evokes the slow, tired humidness of the south without ever really giving long descriptions of settings. It's all here, religious guilt, the burden of the past, the failures of reconstruction, a cast of singular degenerates, all of it wrapped up in a creeping sense of doom and futility. I lived in a small town in North Carolina for two years, and I was surprised at how well these stories evoke the general physical sensations of being in the the south, which I think is empirically different (at least from the mid-west). At times the themes can be a bit repetitive, but the characters are usually so compelling that it doesn't bother you"},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I hadn't read any Flannery O'Connor before I picked up this book. Since I've finished it, I'm thinking about picking up her novel, Wise Blood, or maybe her biography, if there's a good one out there.

Individual stories that stood out were A Good Man is Hard to Find, A Late Encounter with the Enemy, The Life You Save May Be Your Own, Good Country People, A View of the Woods and The Lame Shall Enter First. But all of the stories deserve a second and third read."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"This does contain every last one of O'Connor's short stories. The book itself is very nice for a paperback, too: smooth cover, sturdy binding, and clean-cut text. Other editions of these short stories are often printed with too much front material (prefaces, forewords, timelines), but this one lets the stories speak for themselves with only one 12-page introduction. This book is great for one's permanent collection."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"You can read Flannery over and over again and always come away with something new and never, ever get bored. Much like listening to Beethoven, Mozart, or the Beatles, O'Connor never, ever gets old or wearing. My god, what a gift she had. Other reviewers have summarized the stories, so I won't. Suffice it to say, this collection should be on all people's bookshelves that love literature."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"She is a fabulous writer.I have read most of the book and it is more than 700 pages long. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"...and I love it! O'Connor reminds me of a Southern Shirley Jackson. Never read her before but I am now a fan."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"O'Connor's brief career has not stopped me from returning to her work during my years as a reader and instructor. American Gothic grapples with race, gender and class, which makes Flannery O'Connor a great read."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"This is an Excellent collection of stories by one of America's great writers.Many stories can be read in less than an hour."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"It's fun to pick up this book and read the short stories. Good book to travel with. She's us a unique writer."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"It takes a while to warm up to her style. But once you do (if you do...) she's a beautiful and powerful writer.I was struggling to read the first few stories, and was about to give her up, but after a while I changed my mind completly. I've read about 15 stories (starting with her latest and going back), but now I am impatient to read all of them.A small issue may be the occasional deep Southern dialect. It's simple though - if you don't understand, just read it aloud. Another is that some sentences don't quite make sense. Then try to look at her prose as a kind of poetry - it helps.And of course the worst is that her stories are deeply disturbing. Most of her characters are extremely unlikable, and they usually meet a bitter end. You won't like it, but I'm sure she didn't either, and that's exactly why she was writing about it, a stinging satire of her times and culture."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Connor managed to merge the terms &#34;artist&#34; and &#34;writer&#34; in her perfecting of the short story. Not only are these some of the most inspiring and, at times, heart-wrenching pieces of writing I've ever read, but they are also the easiest to read. I find myself losing track of time when I read her stories, before and after reading: each story takes about 40 minutes to read, and a few days to process. It's just so beautiful."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Connor's stories are mesmerizing. I'd read (and marveled over) plenty of her stories in anthologies over the years but never bought an entire collection until recently. This super compendium was absolutely worth it. One reviewer mentioned that it could be repetitive but come on, you can't expect total uniqueness over an entire writing career. Of course certain things reoccur and themes show up again! A great book."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Connor is such an amazing writer. Her stories create such a feeling in you even though they're only between 10-40 pages long. I read Everything That Rises Must Converge, and I just had to read the rest of her stories. And really, they're so amazing. There's an element of the macabre to them. You get this deep chilling certainty as you read that something bad is going to happen in the end, which it usually does. And they're kind of scary that way, but it just shows how talented O'Connor was. America lost a great writer when she died in 1964 at the age of thirty-nine from lupus. You got to give the South credit; they've turned out some great writers. Now I've got to have this volume for my own collection.I've got to give A Good Hard Look credit for motivating me to read O'Connor. I'd obviously heard of her before, but never actually read her. I guess I thought it would be boring or something. I couldn't have been more wrong. Her stories are gripping, and her words are beautiful. O'Connor is definitely now among My Top Ten (by the way, the order in the list is kind of arbitrary really. I switch the order around every few weeks or so according to my whims.) Really, I cannot stress how much I recommend her. Wonderful, wonderful writer, and wonderful, wonderful stories.All of my reviews can be read at my blog (novareviews.blogspot.com)."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Miss O'Conner died way too soon. Her work is the embodiment of her times, so delicious in her wonderful mix of earthy and realistic characters. If you enjoy oddball, yet real ... there is no one to compare her to. She was unto herself. I recommend all of her work."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Connor is one of great American writers of the 20th century, a Southern Gothic stylist of the first order. She won the National Book Award for this posthumous 1972 collection, 'The Complete Stories'.O'Connor sets her stories in the rural South and populates them with flawed, grotesque, and twisted characters - this is not the imagined noble, glorious, and chivalric South, but rather the real South of the poor and middling whites of the 1950's(race is mostly in the background). She catches the nuances of human behavior. Her stories have powerful, unexpected and disturbing endings.Pick up a story and read just one paragraph and you will be hooked.\\"Asbury's train stopped so that he would get off exactly where his mother was standing waiting to meet him. Her thin spectacled face below him was bright with a wide smile that disappeared as she caught sight of him bracing himself behind the conductor. The smile vanished so suddenly, the shocked look that replaced it was so complete, that he realized for the first time that he must look as ill as he was...\\"Absolutely the highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"If you love O'Connor, you should own this, and if you have never read O'Connor, buy this book and begin ASAP! O'Connor's stories expose the complexities and frailties of being human, and you'll be struck by their profundity, a profundity that I find sorely missing in modern short stories (I've been reading the fiction issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;). But perhaps what I love most about O'Connor is her sense of humor. One of her most anthologized stories, &quot;A Good Man is Hard to Find,&quot; is as funny as it is dark (I'm thinking of the scene when &quot;a horrible thought&quot; occurs to the grandmother in the car). O'Connor is simply one of the best short story writers of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"A dear friend suggested a few Flan stories to me, and I guess I got hooked. With this volume consumed, I can now say I have read all of the published short stories of this fantastic writer.O' Connor's work is fantastic in the way my dictionary describes the word. &quot;Conceived by unrestrained fancy.&quot; These stories are nearly always shocking, actually very shocking. They are powerful character driven things, and rather than describe them as &quot;horror&quot; stories as I see some reviewers do, I would moreso call them &quot;grotesques.&quot;They involve characters that are not so much &quot;horrible&quot; or &quot;horrorful&quot; as much as they are simply ludicrous, or incongruously composed or disposed. Caught up in all manner of inner bigotries, hypocrisy, fanaticism of one sort or another (most often religious). O'Connor characters often turn out to be homicidal, suicidal, brutal, obsessed, the opposite of what they appear to be, and always, if nothing else... shocking!I am no connoisseur of the short story genre but all I know is that these stories without fail, intrigued me. Opened a door to further contemplation, and went a bit beyond what they said.For sheer brilliance of sentence structure, visualization, suspense, I think it would be fair to say that there are few writers that have ever written as clearly as Flannery O' Connor.When I am reading literature, characters better dang well talk good, and talk like people, not like characters. The dialogue in this collection is one of its strongest points. Impeccable down-south vernacular.As for verisimilitude, well that is another mentionable thing here. If they are anything, these stories are bizarre, and yet they retain that quality of appearing to be true. Appearing to be possible. But the last thing that they are (hear me now, if hearing nothing else), these are NOT happily-ever-after stories.Hell no.They are most often direct flights into the realm of the reprehensible and least optimistic aspects (propensities) of human nature.For those who care, my own favorite story was probably The Lame Shall Enter First.T.y.L.i.I."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I cannot believe that I'm the first to review this, but then again, perhaps O'Connor's work is so ubiquitously acknowledged and praised that no review is actually necessary. For those who aren't familiar with her, you would do well to acquaint yourself with &quot;the greatest short-story writer since the (second world) war.&quot; Although her settings are somewhat limited (for the most part, the stories are placed in the rural American South), she manipulates atmosphere to embody a wide array of tensions and meanings. Her grossly exaggerated characterizations generally represent the grotesquerie of self-important, prideful, and perhaps most importantly to O'Connor, Godless people who seem to walk the Earth in greater numbers in the modern age. Even for readers who aren't particularly religious--as I myself am not--the stories fascinate with their merciless wisdom and impact. Subtlety is not an issue for O'Connor. Read these pieces one at a time, allowing the ensui! ng shock to settle into some sort of self-incriminating revelation. Then proceed to the next painful, cleansing lesson."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"While O'Connor definitely has a specific way of telling a story, her tales have been largely ignored. This may be due to the subject matter that fills her niche relative to the time period she was writing in. Even if you don't choose to read the entirety of her work, you should do yourself a favor and take the time to get to know this author. \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find\\" and \\"Revelations\\" are perhaps some of the best literature I have read in quite some time."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Reading Flannery is like reading the Bible, a horror story and a literary masterpiece all at once. She might not have liked the word masterpiece bc the word sounds academic or pretentious, but there is no one like her."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"don't make the mistake of purchasing this book. I cannot believe this edition of Flannery O'Connor's works was allowed to be sold and I'm even more surprised that Amazon is selling it. It has no table of contents, no page numbers (I don't think I've ever seen a book without page numbers), no real separation of any kind between stories, and looks like a Word document that has been hurriedly typed and bound in order for someone to make a fast buck. The typographical errors distract from O'Connor's marvelous work. I've never seen a book so poorly typed. Exclamation points are used in place of upper-case \\"i\\" or lower-case \\"l\\" dozens of times and it's not unusual to find contractions typed, for example, as \\"don*t\\". The titles of the stories aren't typed with the correct capitalization...I could go on and on. The only reason I gave one star to this edition of O'Connor's work - which I'm sure would appall her - is because I couldn't give it anything lower. DO purchase Flannery O'Connor's work. DO NOT waste your money on this edition."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"When I first picked up The Complete Stories I thought it would just be another book, but after I read the first page, I knew Flannery O'Connor was a magnificent writer. My favorite book was A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith, but now it is the Complete Stories. It takes me back to the 1940's and I just couldn't put it down. I love writing fictional stories on my free time and Flannery O'Connor has inspired me, especially in her story \\"The Crop.\\" I recomend this book to anyone who likes a book they can call extraordinary."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Connor's The Complete Stories puts the reader in possession of a superb collection of all her short stories, including those published posthumously. Each story looks at humanity in grit and detail. With a passion for the absurd, O'Connor explores the condition of the South, sparing no character's flaw and yet making the reader sympathize and care for the people she creates. Like Faulkner, O'Connor seems to feel a sadness and passion for the South and its often crazy citizens. While many read \\"Good Country People\\" or \\"The Life You Save May Be Your Own\\" in high school, there are other stories less well-known that reward attention. \\"The River\\" and \\"Revelation\\" are two personal favorites. In \\"The River\\" looks at child neglect, baptism and death simultaneously. \\"Revelation,\\" which was her last finished published work before she died ends on a hopeful note-the protagonist actually seems to have learned and changed at the end of the story- a rare thing in her work.O'Connor has been a particularly influential writer among American authors, and her theories about short stories are regularly taught in the classroom. She was a great advocate for allowing the story to be the meaning, and not candy-coating for a moral. However, her concerns are woven into the fabric of each story, and the flaws in ourselves are revealed through her characters. While O'Connor is known the best for her short stories, she also wrote two novels and some literary criticism, which are not included in this volume, but are also well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"This collection of short stories from Flannery O'Connor is full of unique characters: staunch old women, depressed aging men, disillusioned \\"artists,\\" and young people already mired in moral ineptitude. There are no heroes or heroines here, these people seem just barely able to navigate their own life, and unable to handle any sort of major change. One underlying theme is the old South's reaction to a new social order in which former slaves and \\"white trash\\" threaten established tradition. Another theme is the manipulation of or misunderstanding of Christ's work of redemption. Instead of knowing the truth and the truth setting them free, these characters take part of the truth, skew it, then let it reak havoc in their lives.Besides being engaging reading, these stories caused me to consider my own prejudices and moral ugliness. The chronological arrangement of the stories added to the book's overall enjoyment. It was great to see her progression as an author from the characters sketched in the stories she completed for her master's degree, to the fully fleshed out humans found in the stories she wrote in the years before her death. The first and last stories, in particular, highlight this maturation. The stories are the same, essentially. They both describe the demise of an old man made to spend his dying days with his daughter in New York instead of on his own in his beloved south. The characters in the last story are instantly recognizable as the characters from the first, but it's as though we've moved from seeing pictures of these people to meeting them in person. It makes for interesting reading."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"So . . . how am I going to summarize over 30 short stories in one volume that run the gamut (what is a gamut anyway) of highly disturbing to deeply inspiring to truly annoying? Since Flannery O'Connor is in that \\"classic\\" category and I am not a literary critic, here is my advice to fellow \\"regular guy (or girl)\\" readers:You can't make it through this volume without taking breaks away from this book. I plowed through half of it and that was too much. I had to go to Colorado and drive back home to New Jersey with my family to get it out of my head. So I would suggest alternating these stories with lighter fare, or trips to Colorado if you can.The second half was easier for me . . . I think maybe because Flannery doesn't seem to kill off all of her characters in the second half . . .The single story \\"Revelation\\" was worth all of the time I spent on this book. My second favorite was . . . oops . . . Amazon won't let me print the title . . .I got this book out of my interest in Southern history and culture. What I got from it was incredibly deep, affecting, surreal yet crudely realistic portrayals of people in all of their hypocritical, self deceptive, self destructive, self righteous, vulgar, and funny ways. I didn't know people could write like this . . . or this well."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I love Flannery O'Connor. I first came across her writing by chance and after my first reading I was enthralled by her witty observations and her ability to cut to the chase and eliminate pleasantries and polite discourse. Francis conjures up a familiar world of sidelined characters whose meek corner of the universe becomes the centrifugal force that catapults her characters into the realm of universals. At first I believed her writing to be humorous yet sardonic ; now I believe her literary genius is mysteriously mundane and it challenges my cynicism of everything I thought I knew about human nature. This book has it all - no stone has been left unturned in her moral universe of southern lifestyles , attitudes and priorities."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"I have recently read O'Connor's 2 novels and a bio, so was anxious to read her short stories. She was on a wavelength all her own and after reading her bio I am amazed at the breadth of her knowledge.These stories are freaky and deep and often have very similar messages. I am so glad to have found her although it is so many years after her death.I totally agree with reviewers who say that she was brilliant and one of literary's biggest losses."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Connor is a master of prose. Whether it be her lauded short stories or her novels, her prose strike a blow like a fist. The plots are violent and engaging, the characters often grotesque---all of which make her writing frightening and uncomfortable, but none the less literary. As we know, she died at the height of her powers, but her reputation and prose live on and have engrained her in the literary world as a giant."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Flannery O'Connor's world is dark, bizarre and grotesque, yet comically ironic all rolled into one. I remember taking a Southern writers course in college and first learning of her short stories, and then recently going back up and picking them up again. I was hooked. Unusual characters and situations are at the forefront in her stories; however, there is more to her stories than just their shock value or entertainment. With such deeply symbolic links to spirituality and messages of faith, there really is more there than appears. They have a simplistic form, but are thought-provoking, unique, and often have endings that leave a lasting impression.Similar to many writers of the past, O'Connor was misunderstood. Many take her stories to be \\"horror\\" in origin, but this would be a misinterpretation. Her stories have a Southern flavor to them, but they are of a cynical and darker mood, and seem to expose the negative side of humanity in various forms. She often takes the \\"road less travelled\\" and approaches a moral or theme in a backwards sort of way. So, it is not uncommon to encounter hypocrites, sinners, liars, cheats, and other degenerates. In other ways, her stories aren't always as linear as one would think, as they often need to be interpreted in a symbolic sense rather than at face value.This is the most complete collection of her stories, and it spans from the beginnings of her writing career and follows it all the way to the last story before she died, \\"Judgment Day.\\" Part of this collection is the basis for her first novel, Wise Blood. If you have read the novel, you will know many of the characters and chapters within these stories.There are so many stories that I loved, but probably my favorite is \\"The Life You Save May Be Your Own.\\" The story involves a drifter, Mr. Shiftlet, who comes upon a woman and her daughter. Mr. Shiftlet has sort of a salesman pitch about who he is and what the world is, but he has an ulterior motive--he wants the woman's car. The ironic point of the story is that the two main characters, while they speak about the rottenness of existence, are apparently blind to the fact that they are part of this badness. The ending--the scene with the hitchhiker and his message--is pure genius.Other notable stories: \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find\\" is a darkly comic story features a grandmother and her family meeting up with a notorious criminal running loose, the Misfit. \\"The Displaced Person\\" illustrates the negative sides to discriminating against outsiders. \\"Good Country People\\" demonstrates an ironic twist to the title, as a woman meets a man who is anything but \\"good country people.\\" \\"A Late Encounter with The Enemy\\" has an old timer, who believes he fought in an epic war, encountering fate at his granddaughter's graduation.If you are a fan of Southern writers or the Southern Gothic, this is a great place to start. A fantastic and comprehensive collection and, for the price, it is a steal."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"When you discover something special it tends to stick with you for a long time. This is what happened when I first read Flannery O'Connor. In college I was first acquainted with O'Connor and her short story \\"Good Country People\\". My professor provided a brief bio of her life from her battle with lupus to her comic drawings in her early career. The story instantly connected with me. It was grotesque, funny, tragic, and it haunted me after I read it. The ambiguity is something I at first hated, but eventually as I read more of O'Connor's work learned to grow fond of. After I read that first story I picked up this book that had all of her collected short stories. I originally read it from beginning to end, and I was in awe of how her stories grew with her artistry. Some of my favorite stories include \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find\\", 'The Displaced Person\\", \\"Good Country People\\", \\"The Turkey\\", \\"Revelation\\", and \\"The River\\". These stories work on so many different levels. You can read them for intellectual stimulation, or just as a good story before you go to bed. O''Connor has since become one of my favorite American writers and I have gone on to read everything she has written. If your a fan of grotesque stories, southern America, or just great literature then you will definitely love these stories. There is a reason O'Connor is regarded as one of the best short story writers. Crack the cover and find out, you'll be glad you did!"},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Someone wrote, I read it in 12th grade and didn't \`get it', but was blown away. I think that was her point. Catholic existentialism, as I see it. There is a similarity to Walker Percy, although she is in a different league. When I finish a short story, I laugh- what was that about? Yet at the same time, I think I know..."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"Unfortunately, I purchased many copies of various collections of O'Connor shorts before stumbling upon this complete collection. It is true that there is value in reading a collection of stories in their original compilation format-writers often tell larger stories through a series of short stories. But once you read a O'Connor story, you'll want to read them all, so I advise purchasing this complete set.O'Connor stories are full of the most original and interesting characters and plots you'll experience in fiction. No recycled garbage here. A grandpa and six year old grandaughter fighting over identity, a son fighting with his mother over her charity to a stranger, father and son going to town. O'Connor was heavily influenced by her faith and her writing often explores themes of gaining and loosing religion. But the best O'Connor stories involve complex family relationships like \\"The View of the Woods\\". O'Connor was insightful and understood the tension created by the \\"can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em\\" mentality that often exists in family groups. Excellent reading."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"This is the most comprehensive collection of Flannery O'Connor stories that you're going to find anywhere, and you just can't beat the price.Flannery O'Connor is a literary giant. If your interests include American literature, Southern literature, women's studies, or any combination thereof, this book is a must-have for your collection."},{"Title":"The Complete Stories","review":"O'Connor is amazing. I'm reading this for a class, but I can't put it down. It is a really great book!"},{"Title":"Silent Woman","review":"Janet Malcolm is really unique. Her book is never a conventional biography of Plath, but a study of the things that were not written by Hugues, an exam of every other book on Sylvia Plath and a brilliant anaylisis of the literary biographic genre and literary biographies readers. Besides, her style is so concise and it has an inner rythm and you feel as if you were reading a thriller. And there is something really Davoine or Lacanian in her approach, because she shows the inner sides, the difficulties, the doubts and the reverse of everything she touches. You can see Ted Hugues hidding himself and divided between the two masters he has to serve. And in the same time, Sylvia Plath is there, in every page, the Silent Woman. Terrific."},{"Title":"Silent Woman","review":"This is a terrific book because it makes you think about so much more than just the circumstances surrounding Plath's life and death.

As the host of the Journals forum at BellaOnline, I found The Silent Woman an indespencable tool in writing my article on journals and why the online journal, like the biography according to Janet Malcolm, is so unreliable.Ms. Malcolm's book takes us through England and the US, trying to piece together the history of the Hughes/Plath marriage. Along the way, she makes some rather remarkable conclusions not only about the Plath marriage but about the biography itself -- conclusions which transcent genre and, in the end, talk about most biographical/autobiographical works, such as journals, and why we cannot always believe what we read.

In my experience, when industries become this complex and rarified the harvest becomes ever more meagre and suspect. The Silent Woman is a mixture of grandly-delivered truths that have always been obvious (we can never 'know' the truth definitively, for example) and crumbs of gossip salvaged from the table at which Hughes and Plath critics have been banqueting now for over thirty years.

The title is somewhat misleading. Author Janet Malcolm was drawn to the subject because her former classmate Ann Stevenson was taking a terrible drubbing for her (Stevenson's) biography of Sylvia Plath \\"Bitter Fame.\\"Malcolm went about interviewing Plath-Hughes sources, family and biographers. The world of biographers is a cruel and incestuous one, particularly if the subject still has living friends, enemies, and families. Stevenson, Malcolm believes, had no idea what she was getting into and was bombarded on all sides mainly because she was an outsider.I was predisposed to enjoy the book because of my pleasure in Malcolm's writing. I like her no-nonsense, take-no-prisoners style. She is surgically precise in her judgments. Some readers this may find her intolerably high-handed, and if so, will end up annoyed.Sylvia Plath is not an easy subject from any standpoint. Would she have had such fame if she had not killed herself at 32? If she had not been married to Ted Hughes? Will her poetry stand up? I think we are still too close to give definitive answers. I disagree that this book is strictly for biographers, academics or Plath-buffs. It has a strong appeal to the general reader who has some interest in poetry and expatriate American writers. I left the book with a better knowledge of the dynamics in which Plath spent her last years and strong sympathies for the enigmatic Mr. Hughes.Ms. Malcolm could have used more structure in the book; I found myself flipping back and forth among the pages. Also, some of the statements need attribution. However, in Malcolm's defense, I don't think she planned this as a scholarly work, but more impressions of the closed world of biographers.

One could say that \\"The Silent Woman\\" is a kind of rich almanac into Plath's secret, exquisite, dark world--and the people who loved and despised her. It is not a biography--but more of a journey to find truth.I loved getting to know more about Olwlyn Hughes (typically English), and of course Ted Hughes. And \\"The Silent Woman\\" helps the reader to understand why they are as protective as they are about Plath. (I would not have taken a liking to Olwlyn and can understand why Plath disliked her.)\\"The main problem with S.P. biographers is they they fail...They can caricature and remake S.P. in the image of their foolish fantasies, and get away with it--they assume, in their brainless way, that it's perfectly O.K. to give me the same treatment--apparently forgetting that I'm still here\\" --TED HUGHESCome on people--have some common sense, some decency.

I like the way she created something new from all of the hundreds of the same.

The artist dying young, by design or misadventure, is not a rarity in our era. The Plath story, though, has taken on political and ontological clothing out of any proportion to her brilliant but small, significant but highly subjective, contribution to the literary canon. The development of the legend has outpaced an understanding of her place in the scheme of poetic things. Malcolm tries to penetrate the atmospheres surrounding Plath by taking one step back and looking at the relationship of her biographers to the still living participants in Plath's life and death. At the level of a guide to the prospective biographer it is a cautionary tale of the (perhaps futile) attempt to find objectivity and consensus amongst the emotional detritus of a tragically shortened life. A labrynthe of intrigue, jealousies, speculation, antipathy and ulterior motives actuates the Plath 'biographical community'. For this alone it is well worth the read. At the level of actually sorting out the real Sylvia Plath, I cannot say I am any more enlightened. It is really her husband Ted Hughes who has become an object of derision or the victim of harrasment if not the subject of these biographies. Everything is implicitly in the Hughes camp or fighting the Hughes camp as to historical legacy and responsibility. Unfair but inevitable to Hughes, for this melodrama has been caught up in the swirl of post structural ethics. It might be too early to try this type of exercise. Perhaps someone can work constructively with the contradictions of this story through the clarifying mists of time. The recent biography of Coleridge by Richard Holmes is a reliable companion to his poetry, 200 years on. For Sylvia Plath, all we still really have in agreement at this point is her work (Ariel most remarkably) and that of Ted Hughes on Plath (Birthday Letters specifically) with which to define the drama and literary credibility of her life. That might be enough in the interim."},{"Title":"Silent Woman","review":"It's not very often I get absorbed in criticism, but for a book which wrestles with the complexities and dichotomies of biography, this is surely the best example which exists.

Put simply, it is the final word on its subject - which is, of course, the act of biography, not Sylvia Plath or Ted Hughes.That Malcolm presents herself as a major figure in the narrative, that she sides with Hughes against Plath (she says so in precisely those words; unlike every other book that addresses the Plath story, the agenda here is explicit, not veiled), is not merely apt but crucial. This, she argues convincingly, is what every biographer does - only usually with less self-awareness and honesty.The point can't be stressed enough - especially as several reviewers here seem to have missed it. Malcolm is only interested in Plath and Hughes (both of whom are more compelling, in my opinion, for the doom-filled lives they led than for their sub-canonical verse) as an unusually illustrative example of the impossibility of &quot;objective&quot; biography. Was he a cruel philanderer? Or was she a neurotic harpy? Or both? Not only don't we know, Malcolm says, we *can't* know. Her argument, presented in crisp epigrammatic prose that is its own unique pleasure, seems to me unanswerable."},{"Title":"Silent Woman","review":"Malcolm's certainly has important insights into the writing of biography. But her effort to make the biographers the villains of the piece fails because she assumes, in her title, that somehow Plath is a victim of biography, when, in fact, in so many ways Plath made herself and her work so indissoluable that she invites the biographical approach."},{"Title":"Silent Woman","review":"Despite itself, an excellent book on Sylvia Plath. Who knows the truth about the enigmatic, &quot;silent woman&quot; of the book's title? No one, perhaps, not even that woman herself, who was mixed up about the kind of poetry she wanted to write and about her destiny, even her citizenship was fluid. Although Janet Malcolm wrote this book to prick holes in biographies of Plath that seek to canonize her, she really sinks her teeth into Anne Stevenson's repellent and semi-authorized biography &quot;Bitter Fame,&quot; which on its publication was widely seen as the Hughes' camo corrective to Plath hagiography. Malcolm finds out exactly what information Olwyn Hughes was willing to share with Anne Stevenson, and which slant was verboten, and the whole shameful affair, while not the superb intellectual condemnation of biography that Malcolm thinks it is, is stimulating on nearly every page. And in the process Malcolm tracks down and interviews some important people in the Hughes/Plath saga, and even makes room for Plath's most important critic, the UK theorist Jacqueline Rose.

Were previous biographers co-opted by Ted Hughes' sister Olwyn, and were they harder on Sylvia's quirky personality than they would have been otherwise? That is the question and, to my mind, it is not answered here. Hughes' death last year makes it all more interesting; though the poems in Birthday Letters speak for himself, he no longer can. This will be a great sourcebook, in a sense, for biographers in the future, after ALL the players are gone, but at this time, for me, it raised more questions than it answerered."},{"Title":"Silent Woman","review":"THE SILENT WOMAN: SYLVIA PLATH AND TED HUGHES by Janet Malcolm is a biography through the lens of what's wrong with biography. It's fascinating to Plath fans and afficionados (me) and those who want to examine language, text and form and the barriers between whatever truth is and the outcomes of communication (me again).Malcolm is explicit in her premise: A biography had been written of Plath by Malcolm's University of Michigan cohort, Anne Stevenson (Bitter Fame), that had been controversial. Plath loyalists fulminated against Stevenson's pro-Hughes bias, and the Hughes family denounced it because they said that Stevenson had not cooperated enough. Malcolm, who looked up to the slightly older Stevenson at U of M, who is also a poet of some standing, follows the process of the Plath biography, as well as other works on the famous poet and the machinations/efforts of her former husband and Plath's literary estate executor, Hughes's sister, Olwyn. Malcolm interviews many of the participants, including Olwyn, but not Ted Hughes, and works not to find a \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\" but to understand the issues with biography that can create the problems of trying to portray another's life. In the process, she exhibits more on the life of Hughes and Plath that fascinates those who are interested in such things. She couldn't have chosen a better example/subject to use for this dissection, because their lives are compelling, and the drama around how those lives have been portrayed by others -- including the impression management on the Hughes side, which was no small matter -- seem never ending.Malcolm writes, \\"In a work of nonfiction, we almost never know the truth of what happened\\" (p 154). Malcolm faces this issue squarely and doesn't try to make a definitive statement about what did or didn't happen between Hughes and Plath, Plath and others, the Hughes estate and her various biographers. Instead she narrates her investigation, her own biases, and the flaws and quandaries that exist at every point along the way. Stevenson's troubles, the reader comes to see, may just be a strong form of the problems and doubts all biographers could -- and should? -- experience.In the end, one gets the sense that the Hughes family worked perhaps too hard to control the impression of Ted after the suicide of his up-and-coming poet wife in the early 1960s (though who could blame him after he was villified and blamed for her suicide by those who took public \\"sides\\" in their marital discord, and he stated that he was also quite worried about his children's perceptions of their mother, family and selves if there was a free-for-all regarding Plath's literary and personal legacy). Ted and Olwyn were negative even toward literary scholars who interpreted Plath's poetry in ways objectionable to them and made working with the estate for very necessary quoting rights quite difficult. As Malcolm depicts Stevenson after her book's publication and the ensuing hue and cry, her break with the Hughes family and Plath estate and her reaction to same as wilted and beaten down. The book seems as if it were a tragedy in her professional life from which she must recover because of the interpersonal drama between the author and Olwyn Hughes.Interestingly, the book also has a strong subtheme that examines the pressures, pains and stress of accomplishment by literary women born in the 40s who came of age in the 60s. (There's a brief discussion of Stevenson's marriages, and the impact her literary ambitions had on her family life.) Stevenson and Malcolm are around the same age as Plath, and this personal investment in the times and age is also fascinating from a political-gender point of view.If I had any complaint about the work, which was an expansion of a lengthy New Yorker article that was printed in the 90s, it is that it ends too suddenly. After all the activity and investigation, I wanted Malcolm to make sense of it all for me, but the book just seems to cut off after Malcolm meets a man integral to the Plath suicide narrative, her downstairs neighbor, who may have been the last to see her alive.Malcolm is a conversational and somewhat \\"confessional\\" feeling writer who is not afraid to be explict about her personal investment and lens that engages the reader and makes her feel an insider in this investigation of femininity, biography, rhetoric and one of the lightning rods of gender relations in the 20th century. I recommend it on any one of these levels."},{"Title":"Silent Woman","review":"Malcolm's characteristic interest, in all her books, is to examine the many sides in a typically academic battle regarding truth and viewpoint and show how the many people involved in the battle often shoot themselves in their feet by making self-servicing claims in their own defenses. Naturally, few things work better for this condition than the problematic of biography, and in the case of Sylvia Plath Malcolm found a humdinger of a topic.Most literate readers know about the basic facts of Plath's life--the marriage to Ted Hughes, his philandering and subsequent abandonment of her, and her suicide in 1963. On these basic signposts various biographers (and, more crucially, Plath's friends, family, and enemies during her lifetime) have hung all sorts of interpretations, to the point where a college classmate of Malcolm's, Anne Stevenson, agreed to write an unsymathetic account of Plath's life on behalf of Hughes and his sister Olwyn--and wound up devastating her own literary career by pleasing neither the Hugheses nor Plath's advocates.This is one of the most thoughtful studies of biography and its problems ever written, and shows the horrible things people can do to one another in the name of trying to &quot;set the story straight.&quot;"},{"Title":"Silent Woman","review":"Not only does Janet Malcolm peice together the life of Sylvia Plath, but her famous persona that began to grow upon her death. From Plath's suicide to publishing rights and the immediate family, the process of why things have come about as they have - and clues to where they could go- are well documented in this book as her time on Earth has been by other biographers, giving home the parts that make American myth that is known as Sylvia Plath. Although at time, Malcom is sharp, overbearing and intrusive. She makes claims without sufficient facts, and some of the peices of the story are a bit scattered about the book, making it difficult to follow at points. But she explains why her facts are not quite complete. Malcolm also sneaks in a heafty dose of poison to the biography industry as well, making an example out of Plath and her family. This book is stricly for the Plath buffs-whether they want to love or hate Malcolm for taking this project- and for those interested in the process of the biography mill in publishing today."},{"Title":"Silent Woman","review":"Part of the great appeal of Janet Malcolm's work is precisely her subjectivity. She makes no bones about being \\"objective.\\" There is no such thing as objectivity even in a New York Times article. What you get with a Malcom book is her view of the facts, and that is exactly what makes her interesting, for her view is so psychologically astute and well reasoned and just plain well-written that even if the stance she takes is contrary to yours, the story will be fascinating. The exploration of the effect of Sylvia Plath's suicide on those she left behind is what makes this book so worth reading. The universals here go way beyond who was the victim and who was the demon. I don't really care about Sylvia Plath. I don't care about Ted Hughes either. It's Malcolm who's the main character here."},{"Title":"Silent Woman","review":"Malcolm has written a great book on the difficulties of writing a good and fair biography. She uses Sylvia Plath, and specifically Anne Stevenson's Bitter Fame as her example. What you get here is an interesting book that engages the reader and at times almost reads like a novel. The book is gripping and before you know it, you've finished it. Also, Malcolm claims to be on the &quot;side&quot; of Ted Hughes, but I still think she gives a fairly balanced view of the whole situation. But, this isn't a biography of Sylvia Plath. This is a biography of a biography."},{"Title":"Silent Woman","review":"This is a remarkable book, a blend of numerous genres: biography, memoir, journalism, criticism, psychological analysis, deconstruction of other biographers and memoirists and their work, discussion of postmodernism, and more. Malcolm has an extraordinary intelligence and imagination--both expressed in her metaphors, many of them extended beyond belief. I particularly liked her metaphors for and about Olwyn Hughes, Ted Hughes's sister: \\"Cerberus to the Plath estate,\\" Anne Stevenson's unsuccessful commanding of \\"Olwyn back into the lamp,\\" Anne's obliviously walking into \\"Olwyn's web.\\" (Anne wrote what Malcolm says is a good biography of Plath that Olwyn insisted on editing and correcting as the price of permission to quote.) Malcolm has brilliant things to say about memory and memoirs, criticism, biography, the impossibility of fair-mindedness and truth, writing in general, the language of face and body that can't be captured on recordings, and footnotes. What I don't understand, although Malcolm addresses the question, is why any of the people she interviewed and wrote about gave her permission to quote them. Even the people whose sides she takes emerge scarred and bleeding from her descriptions. Surely her reputation for this proclivity preceded her with at least some of the characters in the book. On the other hand, the noted critic Harold Bloom has remarked on her \\"wonderful exuberance\\" and has stated that her books \\"transcend what they appear to be: superb reportage.\\"Of biography Malcolm says that it \\"is the medium through which the remaining secrets of the famous dead are taken from them and dumped out into full view of the world. The biographer at work, indeed, is like the professional burglar, breaking into a house . . . . The voyeurism and busybodyism that impel writers and readers of biography alike are obscured by an apparatus of scholarship designed to give the enterprise an appearance of banklike blandness and solidity.\\" And, \\"there is no length he [the biographer] will not go to, and the more his book reflects his industry the more the reader believes that he is having an elevating literary experience, rather than simply listening to backstairs gossip and reading other people's mail.\\" Similarly, \\"The reader's amazing tolerance (which he would extend to no novel written half as badly as most biographies) makes sense only when seen as a kind of collusion between him and the biographer in an excitingly forbidden undertaking: tiptoeing down the corridor together to stand in front of the bedroom door and try to peep through the keyhole.\\"She uses one of her extended metaphors to discuss the issues of writer's block and the elusiveness of truth, which I had not realized were related: \\"At the end of Borges's story 'The Aleph,' the narrator goes to the cellar of a house, where he has the experience of encountering everything in the world. He at once sees all places from all angles . . . . Writer's block derives from the mad ambition to enter the cellar; the fluent writer is content to stay in the close attic of partial expression, to say what is 'running through his mind,' and to accept that it may not--cannot--be wholly true.\\" Later, Malcolm says, \\"Truth is, in its nature, multiple and contradictory, part of the flux of history, untrappable in language.\\" She contrasts nonfiction and fiction in an interesting way: \\"In a work of nonfiction we almost never know the truth of what happened. The ideal of unmediated reporting is regularly achieved only in fiction, where the writer faithfully reports what is going on in his imagination.\\" (Of course that leaves unanswered the real question of whether that imagination captures the truth.) Finally, Malcolm relates a visit she made to the incredibly littered, filthy house of an artist and author who had written recollections about Plath. She saw the place as \\"a kind of monstrous allegory of truth\\" in its \\"unmediated actuality, in all its multiplicity, randomness, inconsistency, redundancy, authenticity.\\"In relation to the cluttered house, she writes further, \\"the narratives called biographies pale and shrink in the face of the disorderly actuality that is life. . . . Each person who sits down to write faces not a blank page but his own vastly overfilled mind. The problem is to clear out most of what is in it, . . . to make a space where a few ideas and images and feelings may be so arranged that a reader will want to linger awhile among them, rather than to flee. . . . But this task of housecleaning (of narrating) is not merely arduous; it is dangerous. There is the danger of throwing the wrong things out and keeping the wrong things in.\\"Malcolm is also insightful on post-structuralism, a viewpoint that she at least partly shares, calling it \\"a theory of criticism whose highest values are uncertainty, anxiety, and ambiguity.\\" Writing about a poststructuralist writer and professor of English literature who wrote _The Haunting of Sylvia Plath_, Malcolm says that \\"In accordance with post-structuralist theory,\\" Jacqueline \\"Rose argues for suspension of all certainty about what happened, and thus of judgment and blame.\\" Finally, she refers to \\"the post-structuralist vision of writing as a kind of dream, which no one (including the dreamer-writer) ever gets to the bottom of.\\"Of her conversation with Rose, Malcolm says, \\"I render it with the help of a tape recording, which preserved the words that passed between Rose and me but did not catch any of the language of face and body by which we all speak to one another and sometimes say what we dare not put into words.\\" This from a woman who had won a lawsuit brought against one of her books about Freudianism by a psychoanalyst; she won by playing a tape recording of her interview with him.Recommended even for people who are not specifically interested in Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes because of the book's insights into the nature of truth, memoirs,fiction, and biography."},{"Title":"Silent Woman","review":"Malcolm's book is a compelling look at the process of writing a biography, as well as an interesting biography of Plath's and Hughes's relationship in itself. By examining the motivations behind Plath biographers, friends, and enemies, Malcolm comments on the process and biases of the biography genre, most importantly, the controversial Bitter Fame. In this book, we see the Hughes's sister shut out all biographers with a negative view of Hughes. We see Plath enemy Dido Merwin write a skewed tale about a Plath/Hughes visit. We see admirers of Plath's write scathing biographies blaming Hughes for the downfall of the Plath/Hughes marriage. What Malcolm attempts to do is to look at the union in a balanced manner, while exposing the motivations of the players in the Plath drama. She succeeds whole-heartedly in this excellent book."},{"Title":"Silent Woman","review":"This book is a flat-out marvel. Malcolm is a master of compression and she manages to say more, in this relatively compact book, about marriage, poetry, genius, biography and madness than you will find in volumes and volumes of work by windier and more self-important writers. A masterpiece of nonfiction writing, one of the purest and most perfect examples of the form--and since it is by Janet Malcolm it is also, of course, utterly original."},{"Title":"Silent Woman","review":"Anyone expecting to find a balanced look at either &quot;the silent woman&quot; or &quot;Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes&quot;, will be greatly disappointed by Janet Malcolm's latest polemic. Other than revealing the obvious--that biographers can't really &quot;know the truth&quot; of their subject--the most consistent theme of this book is Malcolm's devotion to and admiration for &quot;poor&quot; Ted Hughes. My God, the way she fawns over his letter writing is enough to send one running to the bathroom.Malcolm has never been known to take a balanced approach to any of her subjects, and this is good to know as it prepares the reader for the inevitable bias that eventually appears amidst her frequently elegant prose. Malcolm has a brilliant, analytic mind, but apparently she can only write with passion when she takes sides, as she does with the Hughes family in this book. Her portrait of Sylvia Plath, what there is of it, pays tribute to what Ms. Plath wrote, but it is hard to come away from this book without feeling that Malcolm doesn't like Plath the human being. She chooses her words carefully, a mastery she has displayed in all of her books, and they have the desired effect--demonstrating that Ted Hughes was quite put upon by this disturbed, but of course talented, woman. What a load!If Ms. Malcolm were not so obviously talented, it would be easy to dismiss this as the kind of piece that could give journalists a bad name, but she is so damn clever in her portrayals that it is easy to lose sight of her agenda. This is not a companion to other Plath biographies, all of which have their own points of view to present, and their own flaws. There will probably be no &quot;final&quot; authoritative biography of Plath, who has been &quot;taken over&quot; by the Plath lovers/haters and the Hughes lovers/haters.I suggest Plath's unedited journals, now available, and most of all the poetry, as a starting point for those interested in knowing Ms. Plath. One is not likely to come away with any final answers about who Plath was, but the effort will, I think, be worth it, and will bring you much closer to understanding Plath than anything Janet Malcolm will ever write about the subject."},{"Title":"Jsp Practical Program Design","review":"The JSP in this book refers to Jackson Stuctured Programming NOT Java Server Pages! web developers take note"},{"Title":"Jsp Practical Program Design","review":"The book is a definite source of information for people who are new to JSP.

The reemergence of nationalism in Europe, the fall of many of the monarchies after World War I, and the beginnings of Fascism's rise in Italy at this time likely led Pius XI to explore the role of Christ both on earth and in heaven as a ruler of man. The encyclical talks about the duty of man of loyalty to their leaders, their king and their God. The transitions from monarchy to democracy and dictatorship - without the imprimatur of the divine right of kings or the traditions of the church - as well as the growing separation of Church and State - are discussed. An interesting prespective on the Church in a time of rapid givernmental transition, and how the focus was shifting in the church from temporal rule to more of a recognition of the role it would play in the spiritual rule of its flock - and the establishment of the Feast of Christ the King as a symbol of that shift."},{"Title":"Masterclass in Japanese Cooking","review":"This book does not qualify as a \`Master Class' in Japanese Cooking, because it has none of the hallmarks of a true master class. Two \`master class' books by teachers would be Julia Child's \`Mastering the Art of French Cooking' and Marcella Hazan's \`Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking'. Two modern \`master class' books by great American chefs would be Thomas Keller's very new \`Bouchon' and Paul Bertolli's \`Cooking By Hand'. I point out two kinds of authors for \`master class books because Ms. Kazuko's book is neither.Ms. Kazuko is not a chef. She is a Japanese journalist transplanted to the United Kingdom, where this book was written and printed. Although I am sure she is well trained in Japanese cookery, I sense she does not have the depth of knowledge as Ms. Child and Ms. Hazan. Her role in this book is that of editor or anthologist. All the true culinary writing is done by twenty (20) chefs, twelve (2) based in Japan, two (2) based in the United Kingdom, one (1) from Germany, three (3) from the United States, one (1) from Australia, and one (1) from Hong Kong. Each of these chefs has contributed one or more classic Japanese recipes in eleven different chapters. Ms. Kazuko has contributed the introduction, and chapters on the tea ceremony, the culinary regions of Japan, and \`the Japanese store cupboard'. These contributions are brief and serve no better purpose than to familiarize a non-Japanese reader with some of the highlights of Japanese culinary landscape. This is a sure giveaway that the book is far more a survey for foreigners than it is a monograph on advanced techniques. But, even as an introductory text these chapters fall short in that there are virtually no pictures of a very visual tea ceremony, no helpful map for people to whom the geography of Japan is an almost complete mystery, and no pictures accompanying almost all of the descriptions of Japanese staple foods and condiments.Most of the individual recipes appear to be in a classic Japanese style, although some have been metamorphosed by a transplantation to Hawaii or other distant lands still under the sway of Japanese culture. There are few French or Italian methods, although some classic French ingredients such as Foie gras do make an appearance. Most recipes fill a page with four sections. A brief paragraph by the editor introduces the \`master chef'. A second headnote paragraph by the chef discusses some of the finer points they feel you should know about the recipe. The list of ingredients is neatly divided into sections when the recipe has separate preparations such as sauce and main preparation. Most ingredient measurements are given in both metric and English units. When only one unit is present, it is the English unit. Most unit conversions are very good, although some may be off by as much as 20%, which is no major crime, as I have seen Patricia Wells be off by that much on occasion. A few ingredient descriptions may be a bit vague, as in the specification for \`1 salad lettuce'. This may be perfectly clear to a reader in London, but I think a Yank may be scratching their head trying to decide between iceberg, leaf lettuce, Romaine, of Boston lettuce. The irony is that the editor's headnote says the chef believes there are too many ambiguous words in classic Japanese recipes.If this were a true \`master class' book for non-Japanese, I would expect it to be divided more by technique such as knife skills, sushi, tempura, broths, and hibachi than by the traditional western chapters with tofu replacing polenta and nori and raman replacing semolina pasta. There is no discussion whatsoever about the style of knife unique to Japanese cuisine. This is odd, because whether or not they use the French or the Japanese styles of knife can generally define all the world's cuisines. This is especially odd since so much is made in western presentations of Japanese culinary practice about the great knife skills of the sushi chef.The individual recipes, I believe, are generally quite good, even though the arrangement of recipes really runs counter to a book on classic techniques. The very first recipe in the first chapter on appetizers is a sashimi recipe requiring fairly advanced knife skills about which the book says nothing. The recipe refers to the katsura-muki technique for creating thinly shaved sheets of daikon and refers to another page which provides nothing so much as a picture of what these thinly shaved sheets will look like. There is nothing on how to properly hold knife or hand or vegetable, or what knife is best to use for this technique. The chapter on stocks and soups contains not a single recipe on stocks. A book on French cuisine with such a chapter would begin with no fewer than three and as many as eight different stock recipes. It is obvious from this book that the Japanese are much closer to Italian thinking about stock than to French. Just as Italian cuisine is based on a simple brodo, Japanese cooking seems to be based almost entirely on a fish stock (dashi). Rather than giving us one recipe and using it in all soup dishes, each author gives his own dashi recipe. When Jeremiah Tower did an omnibus book cooking with many major American chefs, he provided pantry recipes for all his colleagues. But then, Jeremiah Tower is a major culinary talent.This is not a bad book but it suffers by the less than proficient writing style of editor Kazuko and her publisher's copy editing resources were a little thin in putting together this book.If you want a true class on Japanese cooking, try \`Japanese Cooking A Simple Art' by Shizuo Tsuji. I have not read the book yet, but a quick skim tells me it has everything I find missing in Ms. Kazuko's compilation."},{"Title":"Leftovers","review":"Assumes some knowledge by the reader, so best for intermediate cooks rather than beginners. Includes guides to steaming, using the microwave, freezing and dehydrating, as well as a guide to ingredients, a glossary of terms, and an index. Recipes are divided not just by category (salads, spreads, soups, etc) but also by 'top of the stove' or oven dishes.Illustrated with black and white drawings that are there more for atmosphere and charm than because they give you an idea about the finished product. Sprinkled throughout the book are other tips and suggestions for saving and using leftovers.It's a fun cookbook to read, and you will get many useful ideas for reusing leftovers, but not all of them are very frugal. This is not true for every recipe, but many of them rely on ingredients like gruyere, roquefert or gorgonzola cheeses, watercress, sorrel, vermouth and good sherry and things that are not necessarily on the shelf of every cook attempting to use up her leftovers. However, even when I cannot cook with those ingredients, I enjoy reading about them and this is a well written cookbook. I also think this cookbook would be useful to those who wish to reuse leftovers not because of their budgets, but because they feel it is ethically unacceptable to throw away good food just because one has already had it this week.In addition to cooking information, she provides tips on buying information where applicable, as well as substitutions that can be made of one leftover for another.In addition to the index in back, this useful cookbook also has mini indexes within the pages- so in the asparagus section there is a list of 9 other recipes in the book which could use asparagus and the page numbers where they are found.Here are some sample passages from the book to give you some idea of what her tips and recipes are like:Asparagus:\\"Select asparagus spears that are straight, round, firm, and with closely formed tips that show no sign of flowering. The spears should be evenly green almost to the end, and the cut stem should have a moist appearance. Asparagus should be eaten the same day they are purchased, but if this isn't possible, wrap the stem ends in a dampened terry towel before slipping the spears into a plastic bag for refrigeration....\\"(more detailed, and quite helpful, information follows for several paragraphs).Ideas for using up leftover asparagus: arrange cooked asparagus spears on a bed of lettuce. Dress with Lemon Mayonnaise thinned with a little sour cream. Garnish with pimiento strips and chopped hard-cooked eggs.Toss cooked asparagus tips, sliced raw mushrooms rubbed with fresh lemon juice and low-fat cottage cheese into a green salad.Make a quiche with diagonally sliced cooked asparagus and julienned cooked veal sprinkled with fresh lemon juice, seasonings as desired and grated Gouda cheese. ...Saute minced shallots in butter until soft. Toss in cooked asparagus tips, freshly grated Parmesan cheese and minced fresh parsley. Use as a filling for omelets. Top with sour cream.Beets: \\"Do not be attracted to the large beet class at the market, for they can be quite woody. Select the smallest beets possible with fresh-looking, evenly colored greens, if they are sold with the tops intact. The beet root itself should be firm and without wrinkles. Store in the refrigerator in a plastic bag up to seven days. It is important never to cut into the flesh of the beet until it is cooked, for the beet will bleed as it is boiled and lose much of its distinctive coloring and flavor....Ideas for beets:Hollow out tiny cooked beets, fill with any sandwich salad spread and serve as an hors d'oeuvre or as a salad accompaniment.Dice cooked beets and add to grain soupsShred cooked beets, combine with shredded onion and apple and heat together gentlyJulienne or slice cooked beets and use as a salad garnishOther recipes for beets include one for a mixed vegetable salad, additions to potato salad, and a vegetable salad suggestion.Recipes for leftover beef include:beef rolls, busecca, cornbread pie, corned beef hash, patties, and a corned beef-potato casserole, crepe and pasta filings, marinated beef salad, meatloaf, a tongue salad, and tongue tortillas with refried beans.&lt;a target=\\"_blank\\" href=\\"http://www.amazon.com/More-Less-Cookbook-World-Community/dp/083619263X?ie=UTF8&tag;=cmasonideas-20&link;_code=btl&camp;=213689&creative;=392969\\">More-With-Less Cookbook (World Community Cookbook)&lt;/a> has more practical, frugal, down to earth, home cooking ideas for using leftovers at the end of each chapter in a section called 'Gather up the fragments.\\" But this cookbook has both some pratcial, affordable ideas as well as some delicious suggestions I don't think you'll find elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Canning Season (National Book Award for Young People's Literature (Awards))","review":"When Ratchet's neglectful mother ships her off to her great aunts' house for the summer, she isn't sure what to expect. Especially when the great aunts, PenPen and Tilly, are twins who haven't gone farther than the post office from their mansion in the boonies of Maine since they were teenagers.When Harper, an obnoxious but lovable teen, is accidentally dropped off because her guardian thought their house was an orphanage, yet another humorous and heart warming twist.Rich with dry humour and sparkling wit, full of eccentric characters, The Canning Season will make you laugh out loud, or chuckle quietly to yourself at the absurdity of the situations in the book. The characters take silly things completely seriously and the combination of events throughout the course of the novel are guaranteed to make you smile.Don't be turned off by the childish looking cover. This is a hilarious novel that everyone will enjoy, from old ladies just like PenPen and Tilly to their teenage grandchildren."},{"Title":"The Canning Season (National Book Award for Young People's Literature (Awards))","review":"I loved Polly Horvath's newest novel The Canning Season. For the short-attention-span reader, Horvath may be a bit too thoughtful,a bit too cerebral, but for those of us who love a creative inventive writer whose words and images are always wholly original and surprising, this is a great book.Pen-Pen and Tilly are characters in the best Roald Dahl sense, carved a bit from reality and even more from fantasy. Still, I find a bit of many people in both of Ratchet's lovable aunts and am grateful that in a time when many kids have nowhere to turn, the aunts seem to be there for all of us.And Ratchet! How can anyone not love and admire a girl so sturdy she can withstand the winds of a horrendous mother and still have some affection for her. Polly Horvath knows that kids are stronger and more resilient than we give them credit for being, and they can weather crises without teams of people intervening.I had great fun reading The Canning Season and am having an even better time remembering it. That, it seems to me, is the true test of a great book."},{"Title":"The Canning Season (National Book Award for Young People's Literature (Awards))","review":"After reading this book from the library - I turn here to buy it and thought I would check out the ratings.....for me it was 5 star all the way...no sugar coating here but a warm and straight forward tale - one that I am more then willing to pass along to my daughter and maybe if I can twist my sons arm - him as well. A few \\"F-bombs\\" aside (which they use maybe 2 times in almost 200 pages - believe me even though this isn't a word that we use - I have heard it and worse from the kids at the school where my children attend in their fine up-scale middle/upper class neighborhood), Why would I want to hide such a wonderful story about life from my children? As a parent I don't own rosy colored glasses nor would I put them on my children....as a parent we try to protect our children but I am not keeping my children in a box - what happens when they turn 18 and are no longer in the boxes we put them in? Who is there to shelter them then?This is a story filled with warmth and humor and truth about realtionships that we have no control over. It's about change ( even thought for 72 years nothing had changed - when those two girls hit the house things changed) and love and finding happiness in who you are....\\"Penpen said that Tilly lived the way she had chosen, in the woods, uncluttered and undisturbed and that we have to love people as they are, free from what what we want them to be...\\"Two ladies live in a way that makes them happy and give two teenage girls a home, stability and love - something that neither have had in any great supply.

'What good does it do you? It seems to me, from what you've been telling us, that everyone these days knows everything about everyone and the split second it happens, too. What do they do with all this information? What does it get them? It just clutters up their peaceful quiet time. It seems to me from what you've been describing, nobody has peaceful quiet time anymore. Television, bah! Radio, bah! Newspapers, magazines, bah, bah! Sounds like the world is running off half-cocked, people getting zapped with their little hits of information. Needing it every day. Zap, zap, zap. Well, deliver me. Contagious. Like hoof-and-mouth disease. I hope you're not contaminated. Don't go trekking it all over our property.'\\" 'Very funny,' said Mr. Feebles. 'You're a queer couple of ladies, is what you are.'\\" 'Yes, yes,' said Tilly, 'those queer Menuto women. I know all about it. Now, you drive gently on those rutted roads and don't go breaking those blueberry jars.' \\"Changes just keep creeping up on us.\\"And Penpen's eyes welled up as she realized that Tilly was no longer a young girl, as if seeing her white kinked hair and wrinkles and suddenly realizing what they meant. That old age had come and what had seemed like an interesting diversion--the first few gray hairs, the stooping body--wasn't just a pleasant novelty. They weren't going back; they weren't ever going back. Their youth, their youth, was gone. It was as if, unwitnessed, out here, safe in the woods, they should have been out of time as well. If no one had seen their passing, they shouldn't have passed. She wondered if Tilly, lying upstairs alone, was suddenly as aware of it as she was.\\"THE CANNING SEASON is a complex dichotomy of age and youth, of selfish and nurturing adults, of world-shrinking technology and isolation, and of two teenage girls, Rachet and Harper, who are fortunate enough to land on the doorstep of \\"those queer Menuto women.\\" What is so fascinating is seeing how Penpen and Tilly--twin nonagenarians--share a renaissance, despite their failing health, while the two teenage girls come of age in the unusual household, the old mansion on an isolated coast in Maine where Tilly and Penpen have spent their entire lives. Aside from the story's motherhood theme, the book is nonjudgmental in its approach to human existence and different lifestyles.\\"Penpen said that living things were all critical mass, the definition of critical mass being the amount of fissionable material required to sustain a chain reaction. She tossed some weeds on the compost and said that people didn't like to see things rotting in the garden but there had to be all things to be growth. She told Rachet this over and over, and the things that someone repeats to you over and over you tend to remember.\\"Rachet, the first adolescent character we meet in the story, is a rather passive girl who has been long neglected by the mother who ships her off to Maine for the summer. She needs to grow. One of Rachet's catalysts for growth is the blunt, computer-saavy Harper, who also shows up at the end of that rutted, bear-plagued road. Harper, who has been rejected--first by her mother and then by a mother-figure--is a real piece of work:\\" 'I can't eat these raspberries, they're moldy,' Harper said loudly, picking them off and putting them on the tablecloth.\\" 'Please use a saucer,' said Penpen. 'You'll stain dear Mother's tablecloth.'\\" 'I thought dear Mother stained her own tablecloth,' said Harper sourly, because Tilly had told her part of the story.\\" 'Not this one,' said Penpen.\\"Rachet breathed a sigh of relief and began to pick off her own moldy ones. She had been worrying quite a bit that they might make her sick. She didn't think they would kill her unless she was allergic to penicillin, which as far as she knew she was not, but she didn't like the idea of them whizzing around her system, and although in the end she had suffered no ill effects, she was glad she no longer had to shovel them down. This was the good thing about Harper. She did things which at first seemed unbelievably rude and obnoxious but which you secretly wished you could do yourself. Her remarks were less offensive once they realized that she was simply determined to speak the truth and be done with it. There didn't seem to be any hidden corners in Harper's soul, and she wasn't interested in allowing other people theirs. Often, as in the case of the raspberries, this alleviated delicate problems.\\"It is wonderful how the elderly characters act in a manner that young adults can totally relate to: Penpen trying on Zen philosophy and having a schoolgirl crush on Dr. Richardson; Tilly's self-absorption that often leaves everyone waiting all day for a meal. As a forty-eight year-old who identifies with being part of the younger generation, I can similarly identify with that shock of Penpen's in discovering that old age has arrived.THE CANNING SEASON moves back and forth freely between Tilly and Penpen's younger years and the present. It hosts a series of hilarious, bizarre and horrific incidents and circumstances that keep readers (heads) rolling and wondering what will happen next. But for me, the multigenerational aspects to the story are what make this a uniquely exceptional tale with so much to ponder and discuss."},{"Title":"The Canning Season (National Book Award for Young People's Literature (Awards))","review":"My 9 year-old and I read this book together. It is wonderful, touching, funny, and fairly sophisticated. I must warn you that if you are upset by curse words and unplanned pregnancy, then this book will upset you.

I loved this book, but I would not have purchased it if I had known in advance that it had the grandaddy of all the swear words in it, not once, but twice. The story is great, Horvath makes you care about the very realistic characters, but....it's just not appropriate for K-6. I bought it because of the awards it won and on Peggy Sharp's recommendation, and also because I really enjoy Horvath's The Trolls and Everything on a Waffle.

I will be recomending it often."},{"Title":"The Canning Season (National Book Award for Young People's Literature (Awards))","review":"It seems to me that you need to be a very specific kind of person to enjoy Polly Horvath books. Now I'll admit right from the get-go that \\"Everything On a Waffle\\" did nothing for me and that such negative opinions of that book are usually in the strict minority. Still, I thought my dislike of \\"Waffle\\" was a fluke. Just one of those things that happens when you read a wide variety of children's books. After all, I didn't like \\"From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler\\" either, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the author E.L. Konigsburg's enjoyable \\"The View From Saturday\\". So I went into \\"The Canning Season\\" prepared to like it. To my chagrin, what I found was a tale that combines the worst aspects of Horvath's writing with an underlying thread of nastiness. This is an interesting book. Just not a good one.Meet Ratchet. If she had her way you'd probably not notice her too much. The only companion of her domineering mother, Ratchet is a shy unassuming young teen. Born with a hideous birth defect (never really described but often alluded to as merely \\"That Thing\\"), Ratchet one day finds herself summarily sent off to live with her mother's relatives Aunt Tilly and Aunt Penpen. These women live deep in the Maine woods and are roughly 90 years of age but feisty to the last. After settling in with the women and hearing their strange harrowing stories Ratchet just begins to relax when a pregnant woman and her young teenaged ward Harper arrive on the front porch. Then things start to get a little crazy.The book has all the elements you would want in a tale of eccentrics. Crazy old ladies who like to talk about how their mother chopped off her own head. A silent girl with a horrid deformity. Another girl with too much bravado and too little tact. Plus there are crazy bears in the woods who'll eat anyone that gets near them! Whee! But Horvath seems to want to write a different kind of story. It's as if she said to herself, \\"I don't want a touching \`Northern Exposure' tale of delightful eccentrics here. I want something a little odder and wilder. Something the kids reading this book won't be expecting\\". As a result the book is difficult to characterize. I was a little shocked to find it in the children's section of my local library. I mean, the cover looks cutesy and cartoony enough, sure. But then you start running into talk of how Ratchet's mother would pretend she was throwing bits of Ratchet's placenta at the workers fixing pipes in her hospital room (it was really red jello, which is funny in a sick twisted way), a description of Tilly that says she, \\"looked like a sphincter\\", and a section in which the old women reminisce about a tutor they had that referred to them as the little f***s. Now I'm 26 years of age and there's not a word or phrase you can throw at me that I haven't heard used one way or another. But I have to admit I was just the teensiest bit shocked by these, and other passages. I mean, some of them are funny. Flying placentas. Hee hee. But what on earth is all this stuff doing in a kid's book? Is Horvath trying to shake the kiddies out of their complacency? Is she relying on shock value to keep their attention? Surely good writing should be able to do that on its own, right? Well, after reading the rest of this book... probably not.You see, aside from this teen novel being packaged in a childlike manner, the story is just plain mean. I appreciate that Horvath didn't want to write another \\"Ruby Holler\\" and that's fine. But even characters that care about one another in this tale are just doggone nasty (I keep using that word, but it really does describe the book the best for me). I mean, there's no lighthearted undercurrent to this tale. The jokes, while occasionally funny, are biting and contain a sneer. Altogether, I found there wasn't a person in this story I really cared about or wanted to know more of later on down the road. If Horvath had stopped writing this tale at the bottom of page 78 rather than at page 196 I couldn't have cared less. Oh, and there's some odd wrapping up that goes on at the end of this book that ties up all the storylines and motivations with a neat little bow, but that's just so odd in the context of the story itself that it feels extraordinarily fake.So I didn't like it, no. Not really. Funny, since it won the 2004 National Book Award and has garnered praise hither and thither. Thither and yon. I can't join my voice to that chorus of congratulations, I'm afraid. The book is, as I said, definitely full of life and character. Horvath is certainly an able writer in terms of great sentences like, \\"It was like putting your hand on the heart of the earth. It was like putting your hand on your own heart\\". That's what makes her terrible book all the worse. You KNOW this could have been an excellent story. You know that if she'd just toned down the edginess and tried to be a little less cool it could have been worthwhile reading. Instead, it's a vile bile-filled book that drips with contempt and cruelty. I hate to say it, but if you want a book about kids living with elderly caretakers in the woods you're better off sticking with Sharon Creech's, \\"Ruby Holler\\". At least Creech knows how to use the talent she has."},{"Title":"The Canning Season (National Book Award for Young People's Literature (Awards))","review":"I have to agree with the person who spoke of the profanity.

There are parts of this books that are quite lovely, and the way that the characters form a family is quite touching. There are also parts that are startling and don't quite jive. There are issues that are never explained either, which was unsatisfying.You should know that the f word appears twice, which really caught me off guard. I was startled and I felt the letters jump off the page. An adult is calling these sisters little 'f's. I am not overly conservative, nor do I heavily edit my daughters' reading selections, but there was something entirely unnecessary about the use of this language. This story has many dark moments and is clearly intended for an older reader, 11-12 and up. However, based on this author's other books, one might not be prepared for decapitation and suicide to be topics that are covered.I am going to stick this on the bottom of the library book pile.

Ideally, this coming-of-age tale should captivate readers, yet it left me feeling as if I had missed the boat.Horvath tries hard to create quirky characters and memorable events that express the story vividly to the reader. Unfortunately, she tries much TOO hard, and the characterizations, wacky circumstances and bizarre dialogue weigh the story down...the plot loses steam about halfway through and never recovers.Reading The Canning Season will make you feel like the author is keeping secrets from you. This is suspenseful at first, then anticlimactic, as you realize the book's secrets and outcomes aren't really that exciting.Horvath's best move in this book is placing readers convincingly inside the psyche of a young girl. It's a shame that so many other elements of the story don't measure up. I managed to finish it because of my adult patience and diligence, but I doubt a younger reader would be enticed to read even halfway through. It's just too weird, with no payoff to readers for enduring all the quirkiness!"},{"Title":"The Canning Season (National Book Award for Young People's Literature (Awards))","review":"Ratchet suddenly finds herself cooped up in a house with two spinster aunts for the summer, unable to reach the outside world, unless someone calls, she learns to drive, or, worse, she walks out in the forest. But as the summer dwindles away, Ratchet bonds with her \\"Aunts\\" and a girl who we may as well call an orphan, Harper. The surrounding colorful characters make the book an interesting read. There are, I believe, two major swear words. Oh, and Tilly and Penpen(Ratchet's Aunts) may die at anytime.Polly Horvath does it again with this creative storyline.

Horvath has done it again, spinning a tale that sometimes challenges the beliefs of the literal-minded reader but satisfying to the reader willing to take a leap of faith in pursuit of larger truths. As in most of the Horvath books, the children are often wiser than the adults, and that has to be satisfying to the reading age group! It's a page-turner, full of compassion for those with any kind of handicap, real or imagined, and a tribute to the triumphant spirit.And, it goes without saying, it's funny and entertaining about serious matters.

Why, in short, does everyone love a rose, and what has it to offer that other flowers lack?\\" ~ Graham Stuart Thomas ~Author Wayne Winterrowd asked thirty-two of his fellow rose aficionados and renowned contemporary garden writers the above question and came up with this wonderful book, \\"Roses, A Celebration\\" a collection of personal essays from the contributors. Winterrowd started gardening at the early age of four. He now devotes his time to gardening and writing about gardens after a long-time teaching career in English literature.For the stunning artwork, Winterrowd collaborated with a fine artist and botanical painter, Pamela Stagg, who won the 1991 Royal Horticultural Society Gold Medal, the world's top prize for botanical painting. Stagg did an arty job in painting thirty-two varieties of roses in eye-catching and vibrant watercolors that readers would find utterly beautiful at first sight. Some of the varieties of roses to behold include \\"Mr. Lincoln,\\" \\"The Fairy,\\" \\"Variegata di Bologna,\\" \\"Graham Thomas,\\" \\"Bonica,\\" \\"New Dawn,\\" \\"Peace,\\" \\"Old Blush,\\" \\"Rosette\\" and \\"Richardii.\\"\\"A rose is a rose is a rose\\" ~ Gertrude Stein ~Each essay is interestingly presented with a fascinating historical information and a personal account from each contributor as they celebrate their love, passion and admiration for a rose, a flower which Winterrowd described as one that has been \\"treasured since prehistory and that is reinvented in every generation.\\"\\"Oh, no man knowsThrough what wild centuriesRoves back the rose\\" ~ Walter De La Mare ~I highly recommend this book to all passionate rosarians for all its informational contents and not to mention the charming works of art.

Just don't expect another absurdist, postmodern, depressing read, because you won't find it here...thankfully."},{"Title":"THE PEACEABLE KINGDOM","review":"I received this book unsolicited from a book club during the seventies. The way in which the author presents the struggles of these early Quakers with themselves and the world in which they lived left me with a stronger sense of individual values and the importance of our individual commitment to our own.

There are two sequels which are interesting but lesser works."},{"Title":"THE PEACEABLE KINGDOM","review":"Anyone at all interested or intrigued by the Quaker witness to Christianity will find deHartog's adventure to be both exciting and contemplative.

The print is large, arranged in simple sentences, and stresses information likely to appeal to a child's sense of wonder. It is well designed with plenty of beautiful photographs. The book also contains a very good index and a section entitled, &quot;Words You Should Know,&quot; which assists a reader in understanding the use of difficult or exotic sounding words used in the text.This book is excellent as the author balances the old ways of the Hopi with the new while delving into the mystic world of Kachinas, Kivas, and Sipapus. She imparts this information without overwhelming a young reader. The author doesn't mention the clash of cultures caused by the Hopi and Navajo contesting for decades over the same land nor the fact these tribes aren't particularly friendly toward one another. However, that information should wait until a child develops sufficient maturity to understand the rivalry between the two tribes.This book is a welcome addition to a young person's library. They can be entertained, educated about Southwestern Indian culture, and introduced to ancient Americans who practice another way of life.

Yet he was an enthusiast for his subject, so there are many signs of a good book trying to get out.Nevertheless, is it more than irritating, in a book about hunting plants, to read a page or two, sometimes more, about a plant hunter without a hint of what plants he found. (No women plant hunters allowed.)This is definitely a book about the hunters and not the hunted. Hair's breadth escapes or failures to escape dominate the anecdotes. A great many plant hunters died in the field, typically falling off cliffs, but there were other ways. More than a couple were chopped up by Buddhist monks.Rather more about rather fewer hunters would have made for a better book. When Whittle does give a subject some elbow room, as he does with his nominee for greatest of all collectors, David Douglas, it still is not enough. About the only subject who gets just about the right amount of space (seven pages) is Nathanial Ward, who devised the Wardian case, although he was not a plant hunter himself but a GP in the East End of London.This is an insubstantial work, suitable for idling away a few hours in the late winter when the seed catalogs have become dog-eared.It hardly seems to have earned a place in Horticulture magazine's Garden Classics, and the edition I have is anything but a classic. Reprinted, complete with howlers, from the plates of the 1970 edition, it includes two pages of acknowledgments for permission to reprint illustrations but not the illustrations themselves.If you are going to spend the time it takes to read this book, turn hunter yourself and find the original Chilton edition and give the Lyons & Burford/Horticulture paperback reprint a miss."},{"Title":"The Plant Hunters: Tales of the Botanist-Explorers Who Enriched Our Gardens (Horticulture Garden Classic)","review":"This book is in a way the &quot;Laertus&quot; of botanical explorers, full of information and gossip, descriptions of the historical periods in which the explorations took place, and the technologies and economics driving the field forward.

Then Fall Jesus!","review":"Perhaps its a human weakness to grasp part of a complex truth and hasten to far-reaching conclusions. Gary Courtney provides one such summation. \\"JC's passion is essentially Caesar's fate in Judaic disguise, coincidentally grafted onto the dying/resurrcting cult of Attis.\\" Is he right? Of course - up to a point.An investigation of gospel origins is a special challenge. In searching for finite currents of explanation in the vast ocean of information one longs for a solution which brings the whole multi-layered brew into manageable focus. But before the researcher can even start he is necessarily involved in wading through a swamp of faith-based apologetics and special pleading. Courtney handles that task well but it does take up half of a slim volume.The betrayal and murder of Caesar bears uncanny parallels to the drama of JC. A religious play - a fabula praetexta - quite probably commemorated the death and apotheosis of the man who would be king. The Caesar cult surely did breath new life into ancient cults of dying/resurrecting godmen. Quite plausibly the Jewish fans of Caesar assimilated the sacrificed 'saviour of mankind' into the 'Suffering Servant' of Isaiah, and rolled the melodrama of the Ides of March into the Passion of the Passover. The gospels, with their curious rhetorical elements, 'comings and goings', and theatrical flourishes, most assuredly read like a play and not history. There's more than coincidence here and we long for these insights to be developed fully.But pause. Homeric epics, Buddhist sutras, Gnostic speculations, psychoactive drugs, Egyptian priestcraft, 200 years of Roman imperial politics? We can't dismiss other insights that lightly. Courtney makes a valuable contribution but we haven't charted the ocean - yet."},{"Title":"Et tu, Judas?

Fawcett worked full time with John and Yoko running their office, organizing their daily schedule, and cataloging their writings and films (\`Introduction'). Lennon had a complex and varying character (pp.10-11).\`Part One - The Man' tells how his life when he met John Lennon. It tells about \\"The Acorn Event\\", a project called \\"art\\".

John was \\"dropping acid almost constantly\\" (p.43). Did the events in \\"The Peace Politician\\" have any effect?There were big problems in mismanagement at Apple (p.81). These money problems led to the end of the Beatles (p.89). \\"The Dream Is Over\\" tells about John's feelings. The Lennon's moved to New York in 1971 and lived in the West Village (p.119). But President Nixon personally ordered him kicked out of America (p.124). In 1976 John became a permanent resident of the US (p.149).\`Part Two - The Magic' tells about John as a musician, poet, and painter. The author is a fan of John Lennon. Others will not find it worth their time to read this book. It presents John as a deeply troubled individual, probably due to his use of drugs. Whiskey did the same job on other singers. In December 1980 a national monthly magazine printed an interview with John Lennon. They quoted him as going around Manhattan without a bodyguard.

However, in the end, only three of the authors are from South America.Perhaps I'd hoped for a more activist approach, or at least, a ground-based examination of current environmental practices and potential strategies. Instead, this is a scholarly book which sticks its nose in the pages of future academic research and does not appear to be looking up.

It inspired many such stories, and was filmed four times. It may have appealed to the growing interest in Continental politics and the future effect on Britain.Rudolf Rassendyll is a 29 year old bachelor gentleman with red hair and a nose that is unusual for his family, but comes from the Elphburg side (the royal house of Ruritania). This came from an 18th century scandal. Rudolf had been to a German university, and spoke French as well as his English. He then decides to visit Ruritania for the Coronation! Rudolf stops at Zenda rather than the crowded capital of Strelsau, and stays at a small inn. There is a conflict between Prince Rudolf and his half-brother Duke Michael. When walking through the woods, Rassendyll meets Prince Rudolf. But a problem arises that will prevent Prince Rudolf from appearing at his Coronation that day. Colonel Sapt thinks of a solution: Rassendyll will double for the Prince at the Coronation! We learn that the poverty-stricken people of Old Town favor Duke Michael. The Coronation succeeds with no one suspecting a double. But when Rassendyll leaves to return to England a new problem arises. Rassendyll must continue to act as the King of Ruritania.The story tell show Rassendyll, Sapt, and the others succeed in rescuing Prince Rudolf from captivity, and restore him to the throne and marriage with his cousin Princess Flavia (also of the Blood Royal). Duty triumphs over love, Flavia will stay and Rassendyll will go, never to return. [Is this story a simplified version of \\"The Man in the Iron Mask?] It recalls pre-WW I Europe when no passports were needed to travel freely. This swashbuckling tale of adventure is well suited to a film where there is more action that talk. The limited number of characters would keep costs down.The book \\"Royal Babylon\\" by Karl Shaw tells the uncensored history of European royalty, not the bowdlerized version in this novel. The earlier reference to a position in the Diplomatic Corps suggests Rassendyll may have joined the British Secret Service and been assigned to work on the Ruritanian succession. His job is to eliminate Michael from the throne (the masses liked him) and ensure Rudolf's succession (a weak man given to drink, and controllable by his British friends). There was no mention of Ruritania's importance as an ally or commercial partner to Britain."},{"Title":"If Football's a Religion, Why Don't We Have a Prayer?: Philadelphia, Its Faithful, and the Eternal Quest for Sports Salvation","review":"There are certain sports teams that come to mind as having a set of fans that transcendeth all understanding.

At one of my first games at the Vet when I was only 7 years old or so there was an old man two rows up on the end wearing a Dallas jersey just sitting there. I don't even remember him cheering for Dallas or anything, then a group of 4 drunk Eagles fans walking down to their seats saw him and beat the crap out of him. After a good 15 seconds of them beating him while he was down they ran off before security got to them. My dad then told me that Philly was Philly and to be careful if you have the wrong colors.

Born in Paris is 1694, he was well educated by the Jesuits, studying law prior to turning to writing as a profession. His lampoons and satires won him fame and infamy; he was imprisoned and exiled at various times for his writing. He was forced into exile from France to England; later, he was invited to work for Frederick the Great in Berlin (politics and his reputation blew rapidly in the ever-changing winds of Europe). Voltaire wrote 'Candide' shortly after this period, when he had moved to Geneva. In 1778, the year of his death, he returned to Paris, a triumphant celebrity -- many of his ideas served to strengthen the movements that would eventually culminate in the French Revolution.The story of 'Candide', the primary character in the Voltaire's novel, is the story of the search for answers. It is hard to classify 'Candide' solely as a political satire, or indeed in any other genre where it might find similarities. Voltaire explores religious and theological ideas, social and political situations, personal and intellectual issues, and the general strand of history. How could an omnipotent and benevolent God permit the world to be as it is? How can human beings, supposedly rational beings, treat each other as they do? How can rational beings act, feel and believe so irrationally?The Enlightenment brought the ideas of Deism forward as important, and began to explore in earnest intellectual and political freedoms for people. The acquisition of knowledge, both pure theory and experiential/applied, was of high value. Candide was a student more than anything else, although in the course of the story, he holds many roles. Others who appear include Pangloss, the know-it-all philosophy teacher; Cunegonde, Candide's on-again, off-again love interest (who has her own set of adventures reported); Martin, another scholar (this one rather hopeless, in more ways than one); various other characters including Jewish merchants, Grand Inquisitors (the Enlightenment equivalent of Monty Python's Spanish Inquisition), and other bit players.Candide travels all across Europe, from Westphalia through the Latin countries, ending up finally in Constantinople. No stone is unturned to expose the foibles of the locals, the problems of the travelers, and questionable underside of all society as they move from place to place, culture to culture, and crisis to crisis. Ultimately, the plot is not as important as the characters and characterisations -- for a book written in the 1700s, it is remarkably modern, hinting at sexual innuendo (including homosexuality) among royals and clergy, making fun of the military mindset and leadership (the king of the Bulgars is modeled upon Frederick the Great, and the Bulgar army is the Prussian army) and the church (the pope here has an illegitmate daughter, etc.).The key satire, however, is against Leibniz, philosopher and mathematician, very intelligent but obviously not in directions Voltaire cared for. Leibniz had a directional metaphysics and historical sense -- this was the best of all possible worlds (the most famous phrase from the novel, put in Pangloss' mouth); the amiable but not-swift-on-the-uptake Pangloss is the stand-in for Leibniz.Norton's Critical Edition includes several essays, in addition to the text of Voltaire's 'Candide' -- the novel itself is a mere 77 pages, translated by Robert Adams of UCLA. There are several background pieces, including a general survey of the intellectual background, philosophical explanations, and a brief biography of Voltaire.Essays on criticism include discussion of Voltaire's narrative art, the ideas of pessimism and providence (it is worth remember here that Voltaire's purpose in writing 'Candide' was as a critique against optimism, of a sort), and various controversies. This is truly a fascinating collection, with pieces by such heavyweights in literary history as William Blake and Heinrich Heine giving their impressions on Voltaire and the issues addressed in 'Candide'. Gustave Flaubert and Anatole France give reflections on Voltaire's humanity; Victor Hugo discusses his greatness.As Adams says, it is a surprise to find that 'Candide', a classic, is nonetheless funny. However, that is because it is so readily identifiable -- many heroes in modern stories are re-worked Candides of one sort or another; it is an Enlightenment Everyman, and we live in a period still heavily invested in and self-identified with Enlightenment ideas.This is obviously the best of all possible Norton Critical Editions of Voltaire's 'Candide' from Adams."},{"Title":"Candide: Or, Optimism (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"The Easton Press edition has a publisher's preface and an introduction by Paul Morand. The introduction gives you a complete plot synopsis which by no means spoils the tale. This edition also contains both colored and black and white illustrations, some containing nudity to bring out the sexual innuendos of the story. Voltaire didn't want his work to be illustrated. This tale has influenced writers throughout the ages. I couldn't help think of Woody Allen's film \\"Love and Death\\" when reading this book. Candide is the main character. He sees many hardships in his travels but maintains that all is for the best as taught to him by Pangloss. Pangloss represents the prevailing philosophy of his age, known as Leibnizian optimism which appears to come from the book of Job. No matter what evil or destruction befalls man, it is all for the best as the great sovereign of the universe (God for some folk) watches over us and guides us according to his plan. Candide sees the horrors of his age, including the great earthquake of Lisbon and questions such philosophy. Voltaire was of the deist school which claims God does not watch over us, which comes out at the end of the tale in a metaphor about kings caring for rats on a sailing vessel. That same Leibnizian philosophy is used by religious folk today who proclaim, \\"It's all good.\\" Pangloss proclaims, \\"for private misfortunes are for the public good.\\"The character of Martin, who travels with Candide is the pessimist. He is the philosophical opposite of Pangloss. Cun&eacute;gonde is the love of Candide's life. His life revolves much around his passion for her, although she is constantly the mistress of someone else. Three of the main characters in this story die, only to be revived later in a South Park, OMG they killed Kenny moment...only next week he is alive. Much of this was satire of the writings of his era, including a fast paced action plot which jumped around as if he wrote it drunk in one night. Historians claim Voltaire actually worked on this book for over a year in order to write this haphazardly and after it was published he rewrote some of it, especially chapter 22 which has grown. The Easton Press edition has some minor foot notes for historical references, although I thought it could use a few more as it was clear Voltaire was satirizing specific works and authors of his age.As a Frenchman, the Germans, English, and Spanish are shown in a bad light as is the Catholic church. Also governments are not on Voltaire's good list either as Candide dines with six deposed historical monarchs in Venice. Ahmed III, Ivan VI of Russia, Charles Edward Stuart, Augustus III of Poland, Stanis'aw Leszczy'ski,and Theodore of Corsica.The book is a fairly easy read and is translated into modern English with a few foreign phrases untranslated. And if you don't read it, then that's all good too."},{"Title":"Candide: Or, Optimism (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"I decided to read this after readingCatherine the Great: Love, Sex, and Powerand learning that Catherine the Great had a long and intimate pen pal relationship with Voltaire. As the French Revolution progressed, she regretted this friendship noting that philosophers and writers like Voltaire posed too great a threat to the monarchy.You can see how Voltaire's mockery of the established order would resonate in 18th century Europe. Interestingly, he mocks not only the privilege of power, but also the risky business of being a king, with a long list of assassinated and otherwise deposed monarchs.While it's a piece for its time, its truths hold true today. The developed world no longer has kings and slaves, but a pecking order is still in place and wars and conscriptions continue. There are still and will always be con men, sycophants, schemers, hypocrites and misogynists.Not much satire survives a year, let alone a quarter millennium, but this one clearly does."},{"Title":"Candide: Or, Optimism (The Collector's library of the world's best-loved books)","review":"This book was just what i needed for my class that required this it. thank you for this great book."},{"Title":"New Orleans: Elegance and Decadence","review":"New Orleans is known as a Literary City, with many good writers, and this author is certainly one of them.

Although he is well known for his Sherlock Holmes stories, Doyle was most proud of creating the noble knight, Sir Nigel Loring of the White Company.This book is set in the tumultuous days of the 14th century, when the political struggles among England, France and Spain, and the Crusades in the Holy Land, created instablity for peasant and noble alike. There are many heroes in the tale of knights and battles, but young Alleyne Edricson is the main protagonist. Sheltered in an abbey, where the orphaned lad was educated per his noble father's wishes, Alleyne is unwillingly shoved into the world for a period of a year, where he must decide whether he wishes to make his way there or return to a monastic life.It doesn't take long for Alleyne to meet with adventure. He is shocked to find the world is a rough and tumble place. But his straightforward and naive approach to life helps him out of some scrapes and endears him to some colorful characters who become his bosom companions. Together, they join the service of Sir Nigel, who is an unlikely hero with his bald head, bad eyesight and scrawny stature. That is, until he is able to prove himself in \\"some small feat of arms,\\" which is his favorite pastime. He is always victorious in these exhibitions of his knightly prowess, and he always has a kind word for the vanquished, his noble opponent. His motivation is always to defend the honor of his \\"lovely\\" wife, for whom he cherishes the greatest tenderness, although others wonder if this is due to his poor vision rather than any attractiveness on his lady's part.There are many satisfying battles and cliffhangers in this book. Sir Nigel plunges headlong into any opportunity for a fight. Alleyne becomes his squire and follows him to France, to fight for their Prince, Edward III, who wants to restore the vanquished king of Spain. Alleyne becomes adept at sword fighting and exhibits as much bravery as his lord. He is also motivated by the love of a lady, Sir Nigel's lovely daughter, Maude.I read this book aloud to my children, and we shared many moments of laughter as we followed the warriors from England to France. I struggled a bit with the French pronunciation of names and places (how do you pronounce \\"Blois\\"?), but it was a very funny and exciting book, and I'm glad we were able to read it together. Doyle was an expert on this time period as his mother read him many chivalric tales as a boy, exciting his interest in medieval times, which continued into his adulthood. The descriptions of weaponry, customs, religious life, clothing, historical events and geography permeate the story without detracting from it. There are numerous stirring and gory events (including pirates, hangings, peasant uprisings and decapitations...yuck), which will have readers on the edge of their seats. Of course, the illustrations by N.C. Wyeth added to our enjoyment.There is another book about Sir Nigel, a prequel to The White Company, called Sir Nigel, which we will have to read soon. He has become one of our favorite literary characters."},{"Title":"The White Company (Modern author's library)","review":"I can't remember how I happened on this book- probably Amazon herded me to it- but I'm quite glad. I'm more of a fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories, but I found this as enjoyable as The Black Arrow or Robin Hood or any other medieval book that I've read, and I'd never even heard of it before. The protagonist is a young man raised at the monastery who joins a band of rough but good hearted archers and follows their exploits as they head to war in France and Spain. The old agnostic (Doyle) weaves in more respect for the Catholic church than one usually sees from so-called church leaders today, combined with some common sense insights of true morality. For Doyle chivalry not only is not dead, it'll cut off the head of anyone who says otherwise. In other words, a man's word was worth something, and a man's actions were worth even more. Lots of swordplay, a little (very little) romance, some interesting and well developed characters, and an undercurrent of humor. Not as clever as the Holmes books, but a lot more action, and one learns a little English history at the same time. I'd highly, highly recommend it for kids, or anyone really, and I am amazed that it's fallen through the cracks to this point- at least for me."},{"Title":"The White Company (Modern author's library)","review":"I cannot tell you how much fun this book is...you will have to read it yourself. This is the kind of book that you must immerse yourself in. Give yourself the time to just sink into Conan Doyle's world. It is easy to do, because Conan Doyle had a gift for imagery. The book is so complete. It shows both the beauty and the barbarity of the times with complete harmony. It is also downright funny at times. I have found myself laughing out loud while reading this book, largely because of the language used. Yes, the language is sometimes hard to follow, but who wouldn't laugh at \\"I have been cozened and bejaped!\\"? I think the author does this on purpose because it IS funny. It is interesting to compare The White Company with Crichton's recent novel \\"Timeline\\", set in the same era. Both authors worked to bring the flavor of that time to the reader, but with vastly different aims and results. Anyway, give yourself a break and escape into another world. Go to battle with Hordle John, Sam Aylward, and Alleyne! Then go sample another of Conan Doyle's little known gems and read of the outrageous exploits of Brigadier Gerard!"},{"Title":"The White Company (Modern author's library)","review":"I recently purchased this book for my husband and myself to enjoy together. Needless to say, he's been hogging it every night. Occasionally I hear him giggling (at a passage) like a ten-year-old boy. From what I recall when I read this as a kid, this book IS the perfect adventure story. Complete with knights and archers both dashing and dumpy (Sir Oliver), and even pirates, it almost reads like a serial novel in this respect.

While we all know stories like The Count of Monte Cristo and Huckleberry Finn and Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Doyle's classic and simple-hearted story about English adventurers in the Hundred Years' War is a largely unknown work. I purchased it as a lark, and because it cost a single dollar, and its worth was proved to be many times repaid.In reading The White Company, it is best to set aside expectations of sophisticated or intricate character development--this is a story that does best with a sympathetic reader, already steeped in the daydreams of bygone days and lusty battle--and simply have fun. Also, this is the kind of book that a person with some grounding in history will get more out of than someone ignorant of the 14th century. Perhaps it's advisable to obtain a little background information before settling into the book; assumptions about educational background were--ahem--more stringent in 1900 than today.This is a man's story, to be sure, and it appeals to the insurgent lurking within all men. However, it isn't offensive to womankind, either, revealing the strength of the female characters as well. Enjoy with confidence.One last comment: If, at the end of the story, you don't a lump in your throat, or feel a stirring in your heart to don a steel cap, lace on a jerkin and take up a stout length of yew, you've missed the point."},{"Title":"The White Company (Modern author's library)","review":"Though popularly remembered for the Sherlock Holmes stories, the historical novels of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle are more illustrative of his literary flair and narrative skill.'The White Company' and 'Sir Nigel' are set during the Hundred Years War between England and France, focused around the figure of Sir Nigel Loring, a chivalrous knight whose thirst for honour and glory pull him and his companions into many strange and warlike adventures.Mixing real historical figures such as Edward III and the Black Prince with creations of his own, Doyle manages to weave a number of separate incidents into an interesting and highly enjoyable tale. At times very humourous, these stories nevertheless also describe the harsher realities of medieval war, presenting a colourful picture. Though characterisation is sometimes two-dimensional, Sir Nigel as the main protagonist is both funny and endearing.

Coincidentally, some of the character names/personalities find their way to S.M. Stirling's alternate worlds novels as well."},{"Title":"The White Company (Modern author's library)","review":"Everyone has heard of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes. What many readers aren't aware of is that in addition to detective fiction, Doyle also ventured into historical fiction. Doyle's 1891 historical novel The White Company is one of his early efforts in this genre, and I found the medieval adventure great fun.Beginning in England in 1366, during the Hundred Years War, the novel begins with our protagonist Alleyne Edricson venturing forth into the world for the first time. Raised until age 20 in a monastery per his deceased father's instructions, those instructions also require that he go forth into the world for a year before he can choose to return to the monastery. The sheltered young man ventures into the world with little idea of what to do but to visit his older brother and try not to fall prey to the dangers the monks have warned him of.Alleyne soon encounters two companions, however. Hordle John is a rough and wild giant of a man who has been tossed out of the monastery the same day Alleyne leaves. Samkin Aylward is an archer just returned from France and service in the White Company, loaded with plunder, who regales Alleyne, John, and anyone else who'll listen with tales of his exploits. Samkin convinces Alleyne and John to join him in visiting Sir Nigel Loring, a brave and well-respected knight of England who he hopes to recruit as the new leader of the White Company and to return France and beyond for great deeds. Sir Nigel quickly agrees, as he is full of chivalrous fervor to do great deeds of battle and gain honor. Sir Nigel takes Alleyne as a squire, while Alleyne takes an interest of his own in Sir Nigel's daughter, Lady Maude. After months of preparations and recruiting of additional archers and men-at-arms, Sir Nigel leads the company abroad. Great deeds of honor are performed in France in friendly tournament before the White Company goes to Spain to face real war, and a variety of exciting adventures are had along the way.While reading The White Company, I couldn't help but be reminded of The Black Arrow, Robert Louis Stevenson's 1888 historical novel set a hundred years later during the Wars of the Roses, and also featuring a young knightly protagonist and daring adventures. As big a fan as I am of Stevenson, I enjoyed The White Company much more. The characters are much more likable, there's much more humor, Doyle keeps the medieval language much more accessible for modern readers, and overall, it's just a lot more fun. Doyle's action scenes - Stevenson's definite strong suit in The Black Arrow - are as good as Stevenson's, and the White Company leads in every other aspect between the books.I believe my fellow fans of J.R.R Tolkien would enjoy The White Company. Though a historical novel and not a fantasy novel, it shares some of the high and noble adventure that sets Tolkien apart from the more grim interpretations of fantasy. At times some of the beliefs of the day reflected in The White Company, such as a woman who has prophetic visions, are closer to fantasy than today's reality anyway. Had Doyle just put in a dragon for Sir Nigel and Alleyne to fight (although Tolkien would probably have had Samkin the archer deal the deal blow to the beast), this would have make a perfect fantasy novel.I read a version of The White Company illustrated by N.C. Wyeth. I first encountered Wyeth through his illustrations of many of Stevenson's works, and he really brings some of the most exciting scenes of the book to life with his art. Wyeth illustrating an edition of an adventure story is becoming a signal to me that I'll probably enjoy it.I highly recommend Doyle's The White Company to anyone who enjoys tales of knights, archers, and chivalric adventures, as well as to anyone who enjoys fantasy novels like The Lord of the Rings. I had read and enjoyed some of Doyle's Holmes stories before, but I was pleasantly surprised by just how strong Doyle's historical fiction was. I definitely plan to read Sir Nigel, a follow-up book from Doyle chronicling the early adventures of that character."},{"Title":"The White Company (Modern author's library)","review":"Note: This review is of the 1922 hardcover edition published by the Cosmopolitan Book Corporation, New York, with illustrations by N.C. Wyeth. On the cover's inside is the inscription \\"Teresa Lee McNeel, December 1930, From Mother.\\" From that, I infer it was given to my own mother by my grandmother on the former's twelfth birthday. While the book has been in my possession for decades, only now have I taken the time to follow Mom's reading trail eighty years later.\\"Now order the ranks, and fling wide the banners, for our souls are God's and our bodies the king's, and our swords for Saint George and for England!\\" - Sir Nigel Loring, rallying the White CompanyTHE WHITE COMPANY, by Arthur Conan Doyle, was first published in serialized form in 1891. It has been asserted that Doyle regarded his historical novels, THE WHITE COMPANY being one of them, more highly than his (now) better-remembered Sherlock Holmes exploits.The place is England and the Continent, the year is 1366 during the reign of the King of the English, Edward III, and his realm is twenty-nine years into The Hundred Years' War with France.The male heroes of the story are three plus one: Samkin Aylward, a grizzled archer of the White Company, an English mercenary force, Alleyne Edricson, a twenty-year old clerk raised by Cistercian monks in Beaulieu Abbey since infancy who's now sent out into the larger world to learn something of it before choosing a permanent vocation, and the red-haired giant Hordle John, a disgraced Brother of the same abbey tossed out because of his self-indulgent ways. The trio then joins a fresh contingent of the White Company raised by the renowned and veteran knight, Sir Nigel Loring, at Castle Twynham in the Hampshire town of Christchurch. Alleyne himself is taken on as Loring's personal squire and, for the two months prior to the company's departure for the Continent, is the tutor of Sir Nigel's teenage daughter, Lady Maude. Edricson is, naturally, smitten, and he goes off to war carrying her green veil as a token of favor.Doyle's novel, written during the time when the Empire still spanned the globe, is, above all, a paean to England and its common men that transformed themselves into their country's stanch expeditionary warrior forces. As a song in the book has it:\\"What of the men?The men were bred in England:The bowman - the yeoman -The lads of dale and fell.Here's to you - and to you!To the hearts that are trueAnd the land where the true hearts dwell.\\"As might be surmised, THE WHITE COMPANY is also a coming-of-age story and a great road adventure. Emerging from the protective cocoon of Beaulieu Abbey, Alleyne is a completely blank slate, a slate upon which will be writ the learning experiences of a journey that will take him to Spain to fight in what will later become known in history as the Castillian Civil War, a peripheral conflict of The Hundred Years' War. Doyle ensures that the values learned mature Edricson into his ideal of a proper and true-hearted Englishman.A main thread that runs through the entire work is chivalry as practiced by an honorable knight, the poster boy being Sir Nigel. A 21st century reader of this 19th century book may find the romantic view of this warrior philosophy somewhat quaint if not downright ridiculous, as perhaps reflected in these words by Loring to an innkeeper when the former learns of the presence of an anonymous but otherwise bellicose knight within:\\"Go tell him that a humble knight of England would make his further honorable acquaintance, not from any presumption, pride, or ill-will, but for the advancement of chivalry and the glory of our ladies. Give him greeting from Sir Nigel Loring, and say that the glove which I bear in my cap belongs to the most peerless and lovely of her sex, whom I am now ready to uphold against any lady whose claim he might be desirous of advancing.\\"Loring is, of course, inviting the other knight to meet him in personal combat on the spot. The contemporary reader may be tempted to mutter, \\"Oh, puhleeeze!\\" However, in 1891, such a challenge, and the courtliness it stemmed from, was likely to be fondly remembered and admired.There was a flip side to chivalry, however. It was a code of conduct that governed relations between members of the nobility only, i.e. from knight on up to princes and kings; there was no obligation for the aristocracy to treat the lower classes similarly. Indeed, a noble landholder could treat his villeins abominably and still be considered chivalrous; only the Church might perhaps prevail upon such a lord to treat his serfs more justly and charitably. Doyle does not shirk from referencing this in the storyline.THE WHITE COMPANY contains thirteen color plates by the painter N.C. Wyeth in a magnificent illustrative style that hasn't been employed in decades.Not surprisingly, Doyle's adventure novel has an old-fashioned air to it. It's a solid tale with a fairly predictable story; there are no plot twists that cause a mental double-take or can claim a \\"gotcha.\\" It was undoubtedly recommended for the adolescent and young adult readers of the period much as I, in my youth, devoured the epic adventures by author Joseph Altsheler, particularly theClassic American Fiction: Altsheler's Young Trailers Series, all 8 novels in a single file, with active table of contents. That said, THE WHITE COMPANY grandly accomplishes what it was penned to do, both entertain and teach moral values."},{"Title":"The White Company (Modern author's library)","review":"With this book set after Sir Nigel yet written prior, Sir Aurthur Conan Doyle has set the framework of chivalry as it should have been.

Both books are excellent for young people forming their characters."},{"Title":"The White Company (Modern author's library)","review":"The White Company, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is an inspiring tale of knightly honor and chivalry. Though famous for his Sherlock Holmes stories, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in writing The White Company, produced an extremely vivid account of the horrors of medieval warfare, while mixing in moments of humor to create an inspirational and highly enjoyable tale.The protagonist, Alleyne Edricson, is a young man come fresh from the monastery to explore the world and all it has to offer, as his father had wished. Soon after leaving the monastery, Alleyne meets a beautiful young lady and her father, Sir Nigel Loring. Alleyne then becomes squire to Sir Nigel, a humorous and highly respected knight, and the adventure begins. While fighting abroad, Alleyne proves himself to be a worthy suitor for the lovely Lady Maude, Sir Nigel's daughter, and returns from the war as a courageous and honored knight to marry her.Though the characters are at times two-dimensional, Doyle does a superb job of endearing them to the reader and enabling the reader to feel as if he or she really knows the characters. The White Company, an escape fiction novel, is an excellent example of formula fiction. The characters are mostly stock, and the ending is a happy one. The worthy hero rescues the damsel in distress, loses her for a while, but returns to win back her love. Even though the novel contains some flat characters and stereotypes, a dose of reality is present in the horror of war portrayed by Doyle.This account of knights, war, and fair ladies is permeated with the theme of honor. The code of chivalry for medieval knights is a well-developed theme presented by Doyle. This valuable theme mixed with an enjoyable and funny story makes this novel unique. The White Company is a well-written, interesting book and I recommend reading it."},{"Title":"The White Company (Modern author's library)","review":"If the Divine is in the details, than this novel is touched by It with easily readable and rich details alive with imagery.

Containing detailed descriptions of heraldry, castles, weapons, and cities, The White Company takes you back in time to the romanticized world of knight errants, damsels in distress, gallant squires, but does not shy away from the more realistic facts of Medieval life - starving peasants, blood-and-piss battles, captives and ransoms, rape, pillage, and plunder. The White Company contains, among other things:a chase with archers and knights,an awesome sword fight,a giant who can fire an arrow 600 metres,a sea battle between pirates and a merchant boat,a rampaging bear,a gunpowder explosion,an archery competition where Longbowmen shoot birds out of the sky,a pseudo-monk,a wrestling match in a tavern,a last stand between five knights and thousands of starving, crazed peasants,a huge battle in the end,a princess who lives in a nunnery,a lord and a archer taken slave,and much, much more. But the best thing is that the book won't drown you if you tie it around your neck and go swimming and if you put it in your suitcase it won't be overweight: The White Company is just the right length.On a different note, it must be remembered that Conan Doyle was INTENSELY patriotic and much of this book had parallels with England's situation then. So if you don't like that sort of \\"England is supreme. French are dogs.\\" sort of stuff, avoid....The White Company contains one of my favorite poems, an old archer's song: The Song of the Bow. I will show some of it here:What of the Bow?The Bow was made in England:Of true wood, of yew wood;The Wood of English bows;So men who are freelove the old yew-treeAnd the land where the yew tree grows....What of the Shaft?The Shaft was cut in England:a long shaft, a strong shaft;Barbed and trim and true:So we'll drink all togetherto the grey goose featherAnd the land where the grey goose flew....The White Company is one of my favourite books, and I have read many. You must read it!Strongest Recommendation!"},{"Title":"The White Company (Modern author's library)","review":"The plot in this story seems to be quite simple, therefore the story becomes as simple as its plot is.

Much of this book is spent in an extended exploration/description of this concept. Merritt, writing in 1920, gets very high marks for imagination, anticipating current nanotechnology. This is worth four stars all by itself.The story does not really do justice to the concept, unfortunately. Merritt's dominant female personality, Norhala, doesn't really fit. Merritt seems to include her merely because Merritt is obsessed with such personalities and they feature in most of his books. The scenes against the long lost Persians likewise seems to be grafted on just to give the story some action to offset pages and pages of exposition. The resolution comes right out of nowhere with little foreshadowing.Merritt's descriptions are very poetic - the man had a vocabulary - but ultimately can't be visualized by the reader. This doesn't make the story hard to follow, fortunately, but the reader is pretty much left to his own devices as far seeing the story in his mind's eye.Modern readers will also be put off by the slow pacing that was the fashion when the story was written. Although the book justifies its classic status modern readers would be better starting out with Merritt's \\"The Ship of Ishtar\\".Recommended for readers willing to overlook serious flaws. It will reward some patience."},{"Title":"The Metal Monster (Masters of Science Fiction)","review":"I read this book in the early seventies while living in Spain.

One of America's greatest writers, Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote these versions of stories about Pandora, Medusa, Hercules, King Midas and the host of gods and goddesses that make up the Greek pantheon. The language is evocative and colorful yet easily understandable. You needn't worry if your high school teacher's assigned reading of \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" bored you to tears, as this collection of stories is filled with exciting adventures and vivid characters. I love the beautiful illustrations in this book. They were done by Walter Crane, one of the most popular illustrators of children's books in the late 19th century. The paintings are in the Pre-Raphaelite style in full color. The decorations at the beginning of each chapter are filled with Victorian charm and make this new editon seem like a well-loved antique. There are many excellent anthologies of the Greek myths on the market but rarely will you find one that utilizes such substantial talents as those employed by Hawthorne and Crane or that so thoroughly draw the reader in to the romantic and turbulent world of heroes, maidens and the capricious deities who stir their fates. I highly recommend this book. It is a classic that will enrich the mind and heart of a young reader and open the way for further discovery."},{"Title":"A wonder book for girls & boys","review":"This is a remarkable book, with rich detail in both illustration and prose.

Out of a possible five stars I would rate this book a four because the content is very dense, and at times a bit hard to understand. But still, the book was very gripping. The author's vocabulary is vast, and some of the words he used I had never heard. Some of the sentences are phrased abnormally too. The sentences are considerably lengthy.This book is full of tales such as \\"The Golden Touch,\\" \\"Three Golden Apples,\\" \\"The Paradise of Children,\\" \\"The Gorgon's Head,\\" and others. Since the stories were written in the 1800's the writing style is much different than the current modern day style.The storyteller, Eustace Bright, is in the town of Tangle Wood with all of his nieces and nephews, at their family house. The kids always request a story from their uncle Eustace, and then he would proceed to tell a wonderful story filled with fantasy characters, and of course; there was always an obvious moral to each tale.I enjoyed this book, and each story within it. The characters in the stories had great personalities, which made the book a thrill to read. It's full of imaginary settings, and magical things.Eustace Bright told many stories of heroes such as Hercules, on quests. Along the way, they would meet up with all sorts of creatures. For instance in the tale, \\"The Three Golden Apples\\" Hercules comes across a man, who has the burden of holding the sky upon his shoulders.Over all I would recommend this book. Especially to those who enjoy fairytales and fantasy stories. However, like I said, the book can be a quite hard to understand at times.

As a fine art photographer myself, I respect Mr. Silvester's level of skill and artistry, and I find his other books very beautiful.However, when I first became aware of his book about the cats and dogs, I was thoroughly dismayed by his choice of subject matter and the way he has chosen to portray the lives of these creatures as idyllic and carefree.Having been to these Greek islands, I have learned firsthand that the large majority of these poor animals are ignored, injured, or mistreated by people there-anything but &quot;respected.&quot; The photographer has omitted portraits of the true conditions for most of the stray dogs and cats in Greece-crippled, starving, dying of thirst, hurt or maimed, with the humans around them barely taking notice.The full horror of the story was revealed to me by locals on the islands. Each year, the cats &amp; dogs are allowed to breed uncontrolled, because tourists are fond of seeing the cute animals around town and on the beaches. At the end of each tourist season, as many of them as possible are rounded up and killed (I couldn't bear to learn how), until the following year when the ones that survived begin the cycle all over again. I found this same story on all the islands I visited, including Mykonos, and I was so appalled that I shortened my stay and left Greece altogether.The situation is a tragedy, and my feeling, as a photographer and animal lover, is that Mr. Silvester should not be misrepresenting the conditions of the cats and dogs on these Greek islands, especially when it is for monetary gain. I hope animal lovers around the world will agree, and send a message to anyone who profits in any way from the suffering of these dogs and cats in the sun."},{"Title":"Kittens in the Sun","review":"A better title for this book would be \\"Many nice images of felines in a picturesque european coastal town created by exposing thin sheets of chemical-covered paper to light\\".Mostly cats, not that many true kittens in here, but still well-worth your thin, rectangular, monochromatic paper-cloth images of our past leaders."},{"Title":"Scholastic Q & A: How Do Flies Walk Upside Down?

The book is broken into a few sections, first Insect Ways, Growing Up and Insects you might meet. The very first question is How Do Flies Walk Upside Down? with the answer that they use their claws to grip rough spots. They explain that there is some sticky stuff covering their feet that makes it similar to walking with gum on your shoe sole.The illustrations showcase all the insects with their names beside them as well as documenting the four stages of metamorphosis. This is when certain insects change. Some insects do not pass through the four stages while others might grow wings. The insects you might meet would be butterflies, moths, ants and mosquitoes as well as flies. A butterfly will hold its wings straight up while a moth spreads its wings out flat.There are many questions inside How Do Flies Walk Upside Down? with interesting answers sure to amaze and interest any child with a curious mind. These books usually open up the discussion for more questions with more books to search for. This sparks the imagination and opens up the world of science and nature to my six-year old. He has become a walking encyclopedia on many animals and when we go outside he gets to see many of the same insects profiled inside the book.

In the first half he praises the key positive principles of the Reformation, showing how they are good, true, and fundamentally Catholic. In part two he shows how those same great principles have been continuously and inevitably undermined by and among the Reformers (and their heirs) as a result of Protestantism's failure to properly critique and throw off the nominalistic philosophical framework of the late medieval period. He clearly explains how the positive principles of the Reformation and Protestantism can only be sustained and flourish within the Catholic Church.Whether Protestant or Catholic, you should read this book. It is absolutely crucial to understanding what unites &amp; divides Protestants and Catholics, and how to preserve untainted the truths we hold most dear."},{"Title":"The spirit and forms of Protestantism","review":"Committed Christians of all persuasions often know what their churches teach, but seldom know why. The value of this book, in my estimation, is that it lays bear the philosophical underpinnings of the Reformation, rooted as it was in Scotist/Occamist Scholasticism. Bouyer shows that Reform thought resulted in a reinterpretation of the meaning of Christian doctrine and Scripture through the lens of Occamist radical dualism-- ergo the Reform emphasis upon private interpretation, the appeal to Scripture and Faith alone, the doctrine of Consubstantiation and the rejection of reason as an authoritative and reliable means of interpreting revealed truth.Bouyer, beginning his spiritual service as a French Lutheran Cleric, knew Protestant thought from the inside out. He is careful to outline all the good Reform teaching contains and quick to point out how Church practice at the time of the Reformation had come to deemphasize much the Reformers championed. His issues are not with the orthodox doctrines but with the negative elements that mysteriously appear with them in Reform thought. Bouyer insist that these elements, not rooted in orthodox doctrine but in the poison of Occamist Nominalism, weaken and dilute the orthodox doctrines and prevent them from bearing fruit. They also create endless division and doctrinal chaos and confusion.The book is divided into three large sections. In the first he outlines the positive principles of the Reformation, with numerous quotes from the writings of the Reformers. The second section, which is much shorter, Bouyer discusses the negative elements in Reform thought, shows their source in Occamist/Scotist Scholasticism and exposes the logical incompatibility of Occam's Nominalism with Christian realities as they are presented in both Church Doctrine and Sacred Scripture.The final section is essentially his solution to the dilemma of doctrinal chaos in the Protestant world.As a convert to the Catholic faith I must say I never really understood my Protestantism until I read Bouyer. I believe it will be a revelation to all who read it with an open mind and a desire for the truth. I highly recommend it for those on both sides of the issue. As the Medievals were fond of saying, \\"Sell your bed and buy it.\\""},{"Title":"The spirit and forms of Protestantism","review":"Bouyer has a masterpiece of Christian writing in this work.

He looks at all the good that Protestantism has accomplished in its teachings and fervor for Christ and then shows the flaws that underlie the entire system. He then goes on to show in amazing fluidity and detail how the good the comes from Protestantism can only come to its fullest potential in the Catholic Church. Wonderful argument, original thesis and great writing. What a book!"},{"Title":"The spirit and forms of Protestantism","review":"I found this book very valuable because, to be honest, I have always struggled to understand precisely what draws people to protestantism. For me a catholic, the negativity of the movement (illustrated by its name) coupled with its propensity towards relentless splintering seemed to underscore that the movement was a human movement and not a manfestation of the Spirit. This analysis seemed to be even clearer when presented with some american forms of protestantism which seem to be a monstrous distortion of the gospel with its obsessive focus on \\"me\\" and God speaking to \\"me\\", and God blessing \\"me\\" - where does the People of God and the New Israel come into all this and who speaks for Jesus here and now?Thus, it seemed to me that protestantism was simply a new Tower of Babel, an example of man againing becoming alienated from man by being trapped in his own ego and own privated \\"spirit filled\\" illuminations.Bouyer brilliantly shows in the first half of the book what the genius of protestantism was and is: a complete an utter realisation that my salvation is utterly the work of grace, that when I convert, it is the grace of God drawing me to him. Thus, I do not earn salvation as every impulse in me towards the divine including accepting Christ, as the Kyrios, is down to the grace of God.Bouyer shows that this is totally catholic and fully consistent with the teaching of the church from the beginning (see the 6th century Council of Orange and latterly of Trent). However, Luther was not satisfied with proclaiming this truth, which, at that time, needed to be proclaimed again from the rooftops. Luther then developed his doctrine of extrinsic justification, which is, for catholic, an utterly monstrous doctrine, namely that, even after converting to Christ, being baptised and brought into the life of the Church, the grace of God does no more, it leaves us in our sinful condition. Thus, justification and sanctification belong to two different worlds.For catholics, not only is this doctrine monstrous, it belies what is evident in real life. The grace of God can and does change utterly and completely, it breaks the bonds of sins and sets a person free. But, not in a one off sense, but in the context of a life long continuous conversion process. And, good works are seen in this context, not as something added by man to gain merit or justification, but direct and clear manifestations from God and God alone that a person is filled with grace, freely given by God himself. Thus, when the Church canonises saints, its not because these people merit or earn heaven, its because they, by the grace of God, have become icons of Christ, having been moulded by the Heavenly Father into the image of his only begotten Son. Therein lies the mystery of human freedom and divine grace, a mysterium fidei.Bouyer shows that it has been the protestant revivials (wesleyism, for example) which have saved protestantism from auto-destructing. And, yet it is in those revivials that we find protestantism coming closer to catholicism in spirit. Thus, the wesleyan movement was all about living a life of holiness, a life where grace does indeed sanctify and have real tangible effects on the life of man.Bouyer ends the book by an assessment of where protestantism is and concludes that protestantism can only be true to itself by coming back to the catholic fold and in that fold proclaiming boldly the utter extraordinary gift God has given us in Jesus Christ. To him be glory for ever."},{"Title":"The spirit and forms of Protestantism","review":"If I were told that there was a book about Protestantism written by a Catholic priest in the 1950's before Vatican II, I would be quick to assume that it contained unfair simplifications of Protestantism, while giving a triumphalistic view of the Catholic Faith.However, nothing could be further from the truth regarding \\"The Spirit and Forms of Protestantism\\" by Fr. Louis Bouyer. Originally written in 1956, Bouyer's book is a masterful treatment, from a Catholic perspective, of exactly where the original Reformers were wrong - and where they were right. The tone of the book is clearly that of a convert (which Bouyer was) who desires nothing more than the reconciliation of his former Protestant brethren with the Catholic Church, and who sees the Catholic Church as the fulfillment, not the rejection, of the best impulses of the original Reformers. Bouyer takes pains to present Protestantism in the most favorable light, always assuming sincerity and good intentions on the part of those who developed Protestant theology.The book is divided roughly in two parts - in the first section (the greater part of the book) he discusses all the correct (from a Catholic perspective) desires and doctrines of the Reformers, and in the second part he details where they fell short of the fullness of the truth found in Catholicism. In both sections he maintains an even, fair treatment of the decisive differences that separated Western Christendom in the 16th century.This book is eminently useful to both the Catholic and the Protestant. The Catholic can better understand the reasons behind the beliefs of our \\"separated brethren,\\" while appreciating many of the impulses behind them. The Protestant can become more fully aware of the true teachings of the Catholic Church and not its misrepresentations so often perpetrated by propagandists; in doing so, he can appreciate the common ground between his own faith and the Catholic Church - common ground that may be deeper than he might first assume."},{"Title":"The spirit and forms of Protestantism","review":"The divide between Protestants and Catholics since the Reformation has been expressed often in petty polemical writings attacking a caricature of reality. 'The Spirit and Forms of Protestantism', however, is a remarkably intelligent analysis of Protestantism from a convert to the Roman Catholic church. Louis Bouyer attempts to be both irenic and controversial in his arguments.There are three parts to the book. In the first, Bouyer argues that the defining religious impulses of Protestantism (sola gratia, sola fide, soli deo gloria, the centrality of Scripture) are entirely positive principles which actually express the best of the Catholic tradition as well. To the extent that Protestants have lived by these principles, their faith and life has been deeply Christian. In the second section, however, he puts forward the thesis that Protestantism was fatally corrupted by its reliance on nominalistic philosophy, thus incorporating the worst of medieval Catholicism into itself and laying the foundation for the monstrous heresies and schisms that have plagued Protestant churches for centuries. Finally, he argues that the true spirit of Protestantism can only be satisfied in a return to the Catholic church.As an orthodox Anglican and sitting quite lightly to the 'Protestant' label, I could enjoy some schadenfreude over the very incisive criticisms of Reformed thinking and practice that Bouyer makes since I have serious problems with Calvinism myself, but even I felt the sting of the lash on occasion. I have also seldom seen Catholicism presented in such an appealing way. This is the level at which the debate over the Reformation needs to be conducted, not quibbles over the veneration of saints, etc.The main issue of contention with this book is the extent to which his argument of the effect of nominalism on Protestant theology is correct. Without being an expert, I suspect that the true story is more complicated than he makes out. However, in general it does actually seem to me to provide something of a key to understanding the real problems within Protestant churches, and has great explanatory power. If not true in the absolute sense that Bouyer wants to argue, it is certainly a tributary within the whole system. Even Protestants are coming to realise this, for instance the work of Mannermaa within the Finnish Lutheran church regarding Luther's doctrine of justification.Like Bouyer I hope for the day when the truly 'Catholic' church will be united again, and the work of the Reformers will be purified and justified. Come, Lord Jesus!"},{"Title":"The spirit and forms of Protestantism","review":"A former French Lutheran Pastor who converted to Roman Catholicism and became a Catholic priest, Bouyer provides what I have found to be one of the most deeply charitable and thoughtfully insightful assessments of Protestantism available. He finds and affirms in various Protestant movements since the Reformation efforts to capture certain true and biblical aspects of apostolic Christianity. This, I might add, is a value in this book not often found in some acerbic critiques of convert Catholic apologists. Bouyer seeks to affirm those aspects of Protestantism while coming to the conclusion that in isolation from each other they miss the whole and, in fact, transform what was a good part into a bad whole. As would be expected, Bouyer sees in Catholic Christianity the proper balance and integration of the otherwise loose strands of Protestantism - what many might call the fullness of the faith."},{"Title":"The spirit and forms of Protestantism","review":"In this definitive study of the roots of the reformation, Dr. Bouyer praises the reformers for their theological insights. But paradoxically, he observes, these \\"Protestant\\" insights were already alive and well in the Catholic church. And this paradox that these causes celebres of the reformation were not the issues that ultimately led to schism leave us with the question of what did. If the schism was not really a theological disagreement on the primary issues raised by the reformers (the so-called solas of the reformation) then what was that cause?Dr. Bouyer brilliantly gets to the root cause by way of a symptom of that underlying philosophy. He sees something in the early Protestant concept of extrinsic justification. In other words, as Luther would say, with justification we are declared righteous even though remain what we always were; Luther described it as \\"snow covered dung.\\" This is in direct opposition to the Catholic understanding that grace has efficacy to actually make a change in us and not just a decree that has no basis in reality. The root of this extrinsic/declaration-only justification nominalist philosophy played out to its conclusion. Sadly, Catholic theologians of the time, such as Erasmus, were so bound to the same nominalism that they could not provide an effective counter-argument to the new challengers. Both were trapped in the prevailing philosophical fad of their time. At least one other scholar has seen this in his assertion that the true father of the reformation was not Luther but William of Occam (See Dr. Scott Hahn's lecture, \\"Forerunners of the Reformation,\\" at the 2005 Deep in History Conference webpage).Nominalism became the poison pill of the reformation leading to subjectivism and relativism in theology which eventually eroded the movement of its core theological strengths. Liberal Rrotestantism where the individual became their own and sole arbiter of truth was the inevitable result. There were signs of hope in many of the revivals that have swept through the protestant \\"churches\\" but paradoxically again, the assertions that saved Protestant Christianity, Dr. Bouyer demonstrates, were assertions that made them more Catholic.The great paradox that Dr. Bouyer finds is that all that is good about the reformation can be only fully realized within the context of the Catholic church. To be a true Protestant reformer, as it were, one must embrace their Catholic roots. To return to the church is not a rejection of reformation principles, it is a fulfillment of those principles in the only place they can flourish.This is by far the most profound and challenging work on Protestant/Catholic understanding. It should be required reading for every student of theology - indeed every Christian.

This is a classic work that has been the impetus to many in greater understanding. It cannot be recommended highly enough."},{"Title":"The spirit and forms of Protestantism","review":"This is a unique book (at least to me) in the fact that the author manages to give Catholocism its rightful place while still being charitable to the committed Protestants of the reformed variety.Long story short, it's a Catholic resource, but I wouldn't be suprised to find it in a reformed library."},{"Title":"The spirit and forms of Protestantism","review":"The Spirit and Forms of Protestantism, by Louis Bouyer, is hailed by many in Romanist circles as a fair but devastating critique of Protestant theology. Such an assessment, however, along with the book itself, betray a rather superficial understanding of the issues at stake in the Lutheran Reformation. Space does not permit a thorough analysis of all the errors in the book. However, let me touch on two of them and then deal briefly with the book's chief virtue.First, the author is described as a former Lutheran pastor, a fact which no doubt leads some to accept his account of Lutheranism as an accurate one. However, it is clear from the book that his reading of Luther comes filtered through Karl Barth, a distinctly non-Lutheran theologian. If Bouyer were a Lutheran pastor before his conversion to Rome, he was a bad one.Second, although it is conventional these days to summarize the theology of the Reformation in terms of the three solas - sola fide, sola gratia, sola Scriptura (by faith alone, by grace alone, by Scripture alone) - not only is such a self-understanding not to be found in the writings of Martin Luther or of any of his evangelical contemporaries, the meanings with which Bouyer invests those words are quite inconsistent with the way in which the Lutheran Reformers understood them. Fair appraisal of the Lutheran Reformation? Not quite.Let's take sola gratia, for instance. In the first half of his book, Bouyer holds up the Reformers' emphasis on sola gratia as potentially salutary. But from Bouyer this is faint praise, for Bouyer understands gratia in the way of the Council of Trent, that is, as a quality gratuitously infused by God into the sinner which enables him to perform works meriting salvation. Luther slipped off the rails, Bouyer would say, when he began to emphasize \\"forensic justification,\\" that is, the teaching that the righteousness that avails before God is Christ's righteousness imputed by faith to the believing sinner: \\"Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will never count against him,\\" as St. Paul avers, citing Psalm 32. But sola gratia and forensic justification are a contradiction only for Bouyer, who misunderstands grace in the first place. Rather than a quality or power given to the human being to enable him to do the works necessary for salvation, grace was to Luther God's favorable disposition toward the sinner on account of Christ. This is no insignificant misunderstanding on Bouyer's part. Bouyer is operating with what might be called a \\"sanative\\" view of salvation, even when he speaks favorably of the Lutheran Reformers, who were not.The true virtue then of Bouyer's The Spirit and Forms of Protestantism, insofar as it is an accurate representation of Roman Catholic teaching (he gets Lutheranism wrong, why should he be trusted on Roman Catholicism, right?), is its making quite clear the huge distance even today between Roman Catholicism and the theology of the Lutheran Reformation. Martin Luther's burden was not so much the three solas as keeping Christ at the center of Christian faith. Luther recognized that the medieval schemes of meritum de congruo and meritum de condigno, of facere quod in se est deus non denegat gratiam, conditional absolution, etc., served to marginalize the person and work of Jesus Christ. Either Christ's atonement is all-sufficient for the sinner's salvation, or else Christ is just another lawgiver or moral example. What Bouyer's book proves is that Rome continues to operate with a \\"metaphysics of grace,\\" in which Christ is simply made to fit. Baptism into Christ is the indispensable prerequisite for salvation, a Romanist may say, but Christ is not all in all. Grace for the Roman Catholic is a kind of Platonic concept with which God must act in accordance. For the Lutheran, however, grace is Christ Himself. Grace is the heart of God revealed in the person and work of Christ, who died for sinners and whose righteousness is received freely and simply by passive trust in Him.Telling is this passage from Bouyer: \\"'Christ himself declared: 'God alone is good,' but He just as explicitly enjoins, 'Be ye perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect'; the supposition that he could have called men to this without giving them the means to respond is not worth considering.\\" Erasmus said the same thing (to which Luther said, \\"Of course God commands things which we're not capable of doing, to demonstrate our need for a Savior! \\"For by the law is the knowledge of sin.\\"). If, as Bouyer here says, man has the ability - even with God's help - to be as perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect, then it may be asked, Were the Incarnation and Atonement really necessary? For Bouyer, Jesus is a mechanism by which the rest of us can become godlike, and once we're sufficiently godlike, God must let us in. Change \\"godlike\\" to \\"gods\\" and \\"let us in\\" to \\"give us our own planet,\\" and you're a Mormon. The Roman Catholic can keep his infused grace; I'm sticking with Christ's righteousness at the Throne of Judgment.\\"The Spirit and Forms of Protestantism\\" proves that the work of the Lutheran Reformation must still be done. God help us all to say with St. Paul: \\"I consider [everything] rubbish, that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ - the righteousness that comes from God and is by faith\\" (Phil. 3:9)."},{"Title":"The Eighth Situpa On The Third Karmapa's Mahamudra Prayer","review":"This is the most illuminating commentary on the third Karmapa's Mahamudra Aspiration Prayer I have read.

One of the best of these early fantasists was Lord Dunsany, an Irish aristocrat who poured out his imagination into exotic, semi-mythic stories.He only wrote relatively few novels and novellas, but loads of short stories. And \\"Fifty One Tales\\" compiles the shortest of those stories, often meditations on death, joy, life and time. They're less like short stories than long vignettes, but they are striking.In this collection, Dunsany writes of sunken ships, of Fame's prediction to a young poet, the ghost of a workman, Death trying to frighten the legendary hero Odysseus, a king dreams of a beautiful queen who has been dead for forty years, and a Spanish pirate whose evil deeds mean that he isn't allowed to die.There is some dark humour in these stories as well, such as when Time comes across a man \\"antiquing\\" a wooden chair, and is a bit put out that his work is being done unnaturally. \\"Charon\\" is perhaps the most striking of these: the ferrymen of the dead is told by a dead passenger that \\"I am the last,\\" and finally breaks a smile.Not many authors could have such an impact with such short stories. Most of them are less than a page long, and sometimes they only focus on a minute or two. Despite this, Dunsany's excellent use of words paints some very, very vivid pictures.Usually Dunsany either made up his own legends, or sort of coopted vague Eastern myths as they were to the Victorians. \\"Fifty Tales\\" isn't quite the same; Greek mythology has a strong presence here, with Odysseus, Pan, Pegasus, Charon, Homer and Helen all either appearing or being referred to.Dunsany always had an excellent command of language, and he does a great job with \\"grey and watchful mountains,\\" \\"glaring factories,\\" and a world being choked by modernity. In one story, flowers cry out: \\"Great engines rush over the beautiful fields, their ways lie hard and terrible up and down the land,\\" and in another a poet cries out in sorrow because \\"the progress of modern commerce\\" has made his songs unwanted.Bittersweet and beautifully written, these fifty-one short stories leave behind the impression of a magical land that has faded away. Though not Dunsany's best work, it's still a classic."},{"Title":"Fifty-one tales,","review":"If you like Shakespeare - if you like Jack Vance - if you like Fritz Leiber - if you like Lovecraft - then buy *everything* you can find by Lord Dunsany. Frankly, I firmly believe that all of the above Literary Geniuses with the exception of Shakespeare were heavily influenced by Dunsany's works. I have almost everything he has published (some at great expence), and cannot think of one collection/novel/play that has not enhanced my life. Surely, he is one of the greatest authors of all time. I bought this book to replace a copy that was - er, &lt;ahem> - *Permanently 'Borrowed'* by an (_ex_)friend of mine...

A significant outflow of educated people (a \`brain drain') is therefore a serious threat to the future of a country.The Swedish geographer Reidar Oderth has written a very worthwhile study on the migration of graduates and university students from Malawi. Malawi, for decades suffering under dictatorship that forced many intellectuals into exile, passed through a process of democratisation during the beginning of the 1990's. A new, freely elected government gained power in 1994.Oderth's thesis evaluates the impact of these political changes upon the migration of graduates and students, with emphasis on the UK as one of the major recipient countries. The study indicates that the brain drain from Malawi did not decrease after 1994, rather the opposite. The impact of the democratisation has been strongly counteracted by a deterioration of the economic situation in the country. Further, the abolition of currency and administrative restrictions in Malawi has facilitated emigration.The study reviews the present state-of-the-art concerning theories to explain the observed migration patterns. These include, among others, theories based on the push-pull model as well as micro, meso and macro concepts. Theories of time-geography have also contributed to give a new dimension to migration research.While it is obvious that the limitations in Oderth's survey data partially made the study difficult, he has put a lot of effort in collecting and analysing statistical data, interviews and literature. The study therefore gives an important contribution to our knowledge of the extent of migration of educated citizens of a poor African country as well as some indications of their causes and consequences. Further studies to deepen our knowledge of the processes of migration and brain drain should therefore have a high priority in research on development issues of the Third World.Per Lindskog, PhD in GeographyLink&ouml;pings universitet, SwedenLindskog has worked at the University of Malawi during five years as lecturer"},{"Title":"The Teddy Bears Picnic","review":"I loved this version of the book when I was a child and was excited to find it on Amazon.

He's wearin these Jerry Garcia glasses, with a wizzened-white Jerry Garcia beard, and strums both an electric and an acoustic guitar! Real aficionados might even see a resemblance to string player David Grisman, a leaner bear with matching black \\"T\\" and a very fine looking banjo.Yes, it's Garcia and Grisman's foray into kiddy lit, and while they appear on only a few pages (and the board book has no accompanying CD), their presence is felt in the other bears taking the woods-road to a grand picnic. THey're free-spiried and diverse (teddies,koalas, and pandas, and black bears and brown) and wear disguises (a sailor shirt, a pig snout) and free-flowing scarves and hats and , and bright 60's vests. Tqo ainga cross to from thw word \\"Woodstock,\\" and while there are no naked bears holding hands in a river... it is a frolicosme gathering:\\"Beneath the trees, where nobody sees/THey'll hide and seek as long as they please.\\"However, the text is an adaptation of a 1947 text by John W. Bratton and Jimmy Kennedy, and if you read carefully, you;ll pick up on some subverively conservative strictures. Only GOOD bears can go this picnic, it seems, and though they're having a \\"lovely\\" time on their picnic, there's a mysterious (and somewhat cryptic ) reference to dangers lurking in the forest. Towards the end of this playful, and cutely illustrated board book (the wonderful Bruce Whatley), there's a somewhat sinister verse:\\"If yo ugo down to the woods todayYou better not go aloneIt's lovely down in the woods todayBut safer to stay at home\\"Maybe this just relects the creeping fears of a tired young bear at the endof a grand picnic, but it makes little sense to me, not is it consistent with the overall tone of the book. I dount your little one is going to notice, but I can't help but wonder if the publishers could have chosen to omit this abrupt and unexplained warning...Overall, it's a nicely illustrated boardbook, and bear lovers will especially warm to it. However, the original tune clashes a bit with the 60's ethos, and the phrases can be awkward when not sung.

In the previous volume, Ben finally found the Black Unicorn. Willow was with the creature and Meeks was threatening them. Questor managed to do some credible magic and the evil wizard vanished in a bright light.In this novel, Ben Holiday is a founding partner of a rich and well-known law firm. Then he buys the Magic Kingdom of Landover and leaves his friend Miles Bennett in sole charge of the firm. Ben spends the next year restoring the kingdom.Willow is a sylph, the daughter of the River Master and a wood nymph. She is now Ben's lover. But Ben still cannot overcome his residual feelings for Annie, his deceased wife.Questor Thews is the court wizard of Landover. He is the half-brother of the former court wizard, now known as Meeks. Questor is getting better at wizardry, but still has many misapplications of his magic.Abernathy is the court scribe. He is also a talking dog. He had once been a human, but had been transformed by Questor. Then the wizard had not been able to restore his human form.Bunion and Parsnip are kobolds. Both are retainers of the kingdom. Bunion is the court runner and Parsnip is the cook.Fillip and Sot are G'home Gnomes. They are short mole-like creatures who burrow into the ground for shelter and thus are always dirty. They are fearful, talk incessantly and like the taste of household pets. These two were the first to pledge their fealty to Ben after arriving in Landover.Michel Ard Rhi is the former prince of Landover. He was tutored by the court wizard Meeks from an early age and soon developed a mean streak. After the old king died, Michel and Meeks migrated to Ben's world and fleeced buyers by selling the Magic Kingdom.In this story, Questor has found a way to transform Abernathy back to his human form, but he needs the Paladin medallion to use as a catalyst. Since Questor's magical efforts usually fail in part or completely, Abernathy is not certain that such effort would be beneficial.Despite his objections, it is obvious that Abernathy wants to regain his human form. Ben reluctantly agrees to the effort and hands the medallion to Abernathy. On the first try, Questor changes Abernathy into a full dog, without speech or hand-like paws.Embarrassed, Questor tries again and successfully returns Abernathy to his dog-like form and pushes for a full transformation into a human. But then he sneezes and Abernathy disappears. A bottle with dancing harlequins appears in his stead.Questor believes that he has exchanged Abernathy for the bottle. And he is certain that he has seen the bottle previously, but is unsure of where and when. Later he realizes that the bottle contains a Darkling, a form of demon that does dark magic for the holder of the bottle.Meanwhile, Abernathy finds himself crowded into a display case. After a while, a young girl comes into the room and soon discovers him within the case. Elizabeth lets him out and takes him to her room. Unluckily, two guards see Abernathy with her and report the news to Michel Ard Rhi, the master of the castle.Abernathy is caged in the dungeon of the castle -- which had been brought stone by stone to Washington state -- and left with only dry dog food to eat while he considers giving the Paladin medallion to Michel. But Elizabeth sneaks down a hidden stairway and brings Abernathy some real food and plots his escape from the castle.This tale leaves Ben without the medallion and missing his friend Abernathy. Fillip and Sot take the bottle and hurry toward home. Soon Ben discovers its loss and starts looking for the G'home Gnomes, taking Willow, Questor and the two kobolds.The Darkling raises havoc within Landover, passing from one holder to another and whispering dark thoughts into their ears. The next volume isThe Tangle Box. Read and enjoy!Highly recommended for Brooks fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of court wizards, magical quests, and true romance.

Landover has wizards, fairies and dragons in it. The problem of the story was that a man got changed into a dog to hide from an evil wizard. The reason he was hiding was because he beat a kid for throwing dogs off the top of the castle. A wizard named Questor is trying to make the man come back. He had an almost perfect spell.

Have read several times. Now going to next series."},{"Title":"Wizard at Large (Magic Kingdom of Landover)","review":"Terry Brooks returns to Landover with yet another stunning tale of adventure and danger. Less than a year after nearly losing the kingdom of Landover to the duplicitous wizard Meeks, Ben Holiday once again finds himself fighting for his life. The mess begins when Questor Thews, the court wizard and half-brother to the vanquished Meeks, rushes into the garden room to announce triumphantly that he has finally found a way to change Abernathy, the court scribe, back to his human form after more than twenty years. The spell requires just one thing, a catalist that will separate the man from the dog in Abernathy, thereby allowing the transformation to take place. Unfortunately, the only item within easy reach that could possibly serve this purpose is Ben's enchanted medallion. Despite the danger posed by such an act, Ben reluctantly hands over the medallion, giving Questor the Ok to work his magic. But as we all know, Questor's magic doesn't always work the way he intends, and sometimes the results can be devastating. A sneeze on the part of Questor sends the magic spinning wildly out of control with catastrophic consequences. Not only does Abernathy fail to change back, but he's also sucked down into a strange well of light that carries him off to an unknown land...along with Ben's medallion. The mystery only deepens when, almost immediately after Abernathy vanishes, a mysterious bottle appears where the scribe once stood. Though at first nobody knows neither the origin nor the nature of the bottle, Questor remembers an event in his past that sheds a disturbing light on Abernathy's situation.The bottle, Questor confesses, is an old relic of Meeks, the former court wizard, which the old man often gave to the son of the last king of Landover to play with. The bottle, Questor reveals, is the prison of a powerful genie-like demon who appears when summoned and obeys the command of its master. This creature, called a Darkling, draws the power for its magics from the darker side of a person's nature, anger, hatred, envy, greed, etc. The more powerful and cruel its master, the stronger the demon. Since the bottle was last in the possession of Michel Ard Rhi, the son of the last king, Questor can only deduce that Abernathy was sent to the place where the bottle was kept. Abernathy, it turns out, was sent back to Earth, to wherever Michel Ard Rhi lived. The situation only gets worse when Philip and Sot, friends of Ben's from the north, steal the bottle, believing it to be a pretty trinket. Now, Ben must not only recover his missing medallion and Abernathy, but also track down and regain possession of the bottle before it's opened.Despite the seriousness of Abernathy's situation, he is not completely without help. After waking up to find himself scrunched into a display case, he encounters a little girl named Elizabeth, who reveals that he's in Woodenville, Washington. More specifically, he's inside the castle of Graum Wythe, which is ruled by a man named Michel Ard Rhi. Abernathy decides to tell Elizabeth the truth about him and urges her to help him escape from the castle before Michel learns of his presence. Elizabeth readily agrees, and the two of them set about forming a plan to beat the clock and get Abernathy safely away before his old enemy learns of his presence. Will Ben recover the bottle and find a way to exchange it for Abernathy? Will Elizabeth and Abernathy find a way to elude Michel before it's too late? The climactic battle at the end will answer that question quite nicely.All in all I liked the presentation of this book. I'd read the unabridged Library of Congress version and liked it, but the Brilliance Audio abridgment was even better. Very little indeed was left out, and once again Dick Hill delivers a quality performance. My only complaint was his portrayal of the Darkling, but even that really wasn't that bad. He does manage to convey the fawning yet sinister nature of the creature quite nicely. If you haven't read this book yet and you enjoyed the first two novels in the series, pick up this book. Once again, Brooks delivers a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Wizard at Large (Magic Kingdom of Landover)","review":"Brooks makes this one very lighthearted as well, which is nice.

During the incantation Questor sneezes and instead of tranforming him, he transports him. To Earth and in the castle/fortress of the original heir to Landover, Michael Ard Rhi. Much had been made of this guy in first two installments and Terry Brooks does not disappoint. This is one of the authors best villians. Ben immediatly crosses back over to go get him. Willow comes along. Leaving Questor in charge, hence the title of the book. Questor now has the task of recovering a magical bottle complete with a evil bottle imp that is reeking havoc in the land. All thanks to the filthy and meddling G'home Gnomes, Philip and Sot.The one thing that I have always liked about this series is that in the beginning, the hero is just as clueless to the world Landover as the reader. The world starts off small and Brooks is great at adding layer after layer with each book. The last book was more focused on the character growth of Ben. Here it concentrates more on Questor, Abernathy and, surprisingly, the ambiguous River King. There is a great battle between wizard and dragon, but there is also another incident that happens on earth that, while good, strains belief even for a fantasy. All in all, a great book and fans of the series will not feel cheated. Makes you definitely want to get the next one."},{"Title":"Wizard at Large (Magic Kingdom of Landover)","review":"I loved how Brooks split the story between Ben's old world and Landover, especially since Willow and Abernathy were exposed to the good ole' USA; though I hated to see Willow suffer. If you are a fan of the Landover series, you'll love this third installation. As usual, there is lots of excitement and tension going on between characters. I feel for Abernathy's longing to be completely human again...seeing as how he is the central character in this story. Wizard at Large also gave me a little more respect for Quester's magic capabilities...I said for his capabilities, not for him; he's messing up as usual in this story, so the comedic part of the Landover series carries on. Bottom line, Brooks fans won't be disappointed, but they usually never are:)"},{"Title":"Wizard at Large (Magic Kingdom of Landover)","review":"The landover works are very well done, with stand out characters.

I keep listening to the Landover CDs hoping to get past Cameron Beierle's horrible readings and I can't.Apparently the original audiobooks were done by \\"Dick Hill\\" and released on cassette only. These new CDs suffer greatly from issues like:*Frequent mispronunciations of words (Foliage becomes \\"foilage\\" for instance);*a completely phony sounding \\"hard boiled detective\\" voice for Ben Holliday (I am convinced Beierle is NOT a native english speaker as he often rolls his Rs or makes a soft \\"D\\" instead of an \\"R\\".);*Randomly changing pronunciations of character names (the fairly simple word \\"paladin\\" is usually mispronounced \\"puhLADin\\" although in book 2 he freely changes back and forth between the two pronunciations.*His female voices are atrocious. Willow sounds like Carol Channing imitating Marilyn Monroe's \\"happy birthday, mister president\\" performance. Willow pronounces \\"Ben\\" something like \\"Byeeeeehn\\".Wizard at Large particularly suffers from having inappropriate pauses in the middle of passages where one would expect an editor to remove the dead space. In fact the whole series seems like nobody did any kind of production oversight or direction of the audiobooks at all.On the plus side, Cameron does a fine job with second and third tier characters like Questor Thews, Abernathy and the G'home Gnomes."},{"Title":"Wizard at Large (Magic Kingdom of Landover)","review":"Ben Holiday is settling in quite nicely in Landover. All seems to be going as he planned, more or less. Nothing, however, stays that way when the wizard Questor Thews is around. Although Questor always has the best of intentions, his grasp of his magic leaves much to be desired.Thinking he has finally mastered the magic to turn Abernathy, the king's court scribe, back from dog to human, Questor attempts this feat and fails miserably. Not only did he not change Abernathy back, now Abernathy is missing, along with the king's medallion. In his place is a mysterious bottle. A quite dangerous bottle.This series keeps getting better for me. Each book outdoing the previous. I dont see a lot of growth in the characters, but the stories are entertaining and keep me coming back."},{"Title":"Pcs for Dummies","review":"I was a &quot;dummy&quot; when it came to pc basics. I wanted to know Ram, rom, whats on the motherboard, etc. I wanted to know my Dell 4100 inside and out. Thanks to Mr. Gookin's excellent book, I am on my way to becoming very good friends with the very computer that once intimidated the heck out of me. He talks in, depth (but doesnt go so far as to confuse the beginner with a lot of geek jargon), and with humor, all you need to know about your computer so you can feel confident about using it. Youre not going to be a techinician when youre done with this book, but after reading it, you will be able to go to the local computer store with confidence and talk their language and not get the runaround. If every computer were to come with an instruction book, this one should be it!! Hats off to Dan Gookin and IDG books for such an excellent book. I look forward to reading Upgrading and Fixing Pc's For Dummies next!"},{"Title":"Pcs for Dummies","review":"I have been working with computers for a number of years and I am still mystified by all the computer hardware, software, jargon, acronyms, properties, claims, capabilities etc. Most of what I have learned has been through experimentation, reading Dilbert, and pleading for advice. Dan Gookin's book PCs for Dummies has been a great help in demystifying the world of PCs. After breaking down and purchasing this book, I realized just who the &quot;dummy&quot; was.The format of Gookin's book is unique. It is well written, humorous, and very informative. Best of all, PCs for Dummies actually makes reading about computers &quot;nerdless.&quot; The book is broken down into 34 chapters and covers everything from turning the computer on (power-up) to the Internet. Each chapter covers a specific piece of hardware, software, and/or computer function. Individual chapters are further subdivided into sections. For example, Chapter Eight is titled, &quot;Just Your Basic Computer Guts.&quot; Subsections include, The Mother of All Boards, The Microprocessor, Connectors for Things Various and Sundry, Expansion Slots, Tick Tock Goes the Clock, and The Bios. I would love to tell you how it ends, but I am forbidden to do so by Amazon.com guidelines.The best attributes of PCs for Dummies are that the book can not only be used as a reference source, but can also be used in place of a phone book to interrogate surly computer gurus. You don't have to read the entire book before using your newfound knowledge. Just turn to that particular section for which you need help, read, and press &quot;Enter.&quot;PCs for Dummies teachs how to use computers based on the learning philosophy of &quot;Constructivism.&quot; Whoa! Basically, Constructivism is a philosophy in which learners acquire knowledge through active participation in their own learning; and by connecting the new knowledge to knowledge that they already possess. In other words, once you have learned basic computer tasks, you can &quot;construct&quot; or build upon that knowledge to learn more advanced computer operations. I subscribe to this learning philosophy and employ it into my teaching with excellent results.All good things must pass and so must this review, but not before some constructive criticism. I would have liked Mr. Gookin in PCs for Dummies go into a little more detail about specific topics, as many topics are just touched upon. Well maybe not many, just the ones in which I needed help.

He was commercial photographer who specialized in studio shots of antiquities and he died in 1991.Signs, by their nature, seem to be a magnet for photographers. Those who worked for the FSA/OWI during the Depression and early war years frequently did shots of vernacular and commercial signage in the landscape and on buildings. Lee Boltin follows this tradition but with a lovely twist: he searched out signs that had an element of humor and irony that the creators might not have realized was there. Some are obviously deliberate, like BLIND MAN DRIVING on a van for a blind and awning company but what is one to make of MICKEYS GRAB & GROWL JOINT above a diner, STEREO TAPES FOR PEOPLE WITH TWO EARS above a record shop or ICE-COLD HAIRCUTS on a barbers pole.The book has a hundred photos, mostly close-ups of the signs and as the book was published in 1959 the layout reflects the neat and tidy design style of the day, fortunately none of the photos are angled or overlap each other. This could well have been one of the first books that only had sign photos. A lovely unpretentious title full of warm sign humor. The signs probably disappeared years ago.>>> LOOK INSIDE THE BOOK by clicking 'customer images' under the cover."},{"Title":"A Place Apart: A Cape Cod Reader","review":"Robert Finch combed the history and literature archives to compile this definitive sampler of more than 150 Cape Cod essays, poems, and book excerpts. Only a few of the selections run longer than a dozen pages, so this is a perfect volume for browsers. The writings are grouped by topic, and Finch first provides appropriate background and explanation for each section. More than mere introductions, these summaries draw on his vast knowledge of the genre and include asides that reveal his own wry wit. Skim through these pages and you'll proceed from early settlement histories and biographies, to whaling and seafaring, to Cape Cod nature and summer vacations. My favorite episodes are about the activities of the \\"mooncussers\\" and the \\"wreckers\\" who throughout the years salvaged remnants from the inevitable shipwrecks along the dangerous coastline. (Probably more than 3000 ships have been grounded and/or lost around the peninsula's circumference since 1627.) There truly is something for everyone here. Finch thoughtfully provides mini-bios of all 67 writers and always notes sources; so if a particular entry strikes your fancy, you'll be able to track down the original work for more in-depth reading.

The thick apostles then ruin it. All they could leave us is the music -- lyrics and melody together than synergistically capture a certain energy -- but it's only a small taste of what they offered and what they meant. Mr. Lange's presentation demeans that experience -- he took his preconceived self-help template and squeezed Beatles lyrics and quotations into it. This book amounts to just yellow matter custard."},{"Title":"The Beatles Way: Fab Wisdom for Everyday Life","review":"I'm a huge Beatles fan, and have read all the books on the market about the Fab Four. I thought I'd seen it all, so I didn't think I'd like this new &quot;self-help&quot; styled book.Wow - was I wrong! Because I LOVED it! For the first time, I see the Beatles legacy actually helping me to live my own life in a more powerful, creative and joyful way.The author knows his stuff, I learned several things I never knew about the Beatles. The author especially captures the spiritual essence of our dear-departed beloved George Harrison, and clearly shows his impact on the group and the world.PLUS - &quot;The Beatles Way&quot; is never boring or preachy. It's a fun read, and Lange puts the &quot;Yeah!&quot; into the &quot;Yeah Yeah Yeah!&quot;Get this book! I bought six copies for my friends and kids - it's the only self-help book I ever found useful! Kudos and thanks to the author for this breath of fresh air."},{"Title":"The Beatles Way: Fab Wisdom for Everyday Life","review":"This excellent book is just like having the Beatles act as your personal instructors in the areas of self improvement and awareness. It is a literary magnet; it will draw readers repeatedly and remain well loved. It is well researched and I like the way the author is able to apply Beatle quotes and Beatle themed concepts to a myriad of issues. The author compliments his readers' intelligence; his book is a fresh gem of Beatle input that will delight everyone and not just avid Beatles fans.In the words of the great Paul McCartney, \\"I'm so glad our songs were about love, peace and understanding.\\" I think this review can be summed up with a quote from John Lennon: \\"Imagine all the people living life in peace.\\" Ringo's levity from 1964 also can be applied here when he says of his hair that \\"it's stuck on good and proper.\\" This book will stick to your mind, good and proper. George Harrison's wisdom can be applied here as well with his 1965 classic, \\"Think For Yourself.\\" That's what makes this book so wonderful. It really makes you think and come away with insights you might not otherwise have considered.This book is serious, fun and inspirational, yeah, yeah, yeah!"},{"Title":"The Beatles Way: Fab Wisdom for Everyday Life","review":"I was able to get an advance copy, and I have to say - it's really an amazing book. Unlike tons of other Beatle books, &quot;The Beatles Way&quot; focuses on the Fab Four's lifestyles - and how we can model those lifestyles to enrich our own.The quotes from the Beatles that underscore the seven &quot;principles&quot; of Fabness really spoke to me - it's like having John, Paul, George and Ringo as personal life coaches.I especially like the action items (called &quot;You're the Fifth Beatle!&quot; at the end of each chapter)- here's where I can take action on what I've learned and it really works! Positive lessons like keeping a sense of humor, and taking time to dream the way the Beatles did - gave me a fresh start to the day.Great concept, great book. I highly recommend it for self-help fans, and not just for Beatle fans."},{"Title":"The Beatles Way: Fab Wisdom for Everyday Life","review":"I picked up this book quite by accident as I was shopping in a natural food store in London. I never tried many self-help-style books before - so my opinion was neither positive or negative. But I took a chance. I read this book in an afternoon (recently) and have re-read bits of it each day since. I carry it with me to read when I have a moment during the day. The principles are universal and can be applied to every area of life. My life was different the very first day I tried applying these principles. They are simple; not easy, but simple. If you wish to gain peace in your life and be more comfortable with yourself, others, and the universe, read this book and learn to apply its suggestions in your everyday living. This book is on my all-time great list -- I'm going to make sure I'm never without a copy. May it be a blessing to others the way it is to me."},{"Title":"The Beatles Way: Fab Wisdom for Everyday Life","review":"Once in a while, a personal-growth book comes along like a breath of fresh air with a unique concept. &quot;The Beatles Way&quot; is one of those books. What better way to think about how we live our lives than using the Beatles as roles models? They lived every dream and had every success they could ever wish for. This book reveals the details on exactly how they did it - and how we can dream big and live big too. I'm completely a fan of The Beatles - and now - I'm a huge fan of &quot;The Beatles Way.&quot; For a fun and &quot;fab&quot; live - get this book - it's a must-have."},{"Title":"The Beatles Way: Fab Wisdom for Everyday Life","review":"I'm a longtime Beatles fan since the sixties, and have read many many books about the great group. But I have to say this book is compelely different from the rest. Larry Lange has done a beautiful job in the research and in lining up quotes and stories that comprise the seven fab principles. The book has already helped me re-think my priorites in my life, because I was becoming bored with the way it was going. The book really got me motivated to try some new things, and I feel excited again. The spirit of the Beatles soars through the book &quot;and you know that can't be bad!&quot; Get this book right away! It's great to be fab!"},{"Title":"The Beatles Way: Fab Wisdom for Everyday Life","review":"I discovered this great book during a visit to Manhattan recently and I flipped! On the spot, I bought three more copies for my kids and friends for holiday gifts.&quot;The Beatles Way: Fab Wisdom For Everyday Life&quot; has a highly original but simple concept to follow - To present the Beatles' accomplished lifestyles as models for our own.The author clearly shows how we can emulate the Fab Four in striving to live out our own dreams. For instance, I learned quite a lot about how the Bealtes approached spirituality, and I've taken their lead and am now studying meditation. This one breakthrough alone has changed my life dramatically for the better!And I can see how this book will effect my older son (an aspiring filmaker)- as he can learn to model the Beatles determination and willingness to work hard to accomplish set goals - without giving up.The author also talks about the women in the Beatles lives - and I came away with a new appreciation for Yoko Ono and Linda McCartney.The book is fast-paced - sort of like &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; in a book - and I can't say enough good things about it. Buy this book - you'll treasure it for years to come, and you'll &quot;Meet The Beatles&quot; in a whole new light!"},{"Title":"The Beatles Way: Fab Wisdom for Everyday Life","review":"This is a superb book that brilliantly explains how The Beatlesrose to the top using all of the success principles that today'ssuccess gurus preach.It has alot of interesting tidbits about TheBeatles that you won't find in most books about them.It is a combination of motivation,inspiration, and history. 5 stars is not enough for this great book."},{"Title":"The Beatles Way: Fab Wisdom for Everyday Life","review":"I love this book! And it's not just for Beatles fans either.

They don't like self-help books at all, I'm sure they're going to love this one, as the Beatles are people they respect and admire."},{"Title":"The Beatles Way: Fab Wisdom for Everyday Life","review":"All I can say is...WOW!!!....I Really enjoyed reading this ...Eventhough I'm a Beatles fan...even non fans will get a kick out of this book!.

The heroine, Anne Biron, who is visiting from America, finds herself at the center of an art-theft plot - embroiled in part because of her uncanny resemblance to the Countess Marie-Claire d'Aspremont, 300-years-dead patroness of the village, whose heir, a handsome count, owns the priceless Monets....

I highly recommend this title to both the beginner, as well as the advanced hobbyist."},{"Title":"Values and Ethics in Social Work: An Introduction","review":"You make it too darn difficult to bother with as I do not have the time you seem to require."},{"Title":"A Regency Christmas Carol (Super Regency, Signet)","review":"This heart-lifting volume collects the storytelling talents of some of Signet's most beloved Regency authors, all spinning tales with Christmas carols as a central part of the yarn. These talented ladies pack into less than one hundred pages each an emotional wallop that is rarely found in novellas--sure to please even readers who do not usually find the depth they hope for in anthologies.Mary Balogh starts us off with &quot;The Bond Street Carolers&quot; in which Lord Heath, who dislikes Christmas, stops in his tracks on Bond Street to hear a boy's angelic voice raised in song. Lord Heath decides that this young man must perform at his annual winter concert--but the boy's mother, Fanny Berlinton, does not want her son exploited. Little Katie Berlinton sees the tall man enjoying her brother's singing, and renews her wish for a Papa for Christmas. Even readers who do not normally care for children intruding on their romance will be enchanted by the parts these two take in this delighful story.In &quot;The Earl's Nightengale&quot; by Edith Layton, a young woman pawns a musical mechanical bird left to her by the grandmother she never met--a gift that her grandmother said would bring her happiness. When she goes back a week later, as promised, to pay the loan and reclaim her heirloom, it is gone. She catches up with the Earl of Elliott, who purchased it, because it is her only link with her grandmother, and because she and her mother could certainly use some happiness right now. Ms. Layton's Nightengale is a charming gift to her readers, topped with an extra-special bow of an ending.Next up is Elisabeth Fairchild with &quot;The Mistletoe Kiss.&quot; On St. Thomas's Day, five days before Christmas, governess Constance Conyngham is convinced by her young charges to take them &quot;a gooding&quot;--but they did not expect to encounter Lord Deleval at The Devil's Keep, and everyone was even more surprised when he showed up the the bell-ringers' rehearsal. This is a heartening story of two wounded souls who can perhaps heal each other.In &quot;Make a Joyful Noise&quot; by Carla Kelly, Lord Wythe is charged by his mother to help recruit new choir members for the annual competition between the churches of the neighboring shires. One of his first requests is to Rosie Wetherby, but soon he is ent ranced by more than just her beautiful voice... and Ms. Kelly's readers are entranced as well with the relationship that blossoms.Anne Barbour concludes this collection with &quot;Melody&quot; in which American Josh Weston, now Earl of Sandbourne, meets his match in Melody Fairfax, companion to the dowager countess. We are emotionally involved from the beginning as we watch these two meet and quickly find a fearsome affinity towards each other. In a collection of masters of the Regency subgenre, Ms. Barbour shines as the star atop the tree.Kimberly Borrowdale, Under the Covers Book Reviews"},{"Title":"A Regency Christmas Carol (Super Regency, Signet)","review":"A Regency Christmas Carol, a collection of seasonal stories written in the spirit of gentle romance . . .Mary Balogh: \\"The Bond Street Carolers.\\" Grade: A-A delicate, lovely story. All little Katie Berlinton wanted, for Christmas, was a papa. Of course, she told everyone, who asked, she wanted a doll. Because in her little heart she knew that was what they wanted to hear, but in her prayers she asked for a daddy. Mary Balogh delivers a beautiful seasonal story in THE BOND STREET CAROLERS. The author writes her tale using little Sarah's point of view, an idea which proves to be ingenious.Edith Layton: \\"The Earl's Nightingale.\\" Grade: BA gentle story. Impoverished Eliza Dumont sadly pawns a family heirloom - a delicate golden cage, containing a tiny jeweled bird. Truly, an exquisite piece shimmering with magic. Hopefully Eliza will reclaim this token of love. A token of love from her grandmother. But alas, the shop's unscrupulous proprietor sells Eliza's dainty treasure. The buyer -- the roguish Earl of Elliot. The author's clean writing style spins THE EARL'S NIGHTINGALE into a very nice holiday read.Elisabeth Fairchild: \\"The Mistletoe Kiss.\\" Grade: CGood heavens, THE MISTLETOE KISS is a dark dreary story. Constance Conyngham is the governess of Leland Manor and a lonely widow. Her husband, of three months, was taken by the unforgiving sea. Lucian Deleval is soured with memories of a runaway bride, for Lucian Deleval was abandoned at the matrimony altar. On the 21st day of December, Mrs. Conyngham's three small charges think Lord Deleval is in need of some blessed goodness and they employ their governess to help them deliver the honor. This story is too melancholy for the joy of the Christmas season.Carla Kelly: \\"Make a Joyful Noise.\\" Grade: A-A beautiful story. This is the Carla Kelly I love to read - poignant and touching. Peter Chard, the Marquis of Wythe, lives the life of a doting father, a successful landowner, and a very lonely man. Lately, Peter Chard finds himself intrigued by a woman. A woman he sees every day out walking on his estate. Who is she? She is the lovely widow, Rosie Wetherby. Ms. Kelly does a fine job in MAKE A JOYFUL NOISE. Her characters are well drawn and real, her words are touching, and her story is truly divine.Anne Barbour: \\"Melody.\\" Grade: A-A bright, uplifting story. Reluctantly, American born Josh Weston realizes he is the Eighth Earl of Sandborne. Gently-born Melody Fairfax is a lady's paid companion. The lady she serves is Josh Weston's aunt. Josh Weston arrives in England with American views and reasonably disregards the stringent English social rules. He falls in love with his sweet, gentle friend -- Melody. Well done; MELODY is truly a \`make you feel good' read. Ms. Barbour presents a wonderful style of writing -- descriptive and smooth.Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada."},{"Title":"A Regency Christmas Carol (Super Regency, Signet)","review":"I am a fan of this writer and now I have almost all her books I am trying to find her short Christmas stories."},{"Title":"A Regency Christmas Carol (Super Regency, Signet)","review":"Several years ago, I started a Christmas tradition for myself, and have been looking forward to it every time that beautiful season rolls around: reading Christmas romances, whether they are novels or short story anthologies. I especially enjoy reading Regency romances, since I am an ardent Anglophile, and love the period in which Jane Austen produced her masterpieces.This particular collection contains stories by some of the best authors in the genre, and is a real gem! What makes it especiallywonderful is the fact that all of the stories revolve around music. Of course, music is central to the celebration of this, the most beautiful, joyous, time of year.The first story is by one of my favorite writers in any genre -- the incomparable Mary Balogh. In \\"The Bond Street Carolers\\", she presents the sweet tale of Fanny Berlinton, a widow with two children, one of whom, Matthew, is a talented singer. He's part of a choir that sings on Bond Street, in London, during the Christmas season. Busy, handsome bachelor Roderick Ames, who is also Baron Heath, happens to be passing by when he hears Matthew's beautiful voice. Not particularly fond of Christmas, he had been looking forward to a holiday by himself, without the commotion caused by his numerous nieces, nephews, and young cousins. Everything changes, of course, when he encounters this young singer, and the singer's very attractive mother... This is a very beautiful, truly romantic tale that will touch any romance lover's heart!The second story is no less enchanting than the first, especially because there's actually a bit of magic in it. Penned by another great Regency writer, the late Edith Layton, this story is titled \\"The Earl's Nightingale\\", and concerns a jeweled, mechanical bird in a golden cage, which, unbeknownst to the characters, sings the listener's favorite piece of music every time the music box is wound up. It's an heirloom from Eliza Dumont's grandmother. She's a young woman who lives with her mother on the fringes of the disreputable section of London. Her mother had been disowned by her aristocratic family because she had married beneath her, against their wishes. So Eliza has pawned the golden bird in hopes of raising some money for the upcoming holiday season. Eliza's grandmother had sent a letter, along with the bird, in which she stated that this bird would bring Eliza happiness. And so it does, since, because of the bird, Eliza meets and falls in love with Frauncis, the Earl of Elliott, and he with her...Elisabeth Fairchild penned the third story, which is titled \\"The Mistletoe Kiss\\". The female protagonist, Constance Conyngham, is a governess as well as a widow, while the male protagonist, Lucian Deleval, is a wealthy earl who was dumped by his bride, while waiting for her at the altar. Lucian is, naturally, a very bitter person, and prefers the solitude of his castle, which has been given the name of \\"Devil's Keep\\", by the people of the neighboring town. Lucian is even said to be the devil himself. But all this changes when he meets the sweet widow Conyngham, who offers to teach him to become a bell-ringer for that year's Christmas Eve church service. In the process, the earl and the widowed governess will discover love, in a very compelling story with touches of Jane Eyre.\\"Make a Joyful Noise\\", by Carla Kelly, which is the fourth story in this collection, deals with the dilemma encountered by St. Philemon's Church, which is not blessed with a talented Christmas choir. So, Louisa Chard, the Dowager Lady Wythe, has volunteered to help the vicar to find great singers for the choir, which participates in an annual Christmas singing competition with other parish choirs in the area. But alas, Lady Wythe is suddenly called away to help her daughter nurse her sick children, so her son Peter takes it upon himself to look for singers. Thus it is that he accidentally discovers a very talented soprano -- Rosie Weatherby, who is the third widow in this collection. She has no choice but to live with her in-laws, who have nothing but contempt for her. Peter Chard, however, comes to appreciate her not only as a great singer, but as a gentle, sweet-tempered woman who will gradually steal his heart... This story is another winner! I especially loved Emma and Will, who are Chard's children.I love the simple title of the fifth and last story in this volume -- \\"Melody\\", written by Anne Barbour. The title not only refers to music, but is also the first name of the female protagonist, Melody Fairfax, who is a lady's companion. Her employer is the Dowager Lady Sandborne, a countess, who receives an unexpected visitor one afternoon -- the American Joshua Weston. It turns out that Weston has inherited the title of Earl of Sandborne, and has come to take a look at his vast estate. He fully intends to return to America once he has satisfied himself that everything is in order. But then he meets Melody, who has a beautiful voice (and is not a widow). Weston is a very talented pianist, and, of course, they make beautiful music together... Needless to say, this is another lovely Christmas tale! It's also interesting how the two cultures -- American and English -- are contrasted throughout the story, with a very harmonious (pun intended!) blending of both in the end.If you love this period in English history as much as I do, you will definitely enjoy this wonderful collection of stories! Aside from the historical setting, however, each of these holiday tales is a gem, sparkling with the true Christmas spirit! Each is beautifully written, with very well-handled characterizations. In fact, I would have loved to see each story expanded into a novel! I loved all the characters, the plots were cozy heartwarmers, and yet, none of the stories were overly sentimental. This book is a treasured member of my overflowing \\"book society\\" (my personal library), and I will most likely be reading it again during future Christmas seasons! I recommend it very highly for all of those who love the combination of Christmas and romance!!"},{"Title":"Caught in the Web (Madison Finn #4)","review":"This book deserves 2 thumbs up and 5 stars!

Wolcott"},{"Title":"The Day Pearl Harbor Was Bombed: A Photo History of World War II","review":"Make no mistake about it, The Day Pearl Harbor Was Bombed is a book for young readers. It does not treat its historical material deeply and adults might be better served getting their information from a different source. With that in mind, the book is surprisingly comprehensive in its breadth of coverage and relatively accurate at that.With regard to the book's scope, it covers most of the major events young readers should be familiar with when studying World War II. It outlines the rise of the Nazis in Germany and Japan's early aggression in China and the Pacific. It covers Hitlers conquests in Europe, his failures in Russia, and his defeat. It covers the attack on Pearl Harbor, American bombing and submarine efforts against Japan, and the surrender of both belligerent powers to the Allies. In all, from the invasion of Poland to the surrender on the USS Missouri, the book is accurate and fairly comprehensive.If I have on strike against it, it is that it fails to take into account the dark cloud that Soviet expansion into eastern Europe brought. Defeating the Nazis was important, but the Russian methods of doing so were particularly deplorable.But, I digress. The book is a good introduction for young readers and I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"The Day Pearl Harbor Was Bombed: A Photo History of World War II","review":"I was searching for a book to give me a short history of World War II.

Guaranteed. Triplett's first collection demands her readers full attention and then delivers with finely accomplished and fiercely intelligent work.There are no delineated sections or subject headings in Triplett's book to separate autobiography from mythology, or divide religious questions from those relating more explicitly to carnal desires. For the reader, the result of this borderless poemscape is that the voice of the prophetic eventually becomes one with the voice of the everyday. In this way, Triplett echoes the accomplishments of the renowned Irish poet, Eavan Boland. Both women seem to insist on the intermingling of myth and memoir, of the ordinary with the ordained. Both women take on the blockbusters of literary tradition - - The Bible, The Iliad and The Odyssey in order to infuse the female characters - Eve, Queen Dido, and Persephone with seemingly more complex roles than they enjoyed in the original telling.However it is in the smaller, more personal poems: a young woman mourning her grandfather, a daughter imagining her mother's miscarriage, a lover caught in the too bright light of morning, that a more interesting voice appears on the page. In these poems, &quot;On Pattern,&quot; &quot;Stillborn,&quot; &quot;Spectral Dues,&quot; and &quot;Portraits at the Epicenter&quot; Triplett is at her best giving us a world of form &quot;and &quot; feeling. In &quot;On Pattern&quot; the following lines are not confined to the rituals of mourning. &quot;the family at your death keeps to form, having to act out that love of endings.And again, in these lines: &quot;. . It's the formal silence we love. The hush that's planned, the good answer.&quot;Poems and funerals are peculiarly similar in that they attempt to contain the uncontainable. Both construct a vessel for grief. Certain patterns of words, structures of lines, specified silences present themselves in both practices. These stanzas reverberate throughout &quot;Ruining the Picture.&quot; Triplett is clearly concerned with a multitude of forms -- art, myth, photography, and religion. All are considered and framed in her work. There is a compulsion to see beyond the forms, to discover the spaces and silences hiding within accepted traditions and by the same token a fear of 'ruining' what Triplett keeps close to the heart with too much 'light.'In &quot;Portraits at the Epicenter&quot; light is again under scrutiny. The dim light of memory, the camera's flash, the overbearance of bright sun, and the grotesque bomb light of Hiroshima are all juxtaposed. Again and again these images are snapped, cut, and flashed across the page. How to hold on to memory, how to tell the story, frame the photo, are questions posed without any comfort of answers. In &quot;Stillborn,&quot; perhaps the most emotionally charged poem of the collection, the narrator re-tells the story of her mother's stillborn child, &quot;the phantom child you also would have named Pimone.&quot; The voice is equal parts rage and despair, a wounded cry begun before birth.&quot;I wish we could tell one another what it is the stubborn flesh asks of us. For now all the issue I can offer is to dedicate the silence of this night to you and the shadow child that wasn't let to swim for the shore of his own voice the one who taught how little you could get from the botched scrawl of matter ...&quot; Sometimes silence is the best we can do. And yet the craving for communication remains, even if it is only scrawled matter, even if it is 'only' inscribed in the formal beauty of poems such as these. In &quot;Ruining the Picture&quot; we are introduced to an agile and adept new voice. A poet we can expect to hear more from. Pimone Triplett teaches in the Program in Creative Writing at the University of Oregon."},{"Title":"Ruining the Picture","review":"Pimone Triplett's work is well-crafted and crafty, graceful in its execution and stunning in its display of an imagination that is large and powerful. The language in these poems is beautiful, and there are poems here that make one swoon. This collection reads more like a third or fourth book; it is difficult to believe it is her first. It isn't often such a poet arrives. I suspect we will continue to see such striking work from Ms. Triplett in the future. One can only hope for such riches. // C. Dale Young, Poetry Editor, NEW ENGLAND REVIEW"},{"Title":"Ruining the Picture","review":"Pimone Triplett's poems defy easy categorization. Perhaps this is because she allows her poetic subjects to evoke different aspects of herself. Her identity shifts as it is wed to each poem's subject through a highly idiosyncratic relationship that is, in the end, about language. If you are tired of poems that scream for attention like spoiled children, or ingratiate themselves to you like abused dogs, then here are poems whose language and musicality invite you in as an equal welcome guest and tend to your mind and heart."},{"Title":"Ruining the Picture","review":"Pimone Triplett's poetry is like a really beautiful, really smart girl you fall for...at first you are so in awe of her beauty and the wonderful things she says and does that nothing else matters. Then you realize that you don't understand most of the things she says, but she's still so beautiful and they are wonderful things she's saying. Then you realize you're not really connecting with her well, though maybe you're learning something by being around her.You know how it goes. Eventually, you have to break it off, because you're just not right for each other. You're not really relating, you're just pretending for the sake of beauty and profundity. It might work for someone more beautiful and smarter than you are, but you need someone more on your level.It was fun while it lasted, you learned some stuff, but definitely not your best love."},{"Title":"The standard operas: their plots, their music, and their composers,","review":"This book has synopses for 73 popular operas by 27 composers. There's a short bio of each composer, and a little background info on each opera, like the date of the premier and maybe the original cast. Unfortunately the table of contents isn't active, but it never is in these free books. The free sample should show you the entire table of contents so you can see which operas are included. This book is the 12th edition, published in 1897, but the author's preface is dated 1885, so that must be why there's no Puccini.

The short bios of the composers are also nice to have.I thought it might be useful to give a list of the composers and operas for which synopses are given. I have attempted to use the titles as they appear in the book (without umlauts and accent marks though). This list also appears at the beginning pages of the book. Sometimes there is a slight difference between the title at the beginning of the book and the title used in the text.

Thanks."},{"Title":"The Black Mountain (Nero Wolfe)","review":"Someone has murdered Nero Wolfe's best friend Marko, owner of Rusterman's, the only restaurant Wolfe will frequent. More than food is at stake -- Marko and Wolfe share a mysterious history in their birthplace, the mountains outside Sarajevo. Marko is one of the very few who Archie has heard call Wolfe by his first name. Wolfe sets out to find the murderer and the adventure leads back to the Black Mountain, the place of his origin. Wolfe puts out more physical exertion in this one book than in all the others put together, which is one of its charms. But what really works for me is that he casts Archie in the role of his son for the sake of their cover story -- bringing to the front some of the subtle aspects of their &quot;normal&quot; relationship in the old brownstone. It's a stretch for everyone -- readers included -- but the emotional borders are widened as in no other Nero Wolfe novel, and the result is extremely satisfying. Stout's brilliance has, in my opinion, al! ways resided in great measure in his ability to suggest the emotions of his characters through a small action or phrase that lets the reader in without spelling it all out. In &quot;The Black Mountain&quot; Stout has brought to the surface the truth of the Archie/Wolfe relationship in full color with absolutely no pandering, and no cheapness."},{"Title":"The Black Mountain (Nero Wolfe)","review":"There are more flaws in the plot than in my golf swing, but because of the theme, the setting, the emotion, and the close constant interaction between Wolfe and Archie I loved it."},{"Title":"The Black Mountain (Nero Wolfe)","review":"While I greatly enjoyed reading the Black Mountain, it was, in part, the fact that it was so different from the other novels that I found it fascinating. Throughout the series there are somewhat vague references to Wolfe's life before coming to the U.S. This novel fills in much of that back-story, and gives the avid fan a better idea of what makes Wolfe tick. However, I would have to agree with reviewers who don't recommend this book to someone new to the series. It is not consistent with the rest of the novels in the series in setting or tone, and is best enjoyed by those who appreciate the difference, as well as the additional insights into Wolfe's character and background."},{"Title":"The Black Mountain (Nero Wolfe)","review":"If you're new to Rex Stout and Nero Wolfe, you couldn't pick a worse place to start. However, if you already have an appreciation for the Nero/Archie banter and the nuances of the relationships with the minor characters, then you'll enjoy seeing them painted on a very different canvas, as far from the brownstone as they ever got.This book is neither as bad as the 1- and 2-star reviews suggest, nor as good as the 5-star reviews (including that of the audiobook's narrator, oddly) claim. I enjoyed it, but only because I've made my way through 80% of Stout's Nero Wolfe novels and novellas. As others have noted, Mr. Pritchard's voice and flat accent doesn't match up to those in the late, lamented A&E; series."},{"Title":"The Black Mountain (Nero Wolfe)","review":"Having firmly established the rules of Nero Wolfe's first few books, Rex Stout felt free to force Wolfe to bend or break some of his rules. Other than In the Best Families, Stout never forced Wolfe to break so many rules as he did in The Black Mountain.Wolfe's lifelong friend Marco Vukcic is killed and Wolfe leaves the Brownstone in a cab to pay a visit the crime scene and goes to question witnesses. Then, tracing Marco's murder to his support of Montenegrin rebels opposing the Yugoslav Government under Tito, he and Archie fly to Italy and cross the Adriatic an old boat and begin a hike to the place o f Wolfe's birth under assumed names with no passports. Archie doesn't speak any of the languages, so he has to rely on Wolfe's translations to even let us know what is being said.This is definitely not the typical Nero Wolfe story, which is what some people don't like about it. However, I thought this story worked very well. It was thought provoking in many ways, not the least of which was how much of Wolfe's eccentricity was put on as he abandons many of them in order to complete this mission to track down Vukcic's killer. We also have a few hints of what Wolfe's life was like before he departed for America. Stout as he does in countless novels, breathes life into his setting.Stout's Yugoslavia is a Cold War backwater where you don't know quite who to trust and the oppression of the Communists has cowed the Montenegrin people, a fact that clearly pains Wolfe. The story is filled with intrigue and espionage on multiple levels.The story does lack the same level of influence for Archie. There's no girl for Archie to chase as he can't understand one word of the languages, thwarting any romantic inquiries. Archie also gets little chance to mouth off to authority except in the first few chapters which are set in New York.However, this is one novel where the spotlight is rightly on Nero Wolfe, who shines. The story encounters Wolfe dealing with his most personal loss. Wolfe, ever the master of words, uses action instead to show his feelings about Marco as he travels half way around the world to bring Marco's killer to justice. Of course, words come in handy when, in the face of the lawlessness dominating his homeland, he decides to get killer back to the United States trial without extradition. To achieve this, he has to create one of his most elaborate and risky rouses he's ever undertaken. And even then, the action doesn't let up until the final page."},{"Title":"The Black Mountain (Nero Wolfe)","review":"As a Nero & Archie fan for many years, I was delighted to see the Nero Wolfe novels become available on the Kindle -- and I would buy every one of these mysteries if it weren't for other readers' reports about typos and inept proofreading. Rex Stout deserves better treatment from his publishers."},{"Title":"The Black Mountain (Nero Wolfe)","review":"I have read all but one Rex Stout Nero Wolfe book. I admit to being a Wolfe addict but this one I almost did not read given its premise-in this case I was not prepared to believe six impossible things before breakfast. No reviewer mentioned that Wolfe's adopted daughter was actually murdered near the &#34;Black Mountain&#34; in the title. This finally gets Wolfe moving but perhaps if he had been more reasonable when his daughter met with him she might still be alive. Unless you decide to read every Wolfe novel by Stout, I suggest you give this one a pass and read some of his best many of them among his earlier books."},{"Title":"The Black Mountain (Nero Wolfe)","review":"It takes the murder of his closest friend to get Wolfe up; not only out of his chair but out of the country.

A MUST READ for Nero Wolfe fans."},{"Title":"The Black Mountain (Nero Wolfe)","review":"I'm an avid Wolfe fan, but this sucked. Even though Stout dashed off a few that were marginal, there was always an impossible mystery to be solved and the conflict between the rascal Archie and the egotistical Wolfe to keep it lively, while Stout worked the old formula. There was none of that here. This was a revenge plot that he tried to make happen with his familiar, decidedly non-vengeful, characters. And he sends them to Italy and Montenegro, but gives no evidence of even having bothered to look those countries up in an encyclopedia to give us some description of the foreign locales. Bad as this is, it's not as bad as &#34;Under the Andes&#34; (a non-Nero Wolfe tome) in that it's much shorter."},{"Title":"The Black Mountain (Nero Wolfe)","review":"This was a great story.

Nero Wolfe, as always, makes me very hungry. The mystery is pure Wolfe, and I always love to see it when he gets personally involved."},{"Title":"The Black Mountain (Nero Wolfe)","review":"When Nero Wolfe's good friend, Marko Vukcic, is murdered on the streets of New York City, Wolfe is propelled out of his beloved brownstone. But, it soon becomes apparent that Vukcic's murder is not to be found in New York. Vukcic has long been involved with a group supporting Montenegro's independence from Yugoslavia, and Wolfe soon gets word that his murder is \\"in sight of the Black Mountain.\\" And so, it's off to Montenegro for Wolfe and his sidekick, Archie Goodwin. But, it's a strange and different world over there, and it will take all of the pairs intelligence (and luck) to avoid an untimely death themselves!This is a very good Nero Wolfe book, but quite different than the others that I have read. The unmasking of the murderer is not done through great feats of intelligence by Mr. Wolfe, but through a sort of deus ex machine. That is a bit disappointing. Indeed, the book has more of the feeling of a Cold War spy thriller than a detective novel.But, that said, I did enjoy this book just as much as I have the other Nero Wolfe stories I have read. It's different, but different can be good once in a while. If you like Nero Wolfe, I think that you will like this book just as much as I did!"},{"Title":"The Black Mountain (Nero Wolfe)","review":"This novel has structural problems. The Nero Wolf series is interesting because 1) Nero Wolf is an eccentric, who is able to behave as he wishes toward everyone. 2) The interaction between Wolf and his long-suffering fellow detective, secretary, and general factotum, Archie Goodwin, is an interesting relationship. 3) The setting is interesting. The old brownstone with its 10,000 orchids, all male inhabitants, overseen by the eccentric Wolf, is unique. This novel is not a detective novel: it is a revenge tale. In consequence, there is not much detection going on. It becomes more like a spy novel, and if this novel is any indication, a genre that Stout should avoid.The Black Mountain has none of these characteristics. By setting the novel in the defunct country of Yugoslavia, Archie Goodwin is effectively silenced since he cannot speak the language, and so the relationship between Wolf and Goodwin is effectively muted. This novel is not a detective novel: it is a revenge tale. In consequence, there is not much detection going on. It becomes more like a spy novel, and if this novel is any indication, a genre that Stout should avoid.Because Wolf needs others to carry out his revenge, he cannot be the eccentric diva that demands everyone follow his demands. He needs the help of others, which puts him in the position of changing his personality.Stout attempts to gloss over both the setting and the structural handicaps he has given himself as a writer by making the terrain difficult and detailing Wolf's many physical discomforts. Unfortunately, these distractions don't work. But, then, it is a Nero Wolf mystery, which redeems a rather pedestrian novel."},{"Title":"The Black Mountain (Nero Wolfe)","review":"Okay, I confess I'm having great difficulty rating this book. It probably deserves three stars because of the improbabilities and flaws in the plot. On the other hand, it has some of the greatest scenes in all of Wolfe-dom, because they are so unusual and because readers get to see Wolfe in a new light. After Wolfe's best friend, Marko Vukcic, is murdered, and Wolfe's adopted daughter, Carla Lovchen, is also murdered, Nero takes a plane to Yugoslavia, Archie in tow. Here, in Montenegro, the country of Wolfe's birth and youth, the fat detective speaks the language, and Archie doesn't. Wolfe knows the terrain and Archie doesn't. Wolfe knows the foods, Archie doesn't. On and on it goes, and some of the scenes are quite funny, as when Nero and Archie spend the night burrowed into a haystack. If you enjoy the Nero Wolfe novels, I recommend you read this book, but only after you have read at least ten of the ones published before this one, so that you know Wolfe in his brownstone element and can better appreciate him out of it. Otherwise, what will stand out is the weak and improbably plot."},{"Title":"The Black Mountain (Nero Wolfe)","review":"....sure broke the rule this time. We all know about Nero Wolfe...eccentric, overweight, beer drinking, orchid growing, house-bound genius....he hires others to get his data, then figures it all out from the comfort of his custom made chair. Rex Stout based his \\"American Sherlock\\" on Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock's older, more brilliant, brother who only appears in two of the stories...[and, actually, Wolfe left the house a number of times over his 40 year career].It may be silly to avoid giving away the plot here; anyone reading this probably has the story memorized, and is just looking for a replacement copy. But, I can say that this is the most \\"personal\\" of the Nero Wolfe books; Wolfe had few friends...when the oldest, and closest, is killed, there is no limit to what Wolfe will do to assure proper justice under law. In many ways, it is the most complicated of the stories, but a grand master like Rex Stout had no problems keeping everything clear....One regret...when staying over in Rome, Wolfe is asked to meet with the ambassador; after commenting that the ambassador is \\"a woman\\", he declines. She isn't named, but Clare Boothe Luce was quite famous when this was written...Stout probably had valid reasons for not using Mrs. Luce as a \\"fictional character\\"; I think it would have done Wolfe a lot of good, and provided us some fun, for him to meet a woman who was more than a match for his intellect...just a thought."},{"Title":"The Black Mountain (Nero Wolfe)","review":"One of the best \\"Nero Wolfe\\" mysteries. Rex Stout is in full prime."},{"Title":"The Black Mountain (Nero Wolfe)","review":"I guess Stout wrote this to wrap up some historical questions that are referenced in the prior books. Unfortunately the story and the circumstances don't do the job. Almost all of this could have been covered in a flash back mixed in with another, better told story.There is little of the wry relationship between Archie and Wolfe and the constant interpretation of different languages makes the telling cumbersome. Early in the story Atchie essentially asks the question - Why am I here?. It is apt; the story could have been told without him. Even the ending is unsatisfying - with so much detail in the prior pages, the ending just sort of happens.More unbelievable is the physical exertion Wolfe is supposed to have undertaken. In all the other books he can barely get his own beer. Now to have him trek through some very rough, mountainous terrain with just a few foot sores is patently unbelievable. This is a good book only if it is the last one you read of the Wolfe series and you are desperate for more - as I was. Disappointing at best."},{"Title":"The Black Mountain (Nero Wolfe)","review":"I went to my bookshelf collection of Nero Wolfe books and pulled this one to reread, after many years. Why? I'd read Tea Obrecht's THE TIGER'S WIFE (just named as one of 2011's best) about Yugoslavia and had read Geraldine Brooks' PEOPLE OF THE BOOK, about the Sarajevo Haggadah and politics in that corner of the world, and thought it would be interesting to see what Stout had written back in l954. Absolutely fascinating! Reading all three very different books gives a fuller appreciation and understanding, not that it would hurt to read a non-fiction book for ALL the facts.As far as this book goes, it is an anomaly in the Wolfe canon. Unlike all the other books, Wolfe not only gets out of the house but out of the country. To see him engaged in such exotic pursuits as hiking a mountain in the dark and negotiating with the Yugoslavian secret police in their language is a treat. Stout handles the change in language very easily, with Wolfe telling Archie what was said after the fact. This helps the book flow smoothly but one is never in doubt that the setting is different and exotic. As usual, Stout has various red herrings along the way, nods to Wolfe's brilliance and Archie's iconoclastic personality - and the actual mystery is fascinating. Lots of humor and sarcasm from Archie which is always fun.I wouldn't recommend this as a first book by Wolfe since it really does help to know the cast of characters from other books. However, it is a very good stand-alone read if you happen to pick it up.

In this story, even more than usual has to be thrown out the window.That Nero would be loyal to Marko Vukcic is understandable.

While you appreciate Wolfe's passion and commitment, the setpieces Rex creates for him are beyond Wolfe's described capabilities.So, OK, even if you accept these sudden shifts, you then have to cope with a really hackneyed plot and very contrived and stereotypical situations \\"behind the iron curtain.\\" If you wanted that, you could read John LeCarre and get much better writing.Skip it.

Dr. Dalrymple shows how to do this nicely by focusing on promoting profound congeniality between one person and the other and concentrating on looking for ways that benefit both sides in a business relationship.

Besides the physical effect, the psychological impact on me was devastating. I prowled the Net looking for books or Web sites that addressed the problem and found that while there is considerable advice on PCa and treatment, the effect on the man and the relationship was, by comparison, ignored so I built a Web site to fill that gap.In the two years since, I have become intimately familiar with the problem that men and couples face and can say that \\"Making Love Again\\" is one of the very best resources for any couple that must face the sexual effects of PCa treatment. What is exceptional is that the perspective of the companion - in this case, Virginia - is foremost. Every woman who lives with man effected by treatment should read it. She, and Keith, have filled a need and have recorded it with a style and honesty that is equally rare."},{"Title":"Making Love Again: Hope for Couples Facing Loss of Sexual Intimacy","review":"For Virginia the decision seemed easy, Keith's fear of becoming impotent from the prostatectomy was irrational in relation to the possibility of dying. How could he even think that being able to have sex was as important as living? For Keith the decision was not as easy. With his male ego wrapped up in the decision and the importance of being able to have sex with his wife it just was not as simple. After deciding in favor of the operation there was a lot of adjustments to be made and Virginia found that things were a lot more complex than she had imagined.In \\"Making Love Again\\", Virginia and Keith Laken invite the reader into their personal lives and the difficulties they faced as a result of his prostatectomy. Their thoughts, fears, hopes, and disappointments are laid bare to the reader as they openly discuss deeply personal questions and feelings. If you ever wanted to know what it is like to deal with impotence in a marital relationship this book deals with the emotional struggles that are not normally discussed openly. The power of a loving commitment, strength for the challenge, and hope shine through as well as a true commitment to help others through the copious listing of sources of help in the appendix.Readers should be cautioned that because this book necessarily discusses sexual intimacy between two people some may find it too graphic at points. On the other hand, it shows the extent to which the authors are letting the reader into their personal lives. \\"Making Love Again\\" is a very highly recommended book for those going through concerns about a prostatectomy or any sudden impotency of a permanent or temporary nature."},{"Title":"Making Love Again: Hope for Couples Facing Loss of Sexual Intimacy","review":"14 years after my husband's first diagnosis of prostate cancer I learned several facts in this book, but, most important, for the first time it has made me begin to believe that things CAN be different for us if we both choose to work at it.Diagnosis. Treatment he chose and I said I'd support was radiation and we *thought* we'd been told about all the possible longterm effects. NOT SO! Six years later I saw a vital, athletic, physical man feeling totally becoming afraid of, tense about, uninterested in our previously-fabulous sex life. Finally, this week when I read this book, we learned that some impotence develops much later from radiation than from surgery, but it *will* develop!Then depression. Deep. Sullen. Withdrawal from interests and from me. Our physician prescribed medication and counseling. The counselor saw him *once* and said, \\"Go home and don't be so passive!\\" Flat, flat affect. No joy. But he kept *trying*, bless him!Then four years ago recurrence! It took my husbandover 6 months to choose a treatment and he only did so then because our doctor and I insisted on it! Surgery. At our city's outstanding cancer center. SUCCESS. His PSA is undetectable.He does have some mild incontinece.The surgery team introduced us to Muse. It worked 90% for us and the team was very excited for us. We used it once. Once in 3 1/2 years! From then on my husband has just refused to act on sex, talk about sex.I've tried everything. I've begged my husband to return to the team and ask them for direction. He couldn't bring himself to do that. We grew farther and farther apart. My heart was breaking. I felt unattractive and sad and rejected.Last week I read this book. I finished it in two sittings. And I was deeply touched and am now full of hope and new courage. When I handed it to my husband I only said that it was the most important thing that has happened to us in 14 years. I said it has touched me deeply and asked him to read it this week so we can discuss it next weekend. He promised he will read it tonight.....but, interestingly, he has gone to bed early not feeling well. Whether it's another \\"avoiding\\" or a real headache I won't know but a few days. But I really believe that when he does read it he will see he's not alone. He'll see we are not alone.Right now I'm going to order several copies. I'll give one to each of our adult children so they'll know where we've been in our marriage. One will go to our surgery team to share with patients. Another will go to our family doctor so she can read it and have more personal knowledge of what prostate couples go through.This is one of the five most important books in my life."},{"Title":"Making Love Again: Hope for Couples Facing Loss of Sexual Intimacy","review":"This book is written by a husband and wife who continue to experience permanent impotence as a result of prostate cancer sugery. The book is structured like a \\"diary\\" with dated entires over a several-year period written separately by both husband and wife who are honest about their fears, disappointments and frustrations. It does not dwell on the surgery itself, but focuses on the post-surgical successes and disappointments as they try to engage in sexual relations using various options. It focuses on the loving relationship between the spouses, but it is also realistic about sexual needs -- from both partners' perspectives.My husband is a young 65 and I am 46; we read this book out loud together about 9 months post-prostatectomy surgery, and it was tremendously helpful to both of us. After the surgery, the doctor had told us that impotence was unlikely in our situation, so we were not prepared for it. The book was particularly helpful with dealing with the disappointment we both felt in this regard. The book also helped us to see that most couples have to struggle with several alternatives for intimacy over a lengthy period and that not every option works for every couple.The book was not at all preachy, but instead was subtly encouraging to my husband to be open to trying a wide variety of options that we probably would not have considered otherwise. (It does not suggest anything kinky). It gave us information that allowed us to resume [drug-induced] intercourse, which we believed was physically impossible.A big relevation for me was that impotency is not always an \\"all or nothing\\" concept. I had no idea how discouraging it can be for a male who simply doesn't know whether he can or cannot physically perform -- or whether he will ever be able to.The theme of the book is not to quit looking for satisfactory ways to experience intimacy and sexuality -- whatever that may look like in your personal situation. It does discuss a very intimate topic, but it does so in an honest way and it was not as difficult to read outloud together as I had expected. It gave us detailed information that we did not know and that we would never have felt comfortable asking for from our physician. Having read the book, we knew what the doctor was talking about when he suggested various options.I definitely recommend this book, regardless of the reason for the impotence issues. I think it would be most useful for a couple -- it is written by and for heterosexual couples, but it would be equally applicable to homosexual couples as well. In my opinion, the book would be less useful for singles, although it could be helpful for a single female who is considering or is in a relationship with a male with impotence issues. It would be a wonderful addition to a urologist or gerontologist's waiting room."},{"Title":"Making Love Again: Hope for Couples Facing Loss of Sexual Intimacy","review":"I read this book because my father is impotent from prostate cancer.

Bravo Lakens!"},{"Title":"Making Love Again: Hope for Couples Facing Loss of Sexual Intimacy","review":"The information in this book is not easily found anywhere else. Most books deal with the causes of ED and eventually some of the resources available. This one deals with the 'consequences' of ED and the emotional turmoil and suffering ED brings. In the case described in the book it was caused by an operation to remove a cancerous prostate, but whichever the cause, the emotional consequences of ED are the same. This books talks very frankly and openly about the man's and his wife's emotions and struggle to regain a degree of intimacy. From that point of view it can be very useful and be of great help to every man suffering the problem.Towards the end, the story appears a little sugar-coated, because it is not clear what degree of intimacy can be gained if the man can neither have orgasms nor ejaculate and his libido is very low. In addition the penile injections don't work for ever for everybody. But all in all it can be very useful and informative to any man suffering from ED and a wife or loved one that will necessarily become involved in the problem."},{"Title":"Making Love Again: Hope for Couples Facing Loss of Sexual Intimacy","review":"I read this book and was just heartbroken, for both Keith and Virginia. I too am a prostate cancer survivor. I was diagnosed at age 48 two years ago with Gleason 7, 11 of 12 cores positive with over 95% cancerous, stage T3A. My urologist recommended surgery, just like Keith's did.As an engineer, I looked for a better solution and found it. I did not want to end up with a life like Keith's or the countless other men I know who are impotent due to prostate cancer surgery.I found the Dattoli Cancer Center in Sarasota, FL ([...]) and went there for treatment. They immediately determined my cancer had spread beyond my prostate and was in my lymph nodes. They offered me a cure without incontinence or impotence, and after two years I am cancer free, and still able to make love to my wonderful wife.Their treatment is called combination therapy as you undergo initial 4D-IG-IMRT radiation treatments, followed by brachytherapy (seeds), followed by more IMRT treatments. If you are at high risk like I was, they also put you on a hormone based therapy to weaken the cancer during the radiation treatment and beyond. Dr. Dattoli has a better than 85% 15-year cancer cure rate while taking on patients that no one else will even consider.At this treatment facility they spare your nerves so you don't have the impotence issues that almost destroyed Keith and Virginia's life in this book. No incontinence, and no more cancer. If minimal side effects and a total cure for cancer are important to you, contact the Dattoli Center. I don't work for them, only a alumni cancer patient.

This is a mature, touching, exciting and complicated novel which will stay with you."},{"Title":"Street Raised","review":"Pearce Hansen is my best discovery yet on Allan Guthrie's Criminal-E blog, [...]This is a terrific read about young Speedy who is released from Pelican Bay State Prison in North California and returns to East Bay, Oakland. Here Speedy hooks back up with his brother Little Willy and best mate Fat Bob and sets out to settle old scores and to make some new ones.This is a story about life on the street, drugs, crime and simply surviving. The characters may not be people you'd want to take home to meet your mother but Pearce writes his tale so well that you can sympathise with these three guys and even like them as they battle with the daily challenges of their lives. They all show their soft sides, but more often than not their choices are aggressive and violent. There are terrific scenes throughout the book that give you real insight into each of the characters.The other great feature about Hansen's story is the significant role that East Bay plays. On multiple occasions I was searching Google Maps to get a closer look at the locations that Hansen was describing (which are thousands of miles from my home in Australia). A great read from an author I had never heard of before. I will certainly be looking out for more of his work."},{"Title":"Street Raised","review":"Having recently been released from prison in upstate California, Speedy hitchhikes home to Oakland to reunite with his brother, Little Willy, and best friend, Fat Bob. Unfortunately, during Speedy's time away Little Willy has fallen into a life of crime and crack, and Fat Bob's working as a bouncer in some of the area's rougher establishments. Not exactly what Speedy hoped to find.When two of the group's longtime friends get rolled by a Mexican gang - tied up in chains and thrown into a river...alive - Speedy and the crew know things have to be put right and set out to make it so. Of course things aren't that straightforward.Along the way Speedy gets distracted by a woman, becomes the target of a racist gang, and the obsession of a very disturbed (and disturbing) killer. Matters are further complicated when the same cop who sent Speedy up the first time starts sniffing around the crew with ill intent. Taking place over the course of one tense, action-packed week, Street Raised by Pearce Hansen is a truly remarkable read.Perhaps the most stunning thing about Street Raised is its duality: from the reader's point of view, the violent, seedy version of the East Bay the story unfolds in is completely alien to anything they've most likely come to imagine it as. Yet, to Speedy and his friends - and enemies - that human wasteland is as normal as it gets; it's simply home. So much so, there are times when the book flows so smoothly, the characters so well defined and dialog coming so naturally, you almost forget there is a story being told, instead feeling like you're peeking in on the lives of real people. And then gears get shifted, violently, and you are reminded of the harsh reality that is Speedy's world, and that it's a brutal one you want nothing to do with...outside of a book that is.That Hansen manages to make something both so vividly foreign and familiar at the same time, and with such ease, is truly an amazing bit of writing."},{"Title":"Street Raised","review":"Pearce Hansen has some how combined a fable, a gritty street crime story and coming of age tale seamlessly into one novel. It is deep and richly textured with characters that will live with me for some time to come. Along with the human and feline characters there stands the East Bay as a living breathing organism. Hansen knows his turf and writes with clear eyed passion about it. My only word of caution is, it took me a bit to fall in love with this book, after a chapter or two though I fell hard. Damn fine writing."},{"Title":"Street Raised","review":"Speedy's one compelling character, I tell you. I published a slew of Speedy stories in our first run of PLOTS WITH GUNS, and I love Hansen's crazy world in STREET RAISED.

It wouldn't surprise me, were I to analyze it more thoroughly, that John D. MacDonald, Donald Westlake, and Robert Parker tales of hard boiled modern day knights, treacherous scoundrels, and sloe-eyed vamps and the assorted skullduggery sum and sundry found themselves enmeshed within had as much or more to do with my becoming a horror writer than the bloody works of King or Barker.Nonetheless, some crime fiction cuts a hell of a lot closer to the bone than others, a good example being the raw and somewhat horrific exploits of narcoleptic PI Mark Genevich in The Little Sleep and No Sleep Till Wonderland by Paul Tremblay.More recently, I got into a book called Street Raised by Pearce Hansen. This novel is a beautiful and horrifying proposition. Hansen's writing evokes an almost paralyzing aura of authenticity. His description of prison life and the life of a brutal con after he's been turned back out onto the street, or \\"raised,\\" following a stint of hard time, is neither for the weak-kneed nor the prudish. Hansen's depiction of human predatory wildlife is sharp, yet neither glorifies nor condemns its subject. More like he's simply clicked on the camera and the secret microphone and allows nature to take its course. All told, this novel in following the grim and all too human exploits of an eclectic cast of thugs, murderous drug dealers, kamikaze bouncers, phone psychics with hearts of gold, and, most prominently, the freshly raised Speedy as that urban prowler returns to his Bay area hunting grounds, contains more bloody darkness in one pinky than ten times its weight in typical category horror fare. I'm one jaded fella when it comes to shocks in literature, and I was gratified at how many moments Street Raised raised my hackles or caused me to reread a paragraph because I couldn't quite accept that I'd seen what I'd seen. Hansen's delivery is nothing like Cormac McCarthy's, but this novel possessed a few visceral and nasty surprises that put it in the same territory of viciousness and macabre grandeur as Blood Meridian.There is something of Michael Shea's street beat poetics in Hansen's rhythmic prose, and maybe a tab or two of whatever psychedelic Cody Goodfellow mixes into his morning joe, and maybe even a slight hint of what it would look like if Wambaugh stopped giving a rat's ass about anyone else in the entire world, hitched up his suspenders, spit into his cupped palms, and then grabbed an axe and started in with blood in his eye."},{"Title":"Street Raised","review":"\\"He pulled the straight shooter from his lips, torturing himself with anticipation as he watched a tiny tendril of crack smoke waver from the mouth end of the pipe. The scent of it excited him more than the sight of a naked woman as he watched the crack smoke dissipate into the air, a little piece of Heaven wasted.\\" -- from Street RaisedFew crime fiction writers have actually lived through the same events they put their characters through. For most, writing noir is an opportunity to experience illegal behaviors from a safe distance, things they would never dare to replicate because they don't have to. Pearce Hansen is the rare breed: he has run the same streets and struggled through the same precarious existence his characters do. For Hansen, writing is a kind of catharsis: it helps keep the nightmares away.From the bio included with Street Raised, we learn that Hansen was \\"functionally homeless at a young age,\\" and that he did a lot of self-educating through reading a variety of books: \\"he counts Thucydides & Spillane, Dostoevski & H.P. Lovecraft, Dickens & Nietzsche among his dear dead friends.\\"Street Raised is his debut novel, but it is not the work of a beginner. Hansen has been honing craft in short-fiction circles (including the now-defunct Plots With Guns) for ten years, and it shows. The story of Speedy and the aftermath of his release from Pelican Bay State Prison (far too much happens for me to even attempt a summary) displays a sure hand that knows what a good story requires: relatable characters, detailed settings, a clearly defined arc, and a satisfying ending.It is in the spaces between, though, where Hansen's experiences and innate knack for storytelling shine through: There is no distancing from these people; we get up close and personal with their ways of life. Street Raised is filled with situations that could only be described by one who has seen them happen up close. That immediacy translates onto the page, resulting in at least one character who is thoroughly disturbing. (If you thought Begbie from Trainspotting was troubled, just spend a few minutes with Ghost.)But make no mistake, Street Raised is not a memoir; that doesn't suit Hansen's needs here at all. He simply brings the rawness, the grit, and the upfront humanity to a genre that has, over time, gotten far too glossy. Hansen's unflinching (and completely engrossing) take will change how you feel about other crime writers. Kudos to Allan Guthrie and PointBlank Press for offering a forum to a powerful new voice, and to Hansen for writing what is without a doubt the most affecting crime novel of the year."},{"Title":"Street Raised","review":"depicting the life of a couple of likeable misfits in California's Bay Area in the mid 80's.The characters are very well fleshed out and the story has soul, pace and , I suspect, a lot of autobiographic elements ( could the Author be Will, I ask ? ).Absolutely worth reading and enjoying, for its in \\"your face \\" reality and the unreproachable prose.Why not 5 stars, then?

In fact, his STREET RAISED was first published by Point Blank, and reprinted in a longer version which I've just read. I loved STREET RAISED. Speedy is an ex-con who has gated out and returns to his old stomping grounds in Oakland, CA. Times have changed. It's now the 1980s, and STREET RAISED abounds with those pop references and music. The street culture and history of San Francisco come alive. Pearce also excels at capturing the vivid settings. Moreover, his characterizations are nuanced and sharp. The separate plot threads merge with great skill. Though hardboiled and gritty in tone, STREET RAISED also displays its tender side, starting with Speedy's white kitten, Pearl. The prose style is distinctive, reminding me, at times, of early Ellroy. What can I say? This is a top fun read if you're a crime fiction buff.flag"},{"Title":"Street Raised","review":"Once you accept that there's an deep issue with the use of qualifiers, this is actually not bad at all, but boy does it ever get in the way sometimes. The story in itself is really solid and revolves around a visceral grudge, which is cool. Whenever the writer dropped his guard and weeded out his prose, it became highly enjoyable. The interactions in between Speedy and the police officer Louis being the most interesting passages sometimes. Also, Pearce Hansen has a knack for establishing a sense of place. The urban sprawl doesn't get any better than this in crime fiction. Worth a try, especially at the price it is on the Kindle Store."},{"Title":"Street Raised","review":"Street Raised by Pearce Hansen is a basic revenge drama set in the grimly depicted environment of the East Bay area in California in the early 1980s. Oakland street hood, Speedy, gets released from a prison in the northern part of the state, shoeless. He ventures home, encountering a few adventures and picking up a kitten along the way. In a long opening chapter, we see the complex mix of violence and compassion that makes up the protagonist's character. Once home, Speedy reunites with his younger brother, Willy, who's become a crack addict during Speedy's long incarceration.Willy's wretched descent prompts Speedy to enlist a friend, Fat Bob, who bounces at seedy bars, to liberate Willy from his addiction and squalid residence. The three then conspire to vanquish a gang of Mexicans who recently killed two other friends in brutal fashion. These Mexicans are sitting on a pile of money too, so there's profit as well as revenge motivating this action. Stealing from criminals is essentially a victimless crime, or at least one that makes it easier for the reader to root for Speedy and his gang. Despite Speedy's inherently criminal nature, he has a desire to get off the streets and live a conventional life, one in which he can take care of his kitten and Carmel, a woman he falls in love with. Other encounters with street characters inhibit his goal. Violence and tragedy ensues, much of it grisly, along with a deliciously graphic tour of Oakland.The Oakland setting often steals the show but this is Speedy's story. A nasty fellow portrayed heroically, larger than life. He almost instantly attracts enmity and admiration from other characters, such as the creepy and underutilized Ghost, and his lover, Carmel. The unlikely quickness of these bonds could have worked had it not been for the novel's slow pace. The sheer volume of back story and reflection of so many characters diluted the inherent and delightful viciousness of the story.The pace also suffered from the frequency and irrelevancy of many authorial intrusions. An extreme example is when Speedy and Carmel are holed up in motel, trying to evade a gang chasing them. It's a tense situation but for some reason the action is interrupted with several paragraphs describing what's on television. The surprisingly high number of proofing errors puzzled me considering a much briefer version of this book was published over five years ago.Street Raised was a frustrating read for me. It was just way too long. It's unfortunate because there is entertainment value here, particularly the comprehensive and uncompromising depiction of Oakland, which was often surreally riveting, like a mural. As in the following:***The apartment itself was a den of skinheads and bootwomen, at least a dozen lounging about with beers and cigarettes in their hands. Butts and empty bottles and cans littered the floor; decks and longboards stood lined against the wall. The walls were festooned with flyers for punk shows, numberless out-of-date banners for past hardcore gigs around the Bay, for local bands like Fang and Urban Assault, Bad Posture or Flipper. There were holes punched in the walls, which were covered with graffiti, mainly three-legged swastikas, racist comments, spray painted obscenities and declarations such as \`Bay Area Skinz Rule!' A bootwoman with a lit cigarette dangling from her mouth was cooking food bank spaghetti at the kitchenette in the far back corner; an overflowing garbage can stood next to her.***The aura exuded by such passages is the book's biggest strength, just as Oakland is its best character. I liked how the author didn't hold back on the graphic violence, which was never gratuitous. Within Street Raised there is a gritty jewel of a novel that needs to come out, a rough diamond that needs a great deal of cutting and a significant amount of polishing to bring out its shine."},{"Title":"Street Raised","review":"Too often addicts and criminals get homogenized into stock characters, with tired cliches and played-out scenes (ala hookers with gold hearts, one last shot at redemption, etc.). Not in Street Raised. I uploaded this on my Kindle on a whim, because I saw Hansen's name in the same noir circles I run in, and am a sucker for San Francisco-based stories (or across the bay in Oakland). I liked the description, thought I'd be getting a decent read. I wasn't expecting this though. The world of Speedy and Co., the hoodrats and dealers, the crooks and tough guys, the depiction of life on the street is spot-on. The writing zips along, never drags, and Hansen's portrayal of Oakland and beyond and its urchins and castoffs is at once loving and nostalgic and unflinchingly honest. Street Raised is not about easy answers, because this world has only tough questions, and the morality here is graded on a curve. Intentions matter to guys like Speedy, because sometimes it's all they got. Speedy proves a unique and lovable hero you can root for (which when you read this book, and you should, you'll see is one tough trick to pull off). I lived on these streets for a long time. Redemption is possible from there, but it's one crooked path out. Speedy embarks on it, and Pearce Hansen mines humanity from the profoundly wounded in a world very few know. In short, he gets it right."},{"Title":"Street Raised","review":"This is a fast-paced ultra-modern thriller, spare and compact. As I was reading I could easily imagine it as an animated movie, perhaps because the author has written a harsh and psychologically intense crime novel as if it were a comic book.

Kudos, and please make a movie of this book!"},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences","review":"This is an excellent book for undergraduates in science and engineering.

The mathematicians were concerned with procedural processes where the mathematical techniques were asimportant, if not more so than the resulting formula. The physicists, on the other hand were concerned with using that formula to describe what's happening. Now the situation is even worse as computers have come in to allow the use of numerical techniques in many areas of physics that can be treated in a completely different by the mathematicians.There seems to be a trend to develop math and computer science courses to be taught in the science departments. This is the course in math to be taught by the physics department. It strikes a nice balance between procedural math and cookbook physics.This is the third edition. It has been updated based on feedback from requests. There is also additional information on the use of personal computers. She points out to students buth the usefulness and the pitfalls of computer use in most topics."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences","review":"I took Mary Boas' course in mathematical physics at De Paul in the late 50s. Her lectures were excellent and I learned all the math I needed as a physics major. This book is an outgrowth of her lectures, very clearly written and very comprehensive. It is intended to teach physicists how to do physics, not to teach mathematicians how to do math. In other words it is heavy on physical applications and lighter on mathematical axioms and theorems.I still use this book (I own the 2nd edition) whenever I need to refresh my knowledge of any topic in mathematical physics.Warren Wolfe"},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences","review":"Is it just me or are all textbooks boring and filled with tedious equations and unhelpful examples written by egotistical and elitist authors of their field? Well not this one! I found this book indispensable for all of my physics classes! Clear and concise, out of the 3 classes that required this book (a series), I was able to completely teach myself from this book at least for the first class (covering the first third of the book) without help from confusing lectures. I reference it constantly for almost every class and I highly recommend using tabs or sticky notes to bookmark equations frequently used (I even suck at memorizing equations I use daily lol!)So if you have a class that requires this book, be thankful because it is a fantastic supplement for lectures and other books. If it's suggested as optional supplementation, get it!! This is one book I will not be selling back any time soon - totally worth the bucks!"},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences","review":"A Comprehensive Reference of Math Techniques up through the Calculus of VariationsA rare math book that includes a comprehensive collection of the techniques most used across the field of the sciences, from complex numbers, to vector analysis, to ordinary and partial differential equations, up through the calculus of variations and beyond.Each section is carefully organized with easy to understand derivations, beautifully selected examples and a graduated set of problems to be solved at the end of each section, with selected answers to many of them.While it could easily be used as an advance math course for undergraduate science and other non-math majors, including engineers, it is solid enough to also be used as an early course for math majors. Although, I would have preferred seeing probability theory introduced twice: once in its elementary and applied form early on and then later, (as is done) in the more advance introduction to probability density functions.That nitpick aside, this is a first class scholarly effort and a winning combination for anyone who needs an excellent reference or a refresher course in college mathematics.Five stars."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences","review":"Let me start off by saying, I have essentially covered every single chapter (with the exception of the multivariable calculus section, I took a separate course on that), and every single section in a 3-quarter mathematical methods course as part of my physics undergraduate requirements. And let me repeat this again, this book will make a man out of you. After you conquer this book, you will be on your way to conquering all undergraduate physics with ease; mathematics will no longer be a problem and the real learning of physics will begin.1. Infinite Series, Power series:Great coverage of series and series representations of functions. Introduces several methods of determining convergence or divergence and techniques to convert essentially any function into a series as well as determining accuracies in representations. These are invaluable tools to solve difficult and non-analytic functions that show up everywhere in physics.2. Complex Numbers:A great introduction to complex analysis, starts off slow and easy and picks up the tempo with powers and roots of complex functions. This chapter is missing a discussion on the argument of a function and its meaning and kind of sweeps under the rug a few more technical things that a real complex analysis course would cover but nevertheless well done.3. Linear Algebra:The linear algebra section is pretty solid as well and it went a bit further than my regular linear algebra course. The placement of planes and lines is a bit awkward and doesn't really deal with matrices in the sense that you don't need to write out matrices but still an appropriate spot. It is missing some discussion on abstract vector spaces and doesn't delve too deep into the theoretical side of things; a mild discussion of group theory ends the chapter.4. Partial Differentiation:(No comment - did not cover)5. Multiple Integrals; Applications of Integration:(No comment - did not cover)6. Vector Analysis(No comment - did not cover)7. Fourier Series and Transform:A great section to learn about fourier series, usually special series are left out of real analysis courses (or covered only slightly) but in physics we use these a lot. You learn how to represent oscillatory systems as a superposition of waves, that is a series, which is a really neat idea, at least to me. My only complaint is that the fourier transform is only limited to one section and I think it's a bit more important and deserves a more in depth discussion.8. Ordinary Differential Equations:The bread and butter of physics. No matter what you do in physics you'll always encounter ODE's. Even if you have never seen them you might be surprised to learn that a simple equation such as F = ma is, in fact, a differential equation. It gives you the tools you need to solve the problems you will encounter and gives you discussions on how to solve special cases that occur frequently in physics. It ends with Laplace transforms (related to Fourier transforms), convolution, dirac-delta functions (mathematicians cringe at our use of the term function here), and greens functions which are a bit more advanced topics but great introduction and are definitely worth looking at.9. Calculus of Variations:The most important principle you take out of variations is the principle of least action. Once you start doing big boy physics you'll be calculation Lagrangians and Hamiltonians to easily solve for systems. Definitely a good mathematical approach to variations and something that will be essential throughout physics.10. Tensor Analysis:I didn't really cover most of the chapter, and what I did cover was in such a short amount of time that I can't possibly write a review without being biased. All I have to say though, is that for those General Relativity lovers, this is going to be your best friend.11. Special Functions:As the chapter title itself says, these are just formulas and quick derivations for a variety of special functions that are everywhere in physics. You don't necessarily need to study these in great detail as they only help you solve integrals, but they are of some theoretical interest. Definitely a must read chapter.12. Series Solutions of Differential Equations; Legendre, Bessel, Hermite, and Laguerre Functions:Solutions to partial differential equations everywhere, and I mean everywhere. Chapter 12 and 13 go hand in hand, first you learn the math stuff in chapter 12 without really knowing it's purpose and then jump into chapter 13 and find out these are solutions to partial differential equations. Just like ODE's, these are essential and found everywhere in physics. This chapter is very meaty and full of solutions to differential equations and chances are, if you ever run into a differential equation in your undergrad career the solutions are here.13. Partial Differential EquationsSee chapter 12 summary, they go hand in hand.14. Functions of a Complex VariableI still think this is an odd location for the second part of a complex analysis course, ideally I would have preferred right after chapter 2 or possibly 3 but nevertheless a good coverage and sum of complex analysis. You learn how to solve some really nasty integrals in a really trivial way using complex analysis.15. Probability and StatisticsArguably the worst of all chapters, at least in my opinion. The notation convention Boas uses isn't the most intuitive or the most frequently used and the explanation to some of the probability problems are not really helpful. Some are more naturally talented in probability, I however, am not thus found this chapter to be really annoying and confusing. Still, something worth knowing and if it works for you then let it be.Overall this is a book I will be using for years and will keep coming back for years. It's not exactly mathematics and it's not exactly physics it fits that missing link between the two and helps clarify topics in advanced mathematics that will be useful in all undergraduate physics. I'm glad I went through this book and having seen these things at least once, even if I didn't understand it fully initially, definitely helped give me the courage to tackle my undergraduate physics courses. I recommend it to every physics student."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences","review":"I'm using this book to prepare myself for a PhD in physics I'll be starting in the fall.

The material is very well explained, doesnt use alot of baffeling notation, gets straight to the point, and is completely self contained. I have learned alot from this book and I reccomend it highly."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences","review":"Taking a Mathematical Methods course is kind of walking a grey line between math and physics - many of the parameters surrounding your actual physical problem are abstracted away to focus on the mathematics. A similar problem exists for the converse in math textbooks (particularly calculus textbooks) which try to include the details of a physical problem to set up mathematical equations.Boas' book is a happy medium, and a far cry from the horrible textbook that plagued everyone in my undergraduate course. The class actually petitioned the instructor to change the textbook from the one assigned to this one. It's a little on the easy side, but it certainly doesn't lack in the detail or rigor one would expect from a math textbook, nor does it ignore physical applications and explanations like one might expect from a math textbook. Given the price at which I purchased it, I am very happy.That said, the quality of the manufacturing is poor for the (new, unused) version I received. Leaflets of pages were actually loose and fell out of the book as I thumbed through it.. There was a hole in the middle of one of the pages - I don't even know how that happens.

As a mathematician, I am used to seeing Theorem this and Proposition that with clear mathematical definitions. In this book, however, everything is explained in English and formal mathematical definitions are rarely given.For instance, take the definition of moment of inertia: \\"The moment of inertia I of a point mass m about an axis is by definition the product ml^2 of m times the square of the distance l from m to the axis.\\" Why not use mathematical notation to define this? This is just one example of a problem that plagues this book.Reading this book and trying to use it to solve problems is difficult because you are forced to read through the author's long explanations and scattered examples. Rather than making things succinct and easy to understand, the author insists on giving long run-on examples with necessary information scattered throughout.

Buy the hardcopy instead. I want my money back."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences","review":"This is a widely liked and used textbook. I sometimes call it \\"a high-school book about university-level math\\". It takes a bottom-up approach, which is how high school math is taught. University level math is normally taught top-down, and for this reason (among others) I personally do not like Boas, although other people do. Frankly, I can't understand what people like about it. I think it is full of thumb rules, mnemonics, and old-wives tales (no disrespect intended to female readers), and it appears to me almost like the author thinks the reader is stupid or something. E.g., Boas explains that a physicist (unlike an engineer, seemingly) should be comfortable with the unit imaginary number denoted by either i of j. Wow. They should also be equally comfortable with mass being denoted by m or M. (I'm being sarcastic, if you're not sensing it.) Another gem (of which there are many) is that the student should not memorize the formula for the triple vector product. Sounds great, no? After all, why should any formula be MEMORIZED? Real physicists don't memorize formulas. They understand them, and know where to look them up when they need them, if they don't want to rederive them. But then Boas explains why, and the explanation is so ridiculous I think it is actually amusing: Boas argues that if the triple product you need to calculate has vectors denoted by other symbols than A,B,C, the reader might be confused if they memorize the formula with these mathematical symbols. So instead, Boas suggests memorizing a verbal description of the triple vector calculation. Continuing Boas's approach, students should also not memorize Newton's second law as F=ma, because some day they might have to calculate the force when the mass or acceleration are denoted by a different letter of the alphabet. Or, combining with the above, if they memorize F=ma, what would the poor students do if the mass is denoted by M? They might be confused... Instead, they should memorize physics laws like in Newton's time, i.e., verbally: Force equals mass times acceleration, or maybe even the motive quantity of a ... force is the measure of the same, proportional to the motion which it generates in a given time. It probably never crossed Boas's mind that there is a reason why formulas are used, and that students of advanced physics should have already realized that symbols are just symbols, and have no meaning in themselves. Until now my criticism is more of style. I don't like it, but others maybe do. But Boas is also full with, how would I put it, incorrect teaching. E.g., Boas teaches the reader that to get an operator identity you can just take a vector identity, and replace a vector by the del operator on both hand sides, and that the result would be a correct operator identity. Well, that's not true. I think it would be better to teach the students how to prove operator identities than to give them fairy tales that many times happen to give correct results (although by using a method with no merits), but sometimes would plainly lead to incorrect results. Nevertheless, Boas is widely used, and of what I have heard usually people liked it. (Why?!?) Boas contains many examples and end of section problems, but in my opinion they are boring problems. You are given, say a vector with numerical components, and then asked to calculate the divergence or curl of the vector. Really exciting and instructive. I also don't like Boas's style of cheating: it makes you feel a theorem is general, but in fact it applies only to a particular case, and this fact is sometimes mentioned, but not emphasized enough."},{"Title":"Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences","review":"There is nothing which is not already said.I want point out few things for some one living in the cave and trying to learn physics/math.1-1980 edition is only 15$ so don't shy away buy this book.2-Having no help(teachers/school) there is chance you would get stuck once or twice a chapter.

A feud breaks out in the Herries household, which is carried over into the next novel in the Chronicle (THE FORTRESS). Judith has an affair with Warren Foster, leaves him, but has a child by him.The story is a strong one, though saturated with violence (Judith's husband, nephew and lover all die in the story). The character portrayals are good, especially of Judith and Jennifer Cards, Francis's wife and initiator of the feud. The final quarter of the book is not as good as what came before; Judith's sudden delivery of her son is hard to believe, and the action from that point on drags.

It is a practical and user-friendly book, well worth the purchase."},{"Title":"Painting Greeting Cards in Watercolor","review":"I have painted all the pictures in Jacqueline's book. Her detailed instructions make copying her art miniatures easy. Her instructions apply not only to miniatures but also larger sized pictures. I have used several of her designs for greeting cards."},{"Title":"Painting Greeting Cards in Watercolor","review":"This is an exceptional watercolor book that offers over 35 step-by-step projects in miniature art. It is not just for beginners. It is packed with useful information on how to design a painting, vary a theme to create a series of paintings. By walking you through the various painting techniques, then using them in step-by-step projects, Jaqueline Penny shows you how to how to turn one small painting into variations based on such things as differing the arrangement, color schemes, weather themes, horizontal vs. vertical presentation, etc..Here are some excerpts from the Table of Contents:Chapter 3 guides you through 5 projects that vary one scene by changing the sky, color, season, time of day, size and location.Chapter 5 gives 8 projects that help you become more creative by showing how a subject can be painted different ways--project 18 is how to paint a pear, including how to paint a droplet of water on the pear. Project 19 is painting an apple half. Project 20 Painting Hard Rocks--the author then shows how that same scene can be painted again, but by using different painting techniques, it does not become the same picture, but one with a whole new statement. The next projects are soft rocks, coastal rocks, little rocks. Next, painting two adirondack chairs(facing the viewer), then varying that theme by painting them facing out away from you, and changing the scenery surrounding them.Penny also teaches how to set up your paper so you can paint several paintings all on the same board, and how to do such things as making a postcard with three related small paintings--one of a landscape, then zeroing in on what's in the landscape and painting a close up of some flowers, or seeing the landscape from a different perspective, or changing the angles of 3 related paintings on a postcard, etc..I love Chapter 20, because it really shows where creativity and imagination can take you, and it's FUN!! Penny demonstrates how you can allow paints to run together to skies and flowers, then how to make minature paintings for the walls by varying mat colors. She gives you ideas on how to use such things as drips dropping on wet paper to make a colorful flower scene, and how to use that colorful painting along with a colored border cut in various shapes to add interest and make a variety of different greeting cards.Project 35 is especially exciting for me. It's title is \\"Pure Fantasy Another Way\\" It shows you how a wet-on-wet floral painting with a lot of soft edges can be used to create a beautiful fantasy scene with a tiny boy who is about 1/1000th as big as the flower is standing on the stem to gaze at the flower....This idea is then FURTHER EXPANDED by taking that floral idea and changing the boy to a girl, with a different pose and slightly different floral scene, or adding poetry to the scene of zeroing in more to one or two flowers.This book really demonstrates the multitude of possibilities in painting greeting cards, miniature paintings for the home, post cards, etc. The lessons are not difficult, and are easy enough for beginners, but it is also good for someone who is beyond the beginner stage, as it is also a book about design and creativity.A Wonderful book, that will help you expand on ideas for watercolors.If you like the book Work Small, Learn Big, this might be a good companion."},{"Title":"Painting Greeting Cards in Watercolor","review":"This book is full of tips and gift ideas as well as greeting card ideas.

It has useful ideas, plus detailed instructions, including measurements, to insure that you will succeed. I bought my first copy from a book club, but lost it. The copy I got from Amazon was considered used, but was in new condition except for some numbers written inside the back cover. It cost about half the price of the original one I bought.You can enjoy painting, save money on cards and delight yourfriends with handmade greetings.In addition, many of these ideas look good as regular sized paintings that can be used as gifts."},{"Title":"Painting Greeting Cards in Watercolor","review":"Thank you Jacqueline Penney for making my introduction to watercolor painting fun, informative and very helpful.The book, Painting Greeting Cards in Watercolor, was a step by step introduction to watercolor painting through the practice of greeting card design. The lessons were fun, quick and very easy to follow, making the student beg to beging the next lesson. After every lesson I felt like I really learned something and was proud of my accomplishment. I'll be honest, as a first time watercolorist I would have given up if this book wasn't easy, fun and easy to understand. Luckily it was a superb introduction and I am very happy.Thank you again."},{"Title":"Painting Greeting Cards in Watercolor","review":"I live in Australia so expected 3 to 4 weeks for delivery of this book, it came in less than 2 weeks so was plesently suprised with it's early arrival and it was well packed.

I am 22 and haved loved this book since I was a little kid. My copy is very stained from being dropped in the water so many times while I was reading in the tub. No matter what your age, you must read this book. Absolutely classic entertainment--a great book to read out loud to your kids on a trip, or whenever. I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!

The 8052 proves to be a very affordable microcontroller, rather than buying a full blown computer or PC104-based computer. This book is very introductory, but it does assume you know basic electronics. The 8052 is no where near as complex as an FPGA, but the programming rituals can prepare you before you learn the basics of programming the FPGA(theory and your thinking of logic). The experience gained by playing around with the 8052 sure gave me the important thinking processes needed for other design projects at work."},{"Title":"The Microcontroller Idea Book: Circuits, Programs & Applications Featuring the 8052-BASIC Single-Chip Computer","review":"Jan has done an exceptional job putting together this book.

I work on 8051 family microcontroller and obviously for the real time effciency reason, I use C and Assembly, I bought this book reading reviews and my poor observation did not catch that it was on 8052-BASIC. So I was shocked when it reached me. But yes, If you really wanna do some experiment on BASIC language with microcontroller, then this is the book you are looking for, no doubt, but If you wanna start your experience with microcontroller, I would suggest the book \\"Microcontroller Projects in C for the 8051\\" by Dogan Ibrahim. I think as an electrical engineer, professionals should always pick C and Assembly language for real time demand and this is the best book for beginners to start on C that I have found by researching the book market for a long time up to now."},{"Title":"The Microcontroller Idea Book: Circuits, Programs & Applications Featuring the 8052-BASIC Single-Chip Computer","review":"Embedded applications are increasing by the day. Many new areas are being explored. This book really makes things easier and it encourages to undertake good projects which could later be very useful in everyday applications. Full of ideas and suggestions. Although the microcontroller 8051/8052 is considered as outdated, this book is a good start. Once the basic techniques for the same are grasped switching over to other newer controller chips will be a cakewalk.This book (along with other similar titles by author) bridges the gap betwwen academic persuit and real life applications. For every idea discussed, an innovative student can think of say 3 more new ideas. This is not just a book that gives a few projects, which you do and that's the end of the story. It allows you to evolve new ideas and enough grounding is provided such that you can implement the same with confidence and 100% success rate.-For students in this field this book is a must."},{"Title":"The Microcontroller Idea Book: Circuits, Programs & Applications Featuring the 8052-BASIC Single-Chip Computer","review":"This is the best book based on the 8052-BASIC chip, and is a must have for anyone (hobbyist or professional) who is the planning on work with the 8051 or another microcontroller.

I bought it, however, thinking it was going to discuss topics such as instrumental combinations, balance of tone, and other concepts more typically associated with 'orchestration'. It turns out, it deals more with the various characteristics and capabilities of each instrument in the orchestra...EXCELLENTLY!

This may not be the definitive 'orchestration' book your looking for, but buy it anyway - you'll be glad you did!"},{"Title":"Orchestration (Musician's library)","review":"This is an excellent comprehensive text on orchestration. It's age (circa 1935) gives it obvious limitations for contempary application. However, that same limitation makes it an important tool for historical instrumental information that most other books simply do not have. I got lots of information from the perspective of a turn of the century arranger that I found very interesting. Of course, if all you are interested in is modern instruments and their applications, you may not find this book as interesting as I did."},{"Title":"Orchestration (Musician's library)","review":"the book is remade by robots and it's full of typos. you can make out the words, but its still a rip off. look into how the book is being made before you buy."},{"Title":"Orchestration (Musician's library)","review":"This is a good introductory book for an Orchestration class. If I were to pick up this book at a store and try to learn this subject without an instructor, I believe I would not succeed. Although I am in college, I still had to look up words in the dictionary to find their meaning and put them into context, which resulted in a delay in comprehension. Despite these things, I still believe that Cecil Forsyth has compiled a great amount of knowledge about Orchestration in this book. I have not viewed similar books to compare, but I might someday if I get the chance."},{"Title":"Orchestration (Musician's library)","review":"You can get a legal copy of this book as a GOOGLE EBOOK, just do a Google search..

Definatley a great buy for the money."},{"Title":"Orchestration (Musician's library)","review":"Like most Dover books, this British text is a reprint of a highly esteemed publication that went out of print for reasons having more to do with capitalism than science. Published between the world wars, it is obviously has no information on the way cool toys of the last few decades, but it is as thorough and practical a treatment as can be found in any language for most of the instruments (other than percussion oddities) in the European musical tradition, and certainly compares favorably with most of the standard textbooks peddled by needy American college professors. In addition, Forsyth can be droll, as for example when he reports that Berlioz observes &quot;ominously&quot; that the best notes on the little known Russian bassoon are said to be D and E-flat."},{"Title":"Orchestration (Musician's library)","review":"I've got a small shelf of orchestration books and this is easily the best of the lot. While it doesn't talk as much about combinations of instruments as Rimsky-Korsakoff's book, it provides detailed and practical information on each of the instruments it covers. Yes, it's old and the state of the art has advanced on some instruments, but that has little impact on just how wonderful this book is.I'd suggest also picking up Essential Dictionary of Orchestration (The Essential Dictionary Series) by Dave Black and Tom Gerou to fill in some of the gaps on contemporary orchestration."},{"Title":"Orchestration (Musician's library)","review":"This is an older text, most of which dates to the dawn of the 20th century. As a result, some aspects are out-of-date. Many instruments have gone out of favor or undergone further evolution. Still, the section on writing for strings is unsurpassed. &quot;Orchestration&quot; makes fascinating reading for anyone with a historical interest in musical instruments and is filled with a wonderful dry British wit"},{"Title":"Orchestration (Musician's library)","review":"This is the best book I have ever read on orchestration. Brilliantly done. The only reason why it's not five stars (I'd give it four-and-a-half) is because of it's age-copyright 1913, allowing some lack of accuracy through rapid instrumental evolution."},{"Title":"Orchestration (Musician's library)","review":"Orchestration is a wonderful refference for anyone with an iterest in musical instruments. It has a section for every instrument in the orchestra describing the vital facts about each one including varitions on the instrument, certain things to avoid when composing for it, basic technique, and much more. It is a very good source for answers to just about any question on a specific instrument. The only problem with it is that it is old. this is however just a minor thing as most of the data is still very relevant."},{"Title":"Orchestration (Musician's library)","review":"Despite the vast amount of knowledge displayed by the author, Forsyth's work has fallen to the thought process of the now approatching 21st century student of music. This work, however creditable in it's day, simply is far too outdated for the post modern academia.(First publication:1914!) I would recommend this book for the general research of musical practice in the early part of the 20th century. However it would be of no use for the progress of the comming music of future composers."},{"Title":"Orchestration (Musician's library)","review":"In Los Angeles, among the top composers (Henry Mancini, Jerry Goldsmith to list 2) on the A list, this is THE book. Forsythe covers the subject with characteristic dry British wit, but his referencing is impeccable, including covering specialty instruments (like the Serpent, Wagnerian tubas, and many more) that are simply not covered in the other titles. His explanations are indepth, accurate, and still very usable. If you can only afford one book, get this one."},{"Title":"Orchestration (Musician's library)","review":"The introduction to Cecil Forsyth's &quot;Orchestration&quot; is by William Bolcolm, a prominent American composer very much of our time. (His opera &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot; premiered November 1999 and was favorably reviewed in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Time Magazine&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times.&quot;) As William Bolcolm points out, very little of this book is out of date--a few tiny, insignificant bits; it remains &quot;eminently usable&quot;. It also remains head and shoulders above the scores of tedious, dull, and perfunctory orchestration manuals subsequently published. One of its many virtues is its immersion in what Mr. Bolcolm calls &quot;technical culture&quot;: It imparts to you a sense of what it's like to play the various orchestral instruments. Future fetishists (those wishing to obliterate the past and present in sacrificial rite to a future they can know as little as you and I) take note: what is best is what endures."},{"Title":"Orchestration (Musician's library)","review":"An excellent and authoritative text. There have been some changes in the capabilities of the instruments that are not reflected in the text, and of course it is missing all of the more modern and electronic instruments (this has the same unabridged text as the 1935 edition), but it's still very useful and well-written.One (small) lack: after reading the section on the harp, I still greatly prefer the standard on that subject, &quot;Harp Scoring&quot; by Stanley Chaloupka, for discussion of composing or orchestrating for the harp.I feel this book should be in the library of anyone serious about orchestration or composing for an orchestra."},{"Title":"Orchestration (Musician's library)","review":"This is one of my very favorite books--not merely one of my very favorite orchestration books, not merely one of my very favorite music theory books. I read it again and again--sometimes for information, sometimes for entertainment. Its prose is lively and stylish; its advice is practical and to the point; it amuses; it inspires. By the bye, William Bolcom's new introduction is my favorite introduction to any book.Also recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."},{"Title":"Orchestration (Musician's library)","review":"I am an amateur orchestrationist and I loved this book. The history of the instruments gave me a greater understanding of each group and their strengths and weaknesses. I hope everyone who has an interest in instrumentation would read and study this book."},{"Title":"Orchestration (Musician's library)","review":"While Forsythe offers a great deal of depth and detail, much of it I found superfluous unless you are a musicologist, and I am a musicologist. But now my primary interest is orchestrating. The author includes too much historical background on the various instruments, such as the evolution of the horn, which you only need to know if you are analyzing Hadyn symphonies. If you are orchestrating a new symphony, you need to know current instrumental capabilities and practices, and the Forsythe book is now nearly 100 years old. Most of his information remains valid, but how will you know what isn't?I read this and a few other classics (Berlioz/Strauss, Rimsky, Piston) -- all of which are worthwhile -- before getting some coaching from a composition professor, who recognized that I needed a newer text. He recommended Adler or Kennan. So I bought the fourth edition of Kennan's orchestration book, a good place to start. Continue later with Forsythe and the others once you've acquired the up-to-date basics."},{"Title":"Orchestration (Musician's library)","review":"Please note that this is a review of the 'General Books' edition of this work only.Cecil Forsyth, (or 'FORKYTH' as this edition would have it), may indeed have written an eminently usable book, but this edition is anything but that. It is apparently a raw OCR copy of an earlier edition, including headings such as the following \\"ITiii, 3. MODEKN OUOKKSTIIAI, VALVK-HuuN\\" (at 63). While most of the text has not been quite as badly garbled, they layout (it is not visually apparent where one chapter or section begins or ends, what is a chapter heading vs example text, etc), makes it impossible to locate specific information and very difficult to read.If you want this book, spend the extra money buying an edition upon which a modicum of editorial effort has been exercised."},{"Title":"Orchestration (Musician's library)","review":"This book is organized as a tour of the many instruments that comprise an orchestra, together with description about how each instrument sounds, and how it might be used. Its primary focus is the instruments, not their arrangement.My interest was more the latter. I am an amateur, novice composer of short works, working to arrange and orchestrate my own music. I want to understand better when oboes are best used over strings, how strings sections \\"against\\" each other are sculpted, when interplay between brass instruments is most appealing, etc.I respect this man, but his book is not for me."},{"Title":"Orchestration (Musician's library)","review":"Cecil Forsyth's Orchestration is a fascinating introduction to the topic. The text is broken up into sections, each section dedicated to an instrument of the orchestra. There are a great number of musical examples which Forsyth uses to prove the points he makes. Although the age of the book fails to lend a modern perspective (I'd LOVE to see what the percussion section of the book would look like if it was written after Orff's Carmina Burana!), many fundamentals of orchestration are timeless. The string section is glorious, and is a wonderful introduction to the instruments for any non-string player. Overall, the text is invaluable to any student with moderate theory knowledge interested in the technical side of music."},{"Title":"Orchestration (Musician's library)","review":"Don't waste your money on this edition which is basically a scam. The first page where the copyright is explains how they saved money by making digital copies of the original manuscript without doing any editing. Therefore, this book is full of typos and THERE ARE NO ILLUSTRATIONS OR MUSICAL EXAMPLES. Then they try to solicit more business by saying if you want to read the original version you have to join a website where you can join on a \\"trial basis.\\" Although the original edition had plenty of examples of musical scores to study, this edition merely omitted all illustrations in the name of saving the consumer a few bucks. The text accompanying each example is still there but if you want to know what they're talking about you'll have to go find the original scores yourself. Do yourself a favor and buy the original version at your local bookstore where you can see what you're getting before you buy it.NOTE: this review is for the publication by General Books LLC (Large Loads of Crap).

I carry it in my backpack all the time, and if I find myself waiting for a bus or something I pull it out and reread one of the stories.Each story in the book is distinctive, well-written, and a joy to read. Some of them are among my all-time favorites in the short-story medium. Because they're short stories, they're, well, short, and so it's difficult to describe them meaningfully without giving too much away. I'll nevertheless briefly highlight some:Ed Park's \\"A Note to My Translator\\" is a hilarious riff on an unusual situation -- the topic is a stroke of genius. \\"Memory of a Dog\\", by Michael Nigro, is an excellently written story based around a compelling metaphor. \\"Comprehension Test\\", by Myla Goldberg, is a brilliant experiment of form. The structure is a clever acknowledgement of the reading experience -- asking questions and having them answered by reading.My favorite story from this collection, though, is the flat-out amazing \\"the end of the beltline\\" by Tony Carbone. I would venture to say that this is my favorite story of all time. It's nearly impossible to explain why -- I'm tempted to write a lengthy review of this single story to fully convey my impressions. It is unabashedly avant-garde, and a few of its stylistic tricks and startling images continue to give me chills even though I've reread it dozens of times.The idea of publishing stories by unpublished writers is a great one, and this collection demonstrates the unsung talent which lurks beneath the mass-market fiction radar. It is also refreshing to see a collection whose stories are related only by the obscurity of their authors, as most collections seen on the shelves today are anthologies of stories written by a single author (or by several authors of a single ethnic or cultural group), or works sharing a common theme. Because of the variety (in style and subject matter) among the various pieces, the book as a whole is easy to read -- fast-paced, intense stories come right along with slower mood pieces. This also means that in this single volume there are stories for many moods -- stories for when you're happy, sad, tired, anxious, or what have you.It is a crying shame that this book is out of print. I have never seen a better collection of stories, and I recommend Virgin Fiction to anyone who can get their hands on it."},{"Title":"Virgin Fiction","review":"Virgin is a series of short stories by first-time writers.

Telling others the truth about our wretched condition before God, and His gracious provision in Christ is not optional. The problem with much of today's evangelism is that it is aimed at appealing to the hearer--the so-called &quot;seeker sensitive&quot; movement being a prime example. But if you have any experience with such methods, you know that they are ineffective at best, and harmful at worst. Kuiper gives evangelism the emphasis it deserves: a God centered presentation of the gospel. Yes, if you haven't figured it out yet, Kuiper is a Calvinist, and this book is simply a Calvinistic understanding of depravity, grace, and sovereignty. And yet, unlike many Calvinistic documents, this one gives asimple but effective instruction in the presentaion of the good news found in Jesus Christ. Tired of man-centered preaching that does no one any good? Let Kuiper show you the glory of God as you preach the gospel of God!"},{"Title":"God-Centered Evangelism: A Presentation of the Scriptural Theology of Evangelism","review":"R.B. Kuiper's God-Centred Evangelism, written in the mid-20th century, is as relevant now as it was when first printed by Banner of Truth in 1966. The book is Bible-saturated, clearly written and very helful. Each chapter begins with the word \\"God\\", focusing the reader's attention on the intent of the book. Much of the book is just an excellent review of the biblical truths regarding the love of God, the sovereignty of God, and God's work in salvation. In addressing these subjects, Kuiper deals thoroughly with their application to evangelism and what acceptance of these truths forces us to reject (universalism, moralism, fatalism, etc.). This book is intensely practical because it lays the biblical foundation necessary for faithful evangelism.My favorite illustration from the book is on page 155 and is a good example of Kuiper's writing style and content throughout the book . . .\\"A criminal finds himself in prison, locked in his cell. A visiting friend calls out to him: 'I have good news for you.' With eager expectation the prisoner demands: 'What is it? Out with it! The answer comes: 'Be good.' Well that might drive the prisoner mad. Yet, precisely that is the only message which some who call themselves evangelists have for the sinner. It is not good news. It is not news at all. Good news for the sinner is that provision has been made for his release from sin and hell.\\""},{"Title":"God-Centered Evangelism: A Presentation of the Scriptural Theology of Evangelism","review":"This is a solid review of evangelism, especially in relation to God and His sovereignty. Do not expect quick gimmicks on how to \\"win souls\\" here. This book provides a solid theological framework for evangelism. So often modern day evangelistic efforts lack depth, and the ideas being presented in this book are a great antidote to that! Not all parts of this book interested me, but I found it to generally cut right to the heart with a simple writing style that powerfully exhorts the reader with both emotion and reason! Kuiper definately has a great writing style, not spectacular but very Biblical and digestable."},{"Title":"God-Centered Evangelism: A Presentation of the Scriptural Theology of Evangelism","review":"In \\"God-Centered Evangelism\\" R.B. Kuiper (student of B.B. Warfield and later a professor of Westminster Theological Seminary from 1933-1952) delivers a volume aimed at the advancement evangelism utilizing the biblical method and message.Kuiper's stated his purpose as a \\"plea for a God-centred, in contradistinction to man-centred, evangelism. In other words it presents a theology of evangelism\\" (p. 8).First addition was published in 1966 and the edition I am reviewing in 1998.Chapters include:- God the Author of Evangelism- God's Infinite Love and Evangelsim- God and the Scope of Evangelism- God and the Urgency of Evangelism- God and the Means of Evangelism- God and the Triumph of Evangelism- And many more theology based essays on evangelismBible-minded believers need to witness more often. The great English Puritan, John Rogers, one time stirred up his congregation for the lost by imitating the screams of the souls in hell. Hell should prompt your mouth to open and trumpet the truth of God. Your love for Jesus should enkindle your heart to urge Christ upon the pagan; your glorious union with Christ should prompt you to yearn for the salvation of those God has providentially set in your path. It is no longer you who live, but Christ lives in you, the one who loved you and died for you. As a Christian, Jesus lives in your heart by faith. Jesus said, \\"I came to seek and save that which was lost\\" (Luke 19:10). Since that was one of His goals, and He dwells in our hearts; we must follow Him as a seeker of the lost. To arouse your heart for the unsaved: ponder the cross, consider the love and excellencies of Jesus, look to the glories of heaven, and the eternal pangs of hell. As one old preacher said, \\"I want the stench of hell in my nostrils and the splendor of heaven in my eyes.\\"God Centered Evangelism is a wonderful book (247 pages) on witnessing. Kuiper exhorts the church with the following: \\"God commands sovereignly and for that very reason must be obeyed... To apply the foregoing to evangelism, the sovereignty of God comes to vigorous expression in the many missionary commands of the Bible, and in the measure in which one recognizes the divine sovereignty, in that very measure must one be zealous in carrying out those commands.\\"Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day, and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. And you are witnesses of these things (Luke 24:46-48).for more essays on biblical evangelism and apologetics see my book:Truth, Knowledge and the Reason sfor God: The Defense of the Rational Assurance of Christianityor\\"God Does Exist!: Defending the faith using Presuppositional Apologetics, Evidence, and the Impossibility of the Contrary\\""},{"Title":"Board Buster Clinical Cases Steps 2 And 3","review":"The questions do not follow the USMLE format.Not a bad book; however, there are many better options at the same price."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"When ordering anything online what is important is user ease, security, and service delivery.

I had never read him before and had heard complimentary reviews of his work. I was hoping to find a Modern American writer that has been neglected because of the dominance of Faulkner, Hemingway, Fitzgerald, et al. Wolfe excels in description and that is what much of the novel is, description of his family and his hometown. A thinly veiled autobiography, the novel is a bildungsroman set in his hometown, Asheville, NC. Many times, the description is wonderful and uplifting, but at other times, annoying. Wolfe has a tendency to overwrite. No one wishes this book any longer."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"I had to give this book up at about page 150.

But I grew up in the 1950's and 60's, not in the 1900-1920 era that spanned the young years of author Thomas Wolfe. This book chronicles a world that is more akin to that of my grandparents. I recognize much that I remember as typical of small town life. There are the various social castes--with some defined by race. The description of Sunday school lorded over by old women is quite familiar. Much of this novel, however, is alien to the world that I knew growing up. The blatant racism, hard drinking, and constant whoring is shocking! There are even two unmarried sisters who provide their younger brothers with money for monthly trips to the local brothel--because they consider such visits necessary for the boys' health! An older teenage paper boy tells the new boy on the route the houses where payment can be taken \\"in trade\\"--meaning amateur prostitution.I should prepare the reader for the format of this book. Much of the material consists of very long passages and descriptions. There are some incidents that occur sufficiently often to render them close to superfluous--especially the tirades of the drunken father of young protagonist Eugene Gant who stands in for the young Thomas Wolfe.I first learned of this book from a grad school friend who was a North Carolina native. He knew of this book as a roman a clef that focused on the life of the Asheville NC that Thomas Wolfe knew as a young person. According to my friend, North Carolinians in the 1960's were still shocked and insulted by Wolfe's exposing of the vices within that little country town. I should point out that small town people guard their secrets very closely. People once went to great lengths to appear upstanding in order to avoid being subjects of gossip. An acquaintance who moved to my hometown to work for the local newspaper told me that because he had not graduated from a local high school, nobody would dare speak to him regrading the seamier goings-on within our county."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"This was an excellent book.

This isolated and lonely young man begins to escape into books and fantasy while maintaining a strong admiration for his one strange, brooding brother, who alone seems singularly ambivelent to all this outward hypocracy and hucksterism. The brother he calls 'The Ghost'. Wolfe at times seems to be a bit overconsumed with his own sense of mental superiority, but ultimately by portraying this, he also appears to be allowing for a bit of self-deprecation. One can see how Kerouac was a big fan. Although admittedly wordy with needless overdiscription, the books delivers a certain unique historical texture to life in Asheville and elsewhere in the South in the first decades of the 20th century"},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Written in the early 1930's and still as moving and enjoyable today.

His descriptions bring the picture vividly to life. You smell the smells, hear the sounds, etc. Unfortunately there are few positive characters, especially women. Young Gant's sexual experiences were particularly devastating and crude. Realistically the young man never finds the answers to his questions, the peace he looks for, the solution to his problems. That was a disappointment. But this book is still a must read for it's snapshot in time and character development!"},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Listen. This is the &quot;Great American Novel&quot; that supposedly is waiting to be written. Mr. Wolfe's fantastic articulation will make you feel like you are one of his neighbors in Altamont, very familiar with the town and its inhabitants. No other author has written with such vivid honesty in American Literature. It is NOT a thinly veiled autobiography, but a sincere autobiographical account of his childhood which captures the purity of the moment, without letting his ego command full attention. Perhaps the best novel you shall ever read."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Never have I read a novel which has rewarded the close attention to detail that this novel demands of its readers. Passage after passage is full of a descriptive brilliance which seeks out with intensity the breadth and depth of human experience. Such is Wolfe's brilliance (and I see that other readers agree), the question must be asked why (and this after a search of Amazon) there are not more of his titles in print. Can something not be done about it??"},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"He was born a year after Hemingway, and the comparison diverges from there. His work is brilliantly and excessively poetic and rhapsodic to distraction in places. There's an abundance of nuggets that make it worth the trip for those who appreciate poetry, but you're forced to wade through endless description and overmade points. Hemingway would have told the story with half the words. Some of the characters were well drawn, while others were overdrawn. Still others were barely drawn.Max Perkins cut 60,000 words from the manuscript and still let Wolfe get away with murder. There's gratuitous commentary that took me out of the story again and again. The dialogue was excellent in many places, but missing in others. Perkins did a brilliant job with Hemingway and Fitzgerald. What happened with Wolfe?One of the problems with writing an autobiographic novel is that you're stuck with making a workable story out of what actually happened. Wolfe could have left out a lot of this material and had a better story. There's too much here, and all the extraneous detail gets in the way. The entire final chapter could have been condensed into a few paragraphs.I didn't like the narrator's voice. He seemed arrogant, egotistical, spoiled and entirely full of himself. It's a chore, but still a worthwhile read for the poetry and for the nuggets of brilliance sprinkled throughout."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"I feel sorry for anyone who can't find echoes of their own youth in Wolfe's undeniably Romantic writing. You won't find clipped Hemingway-esque sentences, nor the pages-long obscure wanderings of fellow Southerner Faulkner, but Wolfe recreates his world so perfectly that filming it would be redundant. &quot;Self-absorbed&quot;? Yes, how else could anyone produce a literary translation of a life's experience? Cliched? Not when it was written, although as a &quot;coming of age&quot; novel it has many predecessors, none were so ambitious in scope or detail. Achingly, achingly nostalgic, beautifully written, TRUE to itself, sparing nothing of the author or his vision. Pretentious? Hardly, especially when set next to the Oprah-fied books on the best-seller lists today. This and its immediate succesor &quot;Of Time and the River&quot; are, to me, arguably the finest books ever written describing not just life in America but more importantly the sense of loss through time and distance of love, family, and home and the emotional maturation that follows.No, I couldn't recommend this to EVERYbody, but if you haven't become too sophisticated to remember what it was really like to be young, lonely, in love, or homesick, or to see though a child's eyes the wonder in a leaf, a stone, a door; to cry &quot;Oh, lost!&quot; over a memory, you will find much to cherish in this book."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"&quot;Look Homeward Angel&quot; is undeniably a young man's story and as such, I wonder if it appeals to men more than it does to women. It's hard to imagine how the novel's countless aches and awkward blunders would fail to resonate with any man's youthful recollections. When readers in Woolfe's hometown castigated him for his venial characterization of the people he grew up with, Woolfe pointed out that none of his characters represented any one particular person. Instead, their qualities were so real and so vivid that readers felt they instantly recognized them. And so it was with me, although I was born decades after Woolfe's death and raised in a different part of the country. The dialog, drama, and emotional undercurrents of &quot;Look Homeward Angel&quot; were strangely and overwhelmingly recognizable. This is the genius of Woolfe.My favorite parts of the novel vary considerably. I love the prose poem in the very beginning of the book. I also love the protagonist's descriptions of seemingly ordinary activities such as walking through a pasture on a fall evening. Such passages have the unnerving quality of being accessible yet somehow ineffable. A part of you is walking through the field with Eugene Gant taking in the cold wind, the smells of smoke and cow manure under the grim sky. Another part of you is asking why that experience feels so real and immediate even though you've never had it before.Woolfe took a microscope to ordinary people and somehow rendered them great. He did not accord them the stature of epoch heroes or contemporary celebrities. Instead, he rendered their feelings and actions as immediate as their surroundings. You probably would not want to be any of the people in &quot;Look Homeward Angel&quot; and you might not even like them that much. But you will come away from the book with the sense of knowing those people intimately. For this reason, it is impossible to finish &quot;Look Homeward Angel&quot; without a having profound emotional response."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"I was much taken with LOOK HOMEWARD, ANGEL when I read it as a young man, particularly the chapter on the death of Ben Gant. It was one of the most moving things I had read at the time and I never forgot it. With more years behind me than in front of me, I was curious to see what effect this novel would have on me on a rereading. I found this tome this time to be long, wordy, at times bombastic, with far too many \\"O Lost's.\\" Mr. Wolfe never misses an opportunity to do long lists, often sounding like Walt Whitman on a bad day. And why on earth would he name Chapel Hill, North Carolina \\"Pulpit Hill\\" in the novel?On the other hand, sometimes Wolfe writes pure poetry; and the novel pulses with life. He has captured a town (Asheville, North Carolina early in the 20th Century) with all its prejudices, idiosyncrasies but hopes as well and has created a family we will never forgot, the Gants. Anyone who knows anything about Thomas Wolfe understands that they are a thinly veiled version of his own family: the bigger-than-life patriarch of the family Gant who has bouts with the bottle; his wife Eliza, obsessed with making a dime at whatever cost; and their children-- Daisy, Helen, the sailor Luke, the twins Grover and Ben and Eugene, based on Wolfe, himself. These characters are as much of the literary history of the United States as Willie Loman, Rabbit Angstrom, the Compson family et al.Yes, Wolfe's account of the death of Ben Gant at the age of 26 of double pneumonia will tear your heart out. After the Gant family members have spent excruciating days at his deathbed, Eugene has this beautiful words: \\"We can believe in the nothingness of life, we can believe in the nothingness of death and of life after death--but who can believe in the nothingness of Ben? Like Apollo, who did his penance to the high god in the sad house of King Admetus, he came, a god with broken feet, into the gray hovel of this world. And he lived here a stranger, trying to recapture the music of the lost world, trying to recall the great forgotten language, the lost faces, the stone, the leaf, the door.\\"LOOK HOMEWARD, ANGEL, for all its shortcomings, remains an American classic."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"I loved it in 1968 as a college freshman and I love it today as a 52 year old prose lover, ex-hippie, and wage slave. While discussing the book with a classmate in college thirty years ago, He dissed Wolfe by saying that his writing was pretentious. I got seriously upset and wanted to slug him. Enamored I was and still am. After a hard day at work, you may not do better than get lost in the hill country of North Carolina. The characters are so real that you will be saying to your spouse or significant other, &quot;Hey sweetie, listen to this&quot; as you read passages of what seem to be your life. The book takes us places that we can see and feel. Intellectual? yes. Soulful? Hell yes! Settle in and read maybe twenty pages a day. You will be moved."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Wolfe is definitely a master of prose and words, at times hisdescriptions and observations of life are captivating and inspiring.However, the book did move very slowly at times, as his level of detail and character development was almost unparalled compared to others authors I have read. This was good and bad, at times it was really boring, no matter how intellectual I wanted to be, and it was difficult to keep going, however you really do get a sense of the characters. For a true look at small town American life at this point in history, there is no equivalent that I have come across. The last half of the book is especially poignant, and the most interesting development of the book for me was to witness Gene's transformation from child to a wanderlust stricken youth. There are no happy endings here, there are no unbelievable revelations, only a family and its tumultuous journey through this strange travel that we call life. You will either love this book, or you will hate it, but if you have the patience to persevere through Wolfe's long-winded prose, it is well worth the time."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Look Homeward Angel is a rather lengthy and rather wordy coming of age story. Centered around Eugene Gant, a character modeled on Wolfe himself, the story is an exhaustive and detailed account of his life all the wayh from birth to his leaving for Harvard in his 20's.I found this book to be an overall enjoyable read but I also found it to drag in some parts,the tone was a bit too sentimental and it was unfocused in parts. So much time is spent on details and wordiness that the book becomes bogged down at points. It takes close to 300 pages for Eugene to turn 12. I didn't think it was possible to find 300 pages worth to write about young childhood. Wolfe did apparently but none of it was really all that compelling to read. The tone of it is more than a little sentimental. Sure the whole point of the book is nostalgia but it gets too weepy for my tastes. The novel was also unfocused and uneven at times. Too much time was dedicated to his young life, and not enough to his adolescence and young adult life. A lot of the time the story focused not on Eugene, but his myriad of sibblings and his parents. And I wished Ben would stop saying &quot;oh jesus&quot; every sentence.Wolfe does succeed however in capturing the feel of small town life, and he does present a somewhat enjoyable read. If the novel was shorter and more focused, it would have been much better. I recommend Of Human Bondage by WS Maugham or A Portrait of the Artist by James Joyce as better coming of age stories. Of Human Bondage is more focused and deals more with his later and mature life, and Joyce's novel deals mostly with adolescence and should be read for his groundbreaking style."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"What sets this book apart from most 'coming of age' stories is the stunning combination of poetic language and monumental vision with which Wolfe imbues this tale of Eugene Gant's blossoming into manhood. No other American writer of novels has managed to utilize a voice so lush and exacting at the same time. The reader is literally seduced into the world that Wolfe creates and provided with an experience as rich as any in modern fiction.Thomas Wolfe was a large man, and he thought and acted in a large way. His editor, Maxwell Perkins, had to severly cut down the size of the gigantic text that he was given, and it is still a big book in all respects - in sheer size, breadth of vision, and thematic scope.This is one of those books I have to return to every few years just to see if it is still as good as I remember. While it is very much an adolescent book - in the sense that it storms the emotions with a 'Romantic' intensity - and I am much more critical than the young man who first read it - I find that I am still awed at Wolfe's talent and command.This is one of those 'must read' books for all who would be conversant with modern American fiction. It's type has been out of fashion for some time, but it can't be ignored as a substantial contribution that is uniquely its own thing."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Description:A child (Wolfe's fictitious double) born around 1900 grows up in a town in the mountains of North Carolina. The story follows the story of the boy, Eugene Gant, from his ancestors' immigration to America to his graduation from the University of North Carolina.The Good:Wolfe is an excellent writer and his heavily descriptive style works. By the end of the book, many of the characters feel like family. There are times when Wolfe departs from his descriptions to make beautiful philosophical observations you'll want to copy or underline for later reference. The final chapter is a masterpiece, and well worth the 513 pages of text leading up to it.The Bad:Wolfe's romanticism is grating to modern sensibilities--repeated phrases like &quot;O lost, and by the wind grieved, ghost, come back again!&quot; seem more like the lamentations of a histrionic drama student than a top-notch writer. His characters, for the most part, don't undergo any radical changes or exhibit any interesting incongruities of behavior that hint at &quot;depth,&quot; something audiences nowadays have come to expect in a novel. Sometimes his references to other texts (generally quotes intended to represent Gant's literary thought processes) get annoying, and sometimes his attempts to describe scenery or occurrences, especially through the medium of Eugene's thoughts, can be a little bit messy or fall short of their targets.The Verdict:Even though it was published on the verge of the Great Depression, Look Homeward, Angel feels like a work from the nineteenth century . . . Dickens, Whitman, and Emerson seem to be influences. Most of the problems with the text that I mentioned simply take a period of adjustment to get used to. All things considered, it's an incredible piece of literature. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"I love the sprawl of this novel; it has an organic energy, an enormous scope and vitality, and a sensuality, a feeling on each page. The novel is large in more than just page count. Wolfe's story portrays the spiritual and pscyhological growth of Eugene Gant--an autobiographical character. The image that remains is unforgetable. Wolfe's intelligence is that of the fox, uncanny in depth and range.If you like to read novels that create a world, create an irony and have a passion, I'd recommend this one. I can see the debt that Wolfe has with previous writers. He owes something to Dreiser in creating the enormous vitality in his prose. But Wolfe doesn't care about the naturalistic forces like Dreiser does, its powers and drives. For Wolfe, it is more important to live life to the fullest, completely alive. In this sense, I think that Walt Whitman's poetry parallels Wolfe's fictive prose. Whitman and Wolfe wrote about the people, the families, the bodies, the minds, connecting and disconnecting, all vitally alive and all eventually passing away.To me, what makes this novel most worthwhile to read is the final chapter: haunting, lyrical, amazing. I doubt if Wolfe will be read with a wider audience in this day because his race references can easily be construed as racism. Push past that, though, and read it for its heart, not the age in which it was written. Wolfe needs to be read long into the future."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"I can easily see why Look Homeward, Angel is an American classic.The story is rambling and diverse, with a host of characters who are strong-willed and self-assured yet deeply flawed. This strongly reflects the character of the American people, as well as the nation itself.But the strength of Look Homeward Angel is in the prose. Wolfe's writing brings to light those passing moments in time that stay with us forever but which we don't recognize at the time as significant - the glory of the air in an early spring morning, the sensual stimuli that are all around us walking down a dark street late at night, and many other unforgetable scenes. His writing has the power and vitality of Faulkner, without the sometimes impossible sentences that cause one to lose track. It is challenging and rich. Look Homeward, Angel is a masterpiece of place, time, and style."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"This book will lull you along so sweetly it'll bring tears to your eyes. Wolfe strings the reader across a historiography of love, frustration and family and he does it in a hypnotizing manner. It's the most visual and honest portrayal of growing up I've ever seen. If you've ever had the pleasure of visiting Asheville, NC, you will understand how perfectly Wolfe captures the atmosphere, the scent, the light. Nothing can be said about a book this spectacular and real except that it's an under-appreciated gem. I don't mean to compare but it stayed with me more than anything I've ever read from Faulkner or Mellville. It has a humanity neither of those authors tried to capture. It's a different ballpark."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"As an English lit major, I readily recognized the literary genius of Thomas Wolfe.

I recommend it highly -- especially to people that appreciate good literature."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Yes, he did write while standing next to his refrigerator using its top as a writing surface. Writing for Wolfe was so necessary and exciting that it could not be done sitting down. Words would rush from his mind like a river and it was all he could do to keep up. This is the impression that you must get from reading Wolfe. With the flow of word after word after word, in prose described as rich and ornate, Wolfe will be appreciated by anyone who loves language and knows that words are, in essence, vessels of meaning. How appropriate then, that he chose as titles of his books &quot;Of Time and the River&quot; &quot;Look Homeward Angel&quot; and, &quot;You Can Never Go Home Again.&quot; Read Wolfe and you, too, may be carried away, perhaps never to return."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Forget your preconceived notions of Wolfe's legendary verbosity. Ignore the length of the novel itself. Just open the covers of this most exquisite autobiography, for that is exactly what it is: a wondrous, painful, star-filled true life story of a boy growing up in Asheville, NC at the turn of the century. From the first few words, you are transported, entranced, rivetted to the pages. Never was a town, a family, a coming-of-age so tenderly and ruthlessly recreated and revealed. If there is finer writing than the death of his brother Ben, I have never found it. The Great American Novel?

I had read some positive reviews concerning the author's work and picked this one up while on vacation in California. I think I was also influenced by knowing that Wolfe was a major influence on Jack Kerouac, who, while not the best writer I've ever read, certainly is my favorite and the one I've most felt a kinship to. But after 230 pages I realized this morning that I just don't give a damn about the story or anyone in it.Kerouac wrote with a humility that borders on the spiritual. Wolfe by contrast is pompous with everyword. His talents as a wordsmith are undeniable. But, at least in this work, he lacks the introspection necessary to make this sort of autobiographical journey worth taking. What he seems to have not realized is that the story of life has few original happenings. What counts is the perspective each of us bring to those events and how we come to see life as a result. This book fails by that measure. I never learn how these events have molded him nor, after 230 pages, do I get any hint. What I've read is more narcissistic rant than honest self exploration.Other reviewers have said \\"don't waste your time\\". I won't go that far. Wolfe does have a beautiful way with the English language and from that point of view he could be worth the time. And just because I didn't like it doesn't mean you won't. But short of the love of words for their own sake being your motivation, your time may be better invested elsewhere."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"A very well-read, highly educated person, with whom I had a passing acquaintance, mentioned one day that &quot;Of Time and the River,&quot; by Thomas Wolfe, was her all-time favorite book. Very shortly after that, I read somewhere that &quot;Of Time and the River&quot; was the actor Anthony Quinn's favorite book. Okay, now this title, previously unbeknownst to me, was somewhat &quot;following me around,&quot; and my reader's curiosity was piqued, and I went to investigate. I discovered that &quot;Time and River&quot; was a sequel to &quot;Look Homeward, Angel,&quot; which is how I wound up reading this book. Did I feel about this book the way my acquaintance (and Mr. Quinn) felt about its sequel? Not by a long shot, but still this book is a MUST-READ. Why? Even though parts of it are dull, Wolfe has a brilliant capacity for poetically explaining certain types of situations and behaviors that I have oft found incomprehensible. If I'm compelled to underline sentences and paragraphs, as I was with this book, then I'm also compelled to recommend this book and rate it even half a star higher than it deserves. (It doesn't really deserve a full four stars, because it took me FOREVER to finish, which is never a good sign.)Well, now I'm off, to begin the much-anticipated sequel, &quot;Of Time and the River.&quot;"},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Look Homeward, Angel is Thomas Wolfe's masterwork, the novel that made his reputation. Born in Asheville, NC, in 1900, he was educated at the University of North Carolina and at Harvard. He spent his time teaching and traveling, building his reputation as one of America's master novelists. Wolfe died in 1938.The novel tells the life of the Gant family in a small mountain town in North Carolina. It is widely acknowledged that the town is Asheville, NC and that the book is a thinly disguised account of Wolfe's own life there.The Gant family was made of Oliver and Eliza Gant and their children, Steve, Luke, the twins Ben and Grover, the girls Daisy and Helen, and the baby, Eugene. Eugene is the individual whose life most closely mimics Wolfe's own. The family is portrayed for the twenty years of Eugene's childhood and early manhood, as he grows up and learns that he must move on to achieve what he wants from life.The daily lives of the Gant family are richly portrayed, each detail building upon the next to demonstrate daily life in the mountain region of North Carolina from 1900 to 1920. Oliver is a stone mason, Eliza becomes the owner of a boardinghouse. They both are so consumed with the thought of money and what it takes to make a living that they neglected the emotional lives of their children. The children are left to provide emotional support for each other, to force their way through life trying, sometimes succeeding and sometimes failing to achieve their goals.Education was a great good, although expensive and those who had the opportunity to get an education were reminded daily of their great fortune. Wolfe details the daily working life of laborers, of those revered in small towns such as lawyers, doctors and politicians. He covers the relationships between men and women, and those between the races. The first Great War and the iinfluenza epidemic are covered. The United States was changing and the Gant family is a representation of how the country changed over this time period.This book is recommended for readers interested in knowing how daily life was in western North Carolina during the early years of the 19th century as the population moved from a rural to a city focus. It is intricately detailed and moves the reader through the daily life of this family and the constant questions of why we are here and what we are to do with our lives."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"I wanted an older copy of this book, as the author is my distant cousin.

I am very satisfied with this book...I will treasure it."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"I read this book, and it took me a while, but in the end, I was satisfied by the book. There is no way around it- Wolfe uses more words than most people are interested to read. I myself at times got tired of crawling at a snales pace, and I skipped or skimmed parts of the book. But the book does get progressively better. If you can't read the whole thing, read the last two hundred pages, and you'll have a pretty good idea of the story. If you want a book to challegnge you,(and try your patience at times) this one should. If you are interested in quick and exciting reading, this isn't the book for you. The ending will make you think about life in general- a good accomplishment for any book in any genre."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"The first novel of arguably the greatest literary genius produced by America.

They start when the city is just a small village and they grow - over two generations - along with the city, Altamont. The book gives us a very good vision of social hierarchization, a caste system, with seven castes. First the Episcolians who have the highest social eminence. Then the Presbyterians who are less fashionable but solidly decent. Third the Methodists who are the middle group between vulgarity and decorum. Fourth the Baptists who are the most populous and common. Then we have three castes of outcast people. The negroes or Blacks who are nothing but dogs walking on two legs . Then the Jews who are a perpetually chased and hunted group. Finally the Pigtail Alley white-headed, white-haired and white-faced people. Those seem to be rejected even more than the previous two groups. This caste system is based on two scales of values . First religious affiliation among white Americans. Then a racial rejection based on the color of the skin (blacks), the non-christian religion (jews), the color of the hair and skin (white, in fact what could be poor whites who are not even decent enough to live up to their race). The members of the second generation are followed very carefully. And that is where the book has a real problem. We constantly jump from a descriptive vignette to a psychological portrait, always at a determined moment, so that we cannot in any way have a fair idea of the plot, the events, the way they are stringed together, nor of the real psychology of any character, because, along the pages, we have quite many psychological vignettes of one character, and not two of these vignettes are comparable or equivalent. The writing is perfectly impressionistic and we get lost in its meandering among successive touches. This is a shortcoming because we do not really enter a novel , but rather a slide-show where each slide would be a vignette, but with no unifying commentary. The end is pathetic because it shows how the children are fighting to put their hands on their shares of the father who is going to die's estate. Eugene, the last born, stands over the m&eacute;l&eacute;e because he is going away and does not want to come back. He is going to Harvard to finish his university studies. And there appears the long-dead Ben, his brother, who makes him realize that anyone has to sever the chain to the family in order to be, to be oneself, to be free and oneself in one's own world and on one's own feet.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Thomas Wolfe (1900-1938) was greatly admired during his lifetime; no less than William Faulkner declared him the single greatest American writer bar none. Even so, many critics pointed out that although Wolfe had great strengths he also had great weaknesses, and those weaknesses have become increasingly apparent with the passage of time. His reputation has not survived, he is seldom taught in standard literary classes, and even less often casually selected by the reading public.LOOK HOMEWARD, ANGEL, published in 1929, was Wolfe's first novel, and like every Wolfe novel it is both fascinating and frustrating. The great fascination is Wolfe's sense of poetic narrative; he skillfully layers phrase upon phrase, creating images that sparkle in the mind's eye. His failure, however, is multiple, and not the least that too often Wolfe so heavily layers these images that it becomes very hard to see the foundation upon which they rest--it becomes difficult to see the gemstone because the setting is so lavishly ornate.Re ANGEL, Wolfe worked with editor Maxwell Perkins, who strove to curb Wolfe's excesses, and the result is considerably more readable than later Wolfe novels. ANGEL tells the story of the Gant family. Father W.O. has a broad world view--but drifts first into marriage with the unimaginative and utterly pragmatic Eliza and then into a roaring alcoholism. Their children emerge from this battleground as highly neurotic individuals--including their youngest child Eugene. Although the family regards him as they do any other member, Wolfe makes it quite clear that Eugene is a genius, and the novel follows him from cradle to young adult as he deals with his dysfunctional family.Virtually every novelist is autobiographical to some degree, but Wolfe is infamous for being exactingly so, and ANGEL is nothing more nor less than the story his family and his life. It is largely because of this that the novel, for all of Wolfe's talent for poetic narrative, is such a spectacular failure: he includes everything, from a carriage accident when a toddler to a case of crabs as a teenager, and he gives gives it all equal emphasis, treating such incidents with the same gravity with which he describes deaths, failed love affairs, and the like. Perhaps even more frustratingly, these events are often random and have no real position within the narrative thread; since it so meticulously rendered, you expect the carriage accident, for instance, to be a factor in the later portions of the work--but it isn't.What does gradually emerge is Wolfe's sense of social caste: Eugene is forever aspiring to higher social status and forever being knocked back by his father's alcoholism, his mother's lack of social propriety, and his own physical awkwardness. In tandem with this we also gradually come to realize that ANGEL is essentially Wolfe's self-justification of his feelings about his family and, more specifically, a love-letter to what he presumes is his own genius. The novel is seriously tainted by the author's own egotism.Add to this the fact that Wolfe is extremely self-contradictory in his writings and you have a significantly up-hill read that has less to do with a novel per se than it does with the writer's certainty that he is indeed a genius and that every moment in his life is worthy of prolonged examination. It is an issue that would plague virtually every word Wolfe wrote over the course of his lifetime: he is utterly and completely self-absorbed, and no world exists beyond himself.Although the comparison may at first seem unlikely, Wolfe is very much like Ayn Rand: a supreme egotist who writes in an incredibly wordy style and whose works are essentially created to display a presumed superiority over the rest of us. He is also like Rand in the sense that Wolfe is one of those writers that appeals to the young--especially those who are not well-read and who therefore aren't really prepared to spot the glaring flaws in his work. From my own point of view, Wolfe is memorable for his skill at turning a phrase, that famous gift of narrative poetry, but this aside the bulk of LOOK HOMEWARD, ANGEL is ponderous trash. It is a novel best left to advanced literature students who have no choice in the matter.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Sadly, I don't get what the big deal is about this novel. It is boring and plodding and pointless. It just goes on and on and on, and I kept asking myself, \`What's the point?' I kept waiting to be wowed, and instead I found myself wishing I'd never begun reading it.Quite honestly, I think Wolfe is overrated. He's nowhere close to being a Hemingway or a Faulkner. The entire novel is just a bunch of nothing, really. There's no substance to the \\"story\\" at all. In a way, he reminds me of Stephenie Meyer. She can't write either, and she takes forever to get to the point too.I've finished it and I'm still not sure what the \\"story\\" was about. It just seemed like this rambling mess with no plot. The only thing I know for certain is that the entire Gant family was crazy. That's about the only thing I got out of Look Homeward, Angel."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"It was sometimes difficult to wade through Wolfe's complex and dense style. After reading five pages, I felt like I had read enough for the day. With each page of prose, Wolfe shows that he is a master of the English language. There isn't much dialog or fluff in the book.Wolfe, by his character Eugene, writes about growing up in a mediocre family environment with a mediocre morality based on conventional platitudes that are not necessarily lived out. The funniest example would be Gant's saying that \\"licker\\" is root of all evil, but he could not stay off alcohol once the prohibition that he supported began. The Gants never seem to reach any transcendent enlightenment as they go about their little lives. His parents were often neglectful of their children's needs, but were not terribly abusive. The worst thing that happened to Eugene was that his mother made him wear shoes that did not fit him, which ruined his toes because she did not want good shoes to go to waste. The Gants were more materialistic than spiritual and their worst fault over the years was they forgot to love one another, being wrapped up in their own selfishness that made them a family of strangers. They pursued happiness, but never found a lasting one. \\"O lost!\\" is a phrase frequently used to express the loss of some long forgotten ideal that would have made life complete. So it is in this comical tragedy.Each member of the family plays his own role. Eugene is the scholar, Helen is the nurturer, Luke is the go-getter, Ben is the bitter one, Eliza is the property owner, Steve is the bum, Gant is the colorful character. There is a constant tension among them, with an occasional glimmer of rough affection that they are almost ashamed to show.Eugene's Dad, old man Gant, the master of the irrational rant, was given to drinking and whoring around at times. One example of his rants would be the tax rant. With each increase of property taxes, a new tirade would start about how the democrats would send him to the poor house. Eugene's mother, Eliza, was a pinchpenny who was always concerned about acquiring money to get more property to justify her self-worth. Gant and Eliza are in a mediocre marriage. He wants to roam the earth and she wants to possess it. They eventually separate. She runs a boarding house and he lives in the old family house.Eliza was the type of mother to send her children out to scare up some business for her boarding house, which a lot of characters came through, including clandestine prostitutes. After all, she thought, a person should not be afraid of a little hard work. So she lived the life many choose, concentrating mostly on work and money, and complaining about how much she had to work while accusing others that they were not working hard enough. She was also quite the chiseler at prices during any deal and everything could be bargained for with Eliza. Hard times during her formative years had traumatized her into being very materialistic.Eugene, the protagonist, becomes increasingly bitter about his dysfunctional family. He wants to leave them and enjoy life in peaceful isolation. Yet, he still loves his family and feels conflicting emotions about them. This is a good novel about the complexities of family life from someone who had below-average experience with one.Eugene's brother, Ben, is the bitter cynical child who has worked his life away since childhood and once states, \\"What are we living for?\\" He blames his mother Eliza especially for her niggardliness and her demanding that the children work hard even though the family is a well-off. Ben's death brings the family together for a brief moment of honesty and contriteness, until they go back to the selfish and self-pitying ways of average human beings. Ben's getting his death wish from weak lungs, smoking, and pneumonia is the climax of the book. The novel is a series of vignettes so there is not the usual rise and fall of a typical novel.A reader may note the annoyingly predictable habits of each family member, such as Eliza's frequent pursing of her lips. Knowing beforehand that someone is going to react in the same mechanical manner shows that they are stuck in their rut that they are addicted to.This is another sentimental boyhood tale at times, but Wolfe's superior writing makes it appear more than it is."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"I loved this book. And I was rather bothered by 'Lindsay's review (below), calling this work 'self-indulgent, self-pitying, pretentious, and cliched'. Isn't ALL good literature all four of these things? I mean sure it's a good old coming-of-age story, which are pretty common, but Wolfe embues the whole book with such a glorification of the normal plight of Man that one can't help but at least respect the writer, even if one doesn't appreciate the book itself. I don't mean to attack someone personally, it's just that I despise the way some think it is 'intellectual' to diss famous books. Not liking the novel is one thing, but it is utter pretension to assume any book that people dig is garbage just because it didn't fit into a close-minded veiw of what literature should be.Now the book: I thought it was bloody brilliant. As I said before, it's a coming-of-age story. But there is so much innocence and wonder in the book, as well. And the last 10 pages or so make the whole entire book worth it. They (and, in turn, the rest of the book leading up to these last pages) sum up in it's entirety the plight of every young romantic fool on the edge of the soon-to-be-discovered 'real world', looking back over their shoulder at shadows and angels and hoping there is glory to be found somewhere in the world. Trust me, it's great."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Far better than Mark Twain, this is the best American Marterpiece ever written. What else is their to say, except that he wrote in a completely free style in another time period which makes some people unhappy. Long after the trash written by copycats like Jack K. has been discarded, Thomas Wolfe's masterpiece will remain."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Thomas Wolfe reminds me of the eager kid who was smarter than the rest, surging ahead for pure love of learning and life itself. This transcendental outlook pervades this meandering story which in lesser hands would become saccharine, but veers away from that precipice with carefully constructed characters who are not cut-outs used in the puppet show of stories with a \\"moral,\\" but these vivid, living, breathing pieces of life that resemble others we have all known.While the subject matter is romantic to its core in that it combines a knowledge of mortality with a sweet delight in life, between the lines there is a fine-tuned observation of America as a culture of personalities. Wolfe understands the struggles of people both average and exceptional and winds these together to show the common path they are threading as they attempt to understand themselves, so they can appreciate life.Thomas Wolfe described himself as a \\"putter-inner\\" and in this book that might be initially viewed as a problem, since it spills from its pages even after extensive editing with gloriously rich language and a wealth of detail. After the first 100 pages however I stopped caring about this attribute, because my bias against it came from lesser authors who blurt out everything but the kitchen sink in an attempt to appear smarter than they are. Wolfe just delights in the details of life and the subplots that associate a character's journey through it.I recommend this book most heartily for parents of confused teens. It does not fail to show the shortcomings of our world, our species, and our nation, but it awakens our inner emotional strength that forms the want to overcome those. It does not preach morality, but it shows us the value of our time and from that a moral outlook, since when we care about our time we become more discerning. It took my breath away in its audacity to do the unthinkable, and sing a song of life the imperfect beautiful, and never to back down from that vision of poignant, transient glory."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Coming upon some of the reviews written herein, one is startled to hear repeated cliches in lieu of actual opinions.

He is attuned to the seasons, and much else at the same time:\\"Yes, and in that month when Prosperpine comes back, and Ceres' dead heart rekindles, when all the woods are a tender smoky blur, and birds no bigger than a budding leaf dart through the singing trees, and when odorous tar comes spongy in the streets, and boys roll balls of it upon their tongues, and they are lumpy with tops and agated marbles; and there is blasting thunder in the night, and the soaking millionfooted rain, and one looks out at morning on a stormy sky, a broken wrack of cloud; and when the mountain boy brings water to his kinsmen laying fence, and as the wind snakes through the grasses hears far in the valley below the long wail of the whistle, and the faint clangor of a bell; and the blue great cup of the hills seems closer, nearer, for he had heard an inarticulate promise: he has been pierced by Spring, that sharp knife.\\"That's just one example. Seemingly few seasons pass without comment during the years spanned by this novel.Wolfe is also attuned to character, and he writes at length about the members of his family and many of the people he knew during his boyhood in Asheville, North Carolina. The father of Eugene Gant, the Wolfe character in the novel, is lionized as a \\"great man\\" with larger-than-life passions and appetites, including a lifelong thirst for alcohol. His mother, a real estate speculator and boarding house operator, is described in rather unflattering terms, and a high school teacher eventually becomes Eugene's spiritual mother. Wolfe gives carefully drawn accounts of his siblings as well, including Grover, \\"a gentle peering face, a soft caressing voice, unlike any of the others in kind and quality,\\" who dies of typhoid when Eugene is a toddler. His sister Mabel (Helen in the novel), with a great maternal nature, often cares for their father or for Eugene in the novel. But it is his brother Ben, a kind man with a diamond-hard exterior, who has the closest bond with Eugene.The plot takes us through the familiar events of a boy's life. Many of these events are related with great wit; they are all written, in Wolfe's words \\"in innocence and nakedness of spirit.\\" Anyone who has had a paper route will respond to Wolfe's accounts of prowling about the town in all seasons, on the job, before the rest of the world awakens. From the other paper boys, he learns to smoke:\\". . . in the sweet blue air of Spring, as he sloped down to his route, he came to know the beauty of Lady Nicotine, the delectable wraith who coiled into his brain, left her poignant breath in his young nostrils, her sharp kiss upon his mouth.\\"At a tender age, Eugene goes off to college; he comes to know corruption and grief; he finds his way in the world. In a climactic scene with his brother Ben, Eugene understands the meaning of his journey so far, but there is no resolution or end in sight. The book leaves Eugene when he is 18, still an unformed man."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Calling Thomas Wolfe a literary genius is like calling your wife a dynamite telephone caller; it may be true, but it doesn't tell you much.After all, when we think of literary genius, we tend to think of a gift of words exercised in the service of something big, like truth or beauty or human potential, don't we? We may disagree about whether some genius accomplished great work, but it seems as though geniuses at least try to tackle something larger than themselves.Well, if Thomas Wolfe was a genius (and I'm not _entirely_ convinced), he seems to have used his abilities mostly to let everyone know just what a special, unique, amazing, unappreciated and put-upon soul Thomas Wolfe was. Some may call that an accomplishment; I call it whining.Mind you, \\"Look Homeward, Angel\\" is a very accomplished whine. In all honesty, too, that's not all it is. This book was one of the earliest examples of American realism as it came to prominence between the World Wars, a movement that included Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and all those other guys trying to shake loose from the Victorian romantic tradition. This means that Wolfe devoted considerable effort to descriptions of Southern small-town life around the turn of the century in all its details, including the ones that respectable people preferred not to think about. As such, it's a convincing job.Structurally, this is pretty straight narrative, which means that whatever was innovative about it had to come through Wolfe's writing style. \\"Look Homeward, Angel\\" concerns the history of Eugene Gant, Wolfe's alter ego, from a few years before his birth in North Carolina to his departure for graduate school at Harvard University.He grows, learns to deal with an alcoholic force of nature for a father, a semi-delusional miser for a mother, and a bunch of half-crazed older siblings. He explores the town from its wealthiest mansions to it most degraded poverty and racism. He goes to school and shows early promise, reads incessantly and fancies himself the hero of the grand drama that is his life. He falls in love two or three times, sometimes platonically and sometimes not. He attends college, finding it difficult at first, but soon makes a place of prominence for himself there. Finally, upon coming home, losing a favorite brother to tuberculosis and discovering the joys of alcohol, he confronts his family's collective sickness and littleness of mind, and heads north.None of this is terribly unusual. Indeed, any young person with any soul at all has probably gone through similar phases and stages, including the conviction that no one has ever gone through anything remotely like this before (ah, I remember the attitude well). That's what makes \\"Look Homeward, Angel\\" such an unbelievable pain in the rear; Wolfe apparently never grew up enough to realize that his experiences are universal, and so throughout his book he insisted on couching Eugene's (or his own) smallest experiences in the imagery of glorious Homeric adventure, with language to match.Sometimes this actually works. When, for instance, Wolfe describes the opening of a day in the Gant household with its boisterous flow of energy and alarming quantities of breakfast, the inflated language sucks you right in, makes you want to grab a plum from the Gants' table and chow down. The town, the people and the life are so vivid that it's no wonder people believed in them. Some found the sensuality so overwhelming they seemed to regard Wolfe as a threat to public morals.Elsewhere, though, particularly when showing us Eugene's inner life, the whole edifice falls apart like used Kleenex. Which may be appropriate considering the tears Wolfe obviously expects us to shed for Eugene, but it's hardly pleasant or inspiring. Surely it was possible, for instance, to give us Eugene's melodramatic love for a boarder in his mother's hotel without making him seem quite so pathetic? This is a boy and a slightly older girl in a run-down boardinghouse in North Carolina, after all, not Lancelot and Guinevere in noble but doomed love at Camelot, but you'd never know that from the language Wolfe uses.There was something I found disrespectful in Wolfe's utter inability to judge what tone to take with regular people and their lives. Such things are without question worthy of attention and respect; that's the whole idea of America. Wolfe's writing at these moments made me wonder if he was really attending to his characters and their experiences, or whether he was just using the whole thing to show off how fancy his writing could be. Made me want to reach into the book and slap him. Twice.So why the four stars? Well, because the man could actually write, dammit. He could write so well that even his purplest passages fascinated me. And at the end, as callow as Eugene Gant remains and as unaware of how ridiculous his moans of ecstasy and woe can be, I couldn't help liking the jerk. If I came across someone like him in real life, I'd think he was going to be a very worthwhile man one day, after a good kick in the pants or two.Thomas Wolfe didn't live long enough to benefit from such a kick in the pants, but his books show what he might have made of himself, so the air of melancholy about his prose feels earned somehow. And he certainly helped deliver a very useful kick to American literature, booting it right out of its leftover 19th-century politeness. For that alone, \\"Look Homeward, Angel\\" deserves our gratitude.Benshlomo says, God save me from a genius who knows he's a genius."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Few writers can coin a phrase or capture a mood or feeling like Thomas Wolfe could. This is never more evident than in \\"Look Homeward, Angel.\\" After all these years, still a classic, well worth reading for the first time or for another time. His ability to capture mood, colors, feelings and emotions in the depths of the human heart and soul, in and out of family relationships, is remarkable, as is the agelessness of the story. A timeless story of personal growth, coming of age and family dynamics. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Wolfe is known for his wordiness. So, 500 plus pages of oblique, almost pretentious prose could be too much for the average reader. The book is rarely boring, though. Actually, the more time you spend with this one, the more you will absorb, the more you will enjoy. Wolfe's descriptions of the characters and emotional climate of Eugene Gant and the townspeople of Altamont are stunning. University of North Carolina alumni, prick your ears: Chapel Hill, redubbed Pulpit Hill, was here put on the map more than half a century before Superchunk did the same thing with a different medium. The book never drags, and becomes pompous and a bit annoying only when the words \\"Oh, Lost!\\" crop up three or four times in a single paragraph.A side note: Wolfe was, of course, a well read man. Something that dawned on me a while ago: There is an homage to the great poet William Blake here. Blake, after the death of his brother Robert, whom William was training as an engraver, claimed to see visions of his brother, instructing him on how to format Blake's Songs of Innocence and Experience. Towards the end of the novel, Eugene Gant, grief stricken at the death of his brother Ben, weathered and aged though still in college, sees visions of his dead brothers Grover and Ben, swirling around him in a benign cloud of otherworldly wisdom and commiseration. Clever, Tommy.A great book all round."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"the most human characters i've ever known an author to create. every last detail is here, and it's painful and slow and heavy. by the end even the most heavy handed and abusive characters are somehow endearing and beautiful--like the family members you have to love, they are your blood. it is tragic and long winded and eruditic-- and simply the best book i've read."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"After a recent visit to Thomas Wolfe's home in Asheville, I felt like I had to read this book. I was particularly curious as to why everyone in his hometown was in such an uproar upon its publication in 1929. Now I understand.I checked this book out from the library, but now I simply must own it to add to my shelf of absolute favorites. It's a long book, so I spent a LONG time getting to know Eugene Gant/Thomas Wolfe, and I love the author all the more for letting me in on his autobiography in such a beautiful, poetic way.Wolfe came from a difficult family situation, with an alcoholic father and a poor mother who worked herself to the bone trying to run her boarding house, known as Dixieland in the novel. You can tour this home in Asheville; the house is actually called the Old Kentucky Home. Throughout the novel, he's searching, trying to find meaning to his many losses: his brothers who died, a lost love, his innocence, his childhood.In the end, Eugene Gant/Tom Wolfe finally feels free to leave his home forever. He'll be leaving North Carolina for Harvard, and now we all know that he left his life as a small-town boy with big dreams to become one of the most beloved authors of all time. I can't wait to read the sequel, Of Time and the River. I highly recommend Look Homeward, Angel to anyone who is a student of great American literature, and especially to writers of autobiographical fiction.Good companions to this book are Thomas Wolfe's The Story of a Novel and John Chandler Griffin's Memories of Thomas Wolfe: A Pictorial Companion to Look Homeward, Angel. If you're reading Look Homeward, Angel for the first time, Griffin's volume is a must. You'll be able to see Wolfe's actual family photo album, from which he drew his characters. After staring into the real Ben Wolfe's eyes, it took me several days to fully grasp the haunting story of what happened to him (I won't spoil it for you.) I have definitely become a Thomas Wolfe fan and only wish he hadn't died so young so that we'd have more of his genius works to ponder and enjoy."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Thomas Wolfe's Look Homeward, Angel is many things, all of them great; profoundly emotional yet deeply philosophical, it is one of the all-time best bildungsromans, an unforgettable evocation of the mountain American South in the late nineteenth/early twentieth centuries, and a masterpiece of poetic prose. It is an immortal American classic absolutely essential for anyone even remotely interested in American literature.The first thing we notice is the sparkling prose, which is some of the most poetic ever. Wolfe's writing is not simply beautiful but truly sublime; his sentences are lovely, his descriptions lush, and his tropes stunningly memorable. After two major successes, he fell out of favor in an era that valued concision and ambiguity, and time has only made him less conventionally palatable. The book is over five hundred pages, its sentences long, and its vocabulary dense; few readers would now not be scared by such a work. However, Wolfe shines at least as brightly as ever for those truly alive to language's beauty; his prose is near-unparalleled for inventiveness and sheer exquisiteness, making him one of America's great stylists.More fundamentally, the main thing making Look still so undeniably great is its masterful bildungsroman aspect. The novel is above all Eugene Gant's coming-of-age story. There are of course many such stories, but this is one of the very best. We follow Eugene literally from birth until he truly comes into his own in young adulthood and are deeply interested in his journey. The story is firmly rooted in Wolfe's life and thus has many particular trappings, but youth's essential experiences are universal, letting the book speak powerfully to many. We truly feel with and for Eugene because we see ourselves in him; he reminds us of our own youth - what could have been as much as what was. Wolfe tells his story with truly engaging emotion, quickly drawing us in and never letting go; we feel Eugene's ups and downs almost as if they are ours - which of course they are to a large degree. Though admirable in many ways, Eugene has clear faults that only make him seem more human and thus easily identifiable. Few bildungsromans are so transcendentally relatable or thoroughly stirring.However, calling Look a bildungsroman sells it rather short; it is a grand, sweeping epic of many facets. There are numerous other characters, a variety of situations, and several settings. The book is in a larger sense a story of the Gant family, following all members at various times and to various degrees. They are their own family, and we can admire or criticize as we please, but they are also in the truest sense archetypal. The interactions - strife at least as much as joy - that they represent are familiar to nearly everyone. We become as intrigued in their story as in Eugene's, feeling and growing along with them.Characterization is another Wolfe strength. All the Gants have strong individuality and are drawn strongly and evocatively, as are other characters. Wolfe interestingly combines Dickensian eccentricities with American realism's best aspects, creating a genuinely engaging and unforgettable cast.Look is also notable for bringing the Mountain South alive. Local color writing has a long and grand American tradition, and this is one of the best entries. Its Altamont is closely based on Wolfe's Asheville, North Carolina hometown, and he describes with the precision and subtlety only experience can give. Few writers have a greater sense of place. He makes us see landscapes nearly as if we are there and understand what it was like to live in such a place in regard to everything from speech to economics. On top of everything else, Look is thus of substantial historical value to anyone wondering how such people lived in such places in this era.The great William Faulkner called Wolfe the best writer of their time, and it is easy to see why. His writing is universal in the best sense, but he mastered the truly American grain that began with Twain and ran through the likes of Faulkner and Steinbeck. Dialect and place are of course a big part, and Wolfe has them down brilliantly, but it also runs deeper. Faulkner said art is worth nothing unless shot through with eternal feelings and thoughts, and Wolfe handles them with unusual deftness. He makes us feel as few writers can but also makes us think. Look is a deeply philosophical work focusing on themes like life's meaning, individuality vs. wider responsibility, the loss of youth's illusions, aestheticism vs. practicality, etc. It also touches on issues like class and race that are integral to American art and culture - and indeed to the world's. Novels encompassing all these threads are very rare, and only a few dozen have tied them together so well, much less so movingly.One problem with reading Look today is its unflinching racism depiction. Blacks are consistently treated poorly in it, the victims of prejudice and innumerable slurs from all white characters. More disturbingly, the narrative portrayal itself is grossly unflattering and lacks nuance, being also full of racial epithets and other highly derogatory comments. Jews are also shown unflatteringly but far more subtly. This is particularly worrisome in that Look is known to be highly autobiographical and that - unlike with, say, Twain - it is not satirical. It is impossible to deny that Wolfe grew up with many racial prejudices, at least some of which seem to have lingered when writing Look. His views later liberalized, as reflected in subsequent works, but Look remains clouded. Some will not be able to get past this, which is understandable. However, it is important to keep in mind that his prime purpose was realism; characters talk as people of the era really did, and the narrator writes as someone from Wolfe's background portraying such events almost inevitably would. The real problem is not Wolfe or the book but the era; he presents things as they were, for better or worse. This also adds to the historical value, though that of course does not atone. In fairness, we must remember that, however autobiographical, this is a novel and should not be used to determine personal views. I believe this should be a foundational critical principle, and it applies here as well as elsewhere. As for Look, all must judge by their own hearts and consciences. It is certainly a product of its time, which is no excuse but does explain the prevalence of views now rightly considered unacceptable.Excepting this admittedly large caveat, Look is superb in all respects, an American literary monument that will not be soon forgotten."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"I recommend Look Homeward, Angel to anyone searching for his or her identity. Therefore, I recommend it to everyone since we should all search for understanding ourselves forever and ever. We can all appreciate parts of this book. High school-aged students might be able to handle it if they are pensive readers...If you grow weary from heavily worded literature, this book may not keep your interest all the time. At times, I felt like I was forcing myself to tolerate the repetition of Wolfe's seemingly favorite word choices-\`loamy,' \`spermy,' \`inchoate,' to name a few. Also, the tone of the book is a bit overly dramatic and heavy, like an unnecessarily emotional woman; you may feel like plugging your ears. Otherwise, this book invokes the remarkable and unsettling sensation of never quite understanding one's place in this world-feeling restless and apart from it all. Without a doubt, I know that not everything in this book reached me-but I know it's there, and that's why I will read it again and hopefully appreciate it more someday. \`O lost!' for now, perhaps."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"In this American classic, Thomas Wolfe presents the Gant family, a spirited, feisty, multigenerational family living restless lives but unable to resist the magnetic pull of family and the small town in which they live. The centerpiece of the novel is Eugene Gant, the youngest, most intelligent, and possibly weirdest of the clan. From the time of his first thoughts, Eugene has the urge to flee, escaping the confines of the situation he was borne into in order to find a richer existence; no matter what he does, however, he finds himself back at home, among the people from whom he desperately wants to escape.Such is the story of every Gant member so brilliantly depicted in the novel. The oldest son fails to live up to any expectations and moves away in shame, only to return at the prospect of an inheritance. The daughters marry and try to create families of their own, only to return to help nurse the sick or with heads bowed down unable to conceive. The brothers strike out into the world in a variety of ways- as businessmen, soldiers, wanderers looking for a good time- only to find themselves back in the arms of their not too welcoming family. Each is a manifestation of their vibrant and restless parents, a drunk father who fights off an illness that has claimed many, and a money hungry mother who puts finances above family, all for the sake of the family.The characters are unforgettable, and Wolfe's depiction of small town life captures a time in this nation that has long been abandoned. The writing is beautiful, sarcastic, insightful, whimsical, lyrical, and when it comes to capturing the emotions of life- first loves, first heartbreaks, death- powerful.A must read."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Look Homeword, Angel is the most well-written piece of prose I have ever read. Wolfe is a genius, and I do not understand how society seems to have forgotten him when it lists great writers. This book is a work of art. While most books entertain, this one enlightens. In this book, Thomas Wolfe creates some of the finest characters in literature. I feel sorry for anyone who cannot relate with the protaganist, Eugene Gant. This is the story of one man struggling to learn his identity and find himself amongst a world of strong personalities. If I were an English teacher, I would make this book required reading. For beautiful language, intriguing characters, and wonderful imagery, I do not think a better story exists"},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Wolfe grabs my mind and plunges it deep into glorious words, pictures, people and places so that I'm thrilled and captivated. Look Homeward Angel is a slow read for me because I savor the language that awakens my heart and soul in new and wondrous ways.He doesn't write minor characters. Each person, even if only given a short time on the stage of this fabulous novel, is as rich and vivid as a person would be living their life before your eyes.This book is also a window into prejudice, cruelty, and personal disenfranchisement that was ordinary during the time of his writing. But it's also a window into a life of zest, of eagerness to live, and of a planet that was fertile and birthing new life in abundance.Don't miss it.Joanna Poppink, MFT, Los Angeles psychotherapist, lecturer, author of Healing Your Hungry Heart: recovering from your eating disorder."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"The first time I read it (at 15) I was intoxicated, overwhelmed by this earthquake of a novel.

And more concise too."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"\\"Look Homeward Angel\\", together with its sequel \\"Of Time and the River\\", is an intense and panoromic narrative of life in, and a paean to, early 20th Century America from the perspective of a Southern writer gone North. As such it foresages the experiences of others who came after him like Willie Morris. Wolfe's work artfully evokes much of the era that Ken and Ric Burns seek to capture in their documentaries but from the perspective of a participant and his personal struggles in life. (Wolfe's evocation of New York City in the 20s and 30s in \\"Of Time and the River\\" comes to mind in this regard). In sum, Wolfe's works are not only top-notch examples of American literature but stand as a monumental and inspiring expression of American culture and of the spirit that animated much of our society during the dawning period of the 20th Century. Wolfe's work is not in the tradition of pop culture and has little in common with the work of the current writer of the same name. Thus, reading Wolfe's work can be intellectually challenging. Nevertheless, tackling these books can be a rewarding and enjoyable experience for those seriously interested in American history and culture. Wolfe's work, notwithstanding its challenging level of literacy to some, is very absorbing and will only be found to be boring by more pedestrian readers or by those Yankee snobs who have contempt for the work's mostly plebeian subject matter."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"After reading this in college decades ago, it seemed time for a refresher. I had been impressed as a teenager by the vivid descriptions Wolfe used and wondered if the passing of many years would change my perception of the quality of his writing. It did not. The story is captivating and Wolfe's style invited me to re-read paragraphs just for the fun of it."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Author ofAfinidad: A novel of a serial killerAztec Dawn: A tale of sacrifical murder, from Manhattan to MexicoLike the author himself, this first novel resonates with the surge of life. It is passionate, sensual, and unsparing. Every aspect of life, from the characters' every thought and emotion, to descriptions of the natural world around them, is explored in great detail, sometimes to the point of being rambling and incoherent. However, there is a structure to the novel that ensures that the reader does not lose his way for very long. The book is set in a town ringed by the North Carolina mountains, at the beginning of the twentieth century, and tells the tale of a young man's entry into and passage through a life that was intensely sensual and chaotic. The large, rumbustious family that he is born into is given as much attention as he is. There are no aspects of family or individual life left unexplored. You get to know the members as well, or better, than you know your own, with all their idiosyncrasies, strengths and weaknesses. And when the young man goes out into the world to attend school and college, the reader goes with him in all his thoughts and deeds. We learn things that we may feel we could have done without knowing, but the story is a deeply honest recording of a young person growing up. It is, perhaps, a book that has not aged well, because the modern taste in books is for getting to the point of the story fairly quickly; but, for anyone who enjoys a rich flow of prose, of powerful use of language to create incredible imagery, character descriptions, and emotions, then Look Homeward, Angel is a must. You must read it for the journey that it is, and not for a particular plot or ending. I cannot understand why people criticize the book for being autobiographical. That is as legitimate a theme for a book as any other.Yes, the book is flawed and could have benefited from more editing by Wolfe's editor, Maxwell Perkins, but, for anyone who loves to get to know characters intimately, who enjoy being drawn deeply into a writer's web of lyrical narrative, this book will satisfy."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"When I was a teenager, I read Wolfe's final novel \\"You Can't Go Home Again\\" and was floored by its poetry and keen observation. I am a few (OK, quite a few) years older and recently returned to Wolfe and read his first big success \\"Look Homeward Angel.\\" It was a strange and not totally successful experience.The book is a fictional account of Wolfe's own childhood, and is a tragi-comical coming of age novel. The best parts, and there are quite a few, are achingly beautiful and poetic. Those scenes delivering newspapers in the early mornings, concerning a death in the family, and his early years at college as World War I was erupting are beautiful. Wolfe at his best makes you feel you are there and feeling the same things his main character Eugene Gant is feeling.Then there are chapters that seem to repeat what was said earlier or stretch an idea into a chapter length section when one page would do. Plot is not Wolfe's forte - it is conjuring scenes and emotions through smells, sights, sounds, and images. Wolfe adopts several different styles to accomplish this feat, but at its best this is a mix of super detailed realism and incredibly nostalgic poetry.Wolfe is legendary for his gigantic manuscripts that his editors whittled down to a more manageable size. For modern audiences, perhaps a little more editing would be desirable. It is a shame but I see why Wolfe was once so popular and why his literary star has dimmed over the decades. Still, at his best, Wolfe was amazing - you hit that final chapter of \\"Angel\\" and there are few final chapters in American literature as beautiful, powerful, and purely imaginative."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"This novel, his first, captures perhaps more than any other debut the fantastic potential this young man would show in his later writings. There is an old maxim that states that one should write what he or she knows, and Thomas Wolfe did just that. Other writers, with less than sincere motives, portray their surroundings with cynicism and malice; Wolfe wrote with an idealism that is heartbreaking in its naivete.Eugene Gant, like his real life counterpart, is a young man overflowing with a passion for life. Wolfe captured perfectly the ebullient and sensitive nature of this youth. But more than that, he somehow managed to portray Youth itself, with all of its passions, heartaches, and fever.Wolfe was no less generous with his portrayals of the characters who made up his family and acquaintances, describing them through the eyes of one who has yet to venture into the world. These portrayals, while not always flattering, are nonetheless sincere and honest.Much has been said about Wolfe's style, his tendency for verbosity. Many feel that his writing might have benefitted from more careful editing. But to limit Wolfe's prose is to limit the man, to cut him off at the knees. As Wolfe was acutely sensitive to every sensation that he encountered, so did his style reflect his unique experience of the world. His writing overflows with imagery, and he gives the reader the gift of experiencing life as he felt it.This novel lacks the fine-tuning and subtlety of his later work. The words rush recklessly, in a torrent of images and experiences, much like adolescence itself. In his story one can find, or recapture, what it means to be young and idealistic. Most of all, Thomas Wolfe left us a masterpiece that shows what it is like to be young and to feel as if the entire universe was created for each of us, alone."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"While I am thoroughly enjoying the book, this particular edition is awful!!! I don't know who if anyone edited this, but the rules of word division are totally ignored. Words just go to the end of the page and continue on the next line.

What's \\"buried life?\\" You'll know for certain once you read this novel: People buried by a dead-end life. It's the story of the Gant family living in Altamont (actually Asheville), North Carolina. Published in 1929 and considered semi-autobiographical, the bulk of the story takes place from 1900 to the mid 1920s. The focus is on Eugene Gant (Gant and Wolfe have the same birth date), his boozing father, his real estate obsessed mother, and assorted brothers and sisters. The style is spellbinding. What Wolfe can say in six words, he chooses to use 60. Where one modifying phrase will do, he tacks on seven more. A sentence can be an entire paragraph long. The book is filled with rants, which makes sense if Thompson recommended it. It's a long book, 662 pages, and it's not a fast read, but definitely a page-turner. It kept me up late for several nights. Bottom line, this is now one of my five most favorite books. Look Homeward Angel may not be your cup of tea, but I believe it's worth a shot.."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books. Sometimes I re-read sections just for an inspiration. Detailed and loaded, yes, but worth the effort to read. An underrated American classic of the highest order!"},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"When Thomas Wolfe is at his best, his writing is inspired, lyrical and athletic. Clearly, the work may be considered by some to be self-indulgent as the story line stays pretty close to home. Home is located in the hills of western North Carolina at his mother's boarding house, Dixieland. When a writer is fixed on his or her autobiography, and in Wolfe's case this involves his childhood, early youth and college education, the writing seems more non-fiction than fiction. This story is essentially Wolfe's autobiography like a novel from Proust. I wished that his jazz riffs from his personal experience were somewhat more improvizational and that he had ventured a bit further in his storyline as often this is a sign of immature talent in a novelist. But Wolfe's theme is home, after all, and if you enjoy coming-of-age stories, then you can savor this one. Wolfe does prove his real talent when he gets caught up in the mysticism of the moment and to his credit when he does so, his prose launches into a higher angelic ionosphere. His vocabulary is impressive and the writing, in many places, is so good that I found myself slowing down simply to savor the beauty of his use of language. Wolfe was relatively young when he wrote this novel and it brims with idealism and vitality and energy. This novel is an American classic of the South and well worth the reading for Wolfe's pure lyricism alone."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"The descriptive language and the use of metaphor were wonderful.The characters were actual residents of Asheville, N.C. who recognized themselves and made Tom Wolfe a pariah for many years. He is now remembered by the statue of an angel in a cemetary in Hendersonville, N.C. I enjoyed it a lot!"},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"A novel about growing up living and dying. A life filled with anguish,angst,loneliness and quiet beauty. The characters are so vivid you can see the buttons on their coats. Wolfe loves his life but he also knows that it will soon be over, so he captures the essence here. This novel is sometimes so beautiful it will fill your heart to the brim, making you stop reading ,put the book down and hold the ache until it passes. A must must read. Wolfe's &quot;Of Time and the River&quot;, is also brilliant, as is his short stories."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"... to a book of one's youth. I first read Look Homeward, Angel some 40 years ago, and like a few other reviewers, decided it merited a re-read. In the intervening years I carried the memory of a wonderful book that dazzled in its descriptive passages. In particular, I always remembered that he was one of the very few writers to have written at length on smells, as he did on page 69. I've always considered Wolfe on a par with other great southern writers like Faulkner, McCullers, Welty, and Baldwin. The re-read was from the same book that I had purchased those 40 some years ago, a Scribner Library edition, for $1.95, with the marks outlining the passages I considered relevant then, and still seem relevant today. After the re-read, I found myself agreeing with those who say that he has not stood the test of time, for others, as well as myself.The book is largely autobiographical, with Eugene, the last child in the Gant family the protagonist. It is his \\"coming of age\\" story; the background is America's own coming of age, the beginning of the 20th century. Most of the book is set in Altamont, a thinly disguised Ashville, North Carolina, with some sections in \\"Pulpit Hill\\" for his university studies - you guessed it - Chapel Hill. Like so many of us, his family is \\"unhappy in its own way,\\" but by in large, \\"gets by,\\" with an alcoholic father and an acquisitive, possessive mother. The siblings run the gauntlet from a vagabond bum, the \\"dutiful daughter\\" caring for the father, a sailor, one who dies far too early, et al. Each is supportive at times, and at others, disparaging.There are numerous insightful, well-described passages covering the coming of age period, such as: the time of first love, high on a hill, overlooking Altamont which eventually morphs into shades of Maugham's \\"Of Human Bondage\\"; the agony and awkwardness of that freshman year in college; the first job, delivering newspapers in the early morning hours; the heartbreaking death of two siblings to naturally causes; the underlying theme of the severance of ties from one's family and community. These, as well as others, would most likely find resonance with all readers. Wolfe becomes positively Joycian in lengthy chapter 24, capturing a slice of daily life in Altamont, with even a cameo role for William Jennings Bryan. The book, written in 1929, is also a valuable historical record of the outlook of Americans in the first two decades of the last century. The memories of the Civil War fade as America strolls onto the world stage, first via the Spanish-American war, later \\"The Great War.\\" The wars are welcomed with enthusiasm by the population. War profiteering was in full bloom in the section on Newport News, Va. Cars replace horses; electricity becomes widely available. Diseases routinely take lives far short of the allocated three score and ten. University education is reserved for a small minority. Medical care is rudimentary, often something reserved for \\"quacks.\\" And there was a distinctive hierarchical structure to small town life.There are some passages of philosophical insight, such as a precursor to the \\"butterfly theory\\" (i.e., distant events like a butterfly wing flapping in China effecting local events (p.160); is hell oneself, as Wolfe suggests or other people, as Sartre claimed?; and the marvels of war propaganda, when he read the headlines he thought the Germans were pushed all the way back to Cologne, and was surprised to find them just outside Paris.Was Wolfe racist, as some reviewers charged? He did describe African-Americans and Jews with the terms widely used at the time, in their roles in American society then. Overall though, he did not seem to do so in a derogatory way; more so it was as he might describe the natural surroundings. And who knows, in 100 years, perhaps the term \\"African-American\\" will be viewed as an epithet.But from the perspective of 40 years, and after having read Joyce, Nabokov, Proust, and others, I do believe that Wolfe falls far short, as a writer. He does hit on all cylinders in some sections, but there is a numbing repetitive use of some adjectives like \\"gaunt,\\" (probably 10 times in the first 15 pages), \\"pearly\\" for the sky, \\"petulant\\" (sometimes twice on the same page), and of course, the theme, the melodramatic \\"O Lost\\" grates like the proverbial chalk screeching across the black board by the end of the book. On at least three separate occasions he uses \\"stranger in a strange land.\\" On the first reading I was impressed with his dazzling erudition as displayed on page 29, the events and people who preceded the turn of the 20th century; now it seems like a mere listing of deliberately obscure events and people. Some of the dialogue is overblown, and pointless. And I do think his editor, Maxwell Perkins, who did delete some of the original manuscript, could have chopped another hundred pages off the bookI also found myself agreeing with other reviewers who derided his egotistic self-absorption which lacked useful insight. What, for example, do we learn of his first trysts with black prostitutes, or being seduced by a \\"cougar,\\" a woman almost twice his age? There is nothing. What of his sense of responsibility to the family he leaves behind? What of the returning veterans of the \\"Great War,\\" and there disillusionment. Again, nothing. Overall, there seems to be far too much wallowing in the \\"O Lost\\" theme, without the hardship to justify it.So, at least with books it is possible to go home again, and reflect on where you have been in the meantime. Despite the 3-stars, it is a recommended read for being a classic book of its period."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"If you're looking for light reading, this is not for you!Thomas Wolfe's writing is akin to old Victorian furniture...ornate,heavy, and cumbersome,but with its own particular beauty.Wolfe is in love with the language, almost to a fault.I found his descriptive style tedious at times, piled high with far too many adjectives.This coming-of-age story is sweet within itself.And Wolfe gives us an interesting and detailed historical description of the area around Altamount, North Carolina,and the city of Boston, and Harvard University. The thoughts and feelings of a bright and talented young man trying to find his way in the world, weave their way throughout the fabric of the story.If you are willing to forge your way through all the heavy prose, this would be worth your while. But this tome is NOT for the faint of heart."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"I could not read the book. The product was defective and it could not be read, it would not line up on the page correctly. When speaking with someone at Kindle they told me they were not able to fix the problem and would have to send it back to the book company. I was sorry because I really wanted to read Look Homeward Angel."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"I realize a number of reviewers think this is a great book. Not me. Compared to real literature, it is boringly repetitive with endless trite descriptions of EVERTHING. I read that Wolfe was enormously proud of his ability to write pages a day. Well, if one used every possible adjective to describe EVERYTHING I could certainly do the same. Writing quantity is easy; writing QUALITY is another matter entirely. Dickens, Thackery, Austen, Bronte, Capote are all far better writers and address much the same subject. If you insist on wasting time reading it, at least borrow it from the library...don't through your money away buying it."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"I wanted to find a book to read for pleasure (since I am typically found reading college text books). A Bad Religion song references this author/book, and that was why I chose it. However, I have not yet found time to sit down and start it, but it looks great and the subject matter sounds very interesting. I think anything that Bad Religion references would be an educational and interesting pick."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"This is a book about Wolfe's boring southern life. It's cliche to the extreme: &quot;romantic&quot; young man goes to university, laments the fact that he is so much more intelligent than others, wishes people could understand him, returns home and looks down on everybody there. Unfortunately Wolfe is not close to being intelligent or interesting (and he certainly is not a genius as he himself said!). Wolfe obviously thinks that everything that has happened in his life will be of interest to the reader, after all he holds himself to be a genius, but one immediately sees how self-important he is, and how seriously he takes his ridiculous outlook. This is a nostalgic book; if you want to read a nostalgic book, read some Proust or Nabokov, who both soar above Wolfe, and let Wolfe be forgotten as he soon will be."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"OKay, I think my title pretty much sums up the book. But I suppose I should elaborate. In general, I do not like coming-of-age stories because all the author does is reflect on his youth without any plot. The main characters are always flawless heros, in a struggle against a cruel world that cannot understand their genius. Of course, no character in a book can be flawless. The authors just use the novel format as an excuse to lament on the cruel injustices that happened in their youth. I was punished in school when I didn't deserve it! I had to work at a job I didn't like! Boo hoo, poor me! No one is as smart as me! I have really deep thoughts! It's me against the world! Yep, arrogant, self-indulgent, and self-pitying all the way.Wolfe's writing is also particularly bad and cliched. &quot;Negroes&quot; are always snoring &quot;through blubbering lips.&quot; When they are awake, they do everything &quot;sleepily.&quot; You never see Eugene's mom without her pursing her lips. You never see his brother without him saying &quot;damn!&quot; The bad descriptions wouldn't be so intolerable if they didn't happen over and over again. And for the record, I like description, and I don't judge novels for racism that was considered politically correct in their day. I love Conrad, for example. But this is pretentious and generic and bad. Avoid at all costs."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Of all the supposed American &quot;classics&quot; I've read, this is the dullest of the lot, and, given the overtly racist observations, a poor suggestion for young readers. While the characterization of the family is unparalleled, the book, at 500 pages, is about 200 pages too long, and Wolfe takes way too many liberties with his flowery anglophile prose, repeating ad nauseum the same pithy poetic quotes. The book also serves as a painful reminder of our not-so-distant past, with numerous insulting racist commentaries regarding African-American and Jewish peoples. As a slice of history, and a gripping family portrait, this book is worth a read, but in pure story-telling talent and artistry, Wolfe pales in comparison to the other writers of the era (Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Faulkner). Thumbs down."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Someone from my book club selected this as their recent choice. Out of 8 people not one person liked the book. We found the writing to be tedious as well as pompous and the storyline to be dull. Our interest was not sparked and most of us quit before we finished. Life is too short to read bad books."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"I was keen to read this novel, as it inspired many authors, including Pat Conroy...It was written many years ago, the author deceased in 1938....However the writing is inspiring and will stay in my memory as a special novel."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"This book is so hard to read and so many parts are incomprehensible that to give it one star is a gift. Its only saving grace is the way it conjures up late 19th and early 20th century America, with all it's charlatans, hucksters, get-rich schemes, and its often cheap and crude quality of life. It helps you understand why Charles Dickens hated America! But Wolfe has an undisciplined, crude style (matching his subject) that is painful to read. I swear he's made up many of the words, and one can't decipher them from the context. My book club read it, and not one of the nine attendees read more than 300 pages of the book."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"I rarely stop reading a book in the middle of it, but I couldn't take any more of Look Homeward, Angel after Part I (about 1/3 of the way through). It was long, rambling, and most of the passages did not add anything to the story, not even in the way of atmosphere. I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Temple, its ministry and services as they were at the time of Jesus Christ","review":"This volume in its first publication in 1874 was an invaluable compendium of information that bridged the gap between the ancient world of the first century and the modern era. The 75 full-color photos and illustrations plus the carefully revised and updated textual notes have only added to this value!"},{"Title":"The Temple, its ministry and services as they were at the time of Jesus Christ","review":"This book is a wonderful book--it is well written, organized well in a format that allows for relatively quick reference, and just plain has a lot of information in it.Edersheim was a Messianic Jew who lived during the 1800's. He was a phenomenal scholar, which he proves again in this book. This book is riddled with citations to the Talmud, Josephus, and many other early sources. By Edersheim's own admission, he omits as many footnotes as he can--and there are still more footnotes than most books written today!That said, I suspect it is not the book for everyone. First of all, it is written from a Christian perspective. Edersheim shows, very effectively, how Christ fulfilled all that the Temple portrayed. To do this, there are some discussions that many people will find simply boring (I found most of them fascinating). Also, it is worth noting that this book was first published in 1874--and the Edersheim's writing style is thus outdated by over a century. If that doesn't bother you, then great--pick up the book. Or, if you don't plan on actually reading the book cover to cover, but would like a good reference, this would be a good book as well. If, on the other hand, you don't enjoy reading 19th-century language, this book may be sufficiently painful enough for you that you should pass it up.However--and a big however--if you're not sure whether you would like this book, get it anyway. It's a great book.Edersheim takes the reader throughout the first-century Temple, illuminating many things that are not commonly known. The book has some very detailed information in it, details not known to most people. These details bring to light many of the themes of the New Testament, and helps the reader understand exactly what was meant in a given passage.For a better understanding of the Temple in the times of Christ, this book is superb--but like I said, probably not for the faint of heart."},{"Title":"The Temple, its ministry and services as they were at the time of Jesus Christ","review":"I bought this book a couple of years ago and reference it from time to time after having read it completely. This version, which updates Edersheim's magnificent 19th century edition, contains color photos of some of the best researched models of the Herodian Temple at Jerusalem and is your one-stop-shopping source for information on structure, priesthood function, liturgical song and rites. Eyewitnesses to the Temple, such as Philo and Josephus are consulted and cited. Rabbinic material is investigated and used to support the text.The Temple is depicted in painstakingly detailed models and maps based on the best archaeological evidence and eyewitness reports. Edersheim and his successors then take you through the priesthood functions as well as the rules specific to behavior in/around the Temple, and funding sources such as the various taxes and offerings. Next the sacrifices are covered. I found the most striking chapter for me to be \\"At Night in the Temple,\\" where Edersheim takes you on rounds with the priests and temple guard. Everything is here, the feasts, the Passover, the Day of Atonement.If you're a Jew, this text will help you in your studies of pre-diaspora Jewish Temple worship. If you're a Christian, it sheds more context on the New Testament by filling in blanks that would have made sense to 1st century Jewish Christians. One can sense just how devastating the loss of the Temple in 70AD must have been for the religious Jews of Jerusalem."},{"Title":"The Temple, its ministry and services as they were at the time of Jesus Christ","review":"This is a terrific book, but some of the information is inaccurate and the wordier style of the 1800s can be difficult to follow. It has fantastic pictures. You can also try Garrards Splendour of the Temple (scads of photos, many the same as edersheim's) - you can also buy a cd of photos from a model for that, Leen Ritmeyers Secrets of Jerusalem's Temple Mount (he's a top scholar in the field but the book is quite readable), Carta's Encyclopedia of the Hholy Temple (or something like that). Also try the site of \\"The Temple Institute\\" for books reflecting more of the temple services like Edersheim has(less phsyical appearance, but both have a good deal of both), but buy it from Amazon, much cheaper! I haven't received them yet so I am quoting their description. Edersheim is a talented writer, some beautiful descriptions. Garrard's and Ritmeyer's are more correct but less eloquent and evocative.Hope all that helps somebody out there! I had an impossible time finding anything on this temple, because Amazon just refers you to other Edersheim books in their sections on similar books and purchases."},{"Title":"The Temple, its ministry and services as they were at the time of Jesus Christ","review":"This 1997 edition by Kregel Publications is beautiful. It has photographs of a model of the Temple accompanying the text. Even if you already have a copy, this edition is worth finding!"},{"Title":"The Temple, its ministry and services as they were at the time of Jesus Christ","review":"The book 'The Temple' offers interesting details of Herod's Temple in Jerusalem...This is important because it would have been the temple that Jesus, his disciples and Jews in general saw and related to, and It was this temple that was destroyed by Titus in 70 C.E.I do have a couple of issues with some of the descriptions of various sacrifices and temple services. The way Mr. Edersheim and Bimson wrote and edited the book often makes it hard to really understand what is being done and why...but if you have OTHER references books to fall back on when you hit one of these little snares this book is worth adding to your collection of reference works."},{"Title":"The Temple, its ministry and services as they were at the time of Jesus Christ","review":"This is a classic work done from research with opinions called out and expressed. I appreciated the scholarship and research of the author, his knowledge and opinions are well laid out and the clarity between the two is refreshing, compared to much of the recent works published (where opinion is put forth as fact).I recommend this book if you are interested in the blending of the Jewish traditions with and into a disciplined worship of Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"The Temple, its ministry and services as they were at the time of Jesus Christ","review":"The pictures are amazing, the detail descriptions of all of the things are awesome. I LOVE this book. It makes it fun to read about the old testament!"},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"This is political farce with a vengeance. The back jacket on the paperback says this book is not a political book in any imagined sense of that term and that's essentially true. The author's position on the old South African regime is pretty clear from the word \\"go\\" but it never dampens the fun.The book is so over the top that its characters come off as cardboard cutouts of a caricature--yet, somehow, Sharpe still finds a way to imbue them with enough connective personality that we are drawn into the farce willingly. The book is extremely funny--I laughed out loud at least twenty times. It is a rather crude undertaking--but then again, so was the old South Africa, and this books achieves the unique aspect of being extremely sexually explicit while never actually rendering an actual sex scene--not for want of trying on the \\"heroines\\" part.All in all a lot of fun is the crudity and explicitness don't put you off. If that's the case, seek humor elsewhere.I enjoyed it enough that I have ordered another couple of Sharpe's books to see if they are as good. I have high hopes on that score."},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"If you're ever in the mood for a hugely over-the-top farce about apartheid-era South Africa, well, this is the book for you. Sharpe spent a decade there before being deported as a subversive, and after reading this unrestrained comic pummeling of the RSA, one can only wonder why it took the authorities so long to give him the boot. Indeed authority is target number one in this fast-paced story set in the small city of Piemburg. It all starts when an elderly semi-aristocratic Englishwoman calls the police to report that she's shot her Zulu cook. Refusing police Kommandant van Heerden's best attempts to cover up the matter, she reveals that the cook was also her lover, which so appalls him that he immediately declares a state of emergency and mobilizes the entire police force. And so begins a massive comedy of errors, in which a \\"Kaffir-Killer\\" Konstabel Els plays a large role, as does the slimy Luitenant Veerkamp, and matters take a turn for the utterly bizarre, as rubber fetishes, bondage, a drunken bishop, porno films, cross dressing, and penile novocain injections are all introduced to the plot. As one might surmise from such a litany, the plot spins ever more wildly out of control until events come to a head at--appropriately enough--the insane asylum. All the antics are intermittently funny, and it's somewhat refreshing to see the horrors of apartheid treated with rather less than the usual gravitas. Worth a read if you've got a special interest in South Africa or a soft spot for broad farce, otherwise not all that noteworthy"},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"This is the first of Tom Sharpe's two novels set in South Africa. This is a very funny book. It is very perverse and zany fun.The book begins with the murder of a black house wroker by a member of a prominent English family in the city of Piemburg. Enter the police. There is Kommandant van Heerden, who wants nothing more than to be English, Konstabel Els, who is renowned as a killer of blacks, and Luitenant Veerkramp, who is one of the slimiest and wiliest characters in the Piemburg police force. A routine police investigation turns into an armed confrontation between the unwitting members of the Piemburg police force, while van Heerden is unwillingly seduced by the murderer he is investigating. These are just a few of the hijinks that ensue as the police's irrational actions keep making the situation worse.This book is excellent because Sharpe is able to expose the irrationality of apartheid and the actions of the authorities to keep this practice going. After reading this book, there is little wonder in my mind why Sharpe was expelled from South Africa in the '70s."},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"This is Tom Sharpe's first venture into print way back in the seventies after being deported from South Africa. A perusal of the contents will answer the question why succinctly! A paen to middle class prejudices and yearnings everywhere, which when coupled to a prediliction for bizarre episodic violence triggered by equally bizarre human behavior will leave your sides splitting! This started the whole Sharpe thing which afficiondo's will tell you is utterly irresistable and addictive, while leaving one wondering as to the workings of Sharpe's mind! These English &quot;Public&quot; schoolboys!"},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"Possibly the funniest book in the English language. I must have for any dedicated humor collector!"},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"This decidedly intemperate dark jewel has been criticized for, among other things, being short on a coherent logical plot. Fair enough. And saturated with unsympathetic characters. Point taken. So what? If you can find a better written rant of absurd, politically incorrect, howlingly hilarious black (as in motif, not ethnic) humor by all means set Riotous Assembly aside and go with your more entertaining discovery, and be so kind as to post its name here so that we may all partake.Compared to Riotous Assembly, Mel Brooks' best sounds like a grim Savonarola tract."},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"THE FUNNIEST BOOK ON EARTH!!A roaring romp of a book. Brilliant satire at it's best.Certainly a must read for lovers of dark humour. Tom sharp also outpaces himself in 'Indicent exposure', 'Blot on a landscape' and 'Wilt'.A master of exuberant satire that evidently is not content with providing a rib-cracking read, but also exposes a darker side of humanity we should not forget- the evil of racism and discrimination."},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"Non stop crazy Boer antics in S.Africa , difficult to put it down. I heartily recomend it to all and everyone."},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"It's rare that I read an entire novel at one stretch, but this novel gripped me from start to finish. It's a mix of gentle farce (a la Jeeves) and not-so-gentle black comedy. Warning: there's a lot of blood and gore."},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"I first found a Tom Sharpe book in Heathrow while traveling years ago. This was before the internet and before Amazon and when you had to find a book in a bookstore to buy it. So every time I went to England after that I explored bookstores looking for more of his books. I kept hoping I would find another and frequently I did.This book is satire and black humor and so well written you will find it very very hard to put it down and do something else. And you will be so very lucky to be able to go on the internet and find the other fabulous books this author has written that you can buy. You won't have to wait and wait as I did.Men and women will enjoy this. Teens might but much of the satire might not be understandable for them and they might not understand it as well."},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"Haven't had a book make me laugh for a long time. To envision the happenings was a delite. Well done Tom Sharpe. A great read. Very funny."},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"Every now and then my life gets so jumbled, or my hormones rise or fall and depression sets in, and I just need a rousing good laugh. That's when I pick up this book. It has never failed to at least amuse or, more often, to induce a tears-in-my-eyes unrestrained laughing fit. While this can be disconcerting to co-workers in nearby cubicles, it nevertheless works wonders for my sour moods.Totally loony in a restrained British (or in this case, South African) manner, this tale of apartheid, fetishism, gender role swapping, gigantic firearms and novocaine in the mythical South African town of Piemburg is quite simply a hoot.That it works better than Prozac as a mood leveler (Fair warning-- I'm not a psychiatrist, I just play one on Amazon!) is a wonderful bonus."},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"A friend in Britain and I sent each other some favorite books. Since David hadn't read much SF/F, I sent him Jonathan Carroll's Bones of the Moon and James P. Blaylock's The Last Coin. In turn, he sent me some British humor: Tom Sharpe and Clive James. James' books were quite interesting--a well-written autobiography with some sly touches that never quite had me belly-laughing, but kept me reading. Sharpe, on the other hand, I fell into with a gusto. From page one of Riotous Assembly, my hands were doing double-duty turning pages and trying to keep my sides from splitting.Imagine the writer you would get if you mixed P.G. Wodehouse and Hunter Thompson, and then placed them in South Africa; that's Tom Sharpe. He indeed manages to combine the wit and language skills, as well as the awkward situations of Wodehouse with the sharpened pen of satire and low opinion of humans from Thompson, and his target is South Africa and the police forces there (I believe that he was jailed there for awhile, and ultimately deported).Upon finishing Riotous Assembly, I rushed to see if I could find any more by this Sharpe fellow. Luckily, Vintage has brought him across the sea for our enjoyment. Indecent Exposure is the sequel to Riotous Assembly and just as funny; perhaps even funnier, given the satire of the Dornford Yates club (a group of Englishmen who adore the veddy British writer Dornford Yates who is clearly an analog for Wodehouse) within the larger South African satire. I also read Wilt, in which he drops some of the satirical and plays the perverted Wodehouse more. Wilt is okay, but I would suggest you try the South African novels first. If you're like me, you'll have to read Wilt or any of his other novels then--just because you can't get enough of this amazing fellow."},{"Title":"Riotous Assembly","review":"In many respects, apartheid South Africa provides a great setting for farces and satirical novels. Tom Sharpe ably exploits the possibilities in this tale involving an interracial affair, a bishop who ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time, and a murder investigation by irredeemably dumb and racist Afrikaner policemen.Parts of Riotous assembly are very funny and Sharpe maintains the hectic pace of the narrative throughout. But in the end, I was disappointed with this book. My dissatisfaction had nothing to do with being an Afrikaner or with an aversion to dark humour. Carl Hiaasen is one of my favourite authors, and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie version of Sharpe's Wilt. My problem was with the characters, who seemed to have no personalities whatsoever beyond the stereotypes they represent.

Python or Roland Aktinson. I loved it, and this is one of those books that you never get back when you loan it out, order several copies...."},{"Title":"Dark of the Gods","review":"For those of you already familiar with P.C. Hodgell's books God Stalk, Dark of the Moon, Blood &amp; Ivory, and Seeker's Mask--and who are thus chomping at the bit for the sequel--please be warned: Dark of the Gods is not a continuation of the Jame saga! It is a compilation of the first two books, along with an excerpt (&quot;Bones&quot;) from the third. Imagine the devastation and disappointment when (having just re-read the series for the fourth time in the past decade in anticipation of a new book) I discovered that I still don't know what happens to Jame after Seeker's Mask! AAAARRRRRGGGHHH!On a more positive note, for those of you unfamiliar with Ms. Hodgell's works, this is an excellent opportunity. God Stalk introduces you to Jame as she emerges from darkness to search for her twin; however, this is NOT just another quest story. Instead, the quest steps back to hover in the background while this richly developed character learns a thing or two about politics and thieving (and no, I'm not necessarily being redundant in this case), and faces challenges to her concepts of honor and monotheism. Hodgell's portrayal of Tai-tastigon--the wonderfully intriguing setting, with its wealth of scoundrels, gods, and heroes--makes the city seem almost a character in itself.&quot;Bones&quot; (a brief tale written, perhaps, as a crust of bread thrown to the hungry dogs howling for a sequel to God Stalk?) provides a glimpse into another of Jame's Tai-tastigon adventures which enhances her reputation as Penari's Talisman. Although I originally read \\"Bones\\" out of order (it was written between God Stalk and Dark of the Moon), it seems to have found its proper place sandwiched between its two larger contemporaries. Originally published as a short story and obviously meant to stand alone, it merely serves as an aside--entertaining, without being crucial to the story line.Dark of the Moon, however, finally introduces the reader to Jame's elusive, and equally complicated, brother Tori--and it is as much Tori's story as Jame's. And while this shared billing perhaps accounts for my personal preference for the first book (being a big fan of strong, honorable female leads), the second book is equally intriguing. Decidedly more complex due to its shifting viewpoints and introduction of an almost entirely new supporting cast, this one should be read slowly and carefully, particularly during its development of Kencyrath history and culture, as well as where the stories begin to overlap and converge. And without giving anything away, one angle that I found most interesting was Hodgell's commentary on the importance--and the dilemma--of responsibility; I am reminded of Stanley Milgram's &quot;The Perils of Obedience&quot; (a must read for anyone, anywhere).By now (assuming that you are still reading this rather long-winded review) I hope you have reconciled the seemingly conflicting title of my review and the five-star rating. The book is wonderful--how could it not be, given its nature? But my initial disappointment in a lack of new material automatically led me to write this review to warn others like me who are eagerly awaiting the next step of the journey. My initial response was, I confess, one that could have come straight from the mouth of Selina Rosen's Drewcila Qwah (those of you who have read Queen of Denial know what I'm talking about--but my mother is still blessedly in the dark). However, I have decided to just get over it and, instead, to keep Dark of the Gods as a loaner copy. I guess it's only fair since I've been talking about the series for over a decade, but haven't been willing to loan out my copies."},{"Title":"Dark of the Gods","review":"I once had the pleasure of meeting the author of the two novels collected here at a writing workshop held at my college. She is a handsome woman, full of verve, and blessed with a keen eye born of life experience that allows her to be not only a wonderful writer, but a wonderful friend to writers. She also has a Ph.D. in English, so you know her writing is nothing to sneeze at.This volume compiles her first two fantasy novels, \\"God Stalk\\" and \\"Dark of the Moon,\\" along with a short story, \\"Bones,\\" that adds to the events of the first novel. In a genre dominated by authors who try to replicate one another's successes, and by readers who shy away from challenge or from anything new, it's no wonder these books are little known. However, true lovers of fantastic fiction will be well rewarded by letting their gazes wander in this direction at least once.The first book covers a year and a half in the life of the protagonist, Jame, and the second covers a matter of some short months. (The third, \\"Seeker's Mask,\\" covers a little over a week. Plainly some crisis point is approaching for the character.) Her personal history is murky to us, and evidently only little better to her. She has spent a great deal of time in a place where time evidently doesn't apply, as she is seeking out her long-lost twin brother, who is now ten years her senior. She herself is an enthusiastic youth, and the story arc of the books is a maturation process for her.In the first book, she finds herself at loose ends in a city where gods appear and disappear quite suddenly, where her own lost God gives her a task that violates everything she holds dear, and where her only options for survival include learning to steal and using her religious devotionals, which involve a hypnotic martial dance, as cheap entertainment. First published nearly twenty years ago, when the author was only somewhat older than the character, it reflects the turmoil all youth go through as they try to define their identities without their parents, while remaining inextricably part of the world around them. It also reflects the author's religious uncertainty, which comes out if you ever talk to her about issues spiritual.The second book takes the character in a new direction. She leaves behind the trappings of the life in the city, bringing only the newfound self-discipline with her. She thinks she's going to cross the mountains into the land where her brother and her race live, but instead finds herself in a series of distortions, as time, space, and place are warped in an attempt to ensnare her for nefarious ends. The quest for her brother, and with him some form of family link and some form of group identity, takes on the proportions of a heroic quest, and receives only momentary resolution, deeply unsatisfying to the character, at the end.These novels are more complex than nearly any other written in the fantasy genre. This, combined with the fact that P.C. Hodgell isn't a very prolific writer, has denied this story the popularity it deserves. However, for true lovers of the genre, and for lovers of good popular literature, this omnibus volume is one of great significance and quality. This is a book you'll lovingly reread and assign a treasured place in your collection. More than fantasy, this is a potential novel for the ages-and how few others can make that claim."},{"Title":"Dark of the Gods","review":"...when I was browsing the aisles of my favorite local specialty bookshop and turning my head, saw 'Dark of the Gods'. For one heartstopping moment I thought it might be the next book after 'Seeker's Mask'. But this is nearly as good: someone is reprinting Ms. Hodgell's works! Finally when I rave about her books I'll be able to tell people where to find them. Why do I rave? Great storytelling, first. Second, the magical way in which Hodgell puts her original spin on common fantasy elements. Third: her heroine. Jame is an impressive mixture of the powerful, the impulsive, the kindly, and the destructive. Like a good actor cast as the lead in a movie, she can carry the plot and yet be vulnerable. In the story, Jame must constantly walk a fine line between destroying others with her talents, or being herself destroyed by use of them. She is entropy personified yet Jame also has many endearing traits. I've been reading this story since I found 'Godstalk' in the early 80's. I bought 'Seeker's Mask' for $70 (didn't regret a dime). I bought the soft cover of 'Dark of the Gods' even though I own two copies of 'Godstalk' and one of 'Dark of the Moon' because I want to support this fine author. The long wait between books has done nothing to chill my ardor--for one thing they're extremely re-readable. Go on: buy; read; become addicted!"},{"Title":"Dark of the Gods","review":"Set in a semi-medieval world, this book actually encompasses two books: God Stalk(1) and Dark of the Moon(2). In God Stalk, we meet Jame as she is trying to re-discover herself--her memory is scrambled. She winds up accidentally(?) apprenticed to the premier thief of the city. She struggles with her morals, her identity, and who and what she may become. Dark of the Moon does suffer slightly from &quot;2nd book syndrome&quot;, in that it is not as compelling as the first. It still makes a good read, as Jame searches for her twin brother. I waited and waited for a sequel to this series! Thank goodness Meisha Merlin stepped in and printed Searcher's Mask--as good as the first book! If you liked Tanya Huff's 4 Quarters series, you should like these."},{"Title":"Dark of the Gods","review":"I used to buy used copies of God Stalk whenever I saw them, just to pass on to people saying \\"Read this Book!\\"Hodgell's books are one of my all time favorite fantasy series, written in the tradition of Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser stories (but with a few Lovecraftian twists thrown in).Jame is one of the most original characters in modern fantasy, and Tai-Tastigon is a wondous hodge-podge of those fantasy cities you always wanted to visit. Hodgell's work recalls many of the greatest fantasists of the pre-Lord of the Rings era, yet has a wondeful modern voice all its own.Please buy this book, if only help ensure that Hodgell will keep writing, and all of us die-hard fans who have been tearing our hair for 2o years will finally get to read the conclusion of Jame's story."},{"Title":"Dark of the Gods","review":"I first read God Stalk a few years ago on recommendation of a friend. Until Meisha Merlin published their editions of Hodgell's books, they were difficult to find, having been out of print for a while. I later found this compiled edition. I re-read God Stalk, and didn't stop until I finished both novels and the short story &quot;Bones&quot;!My impression of the first novel, God Stalk, which remains the same after a second reading, is that it is cramped. We see an entire year of Jame's life in this short novel, and besides that we are introduced to the world of Rathillien, Jame's background, the city of Tai-Tastigon, and numerous characters and locations within it. Reading it requires a lot of attention, and even then it's easy to get confused without referring to the detailed map in the front of the book. The supporting characters are more sketches than fully realized human beings--Bane remains a favorite though! But despite any problems, God Stalk is fascinating. Hodgell has a beautiful way with description and her world building is awesome.God Stalk opens up several questions about Jame that made me rush to read the second book--for example, will she ever realize that her very nature, fairly or unfairly, requires her to be careful about what she does?&quot;Bones,&quot; far from being dispensable, adds much to both Jame's character and to the Maze, her mentor's home and workplace.Dark of the Moon remedies many of the problems I had with God Stalk. It is 100 pages longer and covers a much shorter time period, a matter of weeks, making for a much better read, in my opinion. While some of the villains (Bortis, for example) are drearily one-note, some of the others, especially the Perimal Darkling characters, are fascinating, and I look forward to meeting them again in future books. Speaking of Perimal Darkling, we are given a lot more background about it and how Jame is connected to it, as well as about the &quot;Builders&quot; who were given minimal treatment in the first book. In Dark of the Moon we also get our first glimpse of the Kencyr society, its attitude towards women, and the conflicts between its major houses. As you might guess, there is quite a lot of detail in this volume; but it was handled in a way that didn't stop the forward momentum of the story. Rathillien builds itself up layer by layer through Ms. Hodgell's marvelous prose, and I became immersed in it, wanting to go back to it after I'd closed the book.Although Jame and Torisen are given equal stage time in Dark of the Moon, I find Jame much more interesting. I didn't find Jame that involving at first, in God Stalk. In Dark of the Moon, however, she made some conscious and difficult decisions that made me root for her and hope she succeeds against the odds that face her.Buy these books and enjoy the work of a true fantasy craftsman--someone who puts the half-effort fantasy hacks out there to shame. Both novels give you things to think about after you are done, about faith and about personal responsibility, and offer a vital, dynamic world for you and the characters to discover. It is obvious on every page that Hodgell has put a lot of thought and care into everything she includes in her stories. It is a true joy to see, even in the three years between the publications of God Stalk and Dark of the Moon, how much her writing deepened and became more readable. The third book, Seeker's Mask, and the fourth book, which I hear will be coming soon, are high on my list of things to read next!"},{"Title":"Dark of the Gods","review":"Dark of the Gods combines two books (God Stalk and Dark of the Moon) which are the first in a fun &amp; original series of, so far, three books. Chaos and destruction dog the footsteps of the main character in a dark, whimsical, cheery sort of way. This is a series worth buying two copies of, one for lending to friends."},{"Title":"Dark of the Gods","review":"This is a book that I first read in the early to mid 80's. It made enough of an impression on me that I kept looking for the book until I was able to purchase my own copy in the early 90's. Due to circumstances outside my control, I lost my copies, and have been looking for them ever since, until I was able to get new copies earlier this year. I know of no other author that would inspire me to embark on close to a 20 year quest to own her books. That, in my mind, speaks for itself. The books are well writen, with a plot line that has yet to drag. The characters are old friends that I continuely delight in reading about, over and over again. The ONLY complaint that I have about PC Hodgell, is the length of time that it takes between books. I have found, however, that the wait has been more than worth it, each time that I get a new copy in my hands to read.This is an author that you owe it to yourself to read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Dark of the Gods","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by the books ability to take ideas that have been around since the Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser and turn them them into something interesting and worth reading. There are still a number of raw spots, but overall definitely an original treatment that was fun to read and with enough moral ambiguity to make things interesting."},{"Title":"Dark of the Gods","review":"I read the two books in this volume about ten years ago, and just read them again in preparation for reading the sequels. I have to say, I felt the same about them the second time around.Unlike some reviewers who found both satisfying, or even the second book better than the first, I felt that God Stalk was the stronger of the two. The city of Tai-Tastigon gives the book an anchor, a framework on which to lay out the constantly shifting plot and the frequent addition of new characters. I appreciated Hodgell's spare, flowing writing style and the lack of long-winded conversation, and in the first book I actually loved the fact that we do NOT get to listen in on Jame's inner monologue. She often acts, and clearly there is a thought process guiding her choices, but it remains internal.It is true that Jame turns out to be something of a superwoman, one of the cliches of fantasy that makes me cringe a bit, but the world and the city through which she moves are so unusual and mysterious and even a bit frightening, and Jame's personal issues provide enough of a character flaw for me to find her interesting.That brings me to another thing that I admire about these books - Hodgell's ability to create a world in which weird, bizarre and frightening things happen with regularity, and a cast of characters that accept those things as a given. However, here again the second book disappoints me. There are spooky moments, but often the weirdness is layered on so thick, or the weirdness is glossed over so quickly (again that spare prose) that it fails to really sink in. The rate of plot twists continues, but in the second book it feels more forced to me, more as someone else said, like she's making things up just for the sake of having weird things happen.The second book doesn't have the framework of a city to anchor it, has more characters but not enough exposition. All the conversations are moving the action forward rather than showing us how these people feel about each other. Maybe that's not quite right, but the dialogue felt like it was missing some essential humanness.Events on top of events, weird places and magical items piled on thick, and I was left feeling like there were not necessarily rules that this world had to follow. When anything can happen, it's hard to care about what does happen.Nevertheless, I'm willing to give the third book a try."},{"Title":"Dark of the Gods","review":"This collecton of books, the first being &quot;God Stalk&quot;was written/published in 1982. Having missed this author the first time around, I found the volume compelling,imaginative, and fun. However the last book in the 600 page plus series &quot;Dark of the Moon&quot; was choppy and not as coherent. P.C. Hodgell definately left room to continue the saga, and I liked the story comcept well enough to buy the next volume should it be published."},{"Title":"Dark of the Gods","review":"The first book I read of Hodgell's was &quot;Dark of the Gods&quot; in '85. It was five years later when I finally found the first book &quot;God Stalk&quot; and I loved it more than the sequal. In the quest for her books over the years I've annoyed bookstores, dealers (who sell out as fast as they get them), various publishers and some poor woman in N.Dakota I woke up at 6 am whose unfortunate number was mistakenly given to me as a source for Hodgells books. I never been able to find even a used copy of &quot;Seeker's Mask&quot; on the internet. If you need any proof of how good Hodgell's books are just try to get someone to part with one! So read it! And write Meisha Merlin to make sure they print her other books!"},{"Title":"Dark of the Gods","review":"Dark of the Gods, is a different world - still a fantasy setting with odd twists for instance, a creature that I might compare with a unicorn if a huge ivory plated vicious horse like animal.The story centers for the most part on a girl named Jame, a girl who was cast out by her tribe, and lost about 10 years of her life. She posses strange skills and she assumes that durring that time someone must have taught her. She carries with her things that will show her twin brother Tori as the true Highlord of the clan, if she can ever find him, if he in fact still lives.As the book progresses there is a urgency to it. You find yourself looseing sleep for reading it too long. As I mentioned before it has a powerful darkness to it, yet the characters are not one dimentional, you see almost 5-6 different sides of the main characters, that which they are now, that which they were, that which they hope to be.. etc etc. Good and Evil are no longer black and white, honror and dishonor are wavering shadows in the night."},{"Title":"Dark of the Gods","review":"In previous printings of this work(s), Jame is depicted on the covers with more artistry. But that is my only complaint with this great re-print. I first read God Stalk in 1988 and had no idea Dark of the Moon existed until severel years (and librarians) later. I followed up with Seeker's Mask and Blood and Ivory. These should all be on your shelves!Give this book as a gift - to others and yourself!"},{"Title":"Dark of the Gods","review":"There is a reason that fans of P.C. Hodgell can be seen frantically scanning used bookstore shelves looking for the elusive copies of her books. They're amazing. The stories of Jame, her brother, and the other members of the Kencyr are enthralling and gorgeously written--the world they inhabit is one of the most original and complete in all sf/f and the stories themselves are complicated enough and fascinating enough for any reader. If you want enthralling characters, interesting background myths and some of the most lyrical writing anywhere..these are the books. plus, they DO have a sense of humor! This book, in particular, is wonderful because it brings together the first two in the (currently) trilogy and a few short stories that also take place in the same universe. A must for anyone--pick these books up and you won't regret it! They're wonderful!"},{"Title":"Dark of the Gods","review":"I first read \\"Godstalk\\" when I was about 12 or 13. I thought to myself, \\"This fantasy stuff is awesome. I've got to read more!\\" I was terribly discouraged when my next several selections from the library proved to be tame in comparison. I was fortunate to encounter some good stuff before I gave up on the genre, though. :)The world Hodgell has created is full of incidental detail that is essential in creating a living landscape...quite literally at times. There are enough events and relationships hinted at throughout the books to keep one happily speculating for years. This is a good thing, since the time between volumes has been so long!Jame is an interesting protagonist - a mess of good intentions, destructive tendencies, honor, stubborness and with a mysterious past that threatens to consume her. Besides, who can resist a heroine with claws?"},{"Title":"Dark of the Gods","review":"The Jameth books are obviously written by someone who's learning as she goes along - the first chapter in particular is so egregious in its 'Hey, I'm showing off!' purple prose that I almost put the book down and never came back. But I'm glad I persevered, because once the author gets that out of her system and starts settling down to storytelling it becomes quite interesting.There are some fairly interesting concepts here and it isn't just another Tolkien knockoff; the closest thing I can think of is the foggy ambiguity of Lieber's Lankhmar books or Moorcock's Elric books. There is a lot of Elric's flawed semi-perfection in the main character, who starts out as a bit of a Mary Sue but becomes more and more corruptly tattered as the series progresses.Recently I've found myself withdrawing further and further from fantasy and science fiction, numbed by the sameness and awful writing. It usually takes a new Iain Banks or Gene Wolfe to get me going (and Wolfe is sadly past his peak) - but I found myself devouring this in spite of the occasional fumbling. I know this all sounds like damning with faint praise, but I'm telling you something clicks here. I finished Dark of the Gods and Seeker's Mask (am ordering To Ride a Rathorn Now) while I've discarded over a dozen other books in disgust. If you're willing to give the author some room to maneuver, she will reward you."},{"Title":"Dark of the Gods","review":"And I'm a picky reader.What really makes these novels (there's two in this book, plus some short stories) great is the main character, Jame - she's a true antihero, complex, flawed, powerful, always trying to do the honorable thing, yet often bringing destruction to everything she touches.The world created in these stories is vivid, complex, and varied. The city of Tai-Tastigon in the first book is almost a character in itself. In the second book, Jame wanders across much of the world, always stumbling across something new and bizarre.Godstalk, the first of the books, is the better one."},{"Title":"Dark of the Gods","review":"This first book in this compilation has something of an underground cult level of fame, due to its limited availability for so long. Recent re-issues and its inclusion in this volume have finally rectified this situation. But does the work itself really live up to its word-of-mouth brilliance? Although different and well written, it is not in the same category as other fantasy classics like Lord of the Rings or The Last Unicorn.The main character, Jame, as a young woman who cannot remember much of her recent past, but finds she has strange abilities and a mission to deliver a sword, ring, and book to Torisien, is very well drawn. Her entry into the city of Tai-Tastigon is not only very darkly flavored but brings a strong touch of horror to the reader, at least partially due to the reader not knowing precisely what is going on at that point. But as the story progresses, the vital uniqueness of the beginning slowly subsides into near-standard revelations of Jame's past and ancestral heritage; the multiple gods of the city, when seen close-up, lose some of their awe-inspiring flavor; and the basic plot devolves into rather simple lines. The battle between the inn that has become Jame's adoptive home and its across the street competitor, another battle for control of the Thieves Guild, and Jame's search for the meaning behind all the gods, her past, and the relics she holds in trust for Torisien form these lines, unfortunately all rather predictable, but they are well woven together. The resolution of all of them makes for a very satisfying conclusion to this book - far better than the conclusions of most opening volumes of long fantasies, making this book stand very well on its own.Stylistically nicely written, without too many made-up words that seem to plague most fantasies, but with enough strangeness to let you know that this is not your everyday world, and a smoothness to the tale-telling that will carry you along without a bobble of something sharply out of place. Characterization of characters other than Jame seemed a little thin, but neither are they just cardboard cut-outs.Overall, a nice start to a fantasy series, but much of its promise fades before the end, though having a real conclusion to this opening book is a definite plus in this world of seemingly never-ending fantasy works.&quot;Bones&quot;, the included short story, is something of a sidelight to the main story started above, but adds some depth of insight into Jame's character.In the second book here, Dark of the Moon, we get to meet Jame's brother Torisien, who shows up as quite different from what Jame expected. More than anything else, this second book is one of political intrigue, something Jame is not good at, being essentially naive at such machinations. But being thrown into this game forces Jame to grow, to more carefully consider the consequences of her actions.More of the underlying forces, beings, and history of this world are slowly revealed here, most especially the 'Builders' and those who belong to the Perimal Darkling. These revelations and their intertwining with the action of this story are the best items here, leading logically to decisions and actions by Jame that make at least a convoluted sense. There is more depth to the secondary characters, and more urgency to the plot. But I did feel that even more than in the first novel, this book trends more and more towards standard fantasy lines, with little that is genuinely new.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"Dark of the Gods","review":"Although there are some inventive elements in Hodgell's world, I was disappointed with the plot and characters.First, the protaganist Jame is so perfect that there is hardly any tension. This character is not only a(n admittedly disenfranchised) noblewoman of the first order, but also: a highly skilled warrior, a master thief, some kind of cleric/avatar (\\"Chosen One\\"!) with supernatural powers and, last but not least, a superlative dancer. And yet more things besides. There are simply very few challenges for her, especially in the first book; I found my interest flagging once I realized she was practically indestructible.This situation is exacerbated by the number of characters who take a shine to Jame for little or no discernible reason. The inn she stays at (complete with overprotective mother figure) gives her free room and board. Why? Her mentor, the city's most highly regarded thief, and also a disagreeable recluse, decides to take her under his wing after a brief encounter. Why? The \\"prince\\" of the Cloudies gives her his own shorts for some silly escapade, for god's sake! And then there is the burly, well-nigh juggernaut Kencyrath Marc, who quickly assumes the role of protector and big-brother/guardian, and would probably roll over and die for her if she asked. Honestly, given her talents, I think Jame hardly needs him; he is mostly a sounding board for dialogue that reveals Kencyrath culture and history.Second, I had the distinct impression on many occasions that the author was simply \\"making things up\\" as she went along. The most aggregious example occurs when, after having been told on dozens of occasions how honor-bound the Kencyrath people are, we are told that an important Kencyrath character was able to honorably abandon the service of his mad feudal liege-lord, not by asking the lord's permission, but rather by getting the permission _of every other person in his house_! I really couldn't believe the absurdity of this proposition, especially since another character felt honor-bound to follow his own lord into eternal damnation.Third, you could almost skip the first book altogether---there is hardly any point to it. A few themes are introduced (but never resolved), and two (three, if you count Jame's pet cub) characters besides Jame appear in both books, but all in all the author could easily have compressed this information into 50 pages or so and then commenced immediately with the second book.I was able to recognize this long before I started the second book; the first one seems markedly aimless and meandering. Jame spends a year in the city of Tai-Tastigon. Why? As far as I can tell, it is not pertinent to the plot. Readers who enjoy episodic novels like Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and Gray Mousrer stories may enjoy it, but Hodgell drops many hints about an overarching plot---a plot which is hardly touched on until book 2. I found it frustrating and pointless.On the bright side, the second book is better than the first, and Hodgell's setting has some interesting, if ultimately unconvincing, elements. Tai-tastigon is kind of neat: it has a thieves' guild sanctioned by the city's authorities; it's laid out like a giant maze; and Hodgell makes a big deal about the multitude of \\"gods\\" in TT contrasting with Jame's own monotheistic heritage (also never resolved). I didn't believe it, but it kept me mildly interested.I can't recommend this book. The prose is unremarkable, the plot is directionless, the world is not convincing, and the heroine is a veritable deus ex machina. But, if you are in dire need of a fantasy fix, it may suffice. Despite my misgivings, I was able to finish it after all, and the later chapters are on improvement on the earlier. I would give it 2.5 stars if Amazon allowed it."},{"Title":"Hippocrene Brazilian Portuguese Children's Picture Dictionary: English-Brazilian Portuguese/Brazilian Portuguese-English","review":"My four year old can identify all figures in both english and portuguse!

All of the material is good, but not original. This is a good introduction to the subject."},{"Title":"John C. Calhoun and the Price of Union: A Biography (Southern Biography)","review":"In his opening remarks John Niven makes the promise that he would not undertake psychoanalysis of John C.Calhoun, Much to his credit, he is true to his word. What Niven has delivered is an eminently readable and straightforward account of South Carolina's greatest political figure. We forget all that he did: senator, secretary of war, secretary of state, and vice president, in a distinguished career that began in the early days of Madison's presidency and concluded during the Taylor-Fillmore administration, a span of nearly four decades.Niven's disclaimer, however, is telling. There is a tendency to use Calhoun's career as a sort of national inkblot. For constitutional scholars and ideologues of many stripes Calhoun's writings survive as either the last great stand of states rights or as a subversive manifesto for the tragic secession that would follow. For politicians and observers of human behavior, Calhoun is either the consummate patriot or his own worst enemy.From the data Niven provides, it can be said that while Calhoun may have been eccentric, he was not crazy. Everyone born in primitive eighteenth century America survived with a history, and Calhoun, born in 1782, was no exception. His family and his colony shared a history of terrible suffering at the hands of the British [those were Calhoun's people slaughtered in Mel Gibson's \\"The Patriot.\\"] Calhoun himself was orphaned as a young teen and appears to have spent a studious but lonely existence until he studied law at Yale under the famous Timothy Dwight.Calhoun arrived home with his diploma just in time to ride a wave of strong Carolina resistance against the Virginia-New York axis that seemed to control presidential elections. This handsome, passionate, articulate favorite son soon found himself elected to Congress where he naturally became a leading advocate of war against the hated British. On June 18, 1812, Calhoun and other hawks got their war, but the thoughtful Calhoun quickly ascertained that the United States was woefully unprepared. Calhoun regretted his impetuousness, and nothing would absolve his guilt for this nasty war.Calhoun would do penance for his sins by serving as Secretary of War under Monroe. Niven commends him for an outstanding tenure during which Calhoun reformed the army's purchasing policies, developed stronger defense outposts in the west, and crafted an almost enlightened Indian policy. An ambitious man, Calhoun not unreasonably expected his War Department success to catapult him toward bigger and better things.But here one of the major themes of the book emerges: Calhoun was an unlucky politician. It was his bad fortune to reach his prime concurrently with an unusually large class of outstanding statesmen: Henry Clay, William Crawford, John Quincy Adams, Daniel Webster, Andrew Jackson, and Martin Van Buren, to name a few. While he could console himself with the role of \\"everybody's favorite second\\" in the 1824 election, that convoluted contest left him tainted goods in the eyes of many, and an outsider in the Adams cabinet to boot.Calhoun reluctantly threw his lot with Jackson in 1828, but by this date the South Carolinian was having long thoughts about his home region. Cotton prices were low, and protective tariffs seemed to him to exact a crushingly heavy toll from southern growers like himself. And although he shared some of Clay's enthusiasms for internal improvements, most notably transportation systems for the inner reaches of the Carolinas, Calhoun became increasingly suspicious and hostile of the federal government, dubious about its ability and will to protect slavery and Calhoun's idyllic picture of the agricultural southern life. A highly sensitive man, he internalized what he saw as the political treachery of Clay, Van Buren, and especially Crawford, who raised Calhoun-baiting to an art form, for reasons never precisely spelled out.Calhoun began to write prodigiously on the subject of states rights and federal encroachments. As Niven observes, his writings were alternately brilliant and contradictory. Potboiler states rights speeches and pamphlets were common in America as the young nation sorted itself out. But how far could a politician really go on the matter of a state's autonomy? Until the Jackson era there seemed to have been a gentleman's agreement that the Virginia and Kentucky resolutions represented the boundary of political good taste. Calhoun crossed that line in his defense of nullification, increasingly preoccupied by perceived threats to his beloved South Carolina, In doing so Calhoun lost his national political base and a sense of the national pulse. No longer viable as even a regional candidate for the presidency, he assisted President Tyler by his skillful negotiating with Great Britain on the Oregon border question. But he objected to the Mexican War, not on humanitarian grounds but because he feared the socioeconomic consequences of the acquisition of Mexican territory, i.e., new free soil states. He was correct in his assessment that the consequences of the Mexican War would bring political turmoil to the United States. He had few horses to trade on the floor of congress as the Wilmot Proviso was debated, but his style till the end was magnificent.From Niven's account it is fair to say that Calhoun was never a universally recognized spokesman for the South during his own lifetime. The Richmond Junto despised him. Unionists were still a majority in the South at the time of his death in 1850. Moderate southern businessmen even in his home state found his philosophy antiquated and at times deleterious to their state's economy. Many found him unbearably pedantic. Only later, as the nation polarized, would his political philosophy become a revered creed for those who dared to think the unthinkable.Niven's work is a fine presentation for the casual reader and a more than adequate primer for those eager to delve into the mind and works of the consummate antebellum apostle of states' rights."},{"Title":"John C. Calhoun and the Price of Union: A Biography (Southern Biography)","review":"John Niven, professor emeritus of American History at the Claremont Graduate School, has shed new light on a statesman that history has long viewed as just another inconsistent headstrong Southerner, John C. Calhoun. Niven convinces the reader that this prominent politician of the antebellum south was much more consistent and levelheaded in both his public and private lives than his typical portrayal as a protean, stubborn hot-head from South Carolina would suggest. A lifelong advocate of the South, John C. Calhoun served as a member of Congress at the time of the War of 1812, secretary of war under James Monroe, vice president with John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson, secretary of state under John Tyler, and then as a senator from South Carolina until he died in 1850. The key to Niven's success in bringing to life to this &quot;cast iron man&quot; is drawing on Calhoun's personal life and experiences in order to gain persuasive insight into the motives and stances of his political career. (back cover) Instead of telling the classic tale of Calhoun's shift from nationalism, during the War of 1812 and the tariff of 1816, to sectionalism and states' rights in later years, on the issues of the protective tariff and slavery, Niven convincingly exerts the original contention that Calhoun had always stood behind individual liberty and states rights. In Calhoun's view, as supported by his own papers, his apparent nationalistic support of the war and the tariff of 1816 was actually an effort to &quot;provide for the common defense and to utilize the resources of all to strengthen the states as individual entities.&quot; (p. 127) When national policies began to benefit northern states at the expense of his home, the South, is when his states' rights sentiment began to manifest itself as sectionalism. The weakness of Niven's otherwise masterful biography is that &quot;as a northerner, born and bred in New York and Connecticut,&quot; Niven is never able to completely shake his own predisposition against slavery and present Calhoun's feelings on the issue as being valid views with their own arsenal of support. (p. xv) Although he obviously attempts to be completely objective, Niven's own views show through in his portrayal of the slavery problem as Calhoun's resistance against the antislavery movement as opposed to the antislavery movement threatening Calhoun's southern way of life and ingrained teachings. John Niven's somewhat unconventional view of the career and motives of one of the leading spokesmen for the Old South, John C. Calhoun, is convincingly and understandably expressed in this original biography. He succeeds in depicting Calhoun as a very consistent man with a humanity and complexity entirely devoted to the preservation of the South."},{"Title":"John C. Calhoun and the Price of Union: A Biography (Southern Biography)","review":"Prof. Niven's book fails on a number of counts, but mainly on that of familiarity with the sources of Calhoun's political thought. For example, in describing Calhoun's indebtedness to the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of 1798, Niven says that neither document contemplated action by an individual state. To correct this impression, one need only consult Jefferson's draft of the Kentucky Resolutions; how anyone who had even read this five-page document could see it as anything other than a threat to interfere with enforcement of the Alien and Sedition Acts within the boundaries of Kentucky is beyond me. The book is full of similiar evidence of Niven's failure to acquaint himself with even the most basic sources. Try Bartlett's Calhoun biography, instead."},{"Title":"John C. Calhoun and the Price of Union: A Biography (Southern Biography)","review":"John Calhoun was one of the most accomplished politicians of his time. For forty years he served the United States as Senator, Secretary of War, Secretary of State and twice as Vice President. He entered Congress an ardent nationalist, one of the War Hawks that led the United States into the War of 1812. As Secretary of War in the Monroe Administration, he was a strong supporter of public works, primarily those designed to promote the safety, security and defense of the United States. He would, however, over time, turn away from a nation first attitude as his perceptions of the politics of his time led him to the conclusion that his cherished way of life, the agrarianism of the Southern States in general and his native State of South Carolina in particular, was threatened by the growing populations and prosperity in the Northern and Western sections of the country.The Era of Good Feelings, that period of substantive economic growth that occurred in the United States after the War of 1812, was not equally shared throughout the country. Unlike the North and the West, the South, whose capital turnover was slow even in the best of times, experienced recession as global commodity prices for cotton and cereal grains stagnated and declined. Unlike the North and West whose sectors were economically diverse, the South's capital was tied up in two interdependent asset classes, land and slaves. Thus, when Congress naturally sought to protect the faster growing, emergent portions of the US economy through protective tariffs, the South reacted negatively, even harshly.On a parallel course was a fundamental difference in the labor practices of the sections. The North and West employed wage or free labor; the South employed slave labor. John Calhoun realized these two labor systems were on a collision course. Neither he nor any of the then Southern leadership could understand how a slower growing, agrarian society, one that stretched back over 200 years, could survive without owning the labor assets necessary to cultivate the land.Between them, these parallels of stronger growth North and West combined with Southerners perception that their entire way of life was under assault, led to increasingly isolationist, combative Southern policies that would lead to America's Civil War. John Calhoun more than anyone else would come to define and lay the ground work for the South's defense of slavery. He would define slavery as an inalienable right beneficial to Blacks, a natural state that had always existed between labor and management, a morally superior position that was condoned by God and the Constitution. Over time, this Southern radicalism which dominated South Carolina and led to the Nullification Crisis of 1832, would spread throughout the South to the point where the very words liberty and slavery became so intertwined, that in the South liberty literally meant the right of white men to own black men.From the Nullification Crisis to the gag rule in Congress, the Texas annexation battle and the extension of slavery into the newly acquired territory from Mexico, John Calhoun's life was spent defending a way of life the rest of the world had passed by. The pretzel logic that defended slavery had become so chauvinistic, so narrowly self centered and impassioned, that it blocked the nation's growth. William Marcy, then Governor of New York, looking to accommodate and appease, summed it up best when he said to Calhoun, \\"I can fight your battles so long as you make the Constitution your fortress. But when you go to the Bible or make it a question of ethics, you must not expect me or any respectable member of the Free states to be with you.\\" Calhoun's positions were so polarizing, so extreme and so confrontational, they would lose him his chance to become President of the United States, a position he ardently desired.This book by John Niven is a book about politics, the political theory of the times and the decidedly strong drift of the States toward separation. It is not a page turner but it is a thoughtful reflection on its times. If you are looking for a detailed work that lays out America's road to disunion and are interested in the antebellum logic that mapped that passionate path, no better place to start than the life of John Calhoun, for he, more than any other person, defined Southern Nationalism."},{"Title":"John C. Calhoun and the Price of Union: A Biography (Southern Biography)","review":"Calhoun was one of the more intriguing and complicated figures in American history. It is fascinating to watch him transform from ardent nationalist to vehement sectionalist during the course of this well written biography.Having grown up within a few blocks of Calhoun's Fort Hill estate in Clemson, SC, I had still sadly never read the story of his life and this book straightened out many misconceptions I had developed over the years, giving clearer perspective to both his good and bad points.I liked the fact that the book was written by a \\"Yankee\\" rather than someone with a Southern heritage and possible bias. John Niven is extremely even-handed in his approach and in the end paints a vivid picture of a man whose potential greatness was undermined by his growing paranoia and his unwillingness to see the flaws in his arguements defending Southern institutions that have long since proven totally indefensible.Also highly recommended is William Freehling's \\"Prelude to the Civil War\\" which offers another fine perspective on this important era and this work is frequently cited by Niven in the Calhoun biography."},{"Title":"John C. Calhoun and the Price of Union: A Biography (Southern Biography)","review":"John Niven presents a straightforward and well researched book on the life of John C. Calhoun who was one of the most influential people in the antebellum period. Calhoun represented the last of the Jeffersonian states rights politicians who clung to the virtues of small government in a chaning time. While that is often lost in his views on slavery it is important to remember as Niven points out that his arguments were not rooted in race but in keeping government small and protecting the farmer. He was against many internal improvements, against the tariff, against the national bank, against many of the things that expanded government power vis a vis the state. He was considered a member of the great triumvirate who with Henry Clay and Daniel Webster debated the great issues of the day and worked out the compromises that prevented Civil War from happening sooner. (See Merrill Peterson's book the Great Triumvirate). I think Nevin has it correct that despite this image of three great men representing sections of the country it was far from true particularly for Calhoun who was never the dominant statesman of the South (although he was the dominant representative for South Carolina).Calhoun would serve as a vice president, secretary of state, senate, house, and secretary of war during his tenure in politics. While always trying he was never able to achieve the presidency due his fractious support. He was easily a national name but his scattered support across many states was never the majority in those states. In many cases he was defeated by the patronage machines that were coming into existence and would be the norm following the Civil War. He had as many enemies as he did allies and his hatred of the Jackson/Van Buren group isolated him within that party. Many other books on the subject have asserted Calhoun to be a radical and I think Niven has it right that in the context of his time he was not a radical but was expressing the dying viewpoint as new political parties were forming in the early years of the Civil War leaving Calhoun on the outside. He was always remembered for the modernization of the War department and many of the things he created from inspector general to a modern supply system and health system would be utilized by both sides in the civil war and are still in use today in much the same form.Overall this is well written, straight to the point and while it can be dry it is well worth the read. Although I did not spend much time on it I should mention that Niven spends a lot of time on Calhouns family, financial and personal problems and how he separates them from his time in office."},{"Title":"Rough & Regular: A History of Philadelphia's 119th Regiment of Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, the Gray Reserves","review":"Mr. Maier has written an average regimental history. His research is pretty solid, although I thought that some more research on the 119th's involvement in the Shenandoah campaign would be nice.

Mr. Maier's writing style is not the greatest...it just doesn't flow all that well and the text is marred by some typos.

It also renewed my resolve to take responsibility for my every dream, doubt, achievement, and failure. And it made me appreciate Richard Bach that much more for writing the two books that have most influenced my outlook on life.Every choice you make in every moment of your life, whether it's your whim to smile at a stranger in an elevator, your last-minute decision to eat a healthy meal instead of an artery-clogging one, or your whim to read one book and not another affects more than your next few seconds or minutes or hours.

Some of it bored me and some of it even annoyed me, but that happens when we listen to our best friends speak with candor. Maybe it was something I already knew; maybe it was something I'm not ready to know yet; or maybe it was just plain wrong. Bach shares his soul generously and we're free to take it or leave it.

As in two of his other books, Illusions: The Tale of a Reluctant Messiah and Jonathan Livingston Seagull, Richard Bach uses flight maturely and appropriately as a chance to learn without the constraints of earth, or reality. As the plane he and his wife are flying in disappears from radar and reality, they have the chance to see the infinite possibilities of their lives: past, present, and future. They learn eventually that they are a part of each other, and that everyone is ONE. The readers are the writer, heroes are murderers, and you and I are interchangeable pronouns. It is a complexly simple and beautiful idea. However, unlike two of the author's other stories of individuals who are socially shunned, rebel teacher-types, this one stresses the submission of the individual to the whole; definitely not written for the fiercely independent individuals who may be expecting encouragement rather than calmness from the book. The reason for only a four-star rating is not indebted to any socially radical leanings, but is for a contradiction from this usually mentally agile author. Toward the end of the story, our humble narrator stumbles a bit by mentioning a higher power. Was getting past this dependence not the point, or has the grand and gaping logic of philosophy circled and returned, recycled, to a dependence on something other than ouselves? Do I hear the Pageites rattling somewhere in one of their name-induced wars? The eloquence and energy of the story, though, fade any inconsistency to a mere blur on the horizon.

The book rambles on quite a bit and has an extremely different tone than something like Illusions. Still made you think a few times, but I definitely didn't feel at all enlightened when reading it.

Bach will occasionally phrase questionable ideas as absolute fact, which doesn't sit well with me, and, although I have a reasonable tolerance for &quot;hokey&quot; stuffs, Bach pegged the meter more than a few times in _One_.While it is, without a doubt, thought-provoking and insightful, and shouldn't be dismissed out-of-hand, I feel that _Bridge_ is a thoroughly better novel.

I thought 'Johnathan' was a good read but that the philosophy was not very heavy duty. Here, Richard Bach goes further along a very similar path. However, this is a more serious attempt to sell the author's philosophy. I doubt if there is much harm in reading this effort. However, it does get boring and may take some effort. And, I doubt if you will want to read it again. But, it isn't a waste of time, either.I think this book is another piece of \\"New Age\\" spirituality. However this book and the entire \\"New Age\\" phenomenon is not heavy duty philosophy or spirituality or religion. If you want heavy duty, read the Bible and the Koran and several Budhist spiritual scriptures. And, that is just a start.Having said that much, I also admit that thinking about some of the concepts in this book can be useful and helpful to spiritual growth. But, do not get your expectations very high. Richard Bach's writing is slightly more spiritual than \\"The Little Engine That Could\\" or Casey Stengal's quote; \\"It was deja vu, all over again.\\" In this book, it is 'one's life' all over, again and again and again. Nevertheless, I found this book to be worthwhile."},{"Title":"One","review":"Bach in the story One takes us on a spiritual journey to explore our power as creators in our own right, and how the illusion of many, separate, and apart seduces us into renouncing our reality, and our ONEness.In the words of Shakespeare we are all actors on a stage and the earlier we stop mistaking the play for reality the earlier we can start recognizing the message each play brings to us and start acquiring wisdom.If you ever wondered the \\"why\\" this world or \\"why\\" am i here this book is for you!"},{"Title":"One","review":"I've given away many of the book ONE by Richard Bach; to graduates who need a little inspiration to take the first giant leap of faith into the working world.

Whatever one may think of Richard Bach's philosophy, that volume at least had warmth and character. This volume feels too much like taking a tired old car out for another spin. It does have its moments, for instance the section about religion and the fate of \\"The Pages\\". Perhaps it is me, and I have simply grown out of Richard Bach.

That is quite a feat. ONE time is more than enough. This book is so boring for a fictional read. It reminded me of the movie, &quot;Solaris&quot;, which is about going back in time only it added another twist: if you could change the past, would you? Anyway, that movie is just as boring, but I must say it is better than this book because the actress is hot. I thought the author's concept of &quot;One&quot; is quite confusing. For instance, the chapter when Leslie encourages her younger self to pursue playing the piano, a path she had not taken, this will affect her life and what she is now. In any case, I don't think one decision can totally change a whole person's life as some readers suggest. If this was the case, we would all be in deep trouble. There are always exceptions, such as deciding to buy that lottery ticket and winning, but usually it takes many decisions to shape one's life. I don't buy this decision-making plot or the plot that everything is &quot;One&quot;. But two stars for the nice self-help pieces littered throughout the book and for the nice cover."},{"Title":"One","review":"what a blowhard! i guess his diehards loved this..my advice is to read fortune cookies instead..profound? wow man, look at that sunset!makes you think about, like you know, things! ouch my head hurts.."},{"Title":"One","review":"I read this book at seventeen--that was three years ago. Back then I had just finished reading *Bridge Across Forever* and I had become a huge Richard Bach fan. He was the first philosopher, if that's what you can call him, that I had ever read. His were the first *how-to-live-and-love-better* books I had ever encountered so I learnt a lot from him. But if I were to read them now, I may be disappointed.In *One* Richard Bach and his wife, Leslie, are thrown into a surreal world of destiny where they experience different parts of themselves in different times and parallel universes. This book is filled with precious ideas on how you can live better and offers you an insight into seeing the world around you in a completely new way. It's a beautiful book and I learned a lot from it. It was the perfect book for a time when I was still trying to find some happiness in the world.Richard Bach *is* a philosopher of sorts and he will offer you different ways to approach life. Sometimes you may love it and sometimes you may be annoyed by it. It depends on the person really and their respective beliefs. If you read this book with an open mind and heart, you will enjoy it, because Richard bach *is* a brilliant writer who is so painfully human, it's hard not to feel for him.

Since then I have read A Bridge Across Forever and One. While they were all great books, One was my favorite because it explored the possibility of parallel universes and parallel lives. I have often wondered whether one silly decision that I have chosen has made a drastic difference in the outcome of my life, and I think the answer is yes. I feel that Richard Bach wrote on paper the thoughts we all have about the potential of our lifes and what could have been. On one side of the coin, it is sad to think of all the opportunities that we have missed, but yet it is kind of amazing there are infinite possibilities; we only get to live one life made of zillions of choices, while infinitly many of us are living on parallel universes, making all the decisions that we didn't get to make.

The first, held by the majority of conservative christians, is that we should criticize the text of the Bible as we would any other book to determine its text to the best of our abilities. This view insists that since we can find the most important truths of christianity in whichever Bible we use, we can be assured that we have the message God wants us to have. The second view, which is the view of Dr. Holland, myself, and many others, is that the body of Christ must have a Bible which speaks with authority. The scripture promises the preservation of its words, not just its general message and fundamental truths, so that the very words God wants us to have must be somewhere. The author believes these words for the English speaking people are to be found in the King James Version of the Bible. The King James Bible has come under heavy fire in the 20th century, being disparaged by many modern scholars. Its translators have been put down, its text has been put down, and some have gone so far as to suggest that the reason christian conservatives are considered &quot;backward&quot; is because some still use it and believe it!The author of this book, in a sweet spirit, free of rhetoric, biting remarks, or insults of other versions of the Bible or people who use them (you wont find any version called a &quot;perversion,&quot; etc.), presents the rich history behind the King James Version and the traditional Greek and Hebrew texts it was translated from, along with the other traditional early versions which preceeded it. Unlike other books on both sides of this debate, Crowned With Glory does not &quot;preach to the choir.&quot; The Foreword was even written by a man who disagrees with his views! In fact, one of the best descriptions of this book is found in the foreword: &quot;Other recent and popular attempts at presenting a foundation for discussion have occasionally betrayed their own ignorance, but Dr. Holland pulls every scrap of evidence-for and against his view-out of the closet of the certainty of the modern paradigm and reopens an honest discussion of the issues themselves.&quot;This is a wonderful book that I believe should be read by all, regardless of which view they hold. It is scholarly, geting into deep subject, yet manages to keep things at a level where anyone can understand, and I definitely give it five stars."},{"Title":"Crowned With Glory : The Bible from Ancient Text to Authorized Version","review":"Dr. Thomas Holland has written an excellent work that both gives an overview of how we got our Bible and conveys a well-informed picture of how the KJV came to be, and why its translators made some of the choices they made.Amply documented, this book contrasts more than favorably with other books on the subject, such as one I forbear to name by an Arizona professor which conveys much of the same ground (re: how we got the Bible) but is smoothly but carelessly written, contains an anti-KJV apologetic with a nasty edge, and is blatantly unfair at many points. Holland on the other hand makes his points with due respect for alternate perspectives, but with tenacity. His is the kind of book that all will find informative, and many will find persuasive. I heartily recommend it to anyone interested in this topic."},{"Title":"Crowned With Glory : The Bible from Ancient Text to Authorized Version","review":"I have read several books on the subject of textural criticism including the King James Defended, Unholy Hands on the Bible and several others.

I first became aware of Holland when an old female saint at a camp meetin' refered me to his website. She said something like this by way of a warning: &quot;Don't get too much ungodly hubris from the way he made James White squirm. Just praise God for him.&quot; This, as it turned out, was excellent advice! (By the way, not only did White squirm, he ACTUALLY ASKED Dr. Holland to remove his criticisms from print!!-- Check around the net for their dialogues!)Critics of the KJV movement delight in demeaning their detractors.

The history of the AV and exposes of the Alexandrian manuscripts are presented in a kind spirit without flaming or caustic comments toward the corrupt manuscripts, their translators, and, their supporters. What's great about the &quot;Tampering With The Texts&quot; section is the accounts of the translators of the corrupt manuscripts and their Gnostic ideologies. This section comes in handy when studying basic Gnostic doctrines in contrast to what the Bible has to say about them. Especially helpful are the numerous charts and glossary to help the novice who is not familiar with the manuscript evidence issue.

His manner is very clear, yet straight forward, and he has no problem taking both sides of the issue and showing the historical roots and path of Gods word as God preserved it among the generations forever. Dr. Holland cleary shows a knowledge of the Greek and Hebrew texts and can explain his views without the name calling, and personal attackes that are so prevelant in this debate. No matter what side of the issue you are on, I would encourage you to get this book and read it with an open heart and an open mind, to do s will show that Dr Holland does not present his opinion as being fact, but present the facts and his failtful obedience to those facts, which came straight from God as He inspired his word and then preserved it forever, just as he promised in His wword. For those looking for a verse that says &quot;The KJV is God's preserved word&quot; you will of course be disappointed, but for those who have a hunger, thirst and desire for the truth, this book, will not let you down."},{"Title":"Crowned With Glory : The Bible from Ancient Text to Authorized Version","review":"One of the difficulties faced by ordinary people who enjoy reading the Bible is the conflicting claims about the many versions available today. Part of the problem is the tone in which the debate is often conducted. There is a great deal of rancor on both sides. One of the pleasures of this particular volume is the equanimity, the calmness, and the spirit of goodwill, that the author evidences in the presentation of his point of view.Holland has written a defense of the Traditional Text, which includes the Textus Receptus. The TR is the basis for the King James Version, and so this book is also a defense of the King James Bible. But it also a defense of the German Luther Bible and the Spanish Reina-Valera Version, since all of them used the TR as the basis for their various translations. One of the fine points about this book is its scope; bringing in the German and Spanish perspectives, though done only briefly, broadens the scope of the debate.Another difficulty ordinary people have is that often the evidence for or against a particular passage is ambiguous; that is to say if one applies the canons of textual criticism one can come up with more than one answer as to the authenticity of the passage. Holland regularly uses approaches beyond that of comparing textual data to present his view. Again, this broadens the field of the debate. For example, Holland brings in patristic sources which are sometimes ignored and gives them more weight than many textual critics. In addition, Holland sometimes includes simple literary analysis; meaning what version makes sense from a literary perspective, from the perspective of readability. Adding this dimension to the debate is helpful in a number of instances.In my opinion, the book does have its weaknesses. Some of Holland's defenses use a theology of biblical preservation. I'll admit to not being clear about what this theology implies. Though I have read one book devoted to the theology of preservation, I'm still not clear as to its implications. I found it difficult to integrate this approach into his other arguments. Perhaps others more familiar with the terms of this kind of theology won't find it an obstacle, but I would have appreciated at least a brief statement of what a theology of preservation means and perhaps some references.The work is scholarly and sometimes that makes it difficult for the ordinary reader. For example, Holland does not translate a short passage in German, nor an equally short passage in Spanish; I suspect that he assumes most readers will be scholars and not need a translation. I know German so I was able to read that passage, but I don't know Spanish. I had to consult with a Spanish speaking friend.Having said that, the book is an invaluable source of arguments and data in support of the Traditional Text. It is particularly strong on the Long Ending of Mark. His case for its authenticity is overwhelming. There is a good bibliography, a well done index, and important appendices in the back making this an excellent reference work for many years to come."},{"Title":"Crowned With Glory : The Bible from Ancient Text to Authorized Version","review":"This book is the best I have read in my recent studies on this subject. The book is simply outlined and the subjects are flowing and easily understood. It is written without the condeming tone that other works on this subject have. This work brought the subject together for me that I could understand it fully. I recomend this book to the hungry student."},{"Title":"Crowned With Glory : The Bible from Ancient Text to Authorized Version","review":"I was introduced to this book by Dr. Holland via his Bible Q and A club ... I think Dr. Holland does a great job of presenting his beliefs and opinions concerning the preservation of the Bible. The one thing I truly enjoyed was Dr. Holland's style of writing. He writes like a next door neighbor or like a friend would write a friend. He doesn't come in and try to force his ideas and opinions down your throat, he presents them and then lets the reader decide.Another thing that impressed me about Dr. Holland was how he treated Bibles other than the KJV. He didn't call them names (i.e. perversions, trash, etc.) or tear down those of us who have been shown by the Holy Spirit that Modern Bibles are indeed God's Word. Dr. Holland doesn't play the games you see in Yahoo clubs. He stays a man of integrity and for that I am grateful.I reccomend this book as a companion to other books including one by Philip Comfort on Bible versions. Read all the books, but remember to take God's Word first--there is no convincing argument in the Bible establishing the KJV above any other English Version. It's not there and should not be taught as it was.I gave this 3 stars...good arguments, but not 100% convincing."},{"Title":"Crowned With Glory : The Bible from Ancient Text to Authorized Version","review":"i am very suspiciousand deeper i am in Godmore i realise why peoplelove to buy 'hort&ho;'instead of KJB...we are of this worldand King James is of Godit took 300 years forhort&conspirateurs;to break into the curseof Revelation of Jesus Christto join Satan for cookingeverybody after isas responsible as themDr Thomas Hollandseems a cool customerwhile tough cookiesare shooting to killhe goes sweet about iti could never be somy passion tells mefor making me awareof fine wonderfuldevoted book!and 'hort et al'can go in peaceinto the hell by the roadthey paved so well!kick the buggers...!AuthorisedKing James Bibleis the bestis the only onethanks to Mr Brandon Staggsand Crowned with Gloryto be in Christ Jesus andJesus Christ to be in mei have to be no fearaccepting my Creatorthe faith is no gimmickis a real thing completeone-ness with no returnand my little mind saysour Lord is not taking overour Lord is enriching usgiving us new dimensiongiving us freedomfrom the chains of rulesof the slaves to this worldwhen my identity issomething else whenThy Will be Donewhen living is dyingand as with our Saviourno more willing or wantingall is the same in our Lord"},{"Title":"Crowned With Glory : The Bible from Ancient Text to Authorized Version","review":"I just started reading this book, and I ran into problem.In Genesis 1:27 GOD says:(Gen 1:27 KJV) So God [Elohim-plural-Hebrew] created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them.In the book the author says:Protestant believers would reject the doctrine of the dual sexual nature of God...Dr. Thomas Holland (2000-12-01).

Can you find, where Scripture says: \\"God Elohim is male\\"?I am KJV kind of girl, because GOD said to me so, but this particular argument is lousy at best.I would improve this review as I go later."},{"Title":"Crowned With Glory : The Bible from Ancient Text to Authorized Version","review":"Crowned with Glory is yet another book in the string of King James Only / Textus Receptus priority books. Dr. Holland is more temperate than many in his critique of modern versions stopping far short of the type of rhetoric that one often finds books of this ilk. He states that his purpose is not to &quot;defame, discredit anyone's translation.&quot; Further while he claims to agree with the translators of the King James that &quot;even the meanest translation of the Bible contains the word of God,&quot; he stops short of including their full quotation, &quot;nay, is the word of God.&quot; On the whole it differs from many other books of this genre in that he has utilized standard reference materials for documentation.His argument is built upon the premise that God has protected His Word in the Traditional Text of Scripture. Having accepted the preservation in the Traditional Text, he then proceeds to use flawed logic to substantiate his case.I feel that he commits a major error in a comment on the Lucianic Recension. After citing Fredrick Kenyon's doubt about the historicity of the Lucianic Recension, he adds, &quot;God told us not to add to his word. If the Traditional Text has added to God' s word, why has it been so greatly used in the history of the church.&quot; This is nothing short of full-blown pragmatism. If pragmatic considerations are all that are to be considered, truth becomes relative to what happens to work now.In answering the King James' inclusion of the Apocrypha, he uses a red herring argument to answer this inclusion by citing the Geneva Bible's title page of the Apocrypha. He then states that &quot;likewise the translators of the KJV did not give the Apocrypha the respect they had given the Holy Scriptures.&quot; While he notes some differences in the way the King James handled the Apocrypha, he failed to note that there are similarities. The Geneva Bible, which also includes the Apocrypha between the Testaments, has no marginal notes throughout the Apocrypha, while the 1611 printing of the King James Version continues its marginal notes throughout the Apocrypha. The point is not that the King James' translators thought that the Apocrypha was inspired or canonical, but if you are arguing for preservation (as Holland is) your argument must address first the inclusion and then the exclusion of the Apocrypha.While Dr. Holland is to be commended for not shying away from some difficult passages, his defense of some passages is strained and opens the door to serious problems. At times he seems to engage in a form of circular reasoning arguing that a passage should be retained in the text because it was contained in the Textus Receptus, which was based on the Traditional Text. He argues for retaining the Johannine Comma, 1 Jn 5:7,8, in spite of extremely weak textual evidence because the Critical Text retains some verses in 1 John with weak evidence. What he fails to note is that the weak evidence is precisely why many Majority Text and Textus Receptus advocates argue against the Critical Text.He saves what I see as perhaps the wildest stretch of rationale for the last six verses of Revelation. Holland concludes, &quot;Preservation simply demands that God has kept and preserved the words throughout the generations from the time of their inception until this present day and even beyond. It does not demand that these words be preserved in the original languages only.&quot; What this does is open the door to an extreme form of eclecticism. All one need do is trace a reading back through a series of languages and claim that it is the preserved Word of God! There is little, if any, check on the textual critic since his prior statements have opened the door to readings which are supported by an extremely small number of manuscripts.A further critique is that he is not really talking about preservation, but restoration. Even the oldest of our manuscripts do not date back into the first century. Sinaiaticus and Vaticanus (probably our oldest &quot;complete&quot; manuscripts) at their oldest date only to the early fourth century! Where was the text preserved during the first three centuries of the church? Since we do not have extant manuscripts how is it possible to know what the &quot;preserved word of God&quot; was during that time? The obvious answer is that we cannot know and it is presumption on Dr. Holland's part to believe he can.He also deals with the criticism that some have raised against the language of the King James Version. Holland points out that many of them involve expressions that can be taken in more than one way in English and directs his readers to an English dictionary and/or English grammar. While I would agree with the majority of what he states in this chapter, I find it fascinating that he never admits that King James English might be antiquated. This is surprising in light of the fact that even Donald Waite, an ardent defender of the Traditional Text and King James Version has recently published a King James Bible with the antiquated words defined in footnotes.While Dr. Holland is be commended for maintaining a gracious courteous spirit throughout this book, there is none of the usual name-calling and bitter rancor that mark this genre of literature. However, a Christian spirit is not a substitute for accuracy. And unfortunately this work leaves much to be desired in explaining how to determine the text of Scripture. The major logical fallacy that underlies the entire work is that since the Traditional Text has been used by the church, it is the true text. This is an assumption which he makes yet never sees the need to prove and therein in the words of William Shakespeare &quot;lies the rub.&quot;"},{"Title":"Crowned With Glory : The Bible from Ancient Text to Authorized Version","review":"This book, though easy to read, is very much biased by the author's belief that modern Bibles are somehow perversions. His stance that the KJ is THE only Bible is clearly against God's Word. (See the fact that he produces not one scripture that says so)."},{"Title":"Crowned With Glory : The Bible from Ancient Text to Authorized Version","review":"The whole idea of &quot;one versions only&quot; is a seriously flawed one. It does not matter if you believe in King James only or any other version only it is not scriptual. It is a myth that Paul warned Timothy about in 1 Timothy. He said there would be some teachers (like Holland) who would be teaching myths (like version onlyism). These promote controversies (see the web for proof of this). Paul said of these men, &quot;They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not know what they are talking about or what they so confidently affirm.&quot; 1 Timothy 1:7Holland exudes confidence in his way of thinking. But his decisions have been made by his preferences (aided by other so called scholars). Passages of scripture have been manipulated to say what he wants it to say (Psalm 12) and the context of passages is thrown out the window in favor of his opinion.King James Onlyism is a dangerous myth and an unbiblical doctrine brought on by the carnal man. Holland only helps this myth grow.To see what God wants us to read, read the Bible in the version you are most comfortable with."},{"Title":"Shining Your Armour: The Lost Art of Romance","review":"This book stinks. This author actually believes that the way to a woman's heart is to buy her trinkets, baubles, buttons and play pretties. Does he actually believe that women are so shallow? Having read his book, it's obvious who's shallow. The purpose of the book is not to help men woo their women, but to give men more creative ways to &quot;earn&quot; a night out with the fellas. As a woman, reading this book, I have never been so insulted. Did he ask any women to help him write his book? He would have benefited, and so would his audience, if he had simply asked women what a man can do to &quot;be more romantic.&quot; I can assure him that rather than shower her with presents and flowers, he could treat her with as much respect as he would his buddies. Rather than meeting her on a horse at her work, embarrassing her in front of her friends, he could just treat her as an equal. Rather than just assuming that women are so frivolous that baubles and bows are all it takes to satisfy, he could simply value their worth to the point of really ASKING women what they want from men. Gabriel Vaughn is one of many men who actually think they know women more than women do.
