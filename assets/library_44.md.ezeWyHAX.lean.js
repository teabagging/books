The book was filled with suspense and dramaall the way through. I thought this was a great story of two guys who loved and cared for each other, and I thought this book showed how people can be different, but can still be friends. This book had two man characters, Lennie and George. They were both different, but shared similarities. I thought the description of the Lennie was great, and as the story went on, the closer I became to him. I thought the author did a great job when he talked about George. George was a kind, hardworking, and a smart man that could be nice to Lennie when he needed him, and he was sometimes hard on him when his patience ran out. Although Lennie caused some trouble every once in awhile, George fussed and him but he knew Lennie didn't mean any harm, so he worked hard to get them out of trouble. As the story went on, I loved to read about their friendship. It showed how much a great friend George was and how strong a man he was.

However, if you are like me and enjoy well writen books, but must have a happy ending then you will want to avoid this book. Steinbeck has a wonderful writing style with excellant descriptions of nature. Of Mice and Men also very accurately depicts what life was like during The Depression. Unfortunately as it takes place during The Depression it is very depressing. Of Mice and Men tells the story of two best friends George and Lenny. George is the leader of the two, while Lenny who is mentally retarded is the willful and very sweet follower. Both are 30 years old, but neither acts his age. While George acts older and more mature, Lenny has the IQ of a four year old. This problem is the theme of the entire book.

Of Mice and Men is a story about two migrant workers, friends, who are moving from farm to farm in search of work. The adventures and dedication of these two men as they search of a better life, is the main focus of this book. Of Mice and Men is filled with ups and downs, twists and turns that will keep one wondering how it is going to end. This book is like no other. I think everyone should be required to read this book.

The book has also a very good and interesting relationship between the main characters, George and Lennie.I think that their relationship is the main plot of the story,but the shocking part is George's last action.

Full of surprises, sadness that you will never experience with bounch of papers, the cruelity of love, and the unpredictable final. And questions, millions of questions coming out each seconds from your head, that would not stop even after you've finished the book: Why? What for? Was it the right decision?

The themes it treated were loneliness, violence, dreams and authority. Each of this themes were very well developed by the author. The characters had a very important part in the book, even the ones which were not principal treated the themes in a very deep way. For example Curley's wife who developed the theme, dreams, showed the importance of them. How she was so full of hopes and wishes and in the end although she didn't achieve them she had still the HOPE she would. The principal characters were George and Lennie. George is an inteligent and small character who travels along with Lennie. Lennie is huge and mentaly retarded. In the book he represents the theme dreams and violence. Both George and Lennie have a big dreams, to have a house, a couple of acres, a cow, a pig and for Lennie, to pet some rabbits. Then Candy, another character, became part of there dream.This book is dealing with the life of itinerary workers, there loneliness and life. It shows life in a real but awful way.

As a story it could have been much more elaborated but, to my dissapointment it was not. Reading the first chapter I was mysled to believe that I was going to find a good and interesting book due to the excellent descriptions. Instead, i found that he used the same style of description during the entire book making it repetitive and boring. Secondly, the only scenes of the book that were, in my opinion, worthwhile ended up being violent &quot;He slashed at Lennie with his left&quot;, &quot;Blood run down Lennies face&quot;. Finally, the entire ending of the book was my mayor disappointment as, it ends in a way that leaves a great deal of issues unconcluded, such as George's future. I think that the ending is very poor and leaves much to be desired. In conclusion, I believe the story did not live up to standard and I would not recommend it as it gives us a fake idea of what the book will be but, tears it apart as you go deeper into the story."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; is one of Steinbeck's best. It captures you and won't allow you to set it down until all is done. I found it completely enjoying considering it didn't take hours to read. George and his simple-minded friend Lennie cling to each other to support their loneliness. George and Lennie found themselves running from the other ranch because of Lennie. The word of a ranch in Salinas Valley was looking for work, the two find it an answer to their prayers. They travel to this ranch in hopes of a job, and a new life. They two have a dream to have a place of their own, one that they can call home. When something goes terribly wrong the workers find themselves looking for jobs elsewhere, and several men's dreams are shattered. This book captures Steinbeck's great theme, and portrays the single idea of the common bonds of humanity, and love. This is what makes goodness and happiness possible. I believe this is the book that I have most enjoyed reading. It has allowed me to express my joys and my sorrows. The story touches me, for I have experienced sadness, and loss, and you too will also feel the same when you are touched by the book &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"By reading this book I now recognise what a brilliant writer John Steinbeck is. He has the great ability to include so much detail that you can see what is happening perfectly, but he keeps enough action going in the process. This style of writing gave him these 2 stars.The topic of this book, however, is very unappealing to me. I felt sorry for poor, retarted Lennie instantaneously. His emmense physical strength seemed very unrealistic, though. This is POSITIVELY NOT a book for a dedicated animal lover: for every animal that Lennie touches dies in this book. It is very graphically done.I don't want to give away the ending or anything, but it was VERY strange. I can't find even one word to describe how strange it was, and how it made me feel. I can only conclude that death is so frequent in this book and talked about so casually that it almost felt unrealistic.I really do not reccomend this book. It is just strange, and the only thing holding it together is Steinbeck's beautiful ability to write. I still don't understand why there is so much appeal to this book: the only reason I can come up with is that this topic is not normally written about. I think it will definitely be worth a try at another one of his books, however."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Look, I know people love this book. \\"It brilliantly captures the working man's life during the great depression....vivid pictures of the surroundings...one of the best things you will ever read...\\" and so forth.I didn't hate this book. It does tell a good story, and the overall feeling fo the novel is one I enjoy. I like some of the characters, Crooks is a particular favorite.I just don't find Steinbeck to be a very good writer. Obviously he can weave a good tale, and he sets the mood well, but his descriptions are bland and unnecessary. He does exactly what one is not supposed to do when writing: he tells, he does not shoe. I don't need to know that the tar bucket hanging from the wall has a wrinkled old rag dangling out of it. The amount of flies buzzing through the air has no bearing on anything, and serves only to fill the otherwise descriptionless pages.Each chapter follows the same style. There is that needless and boring description, followed by an introduction to a character. Usually these characters are doing something iconic or performing an act that defines them. Whether it be solitaire, reading or petting mice until they die, there is an overly symbolic paragraph about each character.Then comes the dialogue. There is much of it, and it pretty much fills all those 108(?) pages. The novel is written more like a play, with each character taking turns to speak and then listening patiently and apparantly thoughtlessly. You never get to see inside these characters heads. They simply speak and sit around. There are only faint allusions to the actual work that they do.But hey, this book is a classic, and all the intelligent people love it. Maybe it is cool to praise it beyond its merits, because look, it says Steinbeck on the cover. I want to fit in. I want to be considered educated. Let me try to slurp Steinbeck a little:This book creates a breathtaking backdrop of loneliness and hopefulness. The painstakingly detailed bunkhouse serves as metaphor for the isolation that these poor working men faced. As the characters fight to survive in a world of hardship and hard labor, they learn that friends are more important then money, and that dreams make life worth living. One of the top 3 books I have ever read.That was difficult. Now I am simply a mindless drone, a sheep following the crowd. At least I fit in with the intelligent people. Maybe I should go reread THE SUN ALSO RISES. Another timeless classic, right"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"In 1943 with the tides of war turning and the Germans starting to go on the defense the Nazi's turn to more unconventional forms of warfare. German scientists experiment with gene splicing animal DNA with that of a man to create a new super soldier with the ferocity of a rodent and the ability to reproduce at an astounding rate. From the Nobel prize winning author John Steinbeck comes \\"OF MICE AND MEN!\\". US informants get word of these experiments and plans are made to stop the production of these genes-spliced super soldiers. Two highly trained American GI's, George Milton, and Lennie Small volunteer in the mission to infiltrate the top secret Nazi facility. George is an intelligent man but is down on his luck and desperate for work so he immediately volunteers for the assignment. On his side is his long-time friend Lenny Small who he knew for his entire life. Lenny isn't the most intelligent of fellows but makes up for it with his large size and experience in hand-to-hand combat, being able to take out German guards with his bare hands.Far behind enemy lines the two are tasked with destroying the main experimental facilities and assassinating the lead officials and scientists involved. Of Mice and Men is a timeless classic about killing scores of Nazi's and gene-spliced mutants. John Steinbeck really is a great author and perfectly captures the imagery of 1940's wartorn Europe. I am greatly looking forward to reading Steinbeck's other classic novel \\"The Grapes Of Wrath\\" where a government chemical weapon's project is unleashed on a rural farming area which leads to residents of a nearby vineyard going on a rage-infused killing spree."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The book was in the exact condition as stated and got to me within two days of ordering.

He uses wonderful detail about everything he mentions. The story in itself is excellent, also. Within only a few pages, a deep and intriguing story between two companions develops and shows the reader the power of friendship.

George's patience with his companion is a prominent theme that grasps the reader by the heart. Steinbeck's technique of scattering reoccurring themes throughout his novel help to draw the story into a circle. &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; is very straightforward, easy to read and it's short length kept my attention.

I thought that the book Of Mice and Men was a thrilling, two thumbs up work of art. I couldn't put it down. I learned alot from the companionship of Lennie and George, and realized how important my friends and family are to me. Lennie was the cutest thing, he made me laugh through the whole book, I just wanted to squeeze him and give him a huge hug. And the poor thing never got to tend to his rabbits. I did think that the ending was sad and I hated that Lennie had to die, but the way that the author demonstrated George's purpose for doing what he did showed how much he really did love Lennie. He wouldn't let anyone else hurt him. This book is a book that should be read by everyone. I think it can teach all people something about life and how fortunate some people are more than others. This is a spectacular book, and Steinbeck has shown a great strength through his work. It was very easy to understand and follow along. THe sentence structure and detail made everything happen. I felt as if I was actually there in some parts of the book. I almost want to think that Steinbeck had some experience in what he wrote, because he seems to know alot about what he writes.

This novel was very touching, as you become attached to the childish Lennie, and the patient George. George, who takes care of Lennie, must always keep an eye on his companion for he is not certain what kind of trouble Lennie may get himself into next. The two of them travel from ranch to ranch looking for laboring jobs on the farms, in hopes that one day they will have a place of their own. That is all part of their plan. George and Lennie imagine having a ranch of their own with land and rabbitts that Lennie can tend to. While at their latest job, Lennie is tested with many temptations that may lead him away from what George has taught him. Opposite in every way, George and Lennie are companions who thrive on each other and work for each other's dream. No matter what they get into, they do it together and always have a picture of their own ranch in mind. This was an excellent novel with a surprising ending. This book appeals to numerous audiences and is an American classic. I enjoyed every minute of it and found myself reading faster and faster each time to get to the next part."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"My name is Scarlett Slaughter and I am a student at Saint Mary's School. After reading Of Mice and Men, I was overwhelmed at it's greatness. Steinbeck knew what he wanted his point to be, and didn't let the reader wonder or have to guess. I think that this tale of true love for a friend and the willingness to do anything to save them should be read by everyone. I recommend this novel to anyone ages 12 to 100. It made me feel good to know that there are true friends out there, and gives me hope that we will all be so lucky as to find one. Although it was required reading, it has been the only novel I've read in school that I didn't mind reading. I'm glad our teacher made us read it!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"After reading John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men, assigned by my eleventh grade English teacher, I got that feeling that I had just read a really 'good book.' When I entered into George and Lennie's world I was not only moved, but actually grew a bit attached to Lennie's childlike ways. Every chapter grabed my attention and I could not put the book down. Of Mice and Men targets readers of all ages. It is a fairly short novel, and full of adventures, keeping the attention of even the youngest audiences.

This is a bit cruel to Lennie, but the world is like this. The setting of the ending is the same as the beginning.

As a reader I found myself placing my body and mind into the characters positions. You easily fall in love with the relationship between the two of them.

This book is a tale of Two migrant field workers in California on their plantation during the Great Depression--George Milton, an intelligent but uneducated man, and Lennie Small, a man of large stature and great strength but limited mental abilities--are on their way to another part of California in Soledad. They hope to one day attain their shared dream of settling down on their own piece of land. Lennie's part of the dream is merely to tend to (and touch) soft rabbits on the farm. This dream is one of Lennie's favorite stories, which George constantly retells. They are fleeing from their previous employment in Weed, California, where they were run out of town after Lennie's love of stroking soft things resulted in an accusation of attempted rape when he touched a young woman's dress, and would not let go. It soon becomes clear that the two are close friends and George is Lennie's protector.At the ranch, the situation appears to be menacing and dangerous, especially when the pair are confronted by Curley--the boss's small-statured aggressive son with an inferiority complex who dislikes larger men--leaving the gentle giant Lennie potentially vulnerable. Curley's flirtatious and provocative wife, to whom Lennie is instantly attracted, poses a problem as well. In sharp contrast to these two characters, the pair also meets Slim, the kind, intelligent and intuitive jerkline skinner whose dog has recently had a litter of puppies. Slim gives a puppy to Lennie.In spite of the potential problems on the ranch, their dream leaps towards reality when Candy, the aged, one-handed ranch hand, offers to pitch in with George and Lennie so that they can buy a farm at the end of the month in return for permission to live with them on it. The trio are ecstatic, but their joy is overshadowed when Curley attacks Lennie. He then, urged on by George, catches Curley's fist and crushes it, reminding the group there are still obstacles to overcome before their goal is reached.Nevertheless, George feels more relaxed, since the dream seems just within their grasp, to the extent that he even leaves Lennie behind on the ranch while he goes into town with the other ranch hands. Lennie wanders into the stable, and chats with Crooks, the bitter, yet educated stable buck, who is isolated from the other workers because he is black. Candy finds them and they discuss their plans for the farm with Crooks, who cannot resist asking them if he can hoe a garden patch on the farm, despite scorning the possibility of achieving the dream. Curley's wife makes another appearance and flirts with the men, especially Lennie. However, her spiteful side is shown when she belittles them and is especially harsh towards Crooks because of his race, threatening to have him lynched.Lennie accidentally kills his puppy while stroking it. Curley's wife enters the barn and tries to speak to Lennie, admitting that she is lonely and how her dreams of becoming a movie star are crushed, revealing the reason she flirts with the ranch hands. After finding out that Lennie loves stroking soft things, she offers to let him stroke her hair, but panics and begins to scream when she feels his strength. Lennie becomes frightened, and in the scuffle, unintentionally breaks her neck. When the other ranch hands find the body, George unhappily realizes that their dream is at an end. George hurries away to find Lennie, hoping he will be at the meeting place they designated at the start of the novel in case Lennie got into trouble, knowing that there is only one thing he can do to save Lennie from the painful death that Curley's lynch mob intends to deliver.George meets Lennie at the designated place, the same spot they camped in the night before they came to the ranch. The two sit together and George retells the beloved story of the bright future together that they will never share. He then shoots Lennie in the back of the head, so that his death will be painless and happy. Curley, Slim, and Carlson find George seconds after the shooting. Only Slim realizes that George killed Lennie out of love, and gently and consolingly leads him away, while Curley and Carlson look on, unable to comprehend the subdued mood of the two men."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"A beautiful story written by a master, but don't be mistaken that it's all butterflies and rainbows.

George is quite small and very smart, while Lennie on the other hand is big in size, and is dumb. He thinks like a child. They become laborers in California's dusty and dirty vegetable fields. While they are there, they always got themselves into trouble. Usually the trouble had to do with Lennie. Towards the end, Lennie got himself in to much trouble and everyone wanted him gone. I would have to say I loved the ending of the book, because you would never guess that that would have happened."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Menby: John Steinbeckreviewed by: S. AkkarPeriod 1Of Mice and Men is a tragic story about two different people. George, a short but mature man and Lennie, an enormous but immature person, have a goal. They have to find a job. After that, they will settle down in a land of many acres and live happily ever after. Fortunately, George and Lennie find a job. However, George has to hide Lennie's immaturity from the other workers. Later George killed Lennie because he cannot live peacefully with Lennie.Overall, I liked this book. It was very intersting. One main reason I liked this book was because the part describing the life of George and Lennie amazed me. It showed them go through life's thick and thin. George and Lennie's difference in maturity was interesting in the book. It showed how two very different people can live together. An example of this is a quote in this book:&quot;'I like 'em with ketchup,' Lennie said.'Well, we ain't got any!' George said angrily.Another reason I liked this book is because of the way John Steinbeck described George and Lennie's goal. In the book, it said that George and Lennie &quot;will live in a small house on a land of many acres&quot; and that Lennie will get to &quot;tend the rabbits&quot; and &quot;feed it with alfalfa.&quot; Suddenly, when George killed the &quot;useless&quot; Lennie, their dreams were all spoiled. I felt bad about George killing Lennie just because in his opinion, Lennie is useless.From the whole book, my favorite part was when they got the job in the Salinas Ranch because it was a hard thing to find a job for George. That's because Lennie is always around, getting George in trouble. How happy George and Lennie were to finally get the job ! I would recommend this book to teenagers and older people because the genre of this book is more like young adult fiction. Overall, an entertaining book indeed !"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The story is about two guys that are working together as ranch workers. They go around from job to job trying to build up a stake. One of the main characters is George. George is a small, strong man, with a keen eye, and a stolid expression. The other main character is Lennie. Lennie is a tall clumsy man, but at the same time he is strong as an ox. He has a sort of childish behavior and no sense of self-control. Everywhere they went, Lennie seemed to get into trouble with someone. It seemed that Lennie's lack of self-control would force both Lennie and George to quit their jobs early and try to find work elsewhere.I think that if I had to relate myself to one of the characters it would have to George. I think George and I have a lot in common, we both are always trying to solve other people's problems instead of our own. I usually do things that other people want first and what I want to do second. I also think the same way George does. We both have a dream of one day owning land and not having to pay rent on it. I too would one day like to like to not have to work for some one else. To be able to step outside and look as far as I could see and know that it is all mine.I really enjoyed the book. I think that the message of being loyal to your friends is a solid one that will never fade away. I enjoyed just being able to lay back and read about what trouble Lennie was going to get into next. My favorite part was the big fight between Lennie and Curley. I think that that fight had a lot of action and really made the book interesting to read, but at the same time kept it within reason so I wasn't disgusted by it. I really don't think there is any part that I didn't like in the book. I don't think that I would change any part of it if I had the chance to. The book was written so well that changing any part of it would alter the whole story.I would recommend this book to students in high school. It has some bad language and a little bit of adult content, but I think that students at that age can fully understand the story and really appreciate its message. I think that anybody with a small sense of humor and a good sense of adventure would really enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"like i said earlier, wow. i really enjoyed reading this book. unlike some peple, i am not the crying type, yet this book actually moved me to tears. i think it was the reality of the story and the fact that the characters are so real. they have their dreams, their hopes, and their faults. steinbeck doesn't view this world through rose colored glasses. no, instead he tells it like it is and that is what is so great about this book. a must read."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I'm the girl who cries over anything sappy.

This is the geographic region where this prized author spent all of his time (generally outdoors) writing and observing, and was a very studious &quot;freak of nature&quot;, so to speak. A surprisingly interesting read, &quot;Of Mice And Men&quot; focuses on two subjects named George and Lennie. George dreams of getting steady work on an animal farm, while his aimless, slow-witted friend (Lennie) has an ongoing desire to pet (and mangle) mice and other assorted creatures. These two take up residence with various other persons along their evasive journey as well. But, there's one pressing problem: Could George tame Lennie long enough to help make this dream a reality? You, just like our two &quot;heroes&quot;, will have to journey through the vast rivers and valleys of Salinas to find out! If you're just an average reader, like myself, you'll want to read &quot;Of Mice And Men&quot; at least twice, just to understand the subtle nuances and charm of the overall story. With so much to offer, this Steinbeck tale of yore is definitely a keeper!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men is a great book with an ending that you would never expect. The two main characters, George and Lennie, are traveling to find work on a ranch in California after a misunderstanding in their hometown. George is a small built man who looks after his best friend Lennie, a large man with a mental handicap. Lennie looks up to George and will do whatever he says and does.When they arrived to the farm George advised Lennie not to talk, fearing they would get rejected because of Lennies' handicap. After receiving the job, they met all the workers and the bosses' son, Curley, a jealous, immature man who has recently married a flirtatious woman. Lennie, being an easy target for confrontation, is the one Curley kept going after whenever he had a problem with his wife.Steinberg did a wonderful job of keeping the readers interest. While reading the book, you think you know how it will end, but when the ending comes, it is a major surprise.

Not to be missed."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book is a good one. When I first read it it was about a six on my scale of 1-10. But now I have started to realize that it is more of an eight. maybee nine. This book goes so much deeper than one can imagine, and when you think about it it really is a shock. A shock of how much the american dream has changed, and how friendship can be destroyed. This book does make you think of society and the hopes of reaching goals, it challenges and disturbes you as you read it (actually as you think of it). But overall this book is powerful and it plays on your emotions quite weel, so it is definately a good choice of reading."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"A classic, terrific story, I would recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This popular high school or college required reading written by Steinbeck was one book I have never read. Neither have I watched the movie (1940) or newer versions (1981, 1992). What intrigues me is Amer Library Association has listed the novel as top sixth 100 banned books during 1990-1999. How can popular novels written by a famous author who earned a Presidential Metal of Freedom in 1964 received banned and challenged review years after initial publication? Perhaps it was a typo until I confirmed:\\"Of Mice and Men\\" was banned:Syracuse, Indiana, 1974;Oil City, Pennsylvania, 1977;Grand Blanc, Michigan, 1979;Continental, Ohio, 1980Skyline High School, Scottsboro, Alabama, 1983.The book was challenged:Greenville, South Carolina, 1977;Vernon-Verona-Sherill, NY, School District, 1980;St. David, Arizona, 1981;Telly City, Indiana, 1982;Knoxville, Tennessee, School Board, 1984Steinbeck wrote the novel at his house in Los Gatos, Ca back in 1937. It was an era of depression; migrant workers and poverty persisted in the US. Steinbeck had dropped out of Stanford earlier to work on the Sprechels Sugar Ranch in this area as a farm hand. He observed the workers behavior and wrote about them. They represented low education and economically poorly people who would do anything to survive. He accurately described the way things were with no flowerily words.The plot of the novel was quite straight forward.George Mitton (witty, small) and Lennie Small (big man with small brain) both dreamed of acquiring a little land of their own someday. They also were in need of each other's company. This was in the middle of the depression years among many poor migrant workers searched for work. As low social class they got no respect in the society. Steinbeck showed his sympathy and concern for the down trodden the way we are concerned with homeless and jobless today.Paired with both accusations and past accidents these two went to work at a Ranch. It was there the readers were introduced to some interesting characters, all seemed to evolve around rancher's son Curley. Curley is the bully, always ready to pick on those weaker people, but was an unsequired person and a disaster. He failed to be a respected boss #2, husband, and a man. His wife (name never mentioned) knew what was missing in life. She tried to get Lannie's attention in taking her. It led to her accidental death. The end of the novel was worth contemplation and debate. Lennie Small hid in the brush and awaited his frightful punishment. George Mitton had to make a decision; he took matters into his own hands by ending Small's life. The tragic ending could have been averted. Some writers sometimes believe the ending of a novel to provide vicarious happy endings especially targeted for youth. Steinbeck ended it as a tragedy.Could in the novel George Mitton run away in the novel from the crime scene with the woman? Would George have waited for justice to be meted out by a bunch of gun carrying migrant workers who were ready to shoot Lennie? To some readers true literary tragedy is distasteful. This may be one of the reasons that the novel was challenged by many parents if not banned?I thought Steinbeck experimented with novel structured like a play. To satirize its silliness, to attack its injustices, to stigmatize its faults. He achieved this goal remarkably well in this novel. In fact, the book was in the form of a play (1937) and ended as an opera (1970).In retrospect, throughout the novel there were words or vernaculars of improper conduct, vulgar language, presentation of low social class characters which can be objectionable to YA or their parents. I list some examples found from the six chapters including but not limited to:1.Live off the fatta the lan', 2. Bustin' a gut, 3. Cat house, 4. Health issues like pants rabbits, 5. Shove out of here, 6. What the hell's he got on his shoulder, 7. Crack and flop, 8. Goo-goos.The urge to control other's lives and restrict what they can read appears to be just below the surface. People may deny that they want to censor books and mouth platitudes about appropriate reading material, but the end results are challenges to books in schools and libraries.I would hesitate recommending this book at junior high or grade school. As for YA a novel teaches more than the mechanics of reading, the vernaculars used actually helps to stimulate critical thinking skills. As teenagers they are old enough to discuss and debate the meanings of the vulgar language as it applies today. For college age patrons, they are old enough to vote and fight for America they should be allowed to read as they please.This is a good book to read and to comtemplate."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Migrant workers George Milton and Lennie Small are the best of friends, though they are complete opposites. Lennie, the big man, provides companionship for George, while George, physically small, takes care of Lennie because Lennie is mentally weak. Sometimes, though, George can get really frustrated and angry at Lennie when he does something wrong, probably without meaning to. But Lennie is so loyal to George that George can't be mad at him for a long time.In the story, they find jobs at a farm, where they meet personalities such as Slim, the intelligent, repected leader, Candy, the old, disabled handyman, Crooks, the black, isolated stableworker, Carlson, an insensitive ranch hand, Curley, a mean little guy who is the owner's son, and Curley's wife, a &quot;tart&quot;. Things at the farm seem to be going alright for awhile, until their spirits are uplifted for a moment and then brought crashing down in an inevitable chain of events. Many of the events in this book appear to be completely random, and Steinbeck even thought about titling it &quot;Something That Happened&quot; just to show that this world is unpredictable.The nature of dreams is a powerful theme in the novel. George and Lennie have always had a dream of one day owning their own farm, where they can be secure from the outside world and will not have to worry about Lennie's costly mistakes. The dream gives their lives meaning, a reason to keep going on. George never really believes they can do it, but Lennie embraces it with childlike enthusiasm and keeps it alive. Of course, Lennie wants the farm so that he can take care of the rabbits. But when Candy and Crooks offer their stakes to join in, George begins to see that this could be for real and starts to make tentative plans to start the next month. However, Lennie's human imperfection makes the dream ultimately impossible.Loneliness is also a big theme throughout the story. The migrant workers we meet travel alone, and their lives are just a set routine. George and Lennie are not very lonely, since they have each other, but pairs like them are not normal or common. Candy, Crooks and Curley's wife are all very lonely, and they try to fight their isolation whatever way they can. Curley's wife flirts with the ranchers against her husbands's demands. Near the ranch is a town called Soledad, which means &quot;solitude&quot; or &quot;alone&quot;.All in all, this is a nice, short, thought-provoking read and my favorite Steinbeck book. Steinbeck does a great job in capturing the character's emotions, thoughts, and feelings. One memorable scene is when Curley picks a fight with Lennie and starts punching him hard. Lennie is scared stiff and takes the abuse until George yells at him to fight back. Lennie then crushes all the bones in Curley's hand. This is a very dark story of brutal inhumane experiences, sadness and obstacles. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I've read quite a few high profile books lately, but it has been years since I have read anything that has affected me at an emotional level as much as Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men. I don't like to go into deeper meaning in my reviews, but I do think that this book is a timeless parable about yearning for a better life and destroying our dreams for fear of losing them. The book centers on a few days in the life of longtime companions George and Lenny as they look for and find work in order to raise some money. Their goal is to finally have a place of their own where no one can throw them out. The narrative is written in Steinbeck's crystal clear style where the story and the caracters are the substance more than the way he uses his words. Thus, like all his books, Of Mice and Men is a book anyone can pick up and read without feeling in over their head. Steinbeck does not overcomplicate his work. He is interested in everyone understanding what he has to say and he does so more clearly than any other major modernist writer of his time. His characters are found, in part, in anyone. George and Lenny are well-drawn complex, sympathetic and as complete as they can be for a novel that is only 120 pages (in large type).I rarely say this, but Of Mice and Men is a novel I would recommend to anyone who is interested in a good story. As is typical of Steinbeck, there is something for everyone."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of mice and men is one book I have read and enjoyed.

The author is a genius in the way he brings about the story of two very different men. The story of George and Lennie. George is a small but tough man who has an intense friendship with Lennie, a big but slow man.The context of this book is excellent although at the beginning of the book some people may say that it seems very boring, or that it has too many facts as in facts that are not needed. But that's only some people's opinion I believe that the beginning of the book is actually very important. It contains a lot of information that if not known you will not be able understand how George and Lennie end up together, and what was that caused them to end up looking for another job.Another brilliant thing that the author does is that he uses literary devices. The most important literary device that he uses is foreshadowing. In the book there is a incident in which one of the characters from the book named Candy has a dog that has been with him almost all his life and naturally like all animals age this dog became old and ill. The dog became so ill that two of the other characters believed that the best thing to do with the dog was to put him out of his misery by killing him. Candy could not believe what was said but after thinking about it he finally agreed that this would be the best thing .After all was said and done and one of the characters shot the dog in the back of the head Candy still believed that this was a good idea but he also believed that it would of been better if he would have done it himself, because after it was his dog. This incident foreshadows a major part of the book.This book is as good as a cold glass of water on a hot day."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book was a good book because of the lessons it teaches. Of mice and men teaches a valuable lesson about friendships. Although Lennie is struck by a illness that makes him dumbfounded, George still takes care of Lennie. George is a awesome friend that cares deeply about Lennie even though he might show his emotions with him. It comes the time for George to make a important decision when Lennie messes up again. This is a great book that should be read by everyone. You will surely enjoy it and learn a very important lesson. This book will leave you \\"heart struck\\"."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The best-laid schemes o'mice and men often go awry, and leave us nought but grief and pain, for promised joy!\\" John Steinbeck Author Of Mice and Men used this quote as an Allusion to his book where it foreshadows events that have yet to occur.According to the quote what it mean is you set yourself up to let yourself down. In the book Of Mice and Men two characters George and Lennie have a plan to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own. Therefore both characters get a land job where their dreams just scrambles in a matter of weeks. Lennie actions led their dreams to be destroyed it was when they arrived to their new job and at the time one of the workers dog just had given birth to puppies. In which Lennie asked George permission to have one of the puppies and George said yes. Within a few weeks the dog died and was witness by the boss son's wife in which she was killed at the site. Seconds after the incident Lennie headed back to where George told him to go just in case he got into any trouble, which he did, at the end. As a result George headed to the site and killed Lennie before the men got a hold of him. In all both men are in screach of identity and in my point of view each character of this book are lonely in which they have trouble finding themselves. Overall this book shows great friendship amoung these two characters eventhough George gives Lennie a harsh treatment but it is the worst for the better. George shows how much he care for his other half and that he is willing to go all out for Lennie, he gudies him through for his own benefit. Incredible book as the Author uses great literary terms and expresses each and one of them.

He played the role of George in the 1992 movie."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I love the way Steinbeck describes the sights (p 11), \\"The flame of the sunset lifted from the mountaintops and dusk came into the valley, and a half darkness came in among the willows and the sycamores\\" and sounds (p 17), \\"Up the hill from the river a coyote yammered, and a dog answered from the other side of the stream\\" in this perfect story, originally titled Something That Happened, that takes place over a three day period on a ranch in the fields of the Salinas valley near the Gabilan mountains. After listening to the (excellent performance by Gary Sinise) of the audiobook, I read the written version, which didn't take long. The novella is only about 100 pages in length, conveniently separated into five untitled sections (p xvi) \\"so scened and set that it can be played as it stands\\" based on an actual incident in the author's experience. Note on this (Penguin Classics) edition - the introduction, though interesting, includes plot spoilers and thus should be saved for last.Of Mice and Men, set in the mid to late 1930s, is about the relationship between two farm laborers companions, Lennie Small, a hardworking, mentally challenged man, and George Milton, his caregiver of sorts. For a book named after a (Robert Burns) poem entitled To A Mouse, the fact that it begins with the main characters discussing one seems apropos. After arriving near their intended destination, a grain farm, the two spend the evening discussing the past, and contemplating the future; they hope to one day become land owners. Once they arrive at the job site late the next morning, George tries to convince the boss to employ them, after swearing the memory-deficient Lennie to silence. Over the course of the day they meet and learn something about all of the other farm workers and inhabitants. Most of the story takes place on this second (full) day including some foreshadowing of what will come later. The climax of the story takes place on the third day. I wouldn't dare say more as the best way to experience this story is completely unaware of any significant part of the plot. Best of the book: the character development, sights, sounds and climax. Of Mice and Men is a powerful story with intriguing ethical issues. Also good: The Lottery by Shirley Jackson, The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck, and Tobacco Road by Erskine Caldwell."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"A great read from start to finish. I loked the characters and there emotion from the start to the shocking ending. This book has everything in it romance,suspense,drama,humor. The book is written great and it deals greatly with the depression. It shows how real friends act and how they deal with the emotion they went through."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"\\"The best-laid schemes o' mice an 'menGang aft agley,An'lea'e us nought but grief an' pain,For promis'd joy!\\"-Robert Burns, \\"To A Mouse, On Turning Her Up In Her Nest With The Plough\\"Lennie and George, the two main characters in John Steinbeck's post-depression era novel, Of Mice and Men, hold to the \\"promised joy\\" that they will someday be able to live out their days on an idyllic farm. Steinbeck's terse, strong narrative style confronts the reader from the very beginning that the men's dream will not come true.Spanning only the course of a few days, the novel is stunning in its beauty, despair, and tragedy. Steinbeck's foreshadowing of Lennie's death (by the killing of the old dog) is masterful and disturbing.Readers who enjoyed Grapes of Wrath will be surprised at this stripped-down novel, which runs only about 100 pages; it captures much the same sentiment, but on a smaller and more intimate scale.Even after you put the book down, you'll never be able to forget the characters."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This book tells the story of two hobos named George and Lennie who are trying to make a living. They get in trouble a lot and this causes many problems for them. They get a job at a ranch and make some friends,and some enemies. I liked this book and I would recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The novel, \\"Of Mice and Men\\", by John Steinbeck, was one of the best books that I have ever read. It is full of detail about how people lived during the Great Depression. It also explains how the hobos during that time lived. To illustrate this, John Steinbeck introduced Lennie and George. Lennie is a huge, retarded man who has a loss of short-term memory and the mind of a small child. He can only move on by the strength of his one and only dream, to \\"Live off the fata that lan.\\" Lennie wants to own his own ranch and tend to his rabbits. George is a stout, hardheaded man who was instructed by Lennie's Aunt Clara to watch over him when she dies. George and Lennie are on the run from their home because of problems that Lennie had encounter there. They encounter many more problems at the ranch that they end up working on but they stick together until the very end.This novel kept me interested the whole way through. I would recommend it to any high level reader who enjoys reading about things from the past with a lot of western dialogue."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I loved the dialog in this story. The southern accent was modeled beautifully. I'm amazed how Steinbeck created such realistic characters in such a short novel (I think it's considered a novel). The ending nearly made my heart stop.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and men is a wonderfull book which i would reccomend to anyone who loves a book about two best friends with the same dreams."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I would recomend this book to just about anyone. This book was the best book I read in school by far. I really enjoyed this book because the story had alot of detail and action in chapters. It wasnt like most books and drug on forever. This book had several big events happen per chapter which kept me interested in the story the whole time. The story first begins when George and Lennie are on the run from Weed because a woman accused Lennie of raping her. Lennie was accutally just feeling on her pretty red dress. They take a bus to a ranch where they are going to work but the bus driver drops them off way before the ranch. When they finally reach the ranch they meet tons of nice people and some people who arent very nice. They meet the boss's son Curly who does not like Lennie because he is so much bigger than him. Curly and george later on get in a fight and Curly does not win. This book was a very good book and i would recommend it to any high level reader."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The phenominal book Of Mice Of Men by John Steinbeck was one of the most interesting books I have ever read. This book is like comedy but also serious. I really enjoy the book characters George and Lennie. I like George because he looked out for Lennie because Lennie was a little slow and instead of making fun of Lennie like some kids do today he helped Lennie. I just loved Lennie because lennie was actually innocent it was jus that he didn't know what he was doing half the time. I was so happy that Curly got his hand crushed by Lennie because he deserved it. I am upset that Candy didn't kill his dog instead of letting Carlson do it. The end was very sad because Lennie didn't mean to kill Curly's wife but he didn't know his strength like George said and he accidentally killed her. When George killed Lennie i was upset and happy. I was up set because Lennie didn't mean to kill Curly's wife and Carlson and George knew that. I was happy because now he won't have no more trouble and he is peaceful now. So all together i really enjoyed the book Of Mice Of Men by John Steinbeck."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"John Steinback is famous for writing book that took place during the Great Depression. Steinback's book \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is about two men, Lennie and George ,trying to reach their dream of \\"living off of the fat of the land\\", in other words they want to own their own land, be their own boss. While trying to reach this goal they run into many problems. Lennie has a problem of touching soft things such as rabbits, and he ends up doin some bad things at Weed and at the new ranch.In my opinion I didn't like this book alot because John steinback likes to describe the setting and i couldn't really picture it very much. Also, the ending of this book was very tragic and sad. I would recommend this book to any age because its a classic story that many people have loved and still rememeber after they read it."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The book \\"Of Mice and Men\\" I believe was a wonderful novel that told about the two traveling companions George and Lennie. Lennie who is autistic is watched over by George under orders from his late Aunt Clara. Despite its short lenght I still found this book enjoyable. In fact this book was so intertaining its a shame it waasn't longer. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a excellent and quick novel to enjoy."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I read this at the recommendation of my girlfriend. I was surprised I hadn't ever had to read it in school. The one thing that I really liked about this book was the characterization and dialogue. Maybe I'm reading the wrong authors, but it seems like a lot of dialogue in fiction is too uniform between the characters. Meaning they all pretty much speak in the same way...use the same word choices. In other words, it's like all the characters are really just speaking the way the author would. This book is great because Steinbeck includes all the vocal and character nuances in the dialogue. It really helps the character development and helps make the story feel more \\"alive\\". this book is pretty short, but remarkably fleshed-out for such a small book. It gives just enough background info on George and Lennie and other characters that you feel you know them, but it doesn't drag on and over-do it."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Dontae SizerOf MICE AND MEN is about two stangers who lived in Soledad California in the 1930's. George and Lennie didn't have a home. Where ever they worked is where they slept at. George didn't have a family,but he is real street smart. On the other hand, Lennie was diffrent. HE was mentaly retarded, tall, strong and had only one person in his life,his Aunt Clara. Before his Aunt Clara died she asked George to look after Lennie for her, and George and Lennie been together every since then. The problem that George had is he is walking around with a mentally retarded person who forgets almost every thing you tell him, and who only is good for picking heavy things up.Two other people in the book were poorly developed, but to me it was interesting.I Liked it because I undersood the vocabularyI heard somebody with the same problem before, like taking care of a person who gives you hell. In the begining of the novel, George didn't care for Lennie. He was just keeping his promise he made to Lennies Aunt.At the end it was like Lennie was a brother George never had. Thats another reason why I like the book because of the endind.It feel like you been in tht situation before,it's like I was in George place before."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Reading the book Of Men and Mice was a very interesting. The novel catches the reader once they open the book. Personally I have nothing in common with the characters from the story. While reading this story I became very interested in the Great depression and the migrant workers having a hard time trying to live. To anyone who wants to read a fictional story based on the Great Depression they should go and read Of Mice and Men. This novel isn't just about the depression its about two people who are total opposites and stick together to find jobs because they don't have any one else to be with. The book has a lot of events that happen all because one of the two men is very slow, so neither of them could keep a job long enough to save money. Even though you might not interested in reading stories on the Depression you should still read this novel because the events in the story will make you want to read this book. This book shows a lot of feelings that the two men show to each other. They show love and friendship. This story will be very interesting whether your young or old, this book is for everyone."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"let me start out by saying this book was AWESOME!it keeps you on your toes and wondering. Lennie just touched my heart with every thing he said and did. I could feel his emotions. I cried so when he got upset, and I laughed when he was happy. Steinbeck really did a good job with this masterpiece. this is a book that you can read again and again and learn something new everytime. I would recommend this book to anybody who is looking for something to make the tears fall."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Although I favor Grapes of Wrath as my favorite Steinbeck novel, Of Mice and Men is easier to read. It has his typical type of storyline, but a little shorter and it's easier to &quot;get to know&quot; these characters. This book is a good addition to anyone's library."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The story of mice and men is a very interesting one. Once you start to read the book it isn't understandable because of the slang, but, as you read on it gets harder to put down. You think you know what's about to happen but it turns out the opposite.The only problem I think was all the foul language. I wouldn't recommend this book to young readers.The story setting was in the 1930's, around the depression years. The book is about two poor men looking for work,totally opposite characters. One was smart,and small built, while the other was big,strong and mentally handicapped.The Author writes about how the mentally handicapped were treated in those days (1930's)and also how ignorant people were.I don't see much difference in our society. We sure can use some improvement.The writer accomplishes his point he was trying to get across,but, I did not like the slang, I didn't understand some of it. I had to read a few sentences twice before I got a sense of what he was trying to say.Overall I rate this book a 7 out of 10(10=very good). I give it this rate because it is suspensful,has Irony and the ending isn't what you suspect. What lowers the rating is the jargon and cursing."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"In this book, Steinbeck bring us to a true world of how guys search for their home and dream.The story cotains love and a careing man. It tells the love that two men can feel for each other. He wrote a great story about guys in America, which he describe as of mice and men.The two main characters George and Lennie. George had no family and no friends, but he traveled along with a guy called Lennie all the time. Lennie was a dump, stronge man, he follows what George orders.He is just like a big baby, and he made troubles.They went to work in a range, inside the range they meet other workers. George told them his dream is to buy a piece fo land in S'pose and settle down. He promised Lennie that he would stay with him and let him to pet rabbits. The S'pose is the dreamland of every men.It is a quiet and peace place.From the book ,the rabbits told us how childish Lennie was, and why he made a bigger trouble. In between the story there is a coloured man named Crook,the story has shown how he was comletely isolated and brutal.He try to discourage Lennie by telling him George will not come back for him.There is another man Curley who dislikes Lennie, the son of the boss of the range.He was little, so he dislikes Lennie as Lennie is big and stronge.Lennie make another big trouble, he killed Curley's wife. Lennie did not mean to , he did not want George to be mad at him ,so he tried to ask that girl not to yell.As he is too stronge , he killed the woman. Lennie went to the brush, as he was told by George that whenever he made a trouble , he should hide in the brush near the river and wait for him.Lennie do stuggle of weather he should hide and stay with George. At last he went to the brush, George told him he was not mad at him ,and they will go to S'pose. Howerver, George killed Lennie, he was tired to a responsibility of Lennie, so haven is the place for Lennie.I would recommand this book because the writer had a great work in writing Lennie.He clearly let us know how innoncent men were, sometimes they were small as mice. Also, he has good understanding of George. The contradiction George face. The story tell us how every men has a dream. They want a little bit of land, not much, just something that was his own. Also,the peoblems that they may come with in attending their dream. I think Lennie did noting wrong , he was loyality to George.For George i think he has no choice, he has to kill him. I can feel how sad George was when he killed Lennie. The story was touching when Lennie saw George in the brush, and George told him he will take care of him forever.It can show Lennie was right to wait George. I like the story because it tells me the truth side of human Nature! There is racism,innocent, contradiction and love. 524 words"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I HATED The Grapes of Wrath, so I thought that Of Mice and Men would just be another boring, overdescriptive Steinbeck book, but it wasn't! The plot was intruiging and the characters really drew me in and it wasn't over descriptive to the point of annoyance the The Grapes of Wrath. I thought that I hated John Steinbeck's writing style, but I guess it's just the style he used for The Grapes of Wrath because Of Mice and Men is not at all the same. It is 100 times better!!!!"},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"It stuns me that people don't like this book (from what I've read in the reviews)!This is a GREAT book. It tells of two men trying to live a dream, and while the rest of the world is travelling alone and trying to make money, these two are holding on to each other and their friendship. It's a great book - period! This is Steinbeck's only good book from what I've read of his collection."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"The book Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is about two guys named Lennie and George. Lennie and George are the best of friends and have been for years now. George and Lennie are looking for a job and have found one but they have to walk there because the bus driver dropped them off saying that where they want to go is only a couple of miles down the road. It ends up being ten miles that George and Lennie have to walk and so the end up having to spend the night outside because they need to rest. After walking all of this way the two men are starving but all they have to eat is beans because it is the great depression and not many people can afford much else.George and Lennie are the best of friends because they look out for one another. Well it's mostly George looking out for Lennie because Lennie is a little slower than most and doesn't always understand things the first time around. So George and Lennie go from one place to another looking for work because most people don't respond very positively to Lennie because of the way that he is. Lennie just likes to touch soft things and that is what makes him happy and feel warm inside. Since Lennie is so big and he doesn't know his strength and ends up killing the little animals that he loves to pet so dearly. So that is how George and Lennie ended up on the farm, and there is where everything came to an end.George and Lennie got there to work, and while there Lennie fell in love with some puppies that were barely born. Lennie couldn't stand to be away from those puppies when he didn't have to. While spending time with the puppies Curley's wife went into the barn to talk to Lennie and she found out that he liked to touch soft things and had him touch her hair. Lennie liked it's softness so much that he didn't want to let go and got scared and accidentally killed Curley's wife. This was a very bad thing and he knew it so he went to hide in the brush like George told him to do if he ever did a bad thing. When they found the body everyone knew that Lennie was the man responsible so they all went looking for him to kill him. George knew that the only way that Lennie would not be really punished for what he did was if George killed him himself. That is exactly what George did and it was the only thing that could have been done to really save Lennie. The book was very serious and stayed that way throughout the novel.This book talked about very serious subjects and didn't change throughout the book. George and Lennie just want their own farm and the ability to do whatever they please from the beginning and that doesn't change throughout the book. In the beginning of the book George expresses that he is tired of having to always worry about Lennie and that George would be much better off by himself. Throughout the novel George doesn't change and while he does take Lennie with him everywhere he goes he still feels the same, and he knows that even though at the end when he has to kill Lennie it is the best for everyone because if he wouldn't have done it Lennie never would have been able to live a truly happy life with no worries.During the end of the book when George knew that he had to kill Lennie and just let Lennie keep talking about his dreams of the rabbit farm and George killed him was the most moving seen for me because there is nothing worse than killing someone you love not because you want to but because you have to. I think that the author was trying to give everyone who read this book a feel for what it is that people who are like Lennie have to go through. The author I think was trying to make everyone realize that they are people too and they really don't know some of the things that they should and it isn't their fault. I learned that you should always give people chances no matter who they are or what battles they may be facing in their lives at that time. This novel didn't really remind me of anything it just showed me that everyone deserves a chance and the ability to express themselves in any way they chose and no one should judge them for that.I felt that this book was very well written and overall just a great book. It shows you how judgmental and naive some people can be and why you shouldn't be like that. This gives you a perspective of how people like Lennie feel and what obstacles they have to go through because people won't give them the chance to get to know them. I learned that know matter who you are you are no better than the people you think are, they in fact are better than you because they unlike you are willing to give you the chance that everyone deserves."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This novel was part of our lit. study in English class, and the first time I had to read it I quite liked it. I thought it was well-written and vivid, and I was especially impressed by the ending. Going back to it on my own, I really can't say that Steinbeck's \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is anything above \\"good\\". Yes, the imagery is good, and its well written. Yes the book is \\"deep\\" and contains a lot of meaning.But somehow, I wasn't too impressed.For one thing, Steinbeck's descriptions might be good, but it takes more to make a reader feel the writing than making it sound good. A picture can be pretty without compelling you to look at it for a long time. Well, this is how I would describe Of Mice and Men; the writing is sleek and polished,and, well , perfect, but I just felt that it was rather lifeless and lacking heart. The characters were wooden, and both the people and places within the novel never felt quite real enough to me.I also found myself really annoyed with all the themes in the story. Obviously, for any novel to attain the status of greatness, a good theme, or \\"themes\\" must be present. However, Steinbeck doesn't simply present his themes, he shoves them down your throat, over and over and over and over again, until you just want to scream I GET IT ALREADY. When themes are too obvious, it takes away from the sincerity of the writing, and makes you too aware that you're reading a book, and good books should transcend that.All in all, I semi-enjoyed reading this book the first time. It is well-written, and demonstrates Steinbeck's creative flare. However, the story just didn't get to me, and I put down the book feeling nothing for the characters or all that had happened."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is a story of friendship and survival against the odds. Most things that could go wrong do go wrong.This book is set in the 1930's, during the Great Depression, a few miles south of Soledad. Lennie and George are in search of work. They are fired from a previous job because of Lennie. He is much stronger than he thinks he is. To himself he seems harmless, but to other people, he seems to be monster.When you read the book, it's almost like you're there with the characters. The setting and physical traits of the characters are described so vividly that you can see where they are and the people they're with. \\"A few miles south of Soledad, the Salinas River drops in close to the hillside bank and runs deep and green. The water is warm too, for it had slipped twinkling over the yellow sands on the sunlight before reaching the narrow pool.\\" It's almost like a little play in your own head. You can see George and Lennie walking down the path onto the bank of the river, or in the barn with the puppies.The most important characters in the book are Lennie and George by far. Without them there wouldn't be a story. Lennie is the one who gets them in trouble. You feel bad for Lennie at times. He gets confused and forgets things, and George gives him a scornful look, or yells at him. Lennie can't help it, and that's when you start to feel bad for him. Some other characters in the book are Curley, the Boss's son who's offended by tall people, Old Candy, the old sweeper with no hand who just wants to live in peace, Slim, the slim-line jerker who is very understanding and Curley's wife, who is very sleazy and desperate. Lennie and George's dream is to own a house on a farm and have rabbits and animals, but they need enough money to get the house. The theme of this book is this; the tale of two lonely men in search of their own home.This book made me feel very uncomfortable. Many of the topics discussed, for example, killing a lame dog, or killing unwanted puppies, made me feel very depressed. None of the events in this book were positive. They were all about killing of people or animals, or getting into fights. Maybe I am too young for a book with such deep meaning, because I do not understand why people are so infatuated with it. It was very saddening, and I do not think I would enjoy reading it again.Overall, I rate Of Mice and Men a C+. If you like shocking endings, you'll like the ending of Of Mice and Men. Do they get the house? Do they live happily ever after? Does something go horribly wrong that smashes their dreams? I guess you'll have to find that out for yourself."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men published in l937, is the tenth book written by John Steinbeck. Even though the book only covers a three-day span, it portrays the full spectrum of human emotions including physical pain, tenderness, friendship, pity, and jealousy. Steinbeck's sensitivity for the common man is evident in this work and the others produced during the 1930's. It has been claimed by many that this period saw Steinbeck's greatest works. The social injustices of the 1930's are depicted in Of Mice and Men. His political concerns for equality and happiness for society is a major theme in this novel and his concern for the poor and below average is also evident.The protagonists, George Milton and Lennie Smalls, are laborers looking for work on a small farm in Salinas Valley, California. Lennie, the bigger of the two, is mentally slow and this seems to always get him in trouble. George stays with Lennie to take care of him after his Aunt Clara died. They both had big dreams of owning a ranch. This is another one of Steinbeck's major themes, the search for the American Dream. However, for Lennie and George the American Dream, to buy the ranch and &quot;live off the fatta the land,&quot; is not achieved because of their limitations.Slim, Curley, Curley's wife, Candy, and Crooks, the antagonists, work at the farm along with George and Lennie. This is where many conflicts happen, such as the fight between Lennie and Curley. The final conflict between George and Lennie at the river brings to reality the importance of friendship and the desperation of loneliness.This novel is also famous because it depicts Steinbeck's well-known style of writing, which includes such literary devices as symbolism, irony, metaphors, parallelism, alliteration, and repetition. In the opening paragraph by repeating such words as, &quot;with the...&quot; the author easily moves from one repetition to another. Some of his descriptive sentences, like where he describes &quot;The path through the willows,&quot; have a rhythmic quality that adds poetic meaning to this novel. Another device Steinbeck uses is the simile. His phrase &quot;the rabbits sat as quietly as little gray sculptured stones&quot; is a striking example.I really enjoyed reading Of Mice and Men, by John Steinbeck. Its down to earth humor shows compassion in a time where there was none. I really liked his characters and how they are developed in the story. They are believable and bring out the appropriate emotions in the reader. Steinbeck's use of simple plot, natural dialogue, and natural setting, makes this an easy and enjoyable book to read. This timeless classic is a book that I would recommend to anyone, for it is a story that withstands many readings by many generations."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice And Men is based on two men that are laborers in a small town. They leave one town going to another looking for work, hoping to fulfill their dreams of having their own land with farm animals, a place they could call their own. The main characters are George, Lennie, Curley, and Curley's wife. George and Lennie are friends. George looks after Lennie because he is slow-witted. George is always getting Lennie out of trouble. Lennie is always wondering off looking for something to pet. Because he has the mind of a child but the strength of a giant, he often kills his pets before he knows it. Curley is the boss's son. Curley, George, and Lennie are workers at the ranch. Curley is mean and likes to pick on people and is always making trouble. Curley's wife often looks around in the barn as if she's looking for her husband. She really wants attention because she is lonely and never has any one to talk too. George and Lennie made friends with another worker named Candy. In the story both George and Candy loose something very important to them.I can somehow feel what George is going through with Lennie. I have a mentally retarded cousin. I can remember when I was younger we could not always do what we wanted or things had to be done in a certain way. In my situation my cousin could not talk, so when he wanted something, he would pull us to what ever it was he wanted, and if he could not get it, he would hit us out of anger. I would get short of patience sometimes, but I would pray for strength and guidance. In the story, George takes care of Lennie everyday. I didn't have the problem everyday because my cousin stayed with my grandmother. My grandmother dealt with this every day and did fine with it. I never heard my grandmother complain.I did not like the book. The book was negative to me. Two of the characters are killed in the story and no one seems to be able to find their dreams. If I could change something, it would be Lennie's role in the story. I did not like how he was treated and how the story ended.I would recommend that others read the book because it might show readers how life can sometimes be very difficult."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"This novel is about friendships and dreams shared by two men named George and Lennie. They dream about one day owning a farm. George acts as a father figure to Lennie, who is large and simpleminded, calming him and helping him to control his physical stength. After the death of Lennie's Aunt Clara, George took care of Lennie. As the author, John Steinbeck did an excellent job introducing each character. I really connected with all the characters. The theme of friendship, struggle, and following a dream was beautifully written. I thought that the book Of Mice and Men was great because it never got boring. I was not able to put the book down. This novel will leave you with a lot of diffrent emotions; it touched me deeply because it reflected true events in my life about hardship and friendships.

The minute I pick up a Steinbeck book, I know that I will come back to the fold of the underdog and the mistreated. I love him for this, as he recognizes the value of the underpriveledged and the poor. He sees the evil in the world and calls it by name. Lenny and George are in a way comedic, but heart wrenching and sad. They are known by even those that are unaware that they know them. Ever watched a Bugs Bunny cartoon, when that giant oaf pets the little animal to a bloody pulp? Well, Lenny still lives within all of us. Hopefully we all have a George in our lives as well."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is a wonderful book. After I started reading it I couldn't put it down. It contains only 107 pages and is a pleasure to read. This book really puts an insight on Steinbeck's theory of the perfectability of man. All this means is that he believed that nomatter how different people were that they all could make a difference in society. The two main characters are George and Lenny. George is a short, smart, muscular man. Lenny is a large, strong, man with the mind of a small child. This very unlikely pair get into alot of trouble, but all they bolth want is a place of their own with chickens, rabbits, horses, and other farm animals. But all of their dreams are ruined because Lenny likes to touch and pet soft things. But when he gets scared all he wants to do is hold on to the soft things. Whether it be a pretty soft dress, or a young woman's soft hair. This book seems so real. I actually forgot that it was fiction. It takes you through life changing events, mishaps, and dreams of two poor laborers who just want a place of their own. Steinbeck's ability to amaze you is as always astonishing."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; is perhaps the most poignant tragedy I've ever read. In my opinion it stands with Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; and Hemingway's &quot;Sun Also Rises&quot; as one of the best novels ever. While I normally try to avoid empty praise like this, a detailed account doing justice to Steinbeck's genius woud be longer than the book itself!In iceberg fashion, Steinbeck packs more emotion, characterization and eloquence into this novella than most books four times its length. The relationship between Lenny and George--portrayed almost entirely through dilouge, allowing the reader a freer (and richer) interpretation--is not only believable, it is TRUE. This relationship, the core of the novel, is beautifully highlighted and ornamented by the other characters and the reletively simplistic plot.Some critics may point out flaws in the work: lack of developed female characters, predictable outcome, cardboard supporting characters, etc. However, I disagree with many of these criticisms and would contend that even if they were true, they are a part of Steinbeck's pseudo-minimalism and serve to better illustrate that single, true, core relationship.When reading &quot;Of Mice and Men,&quot; don't expect a complex web of character interactions as with a mystery or adventure. Don't expect Steinbeck to create a rich, tangible mood like Conrad. And don't expect Hemingway's bare, photo-realistic portrait of human emotion and experience. Instead, expect a simple novel, with seemingly simple characters and a simple, loving relationship ending in tragedy. All of it 100% true.P.S. This is the only novel which depressed me for an entire weekend. Read it on a Monday."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men was a wonderfully written book and I really enjoyed reading it. One reason I really liked the book is that it taught me a lot about how to be a good friend. George and Lennie were very good companions. When Lennie got discouraged, George helped him by telling him to dream about the farm and tending the rabbits. They were always there for each other. When Lennie got in a fight, George told him to fight back. George and Lennie were very good friends.Another reason why I liked the book is that here were colorful characters. There was a wide variety of different characters. Lennie was big and nice, but Curly was small and mean. All the characters had qualities that set them apart from the others. The characters in this book were fantastic.I also like this book because I like John Steinbeck's writing. All his words are nice and simple. His sentences are short but also very descriptive. For example when he described Lennie, he wrote that his hand was like a big claw. He is a great writer!This book is one of my favorite books. I would most definitely recommend it to other people. I read eagerly wondering what was going to happen to Lennie. Of Mice and Men is the best book I have read in a while.

You cannot go wrong reading anything written by John Steinbeck. Of Mice and Men is a great read."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men, a book written by John Steinbeck, is a book about how agricultural workers suffered during the Great Depression. When Steinbeck wrote this book, ranch workers were slowly beginning to be replaced by machinery. Steinbeck portrays the lives of two migrant workers George Milton and Lenny Small. George is a migrant worker who dreams of having his own ranch someday. Lenny is also a migrant worker who is infatuated with soft materials and petting soft animals. He likes petting soft animals so much that he keeps a dead mouse in his pocket. This behavior is due to his intellectual disability.Throughout the book, George watches over Lenny. He reminds Lenny to let him talk when the boss or the boss's son, Curly, asks questions. He also tells Lenny who he should stay away from. He does this because he wants to protect Lenny. He also wants to protect him because Lenny wants to be a part of the dream of having a ranch with George. George has allowed him to be a part of that; however, since he's allowed him to be a part of that, George doesn't want to risk losing that dream because of something Lenny did. Needless to say, George loses his dream anyway because Lenny killed Curly's wife due to his strength that he was unaware of. George does what he feels is best and shoots Lenny in the back of the neck. He knows that if Curly finds him, he'll kill him inhumanely or torture him. George now is forced to stay at the ranch since he won't have enough money.Lenny is accepted in this society to a point. His strength comes to an advantage for him when it comes to working. People don't seem to bother Lenny that much, except of Curly. Curly used to be a lightweight fighter and feels that he needs to fight everybody that's bigger than him. Unfortunately for Curly, he decides to hit Lenny. At first, Lenny doesn't do anything, but when George tells him to fight back, Lenny ends up crushing his hand. Here, his strength is a disadvantage and can cause harm when he doesn't even mean to. Luckily for him, Lenny is embarrassed to admit that Lenny crushed his hand.I would use this literature piece in my classroom. I would have it a part of an English/Reading lesson if I were in a class with the same students all day. If I were in a middle school, I would make this a part of the unit plan directed towards certain themes, such as loneliness, powerlessness, dreams, and even barriers. I would also discuss how Lenny's name is ironic to his strength and disability. His name, Lenny Small, does not describe his size or strength. It describes his childlike traits due to his intellectual disability. These are a few aspects of this book I would discuss with my class."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Heartbreaking, yes; but definitely a classic worth reading and re-reading.

George Milton and Lennie Small are poor migrant workers in California during the Great Depression. George is intelligent and looks after Lennie, a mentally-challenged man of brute size and strength, but whose lack of sense causes trouble. Sharing a bare cabin with other migrant workers, George and Lennie have little more than their dreams of owning a rabbit farm - an unlikely goal for migrants. Their companions include an aging ranch hand (Candy) minus a hand from a work accident, and a black man (Crooks) with a bad back forced to sleep alone and seek solace in books. All try to avoid trouble, particularly from the boss's hot-headed son Curly and his flirtatious young wife. Steinbeck uses foreshadowing to lead to the inevitable (if slightly contrived) ending, when Lennie becomes violent and George administers final justice. The result is a powerful Greek-style tragedy.John Steinbeck (1902-1968) wrote from his hobo experiences, and claimed that Lennie was based on a real-life migrant he once worked with. Published in 1937, OF MICE AND MEN was quickly performed on stage and in the movies. Not suprisingly, this story has faced censorship for its raw language, treatment of mental retardation, sex and violence, etc."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men is a novel based on the lives of two men, Lennie and George, who travel together. Lennie is a mentally unstable grown man, who acts like a child but has amazing strength-which inadvertantly gets him into trouble.

They are left a long distance from their work after the driver of the bus on which they were travelling tells them that the distance is not far. Here is where we learn about Lennie's dream of living in their own house... which, at this point, is only a made up story to keep Lennie busy. The next morning, they travel to a working ranch, where they meet Slim, who is not the boss but seems to have the upper hand among the men, Candy, an old worker, Crooks, who works and is forced to live in the stables, and is mistreated because of the color of his skin, and Curley, a pugnacious character who also happens to be the boss's son. After a while, George begins to believe that the dream of owning a house could be possible, seeing how Candy offers to help to avoid being canned.

I suppose to people who don't have experience with hard work and difficult times this book makes no sense. But it made a lot of sense to me. It is good dramatic history. I suppose some would consider Lenny a bit much - but I have personally met a million Lennys in my life, he presents no problem with me.A good story on many levels - friendship, compassion, the real world, selfishness and greed, making a living in a tough world and society. I'm sure it will ring a bell with all the poor and struggling - but not to the fat, always had it easy crowd. Good book - buy it.Richard Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A..\\""},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"In this short novel, Steinbeck chose two main characters. They are two wandering labourers, George Milton and Lennie Small. The former is the more intelligent one, a small and strong man with sharp features. The latter is rather a simpleton with a huge body and a shapeless face and he moves his feet like a bear moves its paws.They both dream of saving enough money to buy their own modest farm but because Lennie is both clumsy and strong he always manages to get involved in some mischief wherever he can find some work. So George has to keep a constant vigil on Lennie - particularly when there are women around - in order to avoid disaster.Steinbeck's remarkable achievement is to show in a short novel the pathetic way of life of two simple minded men and that of peasants in general in rural America in the 1930s. The dialogues are a delight to read because the author renders the characters' accent so accurately."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"Of Mice and Men is one of those stories that resonates with you long after you finish. On one hand it's a tragedy on the other it's so beautifully written. A good one to read again every once in a while."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"*WARNING: Don't read this review if you haven't read the book and don't want to know the endingThe book has three surprise events in the ending. The first is Lennie's killing of Curley's wife. This is shocking because Curley's father owns the farm, so Lennie could get into serious trouble. The second is when Lennie is hiding in the brush waiting for George, and he sees and hears Aunt Clara's ghost talking and later a rabbit talking. The third is not when George shoots Lennie, but when George walks away with Slim, as if the two are best pals now. This makes it seem that George did not take his friendship with Lennie very seriously, because instead of mourning his death alone, he hangs on to Slim, as if Lennie is easily replaceable and that Slim has taken Lennie's place now. I thought the ending makes George seem like a shady character, not bad enough to be called the villain, but still not good enough to be called hero of the book."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"I'm not a big fan of sentimental moments and happy endings, which is one of the reasons I like 'Of Mice and Men' so much. It's a tragedy, a bleak one at that, but it's also a deeply affecting novel that will stay with you long after you've read it.This is a short but powerful novel about lonely people, desperately clinging to their dreams, even if they know deep down that they will never come true. Without dreams, they have nothing. The novel speaks to the emptiness that people feel in the absence of genuine friendship and how people will settle for whatever human companionship they find in order to fill the void.In 'Of Mice and Men' Steinbeck has given us some of the most memorable characters in modern literature. The novel is deeply affecting without being overwrought or overly sentimental. Virtually all of the characters are lonely and desperate for companionship, but even so, given the opportunity they will seek out those who are lonelier or weaker than themselves and torment them as much as possible.The foreshadowing that Steinbeck uses is very efective in the novel. The difficult decision that George must make at the end of the novel is similar to a choice that Candy is unable to make earlier, a decision the old man later regrets.'Of Mice and Men' may not be the \\"feel good novel of the year\\" (of any year) but it is an extraordinary piece of fiction and one of the best novels of the 20th century. I highly recommend this novel (unless you're a sucker for happy endings)."},{"Title":"Of Mice And Men","review":"In the story of mice and men, novelist John Steinbeck made me feel like I was really in the 1930's when two hobo's were on their quest for survival on a ranch in Salinas, California. Lennie had a companion named George and they were always getting onto trouble.The ranch was a nice size, although all of the people on the ranch weren't. The ranch had lots of plants and animals. The bunks in the ranch house weren't very big and there were ten men to a house. Although living quarters were tight the men had to all get along.In the Great Depression the there weren't a lot of jobs and money. They had to struggle and do the best they could. That is why Lennie and George always stood together because they didn't have anybody else. In of Mice and Men Lennie counted on George counted on Lennie.Lennie Small is very big and he is slightly mentally retarded. He is very forgetful and gets excited over very small things, such as petting small animals. George Milton is a small man with a big temper. He is always telling Lennie that he could live better if he didn't have to take care of him. He knows he really doesn't mean it but that's just his personality.The main idea of the story is basically two hobos trying to get their own place and, \\"live off the fatta the lan\\" (john Steinbeck pg 57). They one day want to own a ranch. On the ranch they want to have a garden with a variety of vegetables to choose from. They want to have lots of animals and Lennie wants to tend the rabbits.I think this book would be appropriate for mature 8th graders and above. The reason I think that is because there are a lot of curse words in the book and the n word is used very frequently.

George is a small man who is committed to taking care of Lennie, a large, strong, mentally disabled man, after his Aunt Clara's death. George always complains about how his life would be easier if he didn't have to take care of Lennie, but truly cares for him and tells him of their plans to have a farm of their own when they get enough money. Lennie loves the story of their future farm and always asks George to tell him about how someday he will get to take care of the rabbits. Lennie loves the soft touch of animals' hair which later gets him into trouble with the wife of a man who works on the farm of their new job.Lennie always seemed to be the outcast in the novel, even by George who told him not to speak when going for their new job, for fear that Lennie would not be allowed to work, or be seen as \\"dumb.\\" Published in 1937, Of Mice and Men does not show signs of inclusion for those who are mentally disabled, nor any understanding of those who have disabilities. However, even though this novel does not show good examples of inclusion or understanding, it can still teach its readers positively about individuals with disabilities.Although this is a short novel, John Steinbeck allows this book to pull at its readers' hearts as well as teach lessons of life and love through the relationship of George and Lennie. Of Mice and Men would be a perfect book to teach at a high school level even though it is a seemingly easy read. There are themes throughout the book that would help students understand isolation, friendship, and strengths versus weaknesses. Even if there are no students with disabilities in the classroom or the school, students can learn from this novel the importance of inclusion even outside of the classroom. A class can even learn from this story about alienating students who don't have disabilities but still feel that they do not \\"fit in.\\" I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good read, no matter what age.

Especially the weaker students would benefit from it, I hoped. I would rate &quot;The Art of Electronics&quot; by Horowitz and Hill a much better book on electronics, but it is too difficult for many. However, I discovered annoying errors in Floyd's &quot;Advanced Problems&quot;.

Or problem 3-39, where a 110 V AC voltage is connected diodes and zeners that could never stand this. Anyway, in Fig. 3-71 it is not reasonable to have 220 Ohm resistors for both the 6.8 V Zener and the 24 V zener. Howcome errors like these can persist in the fourth edition?"},{"Title":"Electronic Devices","review":"My teacher used this book (fifth edition) in a basic electronics course (university). The book begins with some semiconductor basics, the pn-junction is explained and this chapter is OK if one just needs the very basic understanding (which in some schools might be enough). The second chapter contains some diodeapplications and power supply filters, the third chapter is about zener diode applications and some special purpose diodes. Then he goes on with the BJT, FET and the opamp. The physics behind the BJT is very superficially covered but he explains the operation of the BJT in principle. The book considers the basic transistor amplifier circuits but a lot of important material is left out. He uses the r-parameter model as the transistor smallsignal equivalent model, which is not a very common smallsignal model. The FET transistor comes as the next chapter, and here I miss the physics behind the FET. Of course one can design circuits without knowing the physics behind these devices, but knowing the physics will give you a much better understanding. It should also be mentioned that this book is limited to low frequency applications. Further, he doesn't say anything at all about feedback in transistoramplifiers which is one of the most important concepts in electronics. One should know that without feedback you are more or less limited to one-transistor amplifier stages, at least for the practical situation.The chapters contaning the opamp is good as starting point, although the basics could be explained in more detail. Most of the material in these chapters are limited to simple opamp circuits, and you will therefore run through these chapters without the need for any deeper analysis.What an electronics engineer should learn isn't all contained in this book, neither in any other book, but I must say this book is unsuccesful because almost everything in the book isn't deeply enough covered. You will probably not learn to design anything (at least not well enough), you just learn to calculate nodevoltages and the amplifier gain in different basic circuits. What is also left out is a general discussion about some certain problems, such as practical considerations for example. You will neither develop your basic mathematical skills using this book, because the author has left out most of the math (although very basic math), formulas are sometimes just stated without a derivation and so on. This book is just big and heavy because of the big font size and the many big pictures.One might think that I do not need a book that consideres everything in very detail. The problem is that this book is too far from that and isn't therefore intended to students at a university level. I neither think that the author wrote a book, which can be compared to other \\"more serious\\" books in the field. This is a book for those who wants to learn the basics without any deeper mathematical insight.There is a lot of books in this field, and I could mention a couple of good books that gave me a much better understanding of basic electronics. If you wanna learn op amp circuits, \\"Design with operational amplifiers and analog integrated circuits\\" by Sergio Franco, is just superior and contains everything you need about opamps, and is also well written. Books which covers transistors quite good are \\"Mircoelectronic circuits\\" by Sedra/Smith and \\"Microelectronics\\" by Millman/Grabel. The book by Sedra/Smith is quite easy to understand and contains very good homework problems. The only thing I'm missing here are some practical considerations."},{"Title":"Electronic Devices","review":"This book is really good on explaining the fundamentals of electronic devices while incorporating the math explanations. Sedra/Smith (Microelectronics) has a little more math but Floyd does a better job in showing real world applications. Lastly, I would recommend owning both Floyd and Sedra/Smith to get you battle ready for the world of electronics design."},{"Title":"Electronic Devices","review":"I am an instructor and find all of Floyd's books to be excellent...the problem is that many students like the ones in this forum are ill prepared in algebra, trig, basic calculus and just plain old problem solving, plus some don't read English well enough. Let's face it, a lot of [people] are trying to become technicians and engineers when they should be preparing themselves for fast food service."},{"Title":"Electronic Devices","review":"I think of this book as the best way to understand certain topic regarding electronics, it is the boiled down simplified version of all the math and theory covered in other books, it feels like the author is saying \\"it works like this, just do this and that\\" rather than giving you several pages of calculus and complex math (although part of it is described in the appendix in case you want to look)It has several examples and great excercises in which the author goes step by step helping you out, and many of them are practical excercises for real working circuits, it also has a CD with Multisim circuit examples, which helps a lot.However it should be used like that, as a book that explains you something easily so you can understand the main idea, something i consider to be a good thing, because once you understand the main idea then you can read more complex books and understand what those books are saying. Sometimes when im reading more complex books and im not sure what they are saying, I look at the Floyd, and there it is in simple terms giving me the answer so I can go back to the complex book.It is very similar both in content and approach with the legendary Boylestad's \\"Electronic Devices and Circuit Theory\\" , however Floyd's \\"Electronic Devices\\" is even easier, simpler and more reader friendly.So bottomline: I strongly recommend you get this book, its is great for quick reference and easy understanding, but do not rely solely on this book, keep it around next to your more in depth books.Thats the way I study, Floyd on one side, Sedra/Smith \\"Micro-electronic circuits\\" or Savant's \\"Electronic Design\\" on the other, and I go back and forth between them, the Floyd gives me the foundation and general idea, and the Sedra/Smith gives me the insight."},{"Title":"Electronic Devices","review":"I wish it had more detail on some of the subjects covered. More detailed exaples would be nice in its content, it would help drive iin the material. needs more examples."},{"Title":"Electronic Devices","review":"This book is written in a very clear and easy-to-follow way. The author does not assume a lot of knowledge on the part of the reader, and gives plenty of clear, relevant examples to make sure that the subject is fully understood. This is a great introductory book on transistors. I particularly appreciated the inclusion of actual datasheets and the use of them in exercises. In the real world, I use datasheets all the time, so it was helpful to know what to look for.The book is probably too simplistic for anyone who already has had a class on the subject. My experience with books by Floyd is fairly consistent - he is generally clear and easy to understand, but the tradeoff is that the books often lack the depth and complexity explored by other authors.If you buy this book, be sure you are aware which version you are getting - it comes in both &#34;electron-flow&#34; and &#34;conventional current&#34; versions, and it WILL make a difference to you."},{"Title":"Electronic Devices","review":"Speaking as a first year student in Electronics, I wouldn't wish this book on my worst enemy.It's not the content of the book, it's the chapter exercises.For the second chapter there are 54 standard questions, a further 7 Advanced Problems and 18 more Simulator Problems.In our class, nobody was able to finish the assignment past Question 40.The problems started out normally, and became rather tricky by Problem 8.The normal course is to go back through the chapter looking for examples that mirror the exercise, searching for techniques to memorize, and formulas to use. These were almost completely absent.Certainly someone with a degree in Electronics would have the background to comprehend the questions without referents, but if we already had a degree we wouldn't be students !The instructor worked through the problems 40-61 after passing back our homework, and this required two class sessions.I think we have a prime example of \\"expert-itis\\" here.It's rather like when a Calculus Professor writes a book on Calculus and ends up trying to impress his peers rather than teach the subject to introductory students.These exercises would be suitable for a third-year book, but the content is too simple for a third year student.The author should either add more examples with the suitable formulas, or get someone else to write the exercises to suit the text."},{"Title":"Electronic Devices","review":"I'm an electronics student with a teacher that doesn't have a clue how to teach and seems to know little about electronics.

It features the same cast of characters as A City of Bells and Sister of the Angels, romatic, artistic Henrietta, practical, self-satisfied Hugh Anthony, saintly Grandfather and sharp Grandmother, irresponsible poet Grabriel Ferranti, gentle Jocelyn and hsi vivacious wife Felicity, the haughty Dean, eccentric Mrs Jameson whose husband was eaten by cannibals, and an assortment of elderly clergymen and their wives. Going on a birthday picnic for Hugh Anthony, the principal characters all get lost and have very strange adventures, encountering (possibly) supernatural beings and having life-changing experiences. Being a children's book, the atmosphere is much lighter than in A City of Bells, and everyone's problems are resolved rather more easily than they would otherwise have been (mrs Jmeason is cured of her sazdness over her husband's gruesome end by acquiring a music box with a singing bird),but the characters are just as lovable and interesting as they are in the other books, and there is a lot of humour, as there is in all Miss Goudge's books."},{"Title":"The Blue Hills","review":"I've loved Elizabeth Goudge ever since my childhood when I discovered her in worn editions in the local library.

But that's only because it's a compilation of articles that Cooper did over the years for Rolling Stone, Interview, and other magazines. At best, this book is a cultural pastiche of a time that's slowly fading from the tips of our memories; the period of the late 80s/early 90's in which ennui, AIDS, and a new sort of decadance were laying the groundwork for the rest of the decade. Articles about the death of River Pheonix and Kurt Kobain, interviews with Courtney Love and Keanu Reaves,a rather scathing article about the death of William Burroughs,(the opinions in which I politely disagree)and Cooper's opiniated voice color this compilation with a sort of bleak, but humanistic worldview.

Her brother was 30 months old the day they met. For years our favorite adoption book was &quot;Katie-Bo&quot;. This was very much the story of our adoption as known by our son and his preschool age cousins.SEEDS OF LOVE is a very similar book for any preschooler who will gain a sibling through adoption travel rather than airport meetings.The story told in SEEDS OF LOVE is one of happiness, sadness, confusion, and love. All of these emotions go with the process of adoption and with the process of having parents leave home. This book is important because it provides a clear story with a message of love for all children in a family. With small variations, this is the story of adoption as known by many preschool age siblings."},{"Title":"Seeds of Love: For Brothers and Sisters of International Adoption","review":"I highly recommend this book! We're in the process of adopting a baby boy from Russia, and I searched for books that explain adoption to the sibling already at home. This book has been a great way to start to prepare our 3-year-old for a baby sibling who will arrive in a different way. It's about a little girl whose parents are adopting internationally - they travel without the little girl to bring home a baby girl, so the book also deals with separation while parents travel. It never mentions what country the baby is from, and it's easy to substitute \\"boy\\" as appropriate when reading.

If this is your wish, Paul Edwin Zimmer needs but one page to grant it. And you just keep going farther, and it just keeps getting better. If you read this book, a piece of Istvan the Archer and a love for the people of the island continent of Ygora will live within you forever. From the stunning classical roll call of heroes presented at the inn as they gather for their journey in its opening pages to the rip-roaring mind-boggling earth-shattering dragon-devouring confrontation of good, evil, and alien indifference in its conclusion, you will find yourself so immersed in &quot;A Gathering of Heroes&quot; you would gladly drown, and the life you live outside its pages will seem cold and still. You will have to leave Zimmer's world, but it will haunt you till you go back, time after time, until you eventually have to face the pain inflicted by an author who ventures back only once in the next 10 years, to write an inspired book that sings of fools and is called &quot;Ingulf the Mad&quot;."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Heroes (Dark Border, Vol. 3)","review":"After stumbling upon &quot;The Lost Prince&quot; and &quot;King Chondos Ride&quot; in a local library I was determined to locate this book. At the time I believed the trilogy unfinished, and desparately desired the outcome for Istvan and Jodos.Some ten years later, I stumble upon it in a tiny book shop in the middle of nowhere. In those ten years I had managed to purchase only one of the two original novels!Regardless that I lacked the opening novel, I re-read the KCR, and read for the first time The Gathering of Heroes. The first thing that grabbed my attention was (of course) the extensive list of the main characters at the start of the novel. Paul Edwin Zimmer had already proven that he does not rely on perhaps two or three main characters but a score, and this novel seemed epic even compared to prior efforts.The next thing I noticed was that while this was a sequel, it was not the direct continuance of the story. It was not long before that fact was long overlooked!Gripping is hardly the word to describe Paul Edwin Zimmer's work, as the word seems to lack the substance that Paul deserves. Indeed, Paul gives substance in his novel. Every character has a background, and while you do not know the entire background of these some twenty heroes (and at least three or four main enemies!) you certainly get the feeling of a well fleshed character in Paul's mind. The interaction between characters perfectly implies the status it deserves - so many heroes meeting the heroes they aspire to, or other heroes whom &quot;nobody has heard of&quot; regardless of their great deeds and weapons blessed by the Hasturs.Once these heroes arrive at Rath Tintallain, it is incredibly hard to put this book down. The combat just grows upon itself with the next fight being bigger than the last. And just when you can't believe how enormous that last combat was, another awaits to completely blow your mind away. And then the dyole is summoned. And then the dragons come.On top of all the combat exhausting the men, they are also forced to endure the songs of the elves, and the box that is kept secret from all but a few in the hidden city of Rath Tintallain. Come learn why it is so secret, and why the Sarlow want it."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Heroes (Dark Border, Vol. 3)","review":"From the first page you are thrust into the action.

For you readers who love their heroic fantasy to be dark, uncomprising, intelligently written and leaves you with a sense a wonder at it's epic scope. Then buy this book. Sadly Paul only wrote 5 of these Dark Border books and a few short stories relating to them. Quality not quantity what was mattered unlike a large number of his more verbose contemporaries.

A Gathering of Heroes was among his best work, right up there with the wonderfully fabulous Dark Prince &amp; King Chondos' Ride. Only David Gemmell has since written books that can equal Mr. Zimmer's in grandeur.

Zimmer's power is he makes you believe and understand how elves can be both good and dangerous, the motivation of absolute evil, how drangons can fly, and how a hero can be human and hate his reputation. No fantasy author writes heroic conflict so realistically, his knowledge of swordsmanship and his ability to convey it is unmatched. A poet as well as a writer, Zimmer uses his skill with image and language to wrap you up in his world. He ties in Celtic mythos with threads of Norse, Indian and Japanese into an invention that is his own. While you might find similar elements in other works, his vision is his own, and uniquely consistent and powerful. And sadly, after this work and Ingulf the Mad, never to be revisited again."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Heroes (Dark Border, Vol. 3)","review":"A Gathering of Heroes is a standalone fantasy masterpiece that is a prequel in the Dark Border Series. Unfortunately, the series will never be finished because of the tragic passing of Paul Edwin Zimmer. But, that shouldn't discourage anyone from reading this book.Cover Art:The Quality of the Cover Art and the Quality of the Book could be the biggest discrepancy in fantasy literature history, with RA Salvatore's Starless Night coming in second place.[...]If you just look at the cover of 'A Gathering of Heroes' you might think this is a silly book about a guy in a toga who discovered fire and he's using it to torment simple Neanderthals.\\"Look Gorak! He Make Fire!\\"But nothing can be further from the truth.Story:The greatest human champions are assembled to defend a dwarven fortress and fight alongside dwarves, elves, and immortals. All of the champions have unique personalities, interesting histories, and magic weapons. The heroes must defend an ancient artifact against a dark army of goblins, trolls, werewolves, barbarians, and dragons. All of the action from the World of Warcraft is packed into this 367 page book!Characters:They all have unique personalities and it's easy to cheer for them. Conversely, this book is loaded with villains that you'll love to hate. My only gripe about this book is that there may be too many heroes. I actually made a cheat sheet and sketched them, so I could remember what they all looked like. The book has a listing in the front of the Characters and their clans, so you can refer to it if you forget who is who.Writing Style:This book is densely packed with rich information, bringing a fantasy universe to life. It has the best portrayal of elves since JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. The pacing is fast and the book is action packed!!!Action:A battle line of dwarves stave off a pack of werewolves. Elves cast magical spells as they jump around like Spiderman and fight against fire breathing dragons. Heroes fight bravely against trolls, goblins, wolves, and other creatures of the night to save the world from plunging into darkness. More than half of this book is loaded with the most intense fantasy action ever written. Vor Half Troll cleaves heroes in half with a slab of steel as tall as a man, and half as wide. Shields break, swords slash enemies, and bodies litter the ground only to be feasted upon by carnivorous goblins.Maturity:There's sex, violence, and gore, so it's not for kids.Overall:This is a classic! And it can be fully enjoyed as a standalone novel. Every serious hardcore fantasy reader should own it.Fans of David Gemmell and Joe Abercrombie would particularly enjoy the grit and action of this book."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Heroes (Dark Border, Vol. 3)","review":"I was devastated to read of this author's death.

Old hat, right? Wrong! Everything's more than you expect it to be. It's more colorful, richer, more detailed, and extremely surprising.The breadth and depth of scholarship and vision in this book is incredible. From a revisioning of elves, though certainly based on myth, to the nod to Lovecraft with Lloigor and Zhar, and the dholes, this book takes some wonderful ideas and makes them far more powerful than they were before. I LOVED the inside view on Istvan the Archer, his secret shame and his unnoticed glory.One of the things that I found the most truly interesting about this whole series of books is the sheer alienness of the alien. A lot of writers portray things that are alien, like elves, dwarves, wizards, and the like as just like us, only different. In this book and Ingulf the Mad you can see the sheer alien nature of the elves, even as they occasionally approach humanity and human feelings. They have a totally different view - the view of the immortal, the ever-young - and must make an effort to be contaminated by human views and vision. The Hasturs are revealed as incredible powers, partly human but still far more. And the powers of the Dark, and the contamination of human views and society by their dominance in Sarlow, are incredible views of the truly alien impinging on humankind."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Heroes (Dark Border, Vol. 3)","review":"Not so much a review, but this is one of the best fantasies out there."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Heroes (Dark Border, Vol. 3)","review":"There's a web site called www.thedarkborder.com where you can register your email address to show interest in Paul's unpublished 5th book \\"The King who was of old\\".

The classes were somewhat useful and I was curious to read and learn more about it. I had recurring back and neck pain that was leading to early stage tendonitis as well for over four years. Before that time I was an avid runner, but all this had caused me to give up a lot of physical activity. After going over the exercises in the book, and doing the cat stretch regularly, my life has completely changed. My head is positioned much better over my neck and shoulders and my shoulder and neck pain has reduced by over 90%. The upper back pain is also mostly gone. Most importantly, the movements have helped me get in tune with my body, and if I sense that some muscles are sore, I have a battery of movements that I can leverage to fix it. The effect is truly amazing.The illustrations in the book are somewhat hard to follow, but one gets used to it. Most importantly, unlike other techniques, there is no \\"one\\" way to do the movements. One has to sense and find the movement yourself. In that sense, this technique is a lot different. This book is worth every penny you spend on it."},{"Title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","review":"Understanding how your muscles can, over time, become accustomed to positions that are both uncomfortable and restricting of motion covers the first part of this book. After you understand how your muscles shift and get stuck over time, Hanna walks you through some exercises that allow you to reclaim those muscles, as well as the flexibility and strength that comes with a musculo-skeletal system that isn't tied in knots.The explanations are clear and straightforward, the exercises (at least the ones I've done so far) produce results you can feel very quickly. This isn't a panacea nor is it some \\"guru\\" thing - it's basic anatomy of the musculo-skeletal system broken down in very clear terms.I'd recommend this to anyone with stiffness, soreness, back-leg-neck issues - with your doc's approval so you don't counter whatever else you may be doing.For those of us for whom Yoga is a distant dream (I used to lift weights, but was never particularly flexible), this is a wonderful tool to get back into the bodies we remember."},{"Title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","review":"A friend recommended this to me after I had been incapacitated by back pain. I just woke up crippled by back pain one morning - the first time in my life. After weeks of doctors and little relief, I read the book and tried out the exercises. I immediately felt the benefits.The book is organized as first, a series of case studies, which the author uses to illustrate his theory of muscle amnesia, followed by a series of illustrated exercises with detailed instructions. Anyone reading this book should first read the case studies before doing the exercises.The author's objective is to help you reacquaint you with parts of your body that you have lost touch with - and therefore lost control of. He believes that much back and body pain is due to involuntary actions of muscle groups that we have forgotten how to control. By doing exercises and focusing on how they feel, we can regain sensation and control of our muscles. We can replace painful involuntary muscle actions with graceful voluntary ones.All I can say is, the exercises - and theory - helped me, and I do the short version of the exercises most days. The exercises are not strenuous or painful - they are pleasurable and relaxing, leaving you feeling invigorated."},{"Title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","review":"Short spin-off on the Feldenkrais method.

And how traumas cause stored, compensatory tensions in the body.The lessons were completely doable and not too difficult to follow. I recommend \\"The Busy Person's Guide to Easier Movement\\" for much more comprehensive Feldenkrais exercises.The problem is that the author has it out for modern medicine. And seems to go too far fetched with the idea that aging doesn't have to happen. He should've emphasized that with better use of self, aging potentially can be only a fraction of how limiting it is. It's not that a person doesn't age and weaken at all."},{"Title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","review":"The methods used in this book have been very helpful for me to relieve a lot of the pain and discomfort I have in my legs. What I found out is that many of us have muscles that we have given over to automation by our bodies, much like the way your heart beats without you controlling it. The heart is designed to work this way, but most of the muscles in our bodies are meant to be directly controlled by us. The problem is that when we, for example, sit in a chair for many hours, some of our muscles will flex for so long in that position that they do not fully relax when we stand up. This can cause many problems, such as sore muscles, bad posture, aches and pains, etc.This book has a series of exercises designed to help us regain conscious control over our muscles. I have had great results so far. It does require some amount of focus to become aware of which muscles you may be flexing unconsciously, but the results are really impressive:)I think almost anyone could benefit to some degree from this book. Even if you don't have pain or discomfort, these exercises could prevent these problems from arising in the future."},{"Title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","review":"The Somatic exercises have given me more fluidity and ease of movement that anything I've tried - Yoga, Pilates, Egoscue, physical therapy. I actually felt an amazing difference the first time I did these exercises. I continue to do them every day, I enjoy doing them because they allow me to move with far less discomfort and pain. The book may be a little challenging, but well worth the effort. Be sure to read it and then begin the exercises so you have a complete understanding of what the exercises are about and why they work. I'm recommending this book to everyone I know that has lower back/hip issues. The exercises have also been helpful in increasing the range of motion of my shoulder which was beginning to 'freeze up' for me.

Amazingly, after a couple days of self-administered Somatics, I was able to quit the painkillers I was on and resumed something like my previous level of activity. Notably, this book is merely the core text, and I've since purchased a couple other books of their website, but nevertheless the exercises in here are quite effective for decreasing pain from stuck muscles and increasing range of motion. A good way to check whether it will be efficacious for you is to actually feel the muscles that hurt. If they're stiff and flexed, PT, stretching, etc. will probably not help, but Somatics probably will."},{"Title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","review":"I have been practicing the exercises in outlined in the book for about two months now. My back is much better and I have gained flexibility in bending by three or more inches.

Best of all, once you have practiced the long exercises, you consolidate them into a seven minute daily routine you can do either in the morning or before bed. You can see results in a few days, so it's pretty easy to keep on working."},{"Title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","review":"not clear enough to be sure I am doing them correctly, so I probably have to buy a couple of videos"},{"Title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","review":"If you are interested in the relationship between the mind and the body, this is an excellent book which discusses this relationship.

It's impossible to see what the exercises are about or how they are to be performed. The pictures are not of human models but of something that looks like a crash test dummy, and the kindle version is so dark you can't see the movements which are very subtle.SInce I only bought the Kindle version I am not sure if the pictures are better in the printed book but without clear visual instruction, a wonderful book is rendered useless.

A large portion of this book deals with the author's discussion of success stories. It is then followed by a substantive discussion and then a chapter on exercises. The exercises are impossible to understand as the author has employed the use of a wooden art class figurine to illustrate poses. The photographs of this wooden model do not have enough contrast to serve as illustrations and are thus totally useless. Buy Yoga, Mind Body Sprit by Donna Fahri for a much better explanation of body mehanics and with higher production values."},{"Title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","review":"This book is amazing. For over a year I have scoffed at exercise as a way to recover from repetitive stress injuries. Then I read this book and followed the exercises. Not only has it improved the way my neck feels (a key factor in my RSI recovery), but I feel like I did when I was a child again when walking and moving around -- greater flexibility, no tension in my trunk, back, etc. (I am age 50). As far as my neck, this book is as valuable--or perhaps moreso--than a trip to the massage therapist. Incredible.Each lesson does take some time and must be repeated at least a second day, but after completing them (takes about two weeks), the maintenance cat stretch takes 5 minutes a day.Am sharing this with others in my family with neck and/or back problems, and others who have repetitive stress injuries."},{"Title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","review":"One of the most important books ever written!

I borrowed it from a friend then bought my own copy so I never have to be without it. I teach beginning Yoga practice and lead my students in these exercises at the beginning of many classes to bring awareness to the body-mind and loosen and open before practicing traditional poses. This book has been a god-send providing several somatic exercises that are explained simply and thoroughly emphasizing awareness on the body. The references to studies given in the body of the book, come across a little &quot;heady&quot;, but in no way take away from the wealth of information. Hanna explains what &quot; Sensory-motor amnesia&quot; is, and how to free ourselves from it."},{"Title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","review":"I had severe chronic abdominal pain for the best part of a year. I had to quit my sport (rowing) and it really affected my studies. Truth is I was already beginning to realise that my problem was somatic and had begun to release the abdominal tension just by thinking about it. I discovered somatics after that. Personally I have found it an effective approach to releasing tension. It has worked for me but what I would like to know is whether it has worked for others?The thing about this sort of book is that it is likely to attract positive reviews. We only see the successes and the failures are forgotten about thus distorting the reviews. Indeed this is a failure of the book itself. As a practitioner of somatics Hanna must have had people he could not help. What was their situation? How long did he work with them? As such the first part of the book which discusses case studies and its philosophical basis cannot be regarded as scientific. We can learn as much from failure as from success.The only critical review at the time of writing is right to criticise the poor visibility of the skeleton diagrams. Others have criticised its lack of mention of the fact that there are people trained in somatic education. If you decide to take on the program then I advise you to go to someone trained in the movements otherwise you risk doing it wrong and wasting your time or at worst making your problem worse.Somatics is not an alternative to Pilates or Yoga rather it takes certain aspects of those disciplines and refines them as well as adding some additional ideas not found in either. Pilates is about core stability, yoga is about... well yoga and somatics is about muscle tension. The book also fails to adequately put itself within context of other related disciplines.Anyway, Somatics is a great discipline. I hope that the next edition works out these criticisms."},{"Title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","review":"This is an interesting book that has helped a lot of people. I had a back injury that I thought would never go away. These exercises were one of the final pieces of the puzzle in helping me to finally feel better.

The instructions are very easy to understand, and the exercises, once you learn them and create routines, are pretty quick to get through."},{"Title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","review":"I have been a medical massage therapist since 1995. When I read this book, I knew I had to learn more. This information provides clients with a way to help maintain the results they get from their treatments. I was so impressed by it that I got certified to teach it. Now, I teach a class once a month to enhance my work. I bought the book for twenty of my clients and they are all on the program.

This is time and money well spent."},{"Title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","review":"I give this book a 10 star rating. I just love the Cat Stretch. There are live demonstrations of it on Youtube. I have been doing it daily for 3 months and with each passing day I feel more release of chronically tight muscles. I've had faster results with Somatics than with Egoscue. If you don't have the advantage of seeing a Somatic Educator (which I believe will give you even faster results) then the individual exercises in this book will suffice. A great compatible book to this one is by Craig Williamson called \\"Muscular Retraining for Pain Free Living\\"."},{"Title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","review":"Two years ago I got this book after leafing through it in a bookstore. I have had backpain for over 40 years and was in terrible shape following six weeks of recovery from surgery. I did the exercises in this book every day and within a week could feel a change. I then started investigating somatics and Feldenkrais and now am an avid practictioner of Yoga and am doing aerobic exercise. I did not believe I could ever feel better than lousy. It is not hyperbole to say that this book started \\"my own revolution\\". I got in touch with my body and became interested in it. The premise of somatics is fascinating and anyone who is in need of Physical Therapy should become familiarized with this in order to facilitate their own healing. It's not magic, it's not someone elses' job; it's about learning how you got to be in the shape you are and how to bring about real change."},{"Title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","review":"If you follow the exercises outlined in this book, you will feel an expanded sense of well-being.

If you are experiencing annoying pain and stiffness, this book should provide the ticket out."},{"Title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","review":"The term \\"somatic\\" comes from theFeldenkraissystem. This book is an offshoot of that discipline with special exercises involving visualization which are utilized for the relief of chronic pain.My husband and I both experienced traumatic injuries from separate car accidents years ago, with resulting long-term, chronic pain for both of us in our backs, and for me in my neck and him in his hip. His hip pain has been much worse than any of my pain, but we have both gone to many of the same pain management doctors for our injuries. We have been treated with prolotherapy, chiropractic, therapeutic massage, electrical stimulation, cold laser, acupuncture, and rolfing, as our least invasive treatments. In addition, we have explored many different techniques for non-invasive, home care to relieve our pain, and stretching, heat applications, relaxation techniques, and water workouts are regular parts of our pain-reducing, health routines.One pain specialist we saw in 2004 told us that in his professional opinion, 80% of all chronic pain is caused by dysfunctional muscles which go into spasm habitually. This book shares that opinion, though not in those exact words.It is possible to read this book very carefully, step by step, and do the full blown set of exercises the author recommends. In my case, I didn't need to pursue the author's suggestions to that extent because I stumbled on exactly what I had been needing for decades in the beginning of the book.I tried out the diagnostic exercise the author uses on new patients to test how dysfunctional their muscles are. He asks them to press and release muscles in different parts of their bodies, in particular an exercise where you lie on your back and press the small of your back down, then release, then press the lower back muscles by arching upward, then release. This exercise alone, done twice a day, created massive improvement in the \\"bad spot\\" on my mid back that I have had trouble with its going into spasm unpredictably for over 20 years.From there I extrapolated a simple version of that one exercise and expanded into doing press/release on every muscle of my body, from the crown of my head to my feet, and I would follow up with another Feldenkrais technique called \\"micro movements\\" that a Rolfer taught me. She said that we constantly do \\"gross\\" or large body movements, but we almost never do tiny movements. Thus, when you learn stretches for the body, you will, for example, turn your head to the right as far as you can and hold a few seconds, then turn your head to the left as far as you can and hold a few seconds. If you were doing this type of stretch as a micro movement, you would turn your head barely an inch to the right in a delicate motion, then do the same to the left. On larger areas like the buttocks or back, you visualize moving the muscle in a clockwise motion, gently and delicately, and then in a counterclockwise motion.Over time experimenting with somatics, it occurred to me that one thing that all the personal trainers I have had over the years for instruction in weight lifting consistently taught me is a technique very similar to the exercises in this book in its focus on muscles. That technique is calledisometrics. You can do isometrics either while lifting weights, or do them without any weights. Isometrics is basically consciously contracting a muscle while focusing your attention on it (versus doing it absentmindedly), and then consciously releasing it. In other words, the same type of press/release you do for the somatics in this book.When most people lift weights, they attempt to work essentially every external muscle in the body with the exception of the head and the feet--and to some extent the feet are exercised, too, if you go up on your toes for any of your exercises, such as workouts for the calves. Weightlifting, however, does not consciously attempt to strengthen the muscles contained within internal organs. It occurred to me that I could apply the principles of somatics even more effectively by emulating the exercises I do lifting weights at the gym and doing conscious isometrics on my various external muscles as I took the positions commonly used while lifting weights--but without the weights--in order to create somatic healing of my muscles. Examples of these exercises are the positions taken for a chest press, lat pull down, leg lifts, bicep curls, and so forth. I began doing this on waking and at bedtime, and when actually lifting weights, in addition to doing isometric focus while lifting weights, I did isometric/somatic press/release of the muscle just worked after I was done with my set of repetitions, before moving on to the next body part.After this experiment, I decided to also routinely do press/release on the external muscles that are not included in weight lifting, which involved press/release of the feet and of every muscle in the head, including all parts of the face, top, sides and back of the head.From there I progressed to doing press/release of internal organs. Many women, and some men, have been taughtkegelsby their doctor. That is a prime example of doing isometric aka press/release somatic exercise of an internal organ. Other internal organs that give many people trouble are the gastrointestinal tract. It is possible to do press/release somatics, I discovered, of the stomach, the small intestines, the ileocecal valve (which connects the small and large intestine), and the large intestines. For people who suffer from IBS or stomach cramps due to stress, this use of somatics can offer strong relief from their pain and heal the dysfunctional peristalsis that leads to alternating constipation and diarrhea.The result for me has been this: I have relieved the spasms in my right arm caused by using a mouse that is typically called \\"carpal tunnel syndrome.\\" I almost never get headaches anymore. When my long-time worst pain source in my mid back goes into spasm, using press/release of the muscle alone, I can get it out of spasm within minutes, versus the awful situation in my past where a locked spasm could result in indefinite, extreme pain. I have an ease of movement that I haven't had since my twenties. Best of all, I feel that I have knowledge that can save me not only pain, but the money and loss of time of seeking outside care rather than helping myself at home for free--any time of the day or night.One of the most exciting things for me about any particular self-help book I read is if it inspires me to utilize what it teaches and make it my own. This book did that for me. It has been life-changing in the way very few books on health ever have. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","review":"This book has offered me insight about a hip pain I've carried for years and helped me locate its probable source in my lower back.

As a yoga teacher, I've shared some of this wisdom with students and they are delighted to figure out how to release unwanted tension from their bodies.

Not only that, he offers a simple plan to recover lost flexibility, balance, and posture. His exercises, he assures us, will bring us back into connection with our lost mobility while reducing pain and discomfort. It almost sounds too good to be true. But is it?Most people suffer from pain and discomfort at some point in their lives. When this follows an injury, it is easy to watch the play of cause and effect. This can allow us some feeling of control during our healing process as we regain lost function and strength. When we don't know why we hurt, we can feel like victims of our own bodies. When we ask our doctors for help, they offer drugs for pain, and tell us to buck up and accept our lot. We are growing older, after all. What else should we expect? Everyone knows that bodies wear out eventually.Hanna challenges this idea. He points out that although this is true for many people today, there are also many circumstances in which people maintain function and vitality right up to the very end. Gerontologists call this \\"successful aging.\\" Rather than dismiss such cases as oddities, Hanna thinks we should embrace them as possibilities, and learn how to make our own lives turn out like theirs.Five case studies are reviewed in the course of the book. In each case, through guided movements, flexibility is restored and pain is alleviated. Several of the cases are quite extraordinary; one woman regained the use of her frozen shoulder after just one treatment, despite almost two unsuccessful years of conventional treatment. Another case involved a man who had not been able to straighten his knee for almost two years. He rediscovered how to control what he had once given up as lost.Although Somatics is full of information for the professional, it is very accessible to the lay reader as well. He uses clear language that anyone can understand. After describing commonly seen habits of movement, he gives us the keys to unlock our own blockages through simple exercises that almost anyone can do. These slow movements rebalance our structure by bringing awareness to the way we actually move our bodies, and teach us how to develop more balanced ways of moving.The final chapter includes his basic movement explorations. His exercises are simple, mild, and brief. He offers a series of lessons, in which the reader may explore different areas of the body. By encouraging the reader to reacquaint themselves with their movements, he invites us to take our own steps on this healing path. And if my brief explorations with this work are any guide, change really is possible. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking to find a new sense of vitality, movement, and freedom in their body.

Periodically my right hip got so stiff I could hardly get moving when I got up. My dr flippantly said I had arthritis and sent me to get x-rays. I went to my chiropractor instead. He took x-rays and said there were no signs of arthritis which I was sure would be the outcome. But why was I so stiff? He worked on my back which I'm certain was out of whack, (my job is stressful) but my hip still didn't get much better. I do a lot of net research and reading of other folks input. I'm not sure what brought me to this, but YES, it does make a difference. I struggle getting through the exercises and have not made it through to #8 yet, only to #5. I recorded the sessions and put my tape player on pause whilst I complete the repetitions. (It makes it easier than holding a book and keeping your place.) I did the exercises for a while and quit and haven't had any problems and shame on me, how much better I could feel if I continued on(never seems to be enough time for everything I need to do!)This doctor is right. Our brains get trained in certain movements, postures, and we don't revert back to healthy conditions like when we were children. Our stress lives in our bodies and our brains just become accustomed to it. So, this is brain and muscle retraining and it has done very well for me. Two years of periodic stiffness that I couldn't see a reason why... I just forgot how to relax and use my muscles properly. It makes a big difference! Kind of like how the hearing impaired people need to have hearing therapy when they get new aids. The brain forgets how to listen. For our muscles, the brain forget how to let them relax."},{"Title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","review":"Complete honesty: Somatics and Hanna Somatics in particular is one of the most important discoveries of my adult life. I'm 28 now and had incured a series of small muscle pulls in my lower body and then a groin pull (combined with horrible posture and alignment) that eventually threw my whole body into a cycle of degeneration and discomfort. Somatics is the one discipline that is helping me to unravel these patterns. I literally feel 10 years younger.Hanna's greatest insight is that we are both an interior sensing and feeling being as well as an exterior organism. We have a double sense of our physical nature -- inside we feel ourselves as a soma, outside we see and observe ourselves as a body. Most medicine obsesses over the exterior body and denies or supresses the soma. This is unfortunate because the soma, and our inner awareness of our sensations, feelings, pains, and sense of balance, has tremendously useful healing capacities. These are activated by unlocking the potential of our brain and nervous system, which control so much of how well our bodies function and how we hold onto muscular tension and pain.By accessing and working with (rather than against) our nervous responses and muscle groups through simple movement exercises, we can allow our bodies to let go of painful patterns and habits of how we hold ourselves. This is accomplished primarily through pandiculation, a method of slowly contracting and relaxing the tight and unresponsive muscles in order to gain better control over them, thereby increasing their strength and flexibility, or their ability to contract and relax. This overcomes what Hanna calls sensory-motor amnesia, or a loss of control and feeling of our musculature. This loss of control can develop over time by poor postural patterns or acutely through injury. In either case our brain rewires the neural connections to the area through reflex patterns that need to be unlearned in order to restore healty functioning. This is only possible if we go slowly and develop an inner awareness of these patterns. Only then can we release them.This work is highly effective and smart. It seems miraculous, since the mechanism is an interior one. I love the implications -- we are basically computers with a self-correcting diagnostic and repair system. Somatics just teaches you how to activate and utilize it for maximum benefit. We do have control of our own bodies and nervous system. We just have to be clever and inwardly-aware and have the right techniques to unlock it. Truly groundbreaking and paradigm shifting work!"},{"Title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","review":"Enjoyed the book.

I am a life-long chiropractic patient and am accustomed to being pro-active with my health. I was having extreme pain from Piraformis symdrome which caused sciatic pain. Chiropractic helped but didn't dissolve the muscle spasm that was causing the pain.Then after an extensive Google search, I discovered Essential Somatics and began doing the movements she suggests to help relieve the piraformis muscles. Within a week my pain was gone, never to return. This really, truly, this works. This is not yoga, it's not pilates; it does not put any stress or strain on joints. Ut is a fully developed, working system of specific movements that help to unlock the body from the programming that the brain has created to protect after injuries or overuse. This literally helps to reprogram the brain so that old injuries no longer have to recur and limit movement, activity and vitality.This book and her videos are really, truly wonderful.

It is this attention to one's internal sensory-motor process (with emphasis on the relaxation half of movement) that allows the profound improvements in posture, muscle control and general physiological-psychological (\\"Somatic\\") function.Learning through doing these sets of movements and then daily practicing the streamlined summary \\"Cat Stretch\\" 7-part sequence of maintenance movements will enable any person to unlearn their constricted habits of movement and behavior while opening to greater and greater increase of relaxation, flexibility, range of motion and freedom from pain.The widespread application of this information has the potential to significantly decrease the cost-per-person of healthcare and dramatically increase the well-being of every human being on the planet.Let's keep the news moving!For even more information and to make appointments for sessions with a practitioner like those described in the case studies in this book, the following Websites will prove very useful: [...] and [...]."},{"Title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","review":"I bought this for a class taught locally and it has definately helped. i had numerous trauma related injuries and have learned a series of movements and now stand straighter and am more comfortable each dat."},{"Title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","review":"My Physician told me to get this book , and it is very uplifting, and makes thingsgo into another perspective."},{"Title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","review":"I learned a lot from reading the book, however, I was unable to do the first exercise because one of my problems is in my shoulders.

I used to suffer from shoulder tendinitis and other muscular ailments, but by using the material in this book I'm now 99% pain free. In addition, &quot;Somatics&quot; taught me about the causes and cures of muscular tension, &quot;aging&quot;, and poor posture. By applying what I learned in &quot;Somatics&quot;, my body has become much more supple and relaxed, making activities from walking to playing tennis to doing the dishes much more enjoyable.But what is the catch? As Thomas Hanna explains, once you learn how your body really works, its up to you to learn how to improve its function. The bad news is that it takes time and persistance to effectively apply the knowledge in &quot;Somatics&quot; to your own body. The good news, however, is that by applying this knowledge you'll gain control over your own muscular (and thereby skeletal) health, now and for the rest of your life!I also like this book because even though the material is fairly scientific, the book's occasional humor and its case study format make it an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","review":"A wise Pilates/Feldenkrais teacher introduced me to this book. Using \\"Somatics\\" I personally found relief from chronic lower lumbar pain, and got help retraining my gait and balance after a severe ankle injury.The book is simple to understand with sections for various problems.Somatics are a system of gentle movements - while breathing and mildly focusing (and sometimes simple \\"looking\\" in certain directions)- which through a combination of neuromuscular stimulation and the gentlest of stretches (no pain!) manages to to roll back years of stiffness, aid injury recovery, and significantly relieve some of the stresses of aging.Somatics is based on sound science, and Feldenkrais, yoga, and Pilates are related. But Somatics exercises - movements really - are even gentler, and smarter, No equipment but a towel or mat is needed. Any level of fitness can benefit, even someone in a wheelchair or bedridden can do some of the movements.If you have the patience and interest, I suggest reading the book and working through every single exercise presented, which is what I did coming back from traumatic injury. Some will \\"speak to you\\", and you'll incorporate them later into daily practice.If you lack the patience or the time for this, the book is still valuable for its simple \\"CAT STRETCH\\" a five minute series of gentle movements which gently moves the whole body and seem to me like \\"the fountain of youth\\" . I do the cat stretch twice a day - on arising and before bed.I could not recommend this book and Somatics in general more highly.

Their bodies are on &quot;auto-pilot&quot;. Hanna makes this clear to the reader and then discusses how the reader can re-awaken their brain circuits and change their body programming, releasingmuscular tension, using the exercises in the back of the book. Granted that the wooden figures showing the exercises can be difficult to discern, it is worth your patience to work it out.Your body will thank you.

Thank you Mr. Hanna.I have bought about 10 of these books forfriends in pain. A very easy read and reference"},{"Title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","review":"In this book, Thomas Hanna provides a clear, readable explanation of how our brains can become conditioned to maintain unnecessary muscle tension, why that causes pain and limits movement, and most importantly, how to re-educate our brains to release tension, restore free movement, and eliminate pain.The book tells the stories of people who developed limiting pain problems, and how they were able to rebalance their muscles to restore better health. It also gives specific exercises that you can do at home to rebalance your own muscles and relieve pain.The exercises depicted in this book gave me my life back, freeing me from back and neck pain I had for 14 years after being hit by a truck while riding my bicycle. I had undergone many types of treatment with little enduring relief, and this work is what gave me the tools to finally heal my body.Finally feeling well and energetic after so many years of pain and limitation was such a miracle for me that I went on to study to become a certified Hanna Somatic practitioner myself, and I now practice in Sausalito, California. This work, and this book, is a gift--empowering us to take an active role in our own well-being with simple tools that really work."},{"Title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","review":"This book serves as an excellent introduction to somatic education and the benefits available to those willing to do the exercises descibed in the manner (slow and easy) that Hanna recommends. As an educator and therapist I often recommend this book to clients who want to take responsiblity for their own well-being and hear nearly 100% positve feedback about the books usefulness. The explanation of the neuromuscular patterns of stress and trauma and how they contribute to negative aging, dysfunctional posture and chronic pain provide valuable insight helpful for sufferers as well as for the teachers and therapists who try to help. The drawback is the difficulty involved in learning new and unfamiliar movement exercises from the printed page and the pictures are not very helpful. But working with a partner who can read you the directions, repeating them as needed can be helpful. Audio lessons are available for solo work but I highly recommend reading the book first."},{"Title":"Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health","review":"I love Somatics. Just a few private sessions have improved my posture, greatly increased my flexibility without regular stretching and greatly lessened pain in my right hip. I'm not so sure, though, that the average person who hasn't been introduced to Somatics through a few classes or private sessions will so easily be able to get it which is why I only gave the book 4 stars. Some of the Somatics movements in the book take quite a bit of body awareness to figure out and do.Having expressed my concern about how easy it would be for ordinary folks to \\"get it\\" I want to also say that Thomas Hanna was a brilliant man, there are profound concepts in this book, and for anyone who's ever done Feldenkrais Awareness Through Movement work this book is a priceless extension to Feldenkrais' work. My Somatics teacher who has also taught the Feldenkrais method says results come much much quicker in Somatics.For someone wanting to explore Somatics I'd recommend this book and also whichever of the audio tapes/CDs from Hanna's organization in Sonoma, California interest you.

And I mean, immensely. Her books are some of the most romantic I've ever read. They take you away into such a fun place, you can't put the book down.This story starts off in 1837. It's about Laura, Rye &amp; Dan who were childhood friends &amp; grew closer into adulthood. Laura &amp; Rye had a magical connection, married and soon after he left on a whaling ship to try &amp; earn their fortune. However, fate stepped in, his ship went down, and as everyone assumed, with him on it. 5 years later, with a son Rye never knew, married to his best friend Dan who saw her through the toughest times in her life, Rye returns and walks into a house that was once his &amp; a woman he thought was still his wife. Not to mention the son he didn't know existed, but who's now calling another man papa. Rye's returned, but lost everything, including his house &amp; it's belongings as he finds out that legally Laura's married to Dan. But with a love so very strong, Laura &amp; Rye begin a journey, not knowing where it will leave all 4 of them &amp; no one wanting to hurt the other.I enjoyed this book for so many reasons, interesting &amp; likable characters, memorable love story, great friendships and humor. It was also interesting to read about what it was like to live in Nantucket in the 1800's with the whaling industry &amp; all of the other sorts of things like horse &amp; carriage rides, making homemade candles &amp; wearing those hideous corsets.If you are looking for a love story, I'll guarentee you this one will not let you down!"},{"Title":"Twice Loved","review":"LaVyrle's first really good book! This is a story about the power of love. I also enjoyed the setting -- Nantucket -- and the whale and cooper industries.I've always felt that there's several people you could be happily married to -- but there's probably only one real love of a lifetime. And that is the case in this book. Even though Laura enjoyed being married to Dan, her heart had always belonged with Rye.Have read all of LaVyrle's books and put this one in my own top 5."},{"Title":"Twice Loved","review":"I wanted to love this..I really did, but I just COULD NOT STAND Laura. I felt that she was playing both Rye and Dan. I disliked her so much that I didnt think she deserved either of them. The writing was pretty good and I thought that the idea for the story was an interesting one, but I just couldnt connect with the characters. One thing that I really did LOVE about this book though were the flashbacks of Laura and Rye discovering eachother and falling in love when they were young...in my opinion, no one can write sexual tension like Lavyrle Spencer. All in all, not bad, but not to die for either.... for a book by Ms Spencer, I thought this was woefully average."},{"Title":"Twice Loved","review":"The concept of a husband long suspected lost at sea returning to find his wife married to his best friend is certainly an interesting concept, but ultimately, I feel, this story falls short of its potential. I did not feel sympathy for Laura and felt that her character was weak and did not inspire empathy or compassion. Rye, while I felt sorry and empathized with his situation, was rather annoyed by his lack of respect for the Laura-Dan situation. In the end, I liked Dan best of all and felt that he conducted himself the best given the situation, and actively felt sorry for the man. Not really how you want to end a novel, feeling sorry for a man other than the hero!"},{"Title":"Twice Loved","review":"I almost bought this book a couple years ago, but decided against it based on the other reviews here. I am a big Spencer fan, and intend to read all her books, so I finally checked this out from the library and surprise! -- I really enjoyed it. I had a very difficult time putting this down. I didn't like the character of Rye at first, but later in the book I was able to sympathize with all the characters, I mean, what a dilemma! I didn't like the way Dan handled the situation, but how else would a man act when he realizes that out of the blue he's going to lose the wife and son he loves? I also enjoyed the sparring between Rye and his father, I wish the author could have brought a little more of it into the story. The one thing I didn't like was the ending; I know the story could not have ended any other way, but it was sad none the less, I especially felt sorry for Josh at that point. I would definitely recommend this book, but I can only give four stars. Five stars need to be saved for other Spencer books like Morning Glory, November of the Heart, and Family Blessings."},{"Title":"Twice Loved","review":"This is the second book by LaVyrle Spencer that I have read and I must say that I am now hooked on her love stories and on her writing style. Although this book starts off really slow because of its painstakingly detailed decriptions of the setting, her diligence in and ability to describe the history between the characters and the love scenes was much appreciated and gave me a very intimate look into the minds and lives of the characters. This is what made Laura, Rey and Dan real and its also what makes readers feel the emotions that the characters feel throughout the story. That is the test of a truly good writer, and LaVyrle Spencer has passed the test with flying colors!"},{"Title":"Twice Loved","review":"A friend and a niece put me on to LaVyrle Spencer books. Every book I have read, I have loved. I loved this one in particular. It was such a love story. I love the way Miss Spencer writes about the location in a knowledgeable manner. It makes each book more special. What a find - I will read all her books eventually..."},{"Title":"Twice Loved","review":"This is the first LaVyrle Spencer book I have read, and after reading Twice Loved, I have purchased every Spencer book that I could find.How some of the other reviewers thought it less than great is a wonder to me. It had me hooked from the first page.After I read a Spencer book, I always read another author after her, so that when I go back to Spencer, I can truly appreciate her genius."},{"Title":"Twice Loved","review":"I was really disappointed in this one. I'm a big fan of LaVyrle Spencer and there's just a few of her older ones that I haven't read yet, so I picked this one up for cheap at a used book seller. Like another reviewer said, it did drag on and on. This book could've easily been a hundred pages shorter and been better for it. I found Laura kind-of annoying with her wishy-washiness and found myself wondering why both men wanted her so bad. Dan (the one she's married to when the book starts) was weak and clinging and made me wonder what the heck made him and Rye best friends to begin with. Instead of stepping up and giving Laura a reason to stay with him, he turns into the kind of man any woman would divorce regardless of circumstances. I didn't mind Rye, although there were times I wondered why Laura wanted either of the two. All-in-all, none of the main characters were that likable.But, despite all that, LaVyrle did what she does so well, and that's paint a vivid picture of life on Nantucket Island during the mid 1800's when whaling drove the economy. You can almost smell the smells and see the colors of the island, so vivid is her picture. That's what I love about her books. You feel truly transported, and in that she did not disappoint. I still liked this book okay, it just didn't deliver on the love story like most of Spencer's do. I found myself really not caring about the main characters at all. If this was your first LaVyrle Spencer novel, I'd recommend not basing your opinions on this one. It wasn't her best by a long shot! Try Morning Glory. That one was brilliant! I doubt you'd be disappointed."},{"Title":"Twice Loved","review":"the book went on and on. All the descriptions of the town, weather, ocean, people, etc were too boring and I started to skip paragraphs and pages to get to some kind of action. I couldn't see, what was so special about Laura to have 2 such good men fell in love with her. Seemed to me, she didn't want to make any decision and was waiting for either one of the them to give her an ultimatum. That way, she sort of didn't have to decide for herself. And, actually, Dan was the one who started the legal proceedings, not Laura. Last couple of chapters were easier to read, since there was something going on there.That is the first book I am reading by this author, and I am not sure if I am going to read any of her books again."},{"Title":"Twice Loved","review":"A very powerful story - emotionally moving. The characters are well-developed - the emotions realistic. Childhoold sweethearts Laura and Rye face conflicting emotions when they Rye returns from sea after believed to be dead. Laura has married their close childhood friend Dan for the past 4-5 years, believing that Rye is dead. The two lovers struggle to get back together. Laura has borne Rye's son and Dan, her husband fears losing her back to Rye. Laura is conflicted between the two men - duty and gratitude towards Dan, love & passion twds Rye but how to choose between them? This tale is bittersweet. A very good read."},{"Title":"Twice Loved","review":"Spencer writes a different story every time--that's what I love about her. Or should I be speaking in past tense--loved about her. She never wrote sequels. What she does is quite unique. She writes a story surrounding the journey of two people's relationship from the time they meet--through the conflict--and on to the ever necessary happy ending.In this one, the happy ending comes, but not without the tears and pain. How she manages this is heart wrenching. Yes, I was a bit bugged by Laura for not standing up for her feelings and for staying with Dan out of gratitude, but as you read, you tend to put yourself in her position and wonder what you would do and how you would feel. *SPOILER* Her child loved one man as his father. How can you tear apart father and son? But then again, how can you keep another man from ever knowing the love of his child? A painful decision.This is one to be read again and again and again. How you come to love both men will make you cry out of anquish and joy."},{"Title":"Twice Loved","review":"The year is 1837 and today is the day- for five lonely years, handsome Rye Dalton dreamed of the day he would return home to Nantucket and to his beloved wife's soft tender kisses and her warm embraces. His wife Laura, to whom he is returning, is his childhood sweetheart. Things still look the same- the town, his house... but they're not. Less than a year after Rye sailed away word came back that his whaling ship had sunk taking all of the lives on it. Laura, long since believing Rye was dead, has married another man. He was there from the beginning to support Laura and help care for her and Rye's infant son- born 8 1/2 months after Rye left. He is the only father the boy has every known. He is non-other Rye's closest friend, Dan Morgan.Now begins the questions - who is Laura legally married to now? and Who will she finally decide to share her life with?

I always learn so much about a different time and place in our country and the life challenges of love and marriage then."},{"Title":"Twice Loved","review":"I thought the plot of this story was very well done. If you buy this book though, DO NOT read the back of it--it gives away too much!This book reminds me of Tom Hanks's film Castaway, except imagine for a moment that the plot of that film was good instead of cheesy! That would somewhat describe Twice Loved."},{"Title":"Twice Loved","review":"This was the first Lavyrle I had read and I could not put it down. The love story that is told is unreal!"},{"Title":"Twice Loved","review":"This book is a real disappointment. I wanted so badly for it to be good but that was not so. The book just moves very slowly. I had to really push myself to keep reading. I hoped that it would get better towards the end but that didn't happen. I have read quite a few of Lavyrle's books and this was the first that I didn't thoroughly enjoy. I recommend all of Spencer's books if you're looking for a good romance. But I only recommend this one if you have a lot of patience! It's a slow one."},{"Title":"Twice Loved","review":"A fun read, the flashbacks are the most enjoyable part of the book. Get this book if you're looking for an entertaining New England romance."},{"Title":"Twice Loved","review":"I have read this book 5 times in the past 12 years. It has such a chemistry between the 2 main characters written so well that you can feel the passion in your own heart. Truly one of the best by LaVyrle Spencer. The author surely knew personally or researched very well the era & Nantucket Island to bring vivid details to life of that community. Every character complimented the story."},{"Title":"Twice Loved","review":"I first read this book years ago in paperback, and loved it. Over the years I read it several times, I think having lived in coastal Massachusetts all of my life I related to the history that was involved in the story line. I found the love story very poignent Laura not wanting to hurt either man as she loved them both and the men not wanting to hurt the other as they were best friends. I was thrilled when I got my Kindle Fire for Christmas to find out this was availabee for Kindle, it was the first book I bought."},{"Title":"Twice Loved","review":"Laura, Rye and Dan, three childhood friends who grow up together and live as adults in the same small town. Inevitably, as with all triangles, the girl must pair off with one boy, leaving one as the perpetual best friend.In Twice Loved, both men get the chance to love the woman when Rye is lost at sea. After making his way home, Rye finds out that Dan has taken his place in Laura's home. Naturally, chaos ensues, as Rye sets out to get Laura back. As you can imagine, Dan never really has a chance.The real stinker in the whole mess is Laura. I liked Rye a lot, and even Dan, who is a stick in the mud - they're both honest with each other and with themselves the entire time. Laura, however, clearly wants to be with Rye but laments over what this will do to her relationship with Dan. I never felt like she was honest with herself, or with us, the readers, the entire time. I can appreciate her struggle to make a decision between the two, but Spencer develops the plot in such a way that there really isn't much of a question on who Laura will end up with, and I ended up with absolutely no respect for the way Laura strung the other man along.The novel is a good one, with a well-developed plotline and fleshed-out characters; I just wouldn't include this in my 'favorites' because I only liked one of the three main characters."},{"Title":"Twice Loved","review":"I really enjoyed this book. When I read the description I was thinking Wow! This is going to be a good one & it sure was. The storyline was just incredible. I just can't imagine. My heart went out to all of them. The first half of this book was awesome but then I felt that it was kind of dragged out. I still enjoyed it but it was just a bit slow for me.This was my 3rd LaVyrle Spencer book & I love her style of writing. I would certainly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Twice Loved","review":"Everything about this book was very good until the end. The main idea behind the story (a woman loses her husband while pregnant with their first child and remarries only to discover he is still alive) is heart-wrenching and also convincingly played out. However, the ending is a huge disappointment. I won't tell you which choice she made (even though it is fairly obvious from the beginning what it'll be), but I will say that the story would have been much more powerful had she not put herself ahead of her child."},{"Title":"Twice Loved","review":"Imagine being loved by 2 men, and the sad part is you love them both, and now must choose one to stay with! In today's world, with e-mail and instant messaging, we cannot comprehend a time when there was no communication from loved ones, perhaps for years on end, especially when in the 1700's, a man went out to sea and maybe came back 2 or 3 years later. This is the story of a woman who is married to one man, who, she thinks has died at sea with his shipmates, and marries his best friend, only to find out 6 years later that he is very much alive, and still in love with her. Worse yet, she still loves him, and now must choose between the man who helped and comforted her thru her berievement, helped deliver her child, and wants her for his wife, and the man who she still loves and wants as her huband. A love story, written by a great writer..for those who want to be carried away to another time and place."},{"Title":"Twice Loved","review":"What do you do if you're told the husband you loved is dead, you're pregnant, finally marry someone else and then find out a few years later that your first husband is really alive? Who are you really married to? How do you factor in the feelings of your child, who's never known his biological father and loves his step-father? (Since you find out very early in the book anyway, I'll share that Laura's first husband was stranded on an island for a time after suffering an illness aboard a whaleship.)I could sympathize with all three of the main characters...I didn't agree with everything they did, but that doesn't preclude sympathy."},{"Title":"Twice Loved","review":"Well, I really do like Lvyrle Spencer as a writer. I feel she has a unique style and can also be quite humorous at times. This book, however, was not one of the ones that I would put in my top 10. At first I couldn't put the book down. The idea was great. A woman who suppossedly loses her husband to death. Then she marries his best friend obviously out of convenience and gratitude. First husband then shows up five years later to reclaim wife, home and child he never knew he had. I thought \\"hey this is going to be good.\\" But, then the book just dragged on and on. There was just no umph to it. I mean it was pretty obvious who Laura was going to pick from the beginning. And I kept wondering to myself what was it that she had that made these two men fall in love with her since she was a young girl. One thing that I truly had a hard time swallowing was when Laura told Rye that once she had made the decision to leave Dan for Rye they wouldn't dishonor Dan while she was still married to him. HELLOOOO!!!! News Flash!!! SHe already dishonored him because she had already snuck out and slept with Rye while she was still married to Dan. Frankly, the end was just to boring for me. I found myself skipping paragraphs just to hurry up and finish the book. You'll be better off taking this book out of the library than spending hard earned money on it like I did."},{"Title":"Twice Loved","review":"You cannot go wrong with any book by Spencer. I have read all of them and most of the twice. Terrific writing."},{"Title":"Twice Loved","review":"but I didn't. I have read several Lavyrle Spencer books and loved every one of them except this one. It didn't hold my interest and I felt nothing for the characters."},{"Title":"High Tide of Intrigue (Caribbean Writers)","review":"Trinidadian writer Anthony has some fifteen novels to his credit, and with this entry in Heinemann's commendable&quot;Caribbean Writers Series&quot; he tries his hand at crime writing. Things start promisingly enough as we meet Maureen, a police officer whose irrationally jealous husband abuses her. The situation is exacerbated because he is a prominent member of an anti-narcotics unit, and she recently found marijuana in his pockets. The story appears to set up Maureen as the heroine who will investigate her corrupt husband and bring down a web of drug dealers, but then it veers off to Grenada, where her sister Clarice lives. Most of the book takes place in Grenada and alternates between Clarice's suspicions of her prosperous brother in law, and the clumsy plotting of the drug smugglers. Only at the very end does Maureen reappear, but by then the story has lost all energy and momentum and it's hard to care about the outcome. The main problem with the book is that the vast bulk of it is comprised of conversations between people who don't trust each other, which rapidly gets boring. There are a great deal of peripheral characters who are never developed, and the whole enterprise grows wearisome. Anthony does have a good knack for portraying the importance of family relationships among islanders, but the story itself leaves a great deal to be desired."},{"Title":"Bhagavad Gita: Annotated & Explained (SkyLight Illuminations)","review":"In my experience Kendra Crossen Burroughs is one of the best editors in the field of Eastern spiritual literature and texts. As well as working freelance, she has been a long-term editor on the staff of Shambhala Publications, and I was happy to have her involved in a book that I had published by Shambhala, although not a book in Eastern thought.I was very excited when I heard that Kendra was doing this book for Skylight Paths, since the Gita has been one of my, and many other people's favorite and most important spiritual sources, and I eagerly looked forward to its appearance. If I wasn't one of the first people in the world to buy a copy, at least I was one of the first on my block.I was not disappointed. If I was, I would have never written this review. A blurb on the cover by renowned authority, Ken Wilber, says, &quot;The very best Gita for first time readers.&quot; This is one of the rare occasions when a blurb is absolutely true. But, the further truth is that Burroughs's annotations make this a book for the experienced reader of the Gita as well. Burroughs has consulted and used over twenty other translations in her annotations to this particular translation that she uses, the 1935 one by Shri Purohit Swami, and this scholarship, plus Burroughs' own personal experience, make this a valuable book for a reader of any degree of experience.Besides Burroughs' own brilliant annotations, Skylight has done an innovative and equally brilliant job of format, where the annotations are on one page, and the reference text is on the facing page, so that the reader has the annotations right at hand as s/he reads, and does not have to thumb through to the back of the book or chapter to look them up. The only problem that I encountered with this was my own idiosyncratic one of whether to read the text page through and then turn to the annotations alongside it, or read each annotation as it is referred to in the text. I never completely settled this for myself. Other readers may want to read the annotation page first, and then read the facing page of the Gita text.As Burroughs notes, the Purohit translation is a good first time one, because he purposely set out to eliminate all foreign words of the Indian Sanskrit language, and uses only terms familiar to the Western, English speaking reader. For myself, however, who is not a newcomer to Eastern thought (though certainly not a Gita scholar at all), I am less happy with this choice. I want to know what the key Sanskrit terms are in the Gita text, which have a meaning and connotation that is at least somewhat different than the familiar English terms used. For example, in the famous and central verses (Ch 4: 7-8) where Krishna tells his disciple Arjuna about who he is and the reason for his periodic appearance in human history, the Purohit text has it, &quot;To protect the righteous, to destroy the wicked, and to establish the kingdom of God, I am reborn from age to age.&quot; The very Christian phrase &quot;the kingdom of God,&quot; could easily throw off the reader. The Sanskrit actually says, &quot;for the establishment of dharma,&quot; and thus it connects with the whole Indian sense of truth and untruth (dharma and adharma), more abstract and general, and later carried with such powerful effect into Buddhism. In 1935 &quot;the Kingdom of God&quot; might have worked better, but in our time, dharma says more, and more accurately to many of us. However, Burroughs' annotations corrects or overcomes a lot of these problems (but not in this case). So, where the Purohit text says (Ch 6: 23) that meditation &quot;should be practiced with determination and with a heart which refuses to be depressed,&quot; Burroughs explains that the actual Sanskrit term is &quot;chetas, a synonym for chitta (mind). In Indian philosophy , 'heart' is considered an aspect of mind, concerned with intuitive understanding and valuation.&quot; Gems like this of elucidation and clarification occur throughout the annotation pages facing the text.What reading this edition of the Gita has prompted me to do, in part related to my issue with the Purohit translation, is to now have three Gita's that I carry side by side, and compare them as I read in it--this one, Prabhavananda/Isherwood, and Nikhilananda's. Burroughs would be happy with this effect on me of her edition, and in this case would consider her work a success. And these three, are one more than the two translations of the Bible that I have on hand."},{"Title":"Bhagavad Gita: Annotated & Explained (SkyLight Illuminations)","review":"Kendra Crossen Burroughs has done a great service with the annotations of Sri Purohit Swami's classic translation of Bhagavad Gita, the Topmost Hindu Sacred Text. Not only is the translation unrivaled in its ability to communicate the universal message of God to humanity,but it is a joy to read and study thanks to clear English and an ability to prune down the additives of the original to a bare minimum. I was also thrilled to see that the annotations selected leaned heavily toward the recorded words of many of the primary exponents of Vedantic and Vaishnava philosophy in the West. The combination of crisp text and exquisite annotations makes this translation a must for all students of the Song of God. One only wishes that it was available as a hardcover.

Whether the story she relates of his life is 100% accurate I have no idea. She supposedly read numerous documents (many in the original Dutch) to piece together his life as far as she possibly could.Overall it is a good read and if you either have an admiration for Rembrandt or an artist and you are in the mood for a novel then you might as well give it a go. Some judicious editing may have been able to reduce the number of pages from 600+. The novel touches on, I presume, the major components of his life - from his childhood working in the family mill, an unfinished college degree, his yearning for painting, leaving Leyden to apprentice under Lastman in Amsterdam, his being discovered, his major works and the circumstances leading to their creation, his wives, children, patrons, etc.It makes for a good read - in the same mould as Van Gogh's \\"Lust for Life\\" by Irving Stone. Although the numerous references to breasts has me wondering about which team Schmitt played for.Schmitt, a poet and novelist, was a professor of english at Carnegie Mellon Uni in Pittsburgh.Again, just want to reiterate that the book might not be 100% accurate - afterall it is listed as a novel as opposed to a thesis."},{"Title":"Rembrandt: A Novel","review":"Historical fiction. Well written description of the times and culture of the Netherlands. Also, provided some insight to significance of his impact on painting. A good read if you enjoy historical fiction and are interested in the social and cultural attitudes of the times."},{"Title":"For a New Novel: Essays on Fiction","review":"Here is a collection of critical essays about the so-called New Novel, the quite frankly bizarre genre that sent shockwaves through the French literary community back in the '50s, as interpreted by one of its foremost practitioners. Anyone who found themselves gazing blankly at the pages of Robbe-Grillet's &quot;Jealousy&quot; will at least get a general idea of the New Novel from this book.As yet another literary technique based on the idea that we mere mortals cannot know anything for certain, the New Novel restricts itself to elaborate physical description (usually visual), disregards characterization in the traditional sense, and ignores symbolism altogether (because objects MEAN nothing, they just ARE). It also plays havoc with the linear time-schemes of conventional novels; if you're familiar with the jumping-back-and-forth plot of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (or if you've seen the notorious art-house film &quot;Last Year at Marienbad,&quot; which Robbe-Grillet wrote) then you're already aware of one of the New Novel's most distinguishing features. In sum, it tends to be deeply ambiguous and not a little confusing.Luckily for Robbe-Grillet, he's honest enough not to set himself up as a dogmatic theoretician. The definition of the New Novel, he claims, must be open-ended; the theory must interpret the fiction, not the other way around. Fair enough, I'd say. I think he's correct in claiming that novelists today can no longer write like the naturalists of the 19th Century; but I also doubt--as he optimistically says at one point--that we'll ever come to view the techniques of the New Novel as a &quot;normal&quot; form of fiction, against which other novels will be compared. The New Novel is just too WEIRD and, unlike, say, the novels of Flaubert, it is difficult to approach it unless you're already familiar with the theories and philosophical ideas it operates under. But then, theories of literature must always take a back seat to literature itself, which is why the curious reader might be better off tackling Robbe-Grillet's fiction first.&quot;For a New Novel&quot; can be safely ignored by the general reader, but it's worth a look for fans of the French avant-garde."},{"Title":"For a New Novel: Essays on Fiction","review":"This is an excellent translation of Alain Robbe-Grillet's 'Pour Un Nouveau Roman'. The original French is not easy to understand so this is a very useful translation for those whose French is less than perfect."},{"Title":"For a New Novel: Essays on Fiction","review":"Structuralism, post-structuralism, postmodernism, and every other &quot;post&quot; have made this work a bit obsolete.

Even the bad things that may have happened don't change names and dates. Let your kids know where their grandparents came from.

The book came speedily. It was in perfect condition including the CD in the back. Thanks again for everything."},{"Title":"The Organized Family Historian : How to File, Manage, and Protect Your Genealogical Research and Heirlooms (National Genealogical Society Guides)","review":"As every genealogist knows, as soon as you start to gather original documents and photocopies and family photos and correspondence and research notes, it begins reproducing secretly, at night, all by itself. Pretty soon, your two ring-binders have become a packed four-drawer file cabinet and you haven't seen your dining room table in months. Ann Fleming, president of NGS and a family researcher of wide experience, wants to save you from all that. The question is whether it takes an entire book to do it. She begins with all the reasons and ways you should organize your work and your results from the very beginning, including a discussion of file folders versus ring-binders, spiral pads versus a laptop computer or PDA, keeping to-do lists and a research notebook to focus you on the particular task at hand, and so on. Then she proceeds to the proper use of those basic research-tracking forms we all learned about in our first genealogical month: Pedigree charts, family group sheets, and research and correspondence logs. In the following chapters, she expands the discussion to more specialized forms and record-keeping methods, including those for federal and state census schedules, courthouse-type vital records, military records, wills and probates, land research, city directories, church records (though I'm not sure how such a diverse body of information can be handled on a standardized form), immigration and naturalization files, cemetery records and surveys, and school and medical records, among others. And all those forms appear as PDF files on the CD that accompanies the book. She recommends you write a research report to further focus you on what you hope to accomplish during a particular project or research trip, including an individual or family timeline, and she makes excellent suggestions generally on preparing yourself for that trip, whether to Salt Lake City or to a nearby rural county. (Yes, you really need to do a preliminary literature search and review what you already know.) The sections on how and why to care for family photos (don't just discard all those you can't identify), the necessity of a disaster plan (duplicate and back up your files in another location, one that will survive the next flood or tornado), and why you should have plans in place for the final disposal of all your work when you're no longer around.However, Fleming also spends far too much time providing discursive details (and many personal anecdotes) on the interpretation of all these records, which seems outside the scope of a book on organizing one's research. She includes thirty pages of detailed discussion of the questions asked on each of the decennial U.S. censuses, for example, plus several pages on the Soundex and Miracode systems, another sixteen pages of details on American wars, and a lengthy discussion of how to interpret the terminology found in marriage and probate records. Much of this is, by necessity, generic. (No mention is made of the peculiarities of Louisianian legal jargon, for instance, which is of particular interest to me and the other local researchers I know.) She tells you about the online Civil War Soldier System, recommends techniques for oral history interviews, reminisces about inheriting family heirloom furniture, discusses good courthouse etiquette, and describes the differences between microfilm and microfiche, the Register numbering system and how to conduct a cemetery survey. There's useful information on the national Interlibrary Loan program, the IGI, PERSI, and photo-enhancement software -- but none of it really belongs in this book.Finally, she goes into a certain amount of detail on organizing your information for publication, either in print or on the Web, but what she says actually applies to organizing your genealogical data for any purpose, and much of it repeats what she has said earlier. She even discusses style sheets for publishing and provides a chart of U.S. postal codes (the use of which actually should be avoided in publication). The problem here is that the subject of genealogical publishing requires another full volume in this series, not just the twenty-odd pages at the end of this one.In her attempt to be all things to all genealogists, Fleming never quite presents a single coherent system for organizing one's genealogical records and materials, either. I don't say she should have done so, necessarily. William Dollarhide and many others have developed and promoted their own schemes, all with good and bad points, and one understands that the series editor wants to appeal to the widest spectrum of possible readers - but when the advice is too general, its usefulness is greatly diminished. It might also have been useful to include tips for designing and developing one's own forms (perhaps by providing templates on the CD) for more specialized purposes, like the UK and Canadian censuses, German parish research, and transcribing ship lists.To one with experience in publishing, it's pretty obvious what has happened here: In order to keep all the volumes in this series roughly the same size (which can be sold at the same price), considerable extraneous information had to be added to what would have made a good fifty-page section in a different book. Perhaps this one should have been titled *Genealogy 201: Intermediate Methods in Genealogical Research and Organization*. It's a well-written and informative book, but it's simply not the book the title says it is."},{"Title":"The Organized Family Historian : How to File, Manage, and Protect Your Genealogical Research and Heirlooms (National Genealogical Society Guides)","review":"What a DISAPPOINTMENT! This book is NOT for you unless you are a beginner geneaolgist.

However, this book is SUPPOSED to be about \\"how to ORGANIZE, FILE, MANAGE & PROTECT YOUR GENEALOGICAL RESEARCH AND HEIRLOOMS\\" which is what the cover of this book CLAIMS it does. IT DOES NOT!For example, in the chapter about census records, there is NOT ONE iota of information about how to \\"file & manage\\" (as promised on the cover) the information gleaned from census records. The book only discusses what info is supposed to have been included in each of the census years and wholly fails to give one pointer about how to organize your census extractions -- it does not even discuss the pros and cons of organizing census extractions by year or by ancestor or by location much less how to transfer them to the computer.The author includes only one small chapter about protecting research and heirlooms and there is precious little information that is of any actual use. However, the author goes to great lengths to discuss why the diaries of our ancestors are so valuable and must be preserved --- but any genealogist worth her salt will know that already!This is a book for BEGINNERS ONLY!If you are looking for more than a beginners' book, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!My money was wasted because I was MISLEAD as to the contents and because I relied on the alleged reputation of the author!

When the female is a fairly close relative, I manage to remember the maiden name and cross-reference it to the married name. But what do I do with female relatives more than two generations back? (my mental limit). I'm not great at remembering computer-generated reference numbers. (And, my computer is not always on.) I need a way to track females based on names.

When Adam Hardesty enters medium Elizabeth Delmont's home, he finds her dead, her skull crushed by a poker. She is wearing a wedding veil and brooch with a broken pocket watch nearby stopped at 12 o'clock.The next day Adam visits Caroline Fordyce who attended a s&eacute;ance at the victim's home just hours before the murder occurred. He asks Caroline if she took a diary that belonged to the medium because he does not want secrets about his past to come out. Caroline insists she does not have it and fears her secrets will become known. She persuades Adam to allow her to join him on his investigation. When a second medium is murdered, the broken watch left behind at the crime scene has Adam's name on it. Caroline provides Adam an alibi. As they continue to make inquiries, they become lovers and try to keep the other safe struggling with the case.Amanda Quick is deservedly respected for her terrific Regency romantic suspense novels, but in WAIT UNTIL MIDNIGHT, the talented author switches settings to the Victorian era yet maintains high quality of her previous historical romantic mysteries. Her latest tale has a gothic feel to the plot, but as expected the hero and heroine are likable characters whom readers will become absorbed in their investigation as much as their evolving relationship that ultimately turns to love, danger, and risk. Regardless of the time period, Ms. Quick provides a fabulous tale that seems always to land on the keeper shelf.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"Wait Until Midnight is another Historical Romance from Amanda Quick, penname of Jayne Ann Krentz. Her Quick books have been somewhat of a let down for this diehard JAK fan. She is formula whether in Contemporary JAK or the Historical Quick. A formula I adore, so I often forgive her things (such as a feel of word padding) I might not of another author. I have been reading her and have everything she's ever written and until the last five years I would call her books \\"Keepers\\". I'm not sure where the formula went \\"off\\", but it has in several of her books, especially her Historicals. After reading Wait Until Midnight, I am glad I waited until paperback release instead of hardback. It's not bad, and for any Quick/JAK fan it's a nice enjoyable visit to an \\"old friend\\". But the formula lacks it's usual JAK dazzle. She seems to hit and miss in the 2000's. One powerhouse novel such as JAK's Falling Awake, then a so-so. This is the so-so. Enjoyable but soon forgotten.It has all the right Quick elements, just the mix doesn't gel with the perfection of other JAK novels. Adam Hardesty comes into Caroline Fordyce's life, dark, dangerous and meaning business. He's on the trail of blackmailer, who has turned murderer - or possibly a murderer who kills a blackmailer and intends to pick up blackmailing. Adam is determined to find out which and put a stop to the threat to his family. Caroline is the only link to the murdered Elizabeth Delmont, a medium in Victoria's England. The diary with holds the threat to Adam's siblings is missing from the dead woman's home, and the only clues left behind - the corpse was wearing a wedding veil and a brooch pocket watch. Nearly crushed in the killing blows from a poke, the watch is stopped at 12 o'clock. The trail leads Adam to Caroline, since she was at the seance the night of Delmont's murder. Caroline, too, is hiding secrets so Adam's forceful presence alarms her, despite the man himself intriguing her.Soon a second medium is murdered, with a broken watch left as a clue on the scene. Only, this watch has Adam's name on it. Fortunately for Adam, Caroline provides him with an alibi. The mismatched duo of opposites attract (typical of all JAK heroes and heroines!) join forces to solve the murders, remove the threat to their families and fall in love along the way.Quick fans will enjoy this, though will hardly call it a \`keeper'. It's a nice enjoyable read, that could have been improved by tighter editing to speed the pace. In the first 100 pages, Adam and Caroline are rarely in each other's company. Also, JAK needs to rediscover the passion in writing romance, not just turning out her next book. When she hits the target no one can touch her. This one is just a little right of bull's-eye. Not-devoted-fans, might want to give this a pass as they will be less pleased with this effort. If you have never read Quick before, I recommend reading any of her earlier Quick novels for perfection to see JAK at her prime."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"Caroline Fordyce writes sensational romance serials for one of the newspapers in London.

I am a huge fan and found this latest edition to be just what the doctor ordered for a night of fun, romantic reading. I liked everything about the book from the characters to the plot. I did not find it lacking and I really like it when there is nothing in the way of the hero and heroine getting together. I prefer to read about other circumstances outside the romance. I want my characters to have immediate chemistry and move forward from there. I dont' need suspense or guessing when it comes to them falling in love. Let the mystery come from other characters, throwing the hero and heroine together and in danger. But they should always trust eachother and stand up for eachother. This was definately the case with Wait until Midnight. When the time came to stand up for him, she didn't hesitate and he did the same for her. I liked Adam a lot. I liked his makeshift family.

As an enthusiastic reader of her previous books, I certainly hope not; however, this latest offering makes one wonder. Completely lacking the sparkle and charm of earlier Quick works like \\"Deception\\" and \\"Mistress\\", this book falls victim to recycled plot devices and stock characters. For example, readers are introduced to a pair of lesbian \\"aunts\\", the heroine is a virgin posing as a widow, and the heroine has a creative career....all ideas used constantly in her other books. Nor would I have a problem with the romance being secondary to the mystery, as indeed it is. Yet this romance is so uninspired and flat, it is not even remotely believable. Adam and Caroline seem to kiss in the first few chapters because that is what Amanda Quick charcters always do, and not because the reader feels there is any genuine desire between them. The rest of the love scenes are just plain boring and trite. Even Caroline's oppostion to marriage echoes that of a dozen of other Quick heroines. I am glad I just got this from the library and didn't waste my money on it--indeed, I think if you read this you will understand why it was released only as a paperback and not as a hardcover, because the hardcover expense would not be justifiable. Having said all this, if you have not read other Amanda Quick romances, please treat yourself to early gems like \\"Mystique\\" or \\"Mistress\\". These books, while light and quickly read (for those days when you want something light and quickly read) are witty, fun, and cute."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"Amanda Quick serves up more of her tried-and-true formula. An intelligent, spunky heroine, a stoic, strong and silent hero, a mystery with a little twist, and the requisite tender love scene. I admit I love the formula. Mainly because the heroine is intelligent and spunky and usually has an interesting occupation. In this case, Caroline is a serialised novel writer who has to invent a history for herself to escape a Great Scandal. There are some tender scenes between her and Adam as they share their respective checkered pasts. They are both likeable. The mystery trots effortlessly along to its conclusion, with a nice little twist. Of course, after a while, all the Amanda Quick romances tend to blend into one another, but they're very enjoyable in the process."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"Quick intoduces Caroline and Adam to each other in such a bazaar manner, that you see Quick's creativity and taste the ironical in a most entertaining way. This book is best enjoyed on the unabridged Audio CD, in case you missed it in the book. Quick deviates from her simple sweet humorous though quick paced style to murder, suspense and intrigue with a dash of humor. The development of this love affair has some unexpected twists in the plot and the actors on the audio CD portray the story with fast moving reality. This book is easily Listened To over and over. Its a fun book, a fun read."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"If you expect more than a love story reading don't read this book. If you want to read an 1800's year s&eacute;ance love story this is the one. No eerie or spooky at all, just a love story. This book is to relax and read. You'll never be thrilled by its story but it'll keep you reading all the time. Sometimes you'll want to read it and sometimes you'll want to watch TV. So I can say that you can take this book to the beach and read it there with a pi&ntilde;a colada.P.S. After you read this book you'll know why the bride wears a white gown on her wedding."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"I had read the mixed reviews here when I picked up the book. I have had very mixed feelings regarding her more recent works. I enjoyed the Paid Companion and sicee this wasn't part of the recent series, I picked it up, but I wasn't holding my breath. I loved this book. The begining was a littls slow going. But as the main characters got to know each other I really enjoyed the connection. I found myself smiling in the middle of it. I really liked that the mystery aspect was not overly obvious (although I was reading it as a romance novel, not a mystery, so I wasn't really trying to solve the mystery). I also liked that the mystery climaxed at the very end of the novel. My biggest complaint is that two of the characters are named Julia and Julian. Granted, these characters are never together and it isn't too confusing, but of all the names in the world to come up with it seems strange that they would do this. The psychic aspect of the novel was interesting. I loved learning the history of our hero and his unusual family. I loved Quick introduced us to some shady characters just to throw us off the real villian's trail. Good read. I am probably givig it such a high rating because I am pleasantly surprised after some of Quick's other, recent books. Some of my favorites from her past writing include \\"renvezvous\\" and \\"seduction.\\""},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"Amanda Quick has gone forward in time to the late Victorian era with her latest romance and she does a good job of it. Adam Hardesty and Caroline Fordyce each have secrets that could cause problems with their families if they were to be told. Adam is being threatened by a medium to keep his secret. When the woman is discovered murdered, Adam has only one lead and it leads him to Caroline Fordyce, author of serials in the tabloid newspapers. The two join forces to find the murderer and to protect each other, when another medium is murdered. The characters are multi-dimensional (though I miss the humorous aspects of earlier Quick books) and plot intricate. The identity of the villian is not apparent until the end. Overall, Quick has written an entertaining romance and an intriguing mystery."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"I love all of Amanda Quick's books so I'm not an unbiased reviewer.

Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"This was the first book I'd read by this author (under any of her many pen names!). So, with no expectations or comparisons to make regarding her previous work, I enjoyed 'Wait Until Midnight' as a good stand-alone romatic suspense story. While not a classic, it was an entertaining period piece, with many nods to the Victorian adventure yarns like those written by 'Mrs. Fordyce).Neither the mystery nor the love story aspects overwhelmed the plot, and while each of these had a mix of strengths and weaknesses, the book did its job as light entertainment. I'd look into the follow-ups to this novel by 'Amanda Quick', though I'll probably skip the 'Jayne Ann Krentz' library."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"I always eagerly await the newest Amanda Quick/J. Krentz books. They never fail to please. Such a light touch! While this one does not offer anything new, still an enjoyable read. Caroline and Adam are another great couple. The hardcover is available now from amazon.co.uk. (Come on guys, don't edit this out--it's all in the family.)"},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"A quick read - couldn't put it down. A bit of a hint of Amelia Peabody style to the characters."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"I'm sorry to all the fans of this author, but I've read a lot of romance novels, and this is at the bottom of my list. This is a very boring book, and the writing is pretty bad. The romance is as passionate as watching the grass grow. Just to sum it up, the book is so dry and not interesting that I skipped most parts. They only reason I've read this book is because I moved to a new place and didn't have any TV or computer or radio with me, and this was the last resort. Dry Dry DRY! I give it 2 stars because I'm sure with a lot of concentration, the book is bearable, but I just really didn't like it."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"This book was so bad I read it for sheer entertainment value. Whatever you do, get it from the library if you really want to read it. Her books used to be funny and sexy, with real heroines and plots. Not anymore. I read this hoping to get away from the continuing series, but it was just as bad. So many Startling Instances and really bad prose. Whoever this Harriet Klausner is, she writes reviews for every book and praises them. I think she works for the publishing companies, because it's really hard to find an awesome romance novel lately. If you're looking for real romantic suspense with curl your toes sex and an interesting plot, go get a Karen Marie Moning or Josie Litton book......Or even an old Quick book, like Rendezvous or Mystique."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"Circumstantial evidence points to Adam Hardesty being a medium's murderer. He turns to the one person who might have clues that could refute this idea, Caroline Fordyce, a young woman masquerading as a widow and hiding her career as a sensational romance writer. Initially, Adam's main appeal for her is as an anti-hero in one of her stories, but as they work together, it grows to more, on both sides. The intrepid pair follows rabbit trails and red herrings in search of true clues all across Victorian London, one step ahead of danger as they fall in love.* If you've read Ms. Quick's other books, then you basically already know everything that will happen. A mismatched hero and heroine unite to clear one's good name. At least one is encumbered by a set of loveable, eccentric relations, and both are hiding some terrible, in their opinion, secret that no one must know. Usually, the daffy relatives are more entertaining than in this book, and make it more interesting. Unfortunately, the eccentrics fall down on their duty this go round. *Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"This is one of Amanda Quick books that I really liked. I do enjoy most of her books. Loved both the hero and heroine in this one."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"Another hit by Amanda Quick. I couldn't help bursting out laughing in some of the the scenes at the beginning of the book. Caroline is one of my all-time favorite characters. The very first scene were Adam and Caroline meet is amazing. This book was a lot of fun to read although it did slow down in the middle. I loved Caroline's work as a sensation novelist. Love it."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"If you have read Amanda Quick under any of her pseudonyms, you will enjoy this book.For the uninitiated, this is a romance/suspense set in Victorian London. The main characters, Caroline and Adam meet shortly after the first murder occurs, and resolve to work together on solving the murder, even though this is most inappropriate for a woman to do. The book takes you through the color of London streets at all levels, from that of prostitutes through the aristocrats, and it seems that both Caroline and Adam have secrets that they need to hide from the public, and also from each other.But there is a spark, as there generally is in Quick's writing, and within 100 pages, the two have exchanged their first, very hot, kiss. It seems that these two are meant for one another, once they sort out their feelings, but there is still a murder to resolve.It is hard to tell much more without spoiling the surprises. I really enjoyed this book, and if you enjoy historical fiction with a romantic flair, you will too."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"Wait Until Midnight by Amanda Quick is sort of like a cup of hot chocolate on a cold night. As a widow, Caroline Fordyce can get away with doing a lot of things socially unacceptable for a Victorian era woman, including writing serial mysteries. The character's natural independent nature is a refreshing change from the dependent, provoking and quarrelsome wannabes that too often find their way into romance novels.As the member of an old and revered family, Adam has to hide most of what he does from polite society. What's surprising about this character is his honesty. He may hide things about himself from outsiders, but he doesn't hide things from the people that matter to him.When the murder of a psychic brings them together they soon learn that neither of them are what they seem. In this tale everybody has secrets and the secrets say a lot about who they really are. There are some twists and some surprises, but overall it's the character's courage to be who they are and the unquestioning support of their families that gives the story body. Like hot chocolate, it's not outrageously exciting, but satisfying just the same."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"I bought Wait Until Midnight in the form of an audiobook. I highly recommend doing so as the reader, Anne Flosnik (in my opinion) made the novel so much more enjoyable. The main characters, Caroline and Adam were likable enough, but if I had bought the actual novel to read, I wouldn't have finished it as the story and romance were a bit mediocre. Listening to Ms. Flosnik made it more interesting and gave it some edge so for that, I gave it 4 stars. So I will be picking up more of the Amanda Quick novels in the form of audiobooks. This is definitely a good book to listen to."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"Weak, boring, annoying, false notes galore, a complete absence of character development, no chemistry, no tension, simplistic, stale, formulamatic.I did NOT enjoy this book and had to force myself to finish it. Perfectly wretched."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"This one just missed the mark for me. Probably a little too much \\"supernatural\\" stuff. And while the main characters were mostly in the business of debunking those psychics, it still left a little too much wiggle room for me. I did like the characters, and it kept me reading - but I wouldn't say it was her best work. I was a little disappointed, considering some of the other books I've read by her. Overall it was a good book with a decent plot - and if you like psychic shenanigans in your romance novels, this would be the book for you."},{"Title":"Wait Until Midnight","review":"Amanda Quick (the pen name of Jayne Ann Krentz) writes historical mysteries that are light on facts and heavy on story. She is of the minimalist school, and \\"Wait Until Midnight\\" is as grounded in the late Victorian period as Quick's previous books were in the Regency, which is to say not much. In fact, if you didn't know, they could have taken place in the same year, so similar they are in its preoccupations with the Quality, its balls, its carriages, maids, and romances.In \\"Wait Until Midnight,\\" Caroline Fordyce supports herself and the two aunts who raised her by penning \\"sensational\\" novels for a newspaper. While researching the spiritualism craze for her next work, she encounters Adam Hardesty, who's hunting for a diary that reveals his family's secrets. His trail crosses Caroline's as well as two mediums, one of who is found murdered, wearing a wedding veil and found beside a crushed watch, its hands stopped at midnight.Where Quick excells is in her plotting, throwing in curves that freshen the standard story. Caroline is a popular writer with a secret past, and who masquerades as a widow but in reality a virgin. She is pursued, first as a suspect, then as a lover, by Adam, the brooding, virile hero who lives by his own rules, but is startled, then discomforted to discover that she's been strip-mining his personality to create the villain of her latest penny dreadful.Given these limitations, Quick keeps the plots spinning, the romance heated, and manages to come up with an appropriately creepy climax."},{"Title":"Theories for Direct Social Work Practice","review":"This text book is great and I needed it for my class.

It was out-of-date when it was produced and it still is.Possibly the only value this item has is for its historical interest of 1970s era self-help and 1960s era holistic psychobabble that was the forerunner of the 1980s &quot;inner&quot; malarkey that passed for socio-communication theory.No author should still be making money on something like this."},{"Title":"First Impressions: Successfully Presenting Yourself","review":"Apparently this thing is still in print.As aholdover from the touchy-feely 70s exercises in bad Interpersonal Communication classes, this might be valuable historically to see how far the discipline of communication has come.

I have a sort of connection with Lavender. There was one part, especially, where she is described wearing a long black skirt wit slits on the side, with the long boots, and Gothic top, and that is an outfit that I've always wanted to own, but unfortunately couldn't find the exact skirt anywhere. I feel her loneliness sometimes, and that is something I can relate too.I always love the \\"Gothic\\" feel and this book does well with it. The writing style, gorgeous!

First, they fight their feelings, then get closer to each other, then spend the obligatory night in bed with almost nothing happening ... Just want to hold you ... But, the end dawning, they finally and fully fall for each other and commit themselves and have mind-blowing sex.Unfortunately the character of super rich Lynn Gregory who poses as a plain waitress and band leader but in truth is a financial analyst (the bitchy successfull type) is a bit too unbelievable. The readers of such books, however, are willing to deal with only a bit of unbelievable. That's why the three stars. I would have given another star for more plot, actually. Almost all of the story is about how they almost sleep with each other."},{"Title":"Risky Investment","review":"I'm always scared to try new authors. You either love them or hate them. But when you've read through most of the big names and you need new material, you venture out.I'm glad I did for this book. I don't think I've EVER read a more romantic book in any genre. The author takes her time building up the two characters relationships. Their romance is verbal and physical, hot and sexy all at once. The situations they find themselves in are new and interesting. It's not your usual banter either.I highly, highly recommend this book. I hope Beth Moore writes s'more."},{"Title":"Risky Investment","review":"This one has been sitting on my \\"to be read\\" bookshelf for a long time. On a recent long weekend, I dug back into some of the older ones in my library and started reading. This is one of those I wish I had read sooner. The story is great and the characters are wonderful.Outrageously successful investment analyst Lynn Gregory completely changes her life after finding her long-time, college professor partner in bed with one of her students. To top it off, it seems Lynn's friends had known about the frequent infidelity, but chose not to tell her. All of this has made Lynn untrusting of her life, so she packs her clothes and moves to a simpler life. She buys a restaurant - a place where she works as a waitress, but the other employees don't know she's the owner. She owns a small home that she shares with Matt, a local mechanic. She now drives a simple pick-up truck instead of a BMW. She also is alone. Her only companionship is one-night stands.Matt, completely in the closet from is parents, is in a quandary. His parents are coming for a visit to meet his fianc&eacute;. Of course, the otherwise openly gay Matt doesn't have a fianc&eacute;, so he convinces Chris to play the part. Chris is a stranger, and a struggling college student whose car breaks down - only to find its way to Matt's garage. While training her about his life, the straight Chris begins to have strange thoughts and feelings about Lynn. At the same time, Lynn finds Chris hard to resist. The development of this relationship is slow and cautious, but both Chris and Lynn's thoughts are steamy as they contemplate possibilities for their future. With all this, Matt's parental problems seem to fade into the landscape.I highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"Risky Investment","review":"Don't get this stuff confused with the Beth Moore that writes studies and Biblical things...it's not."},{"Title":"Risky Investment","review":"I enjoyed this book very much.Don't be discouraged by the idiot jesus freaks who are too stupid to read the author's bio on the back cover.If you enjoy relationship drama, try this book."},{"Title":"How to Be a Great First-Time Father (How to Family Series)","review":"I have been sorely disappointed with what is available for fathers-to-be. This book is the best example of why I have given up on finding a book written specifically for men. It is overly simplified and virtually devoid of useful commentary beyond the painfully obvious.Moreover, it appears that the author has an incredibly negative view of men -- apparently presuming men are slobbering morons, interested only in football and beer rather than their pregnancy/baby. This is exemplified by the section entitled -- and I'm not kidding here -- \\"why you shouldn't sleep with your babysitter.\\" Give me a break.Skip this terrible book and try The Expectant Father: Facts, Tips, and Advice for Dads-To-Be by Armin A. Brott, Jennifer Ash. While The Expectant Father is a little too focused on the emotional well-being of the parents, it is much more informative and -- dare I say -- mature than How to Be a Great First-Time Father. Beyond that, I recommend those that aren't necessarily geared for men -- e.g., What to Expect When You're Expecting.If some skilled professional is reading, make note to self: Write Intelligent Book For Dads and Dads-To-Be.In preparation for your newborn, try the following that are wonderful: The Baby Book: Everything You Need to Know About Your Baby from Birth to Age Two, by William Sears, Martha Sears.

(The slipcover is also lovely -- I wish I had it as a poster!) The writing is workmanlike and shows that the author's first language is not English, but it does the job. For the casual reader, though, the technical detail may be too much.One gripe: the paper is a glossy bond that smudges and holds fingerprints something awful. This would have been fine for the photo pages, but *all* the pages are like that.All in all, a good book and a much-needed addition to any space-lover's bookshelf."},{"Title":"Mission Jupiter: The Spectacular Journey of the Galileo Spacecraft","review":"An interesting look at the space program from a non-american source, that gives the reader a text free of the usual &quot;national&quot; chauvinism (and a little bit a German-centric comments!).But, most of all, it's an excellent source of information about the Galileo probe, from its 1970 original concepts to its long-delayed launch (which makes you wonder if NASA really cares about science). You will also find an excellent (and, of course, premature) synthesis of what we thought we knew about Jupiter and its moons, and what we think we now know...Even though this english edition has been revised since the original 1998 German release, especially about Europa, you can expect most of its scientific content to be outdated in a few years from now... but, no, you shouldn't wait for another book, because the Viking probes, 25 years after their mission, are still giving up some secrets about Mars. So you can expect a few decades of data mining before having exhausted the information locked up in the Galileo database.Enjoy your trip!"},{"Title":"Mission Jupiter: The Spectacular Journey of the Galileo Spacecraft","review":"Galileo is probably one of the most significant NASA missions since the Voyager pair. Here, Fischer covers both the background and the latest findings (as of presstime, anyway) of the mission.The background is copious but appropriate, covering prior missions such as Pioneers 10 and 11 and the aforementioned Voyagers, as well as a brief history of Jupiter astronomy, going clear back to Galileo himself and his discovery of the moons of Jupiter.The history of the mission is covered in detail, from conception through to execution with all its trials and tribulations. Bumps in the road such as the mission rescoping following the Challenger disaster and the failure of the primary antenna are covered thoroughly with no punches pulled.Findings are covered, fortunately, in topical order rather than in chronological, with sections devoted to each of the major moons as well as Jupiter itself.The book is translated from the German, though despite this it's consistently clear and easy to follow. There are at least two occasions when a wrong word is clearly used, however, once where &quot;degrees&quot; is used instead of &quot;astronomical units,&quot; and another I simply didn't understand. But this is just one of my necessary quibbles, and overall the book is impressively readable.

She later became a very successful evangelist, preaching to both black and white audiences all over the United States, as well as in England, Liberia and Africa. Fame on that scale in that field would, of course, be rare for an African-American woman even in today's society. In the face of the social obstacles she faced in the late 19th century it was surely nothing short of miraculous.Her autobiography is, of course a real autobiography. They didn't often have \\"ghostwriters\\" in those days. Her style of writing is easy to read but intelligent, articulate and piercingly insightful.She writes about encounters with racism, sexism and class distinctions among African-Americans with a rare combination of uncompromising integrity, wisdom, humor, tact and graciousness. She writes about holiness and theological issues within the context of her own personal experience with God in a way that is compelling and inspirational.The autobiography of Amanda Smith is a remarkable telling of a remarkable life. She is an undiscovered American treasure. Her book ought to be a perennial bestseller."},{"Title":"An Autobiography The Story of the Lord's Dealings with Mrs. Amanda Smith the Colored Evangelist","review":"I just finished reading the biography of Amanda Smith. I found this book to be a faith building testimony of God's faithfulness and sufficiency, to all who will only trust Him both for spiritual and temporal provision. In today's complicated secular society and even in the organized church, Amanda Smith's testimony rises up in a refreshing way to glorify the Lord and teaches us that God's ways are still pure and simple, easy for anyone to understand and full of goodness and mercy, if only we would humble ourselves to hear what the Lord is saying to us, in His Word, the Bible.

The price for this tiny book is not correspondingly tiny. More to the point, the book is a quickie impulse-buy type book, made up entirely of very brief (one- to several-sentence) quips, comments, witticisms, and pieces of advice about men's style, three or four of these to a page. Some of these tips are helpful, though the entire text is heavily pervaded with Esquire's, or the authors', elitist attitudes, the assumption seeming to be that every man has it within his means to buy a $1,000, or even a $500, suit. What I had wanted (and expected to find here) was a book comprised of traditional text and chapters that would go into detail on the subject of men's clothing and style.

But for summarizing the things a man shouldn't do, getting him to actually start thinking about style, or saying things that really need to be said (\\"No level of fitness justifies wearing a tank top in public\\" [p. 80].), this little guide is a pretty good way to get started.Perhaps in keeping with the entertaining bulldog photos that break up the text, some of the declarations are somewhat too dogmatic: No cowboy boots, no Hawaiian shirts, no pleated khakis. In fact, there's some room for discussion on most of these issues (what if you live in Hawaii?). But frankly, so many men need so much help dressing properly that if they need absolute rules to live by, so be it.On the whole, this is a very entertaining little book. If men turn to magazines likeEsquire (2-year)for their style guidance, then I wish a handy primer like this one all success in imparting a few guiding principles.

There is an average of 4 such phrases per page (&quot;The Hawaiian shirt: no&quot; or &quot;Expensive shampoo smells really good&quot;) x 150 pages = 600 common sense proverbs in all.

You are not getting an overview of principles that would go into an appropriate men's wardrobe.That said, this book would be perfect for women who want to send their boyfriend/husband a subtle hint (and have them laughing along the way). Great pointers on everything from how to buy a high quality suit to avoiding fashion faux pas. The writing is engaging and hilarious. (With books, I'm a juggler. I never finish a book in one sitting, as I did with this one.)Well worth the [money] I spent!"},{"Title":"Esquire's Things a Man Should Know About Style (Things a Man Should Know)","review":"This is an extremely quick read. I read it in about two hours, and I think I read it pretty slowly.You'll like it if you've ever read any of the style sections in Esquire--it's written by an Esquire editor, and it's written in the same type of formal, aloof, and arrogant tone that Esquire is written in. So, if you've got a question as far as whether or not you'll like it, just thumb through an Esquire at the bookstore. If you like it, you'll like this...if not, then you won't.Here's an exerpt I liked: \\"For those still contemplating the wearing of funny underwear, think: When you are removing your pants for the viewing pleasure of another, do you really want the person to laugh?\\"It's a really good way to familiarize yourself with the \\"rules\\" of style very, very quickly. It's not an exhaustive guide that will really teach you anything.And, it's a tad dated. Boxer briefs are the in thing now, baby!Also, the pictures of the dog are funny. The dog shows you what not to do."},{"Title":"Esquire's Things a Man Should Know About Style (Things a Man Should Know)","review":"It'll take you about 20 minutes to read the book from cover to cover. If all the tid-bits, tips and info were typed end to end you could fit the whole book on to a page and half of 9x11. The authors assume that men either can't or don't like to read - so they take a sort of short hand approach to their content. Even more irritating than the lack of substance is that there is no order to the book - it's just a random scattering of one-liners. A simple index or table of contents would have tripled this book's usefulness. As it is you'd have to take notes or create your own table of contents if you wanted to use it as any sort of guide. It's good for a browse through once a in a while just to remind yourself of some style basics... but for someone who really wants a comprehensive guide for men - keep looking."},{"Title":"Esquire's Things a Man Should Know About Style (Things a Man Should Know)","review":"Esquire Magazine has long been a fantastic resource for men looking for tips on style; this great little book is full of accurate, useful and classy tips that can help any man improve his image.

It certainly doesn't go in-depth, but it gives you the average person some good, basic principles of style. It gives the person who can't afford to shop anywhere other than TJ Maxx or Marshall's a decent education on what to buy and how to put it together. I think this book is worth every penny."},{"Title":"Esquire's Things a Man Should Know About Style (Things a Man Should Know)","review":"What makes this little book so good--and so original--is its voice and style and humor, which are perfectly in keeping with Esquire magazine's 70-something year history of offering sound advice to real American men. It's as much a collection of humorous axioms as it is a guide to dressing, which makes the topic easily and enjoyably digestible--and you have to love Pedro the bulldog that models the clothes. Yes, as some reviewers have noted, it's a quick read (wait: that's bad?), but the shelves are already sagging with self-important books that purport to be encylopedic guides to fashion, and how many men have time to sit down and read an encyclopedia? Amazon's page clearly indicates this book's compact size and modest price--I mean, how big a book do you want for ten bucks?. I found it an absolute hoot, and I gave it to both of my brothers for Christmas--who, in turn, bought it for their college-age friends. Two thumbs up from San Fran.

I laughed the whole way through this breezy read on men's fashion--what to do, what not to do, and how badly so many of us do it. The sensibility is thoroughly modern, yet classic. It's a collection of advice, tips, legends, all delivered in a soundbite style that's perfect for the times (and, if I may say, the bathroom). Furthermore, it's got the decades-worth of Esquire magazine's knowledge behind it-and it's compact and inexpensive. Women, your men need this book!

Then this tiny book of sharp, smart comments on everything from cowboy hats to indian shoes is for you. Its observant and witty comments not only give you an idea of what should be in your bag for that business trip next week, but an idea of what and why (and most importantly when)it is ok to be seen in public in a garment (or lack of). This book, though is good for the expert or uninitiated alike, does not tell you how to tie a knot, for that you need to go elsewhere (thin side over left shoulder, one way around, over and into the loop, pull and adjust. There. Don't go anywhere else). Get this book."},{"Title":"Esquire's Things a Man Should Know About Style (Things a Man Should Know)","review":"I'm a jeans and T-shirt guy who was curious if there was something deeper under the paper-thin skin I imagined I could see covering what passes for men's \\"fashion\\", and maybe looking for some simple pitfalls to avoid in buying suits, for example. If this is what you want this book for, you probably only want one book (at most) about this kind of crap and that book should probably be Alan Flusser's Dressing the Man. Really, though, as underscored by the constant stream of aphorisms in books like this stating exactly the opposite, fashion is nothing if not fickle and ephemeral. With this in mind if you get all geeked out about what you are wearing, go to the web for your info, not a coffee table book. Only modern visual art, and at a more mass market level, the last couple of decades in the liquor industry, have reached the embarrassing and brazen level of of sneeches-with-stars up-pricing of label and buzz over substance that designer clothes aspire to. I have to say to put this review into context that I'm still constitutionally uninterested in fashion in every way despite taking a passing poke at it out of curiosity, so if you're crazy about fashion already this review is not for you it's for a different audience, although I suspect that the breathy tone of this book (think Cosmo sex tips) won't really fly your kite either, and as mentioned above probably the web is where you want to live not in a book in this case. Tangent: If like many guys your detour into giving a crap about clothes is motivated by your only civilizing impulse (as Harold Bloom would have it), something to do with impressing the ladies, I haven't thought deeply about it but I'd submit here that the relevant question on window dressing like what you're wearing might be \\"which ladies\\", see for the parallel argument but in linguistics not outfits, flayed wide open, David Foster Wallace's Harper's article \\"Democracy, English, and the Wars Over Usage\\", and note then that if this is true then no generally prescriptive book like this one has a chance in hell of being useful to you; it'd be the clothes equivalent of telling someone going on a date to trim their nails and comb their hair i.e. useless.Summary: If you're a regular guy not a fashionhound, not for you. Hack magazine writing repackaged into a bound edition. Get Flusser."},{"Title":"Esquire's Things a Man Should Know About Style (Things a Man Should Know)","review":"I think this book is puffery at its best. Some of the advice is very pedestrian and even a bit cocky (in an effort to be amusing). Most men who have any real style at all -- or know anything about clothes -- will find it boring. Speaking of boring, has anyone seen the suits that are featured these days in ESQUIRE? Tight-fitting rigs that show a big belt buckle, too many buttons, tight legs, and probably being worn by some young guy with a three-day growth. Experts on style? There are far better books on classical, quality dressing than this mediocre, eight-year-old rhubarb. Save your money."},{"Title":"Esquire's Things a Man Should Know About Style (Things a Man Should Know)","review":"This book merely reiterates the arcane belief that male fashion should be defined by a repression of all creativity. This is a sexist belief that I strongly believe we need to leave behind with the Twentieth-Century.Anthropologists are beginning to realize how our world would be a much safer place if only men felt more free to express themselves and their feelings. I don't think that it would take a genius to realize how the limited-expressiveness in male \\"fashion\\" is related to the limited-expressiveness of male life in-general in this society.In an age when men are *finally* beginning to break free of this fashion slavery, the last thing we need is a booklet full of conservative rants deisgned to turn-back the clock, disguised as fashion advice.

Having followed Equire's mission to educate men in sartorial style--not fashion--over several decades, I could not help wonder whether this book is a reflection on mens' loss of attention span or that of the authors. First, the pluses: the book is short (nominally, 152 pages; given the white space, about 65); reads quickly (if it takes you over an hour, you fell asleep); and wit (&quot;Shaving does not require so much foam that your face resembles a meringue pie&quot;). The minuses: zero historical context and questionable advise; e.g., [Re rings] &quot;Silver or platinum or white gold, not yellow gold&quot;(One cannot be well dressed wearing a gold wedding band?).

The booklet accompanies an entire set of Masterlife (by the same author) that is sold separately for group or individual discipleship. While the Masterlife booklet is for touching the word every day, the whole series is meant for in-depth study and spiritual growth that takes about a year to complete. Having done the whole series in the past means that I have encountered the impact of the thoughtfully written Masterlife series and can attest to its effectiveness. Over time, it has helped me make mindful choices, encourage a disciplined Christian life-style, and been foundational to all further learning. Each week I could reflect on my choices and write about what I learned. Each week I could look back on how I treated myself and others and whether or not I acted in love.I bought the Masterlife Day by Day because my first booklet is full and I wanted another. I like the format. I like how it helps me focus my mind and spirit on God's will for today. And it helps me endeavor to be wise with my resources and cautious with a natural tendency to speak too quickly and judge too freely. This tendency needs all the help it can get and the devotionals head me in a mindful direction over the long haul."},{"Title":"Race Against Love","review":"This is a soft romance that is timeless, especially for the reader who also has a love affair with horses.

I found that the author worked harder to bring out Jefferson the man in this volume... maybe because of the actions of others, (Burr and Marshall), but it is apparent that the author worked hard on this volume.Jefferson sponsors the Lewis and Clark Expedition, Congress gives Jefferson a little slack, but Arron Burr takes the domestic heat. The Barbary pirates are delt with, but the political views of Jefferson and Marshall heat up to a boiling point. But, Jeferson's second term seems to hit a nadir and he is longing for his Virginia mountain top home where he can finally retire after forty years of service to government.I found the scholarship to be impeccable, balanced, seemly sympathetic. The overall narrative is detailed and at times engrossing and engaging. Even though we can see Jefferson's excitement with the Lewis and Clark Expedition, we also see heartbreak with Burr and vituperation with Marshall.Overall, this volume brings us to one of the most interesting times of Jeferson's life... that of retirement. This is one of the most interesting of the volumes so far as we see Jefferson working out the problems that others have wrought upon him."},{"Title":"Jefferson the President: Second Term, 1805-1809 (Jefferson and His Time, Vol. 5)","review":"What can be said about this monument to Jefferson scholarship? I am sure that somewhere in universities around the United States there are &quot;scholar squirrels who want to put down this invaluable resource in Jefferson studies. It is always the way that mice attempt to gnaw at lions. This is not a perfect work (and my remarks refer to all of the books in the series as a whole), there are somethings, namely Sally Hemmings references which are wrong and will not sit well with American 21st century mores. There is the issue of slavery which was handled much differently 50 years ago than it is now.Jefferson is not worthy of our interest because of Sally Hemmings and because he kept slaves. Jefferson is great because of the Declaration of Independence and his fight for the rights of man. While it may have been hypocritical to preach liberty and keep slaves, it is doubtful that slavery ever would have been abolished if Jefferson had never gained the prominence that he did. This book and the others that follow show why we should continue to honor the public man even though his private side may have been wanting."},{"Title":"Jefferson the President: Second Term, 1805-1809 (Jefferson and His Time, Vol. 5)","review":"Dumas Malone (1892-1986) devoted his academic career to studying Thomas Jefferson, and this superbly researched volume reflects that lifelong scholarship. This book is one in a six-part series examining the life of our third President. I read this book for a college class and immediately grasped the unending pressures that President Jefferson faced in his second term. Malone examines the decision-making options available to Jefferson, usually (and perhaps too often) supporting the eventual route that the President decided upon. This volume's research and analysis is worthy of five stars, not to mention the 1975 Pulitzer Prize the series captured. Unfortunately, Malone's stilted prose - the weakness of most academic historians - produces a rather laborious read. Thus, four stars overall."},{"Title":"Jefferson the President: Second Term, 1805-1809 (Jefferson and His Time, Vol. 5)","review":"First time that I have ordered from this vendor and the book was in fantastic condition.

They also share one thing, they all contains false statements which must be identified before you can come with the correct solutions.If one needs assistance in solving a particular puzzle or type of puzzle, the hints section will be helpful. The solutions section presents considerations in solving each problem. For each puzzle, these describe an appropriate method to use to arrive at the solution. These will be helpful in solving puzzles of the same type.The stories that describes the situations associated with each puzzle are developed in the backwards, wrong-way, mixed-up Kingdom of Lidd.

It's much darker and more complex than when Lydia's telling the story and interesting in a different way."},{"Title":"Stone Quarry","review":"While I enjoy the Lydia Chin and Bill Smith series and think that each book has its own feel depending on whose point of view that book is told from, I found Stone Quarry an oddity in the series. It seems to be Bill Smith's book: he's at his uncle's cabin in upstate New York and is asked by an old friend to investigate what might be a burglary. This causes a run-in with a cop who hates Smith. A body turns up. More problems -- and it's clear that more than a burglary is involved. Eventually Lydia Chin arrives, but by the time she does, it feels like an intrusion: as if the novel was going in one direction with Smith, but then the author decided she needed to bring Chin into the picture. The story and movement of the book felt disjointed to me, as if it were parts of two different books put together. But, if you're a Chin/Smith fan, and if you like small-town or small-community settings, this is worth reading."},{"Title":"Stone Quarry","review":"This is my first Rozan mystery. It is a well-crafted mystery with richly portrayed characters. The main character, P.I. Bill Smith, is a chain-smoking, hard drinking man who also loves the quiet of the country and the peace of classical music. He is also quick with his fists, carries a weapon, and his missions propel him into near death encounters with nasties.If you like a fast-moving mystery that takes many twists and turns, you have found your read here."},{"Title":"Stone Quarry","review":"After reading \\"in this rain\\" I was ready to give up on this author, but \\"Stone Quarry\\" did redeem her in my view. It kept my interest entirely, enough that I hated to put it down at mealtime. maybe we need less of Lydia and more of Bill. Finished it in record time and now willing to try another by her."},{"Title":"Stone Quarry","review":"You can tell that this series is written by a native New York City person (?} because she keeps comparing the area (Schoharie up near Albany) to New York. Any native of \\"The City\\" will tell you that north of NYC is \\"Upstate\\" and east is \\"The Island\\", new york city is NEW YORK. Those other places are New York STATE, which is like Vermont or New Hampshire or better yet...Montana. For all intents and purposes, it's like the area behind your backyard that is owned by some conservation group and isn't anyplace you'ld want to go except to drive through or past it. Got That!As to the story, it's a typical 'Bill Smith', where he gets beat up more times than I can remember, but always ALWAYS gets up off the floor and gets to best the bad guys. The local cops are all hayseeds and couldn't get a job as a traffic brownie (Dept of Traffic) in NEW YORK. Bill is always ready to smoke a cigarette, drink a beer, race around like a NASCAR guy and still find time to practice a couple of Chopin etudes. Lydia is her 'gorgeous', intelligent, wise cracking inscrutable self at all times and never misses a beat.Even with all this the stories are still welcome and readable and enjoyable...just don't expect them to be plausible."},{"Title":"Stone Quarry","review":"The more you read the more you appreciate her writingBill Smith is the lead in Stone Quarry. Previously I had read only novels that put Lydia Chin in this role. The accomplishment here is that Rozan does quite a remarkable job of creating a wholly new ambiance when she skips from Chin to Smith. The Chin books kind of remind me of a modern day Agatha Christy while this Smith work falls under the hard tack noir of yesteryear. Stone Quarry is a bare-knuckle brawl that comes close to greatness but falls just short. One thing that I like about Rozan is her ability to work in a very complicated plot structure that pulls together through intricate evolution. But here, parts of this plot feel unnecessary and burdensome.All of my complaints aside, Rozan is an author that I would recommend to anyone. The closest authors that I can think of are either Dick Francis or the Kate Shugack series'. If you have read these authors and enjoyed them, I think that you will be in for a treat with Rozan"},{"Title":"Stone Quarry","review":"STONE QUARRY is terrific. I've been a Rozan fan for years -- love the alternating-voice thing -- and I have to say this book shows simultaneously a lyricism and a toughness beyond even what Rozan has given us before. Characters are real, setting so believeable you can feel the chill in the air. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Stone Quarry","review":"By reading the hype written by a lot of my favorite authors of mysteries and thriller about S.J. Rozan's latest book, &quot;Stone Quarry, I expected a lot from it. What I found though was somewhat entertaining, not at all informative, and wholly average.Bill Smith, private detective, and his on-again/off-again partner, Lydia Chin, are the stars of this current installment of an ongoing series. While vacationing in his deceased uncle's cabin in upstate New York, Smith becomes engaged in a what appears on the surface to be a simple burglary involving a reclusive artist who wants to remain anonymous but still recover some valuable paintings that were stolen from her. The situation devolves quickly into a fight to the death with local crooks who may-or-may-not have mob ties, along with some bought-off cops on the local force.While Rozan does an able job with telling this story, it follows a well-trodden path and ends in a place we've all been many times before. By the end of the story, I found myself being able to skip ahead without missing anything, which to me, says a lot about a book. While it appears that Rozan may have a huge following, she didn't gain a new one with me."},{"Title":"Stone Quarry","review":"I didn't like this book at all. Rozan cannot write about macho males, though there are many good female authors who certainly can. In addition, her attempt to put some mystery into the relationship between Chin and Bill Smith is weak--what is the relationship between them all about? Is Rozan uncomfortable trying to suggest it is sexual as well as business(private eyes). In addition, the character of Jimmy, Smith's nearly adopted charge, is terrible. Jimmy is the most obnoxious character I have seen in fiction in some time--and that's saying something. Every sentence he speaks has the expression (hey man!!) and two or three expletives included, regardless of who is around, and regard- less of the fact that Smith is breaking his back get him out of a jam. I was hoping against hope that he would be found guilty of all the crimes that were suggested he might have been involved in but, alas, to no one's surprise, he was clean!! WHAT A JERK!! Maybe Rozan should stick to female characters."},{"Title":"Stone Quarry","review":"My introduction to the work of S.J. Rozan took the form of a short story. After reading one or two of her novels, I was telling friends on the internet that this writer was a major talent, someone I believed would be a strong voice in mystery.With the publication of STONE QUARRY, the sixth book in Rozan's Lydia Chin/Bill Smith series, St. Martins Press has proved me right - but then, I knew that about the time that CONCOURSE, won the Shamus Award back in 1995. Rozan has not only developed a continually fascinating series, with fully developed characters, well-described settings (mostly in and around New York City), but she has successfully created a series with two distinct voices. In books one, three and five, Lydia Chin takes the narrative. She is a young, optimistic Chinese-American private eye who tries to balance the needs of her family and her own need to declare her independence and intelligence. The older, far more cynical private eye Bill Smith takes the lead in the other books. STONE QUARRY is, technically a &quot;Bill Smith&quot; book, while Lydia still participates. While Smith seems to fit the mold of he standard white guy p.i., he is anything but typical and is as interesting as his more &quot;exotic&quot; partner.In this dark mystery, Bill is in upstate New York where he's had a house for years - a place he retreats to. He's in town primarily to assist Eve Colgate, a somewhat reclusive resident who wants him to check out a theft, without reporting that theft to the police. He is as well known as anyone in the area, but still seen as an outsider; even when he helps someone, he's somewhat resented. There is corruption, there's the arrogance of wealth and small-town attitudes for Bill to deal with. He calls Lydia, who is clearly out of her element in this rural setting, but still insistent on helping her friend and some-time partner.STONE QUARRY continues an excellent series. It tells you more about Smith and Chin, two of the most intelligently drawn private eyes in modern day. Rozan, who won the Anthony for best novel for A COLDER PLACE, writes as effectively about this dark place as she does the bright lights of Chinatown and the upper west side and Brooklyn. The conflicts between Lydia's fairly upbeat attitudes and Bill's world-weariness only serve to highlight the way the two characters care for each other and keep each other balanced, keep each other from going off the deep end in either direction. This is truly one of the best mystery series available today - never a disappointment, cleanly, sharply written with warmth and wit and compassion, but the author never forgets to tell the story."},{"Title":"Stone Quarry","review":"Shamus winner S. J. Rozan tries something new: setting a book in upstate New York instead of New York City. The city was such a strong presence in the earlier books that I was afraid this one would be weaker, but it's a great read: atmospheric, dark and moving. Good plot, good characters, too. BTW, it's a Bill Smith book, so Lydia Chin fans, wait your turn."},{"Title":"Stone Quarry","review":"The setting is different in this book (rural upstate New York vs NYC) but in every other way this book is very similar to Rozan's other novels, which is a good thing. As usual, this is a very well-written book; Rozan obviously puts a good deal of thought and effort into her writing; she tries hard to describe things and people in a way that is fresh and that puts vivid images of the scene into the minds of the readers. The plot is complex and satisfying, which is one of the things that Rozan always does well that most of the current mystery writers do not. This series is made up of real, quality mysteries, in the tradition of Chandler, Hammett and Ross MacDonald; these are not thrillers masquerading as mysteries. There is a good bit of action here, though, and the ending is a real barnburner. My only quibble, and it is a small one, is that Rozan needs to either have Smith and Chin get together or have them decide to be strictly friends. The quasi-relationship that they have been in for several books now is starting to wear a little thin."},{"Title":"Stone Quarry","review":"Stone Quarry is one of S.J. Rozan's best books yet. The feel for the landscape, both natural and social, is particularly strong. The isolated rural county where the novel takes place really comes to life. The story grips you by the neck and propels you forward, and keeps you guessing until the unexpected but convincing end. In its twists and turns, the plot put me in mind of The Big Sleep. The narrator, Bill Smith, is a complicated, private person, and we learn a little more in this book about what makes him tick. Some interesting changes in the relationship between Bill and his partner, Lydia Chin-- Rozan handles this with a skillful, subtle touch. Another strong character is Jimmy Antonelli, a working-class kid in deep trouble who Bill has helped out before. Jimmy reminds me of some guys I've known-- a bundle of bravado and contradictions, caught between wanting to do the right thing, and internal and external pressures that push him in the wrong direction. Rozan herself goes in exactly the right direction with this novel, a story that slowly builds to a fast and furious conclusion."},{"Title":"Stone Quarry","review":"S.J. Rozan gets better with every book. I can't think of many writers with a more vivid sense of place: whether it's the kitchen of a dim sum palace in Chinatown, or a roadhouse in upstate New York, the settings of Rozan's novels, like her protagonists, are engaging and original. Bill Smith and Lydia Chin are rarities in the mystery genre: heroes with evolving inner lives, moral conflicts, and intelligent and humorous voices. Stone Quarry is Rozan at her best: it is wonderfully written and impossible to put down."},{"Title":"Stone Quarry","review":"Bill Smith returns in another winner by Shamus-winning S.J.

I probably enjoy the &quot;Lydia&quot; prospective a bit more because of the view into her Chinatown world, but the Bill perspective has always been satisfying. The author successfully works hard at breathing new life into what has been a very over-worked genre. She obviously likes her main characters which makes it easy for the reader to become attached to them also. I look forward to more books in this series since each one has gotten better and better."},{"Title":"Stone Quarry","review":"Rozan keeps getting better with every book.

In addition to providing elegant design ideas, the book gives invaluable &quot;general advice&quot; which should be read carefully: with a few simple tips our puff pastry hors d'oeuvres now rise evenly, and I must say look much nicer than any of the frozen things sold at gourmet markets. Next up: making our own pan de mie for canapes, which will of course require purchasing a Pullman loaf pan ... Be warned, this stuff is orders of magnitude above chips &amp; guacamole."},{"Title":"Pastry Hors d'oeuvres, Mini-Sandwiches, Canaps, Assorted Snacks, Hot Hors d'oeuvres, Cold Brochettes, Centerpieces for Buffets (The Professional Caterer Series)","review":"Do not let the title scare you off: if you need appetizers, finger food, whatever you want to call it; whether you are a high-volume private caterer or home cook needing to feed/entertain a house full of guests for the superbowl, this is your book.The great strength of this book: it does not require great culinary skill or experience to execute. It does require: patience, time, good ingredients, and a good attitude. Indeed, there are some recipes that are desultory at best, requiring the cook to either have other books for reference or experience to fill in the gaps. OTOH, it has a gazillion pictures, so there is never any doubt as to what the final product should look like. Course, the more manual dexterity, artistic talent, patience, efficiency, and organizational skills you have, the faster the job will go.For the home cook: yes, you can skip steps and substitute. You can dispense with the usual aspic; also with the butter-from-a-pastry-bag-with-a-really-small-star-tip. Your product does not need to be so neat and tidy; arranging the toppings with a spoon and paring knife is more than sufficient. Yes, you can substitute ingredients or omit them entirely; just make sure that the ingredients that you do use are top drawer, and everyone will think that you are a culinary genius. And: you can scale up or down the volume of stuff you make to suit the occassion; add more variety or quality as time and resources permit. You are the boss. The best part: these are all do-ahead recipes. You can prepare many trays of these tasty treats beforehand, perfect for parties and entertaining.For Professionals: this book is a must-have; just buy it and don't argue; you will understand when you start to flip through it. Ever gone to a wedding reception, charity affair, etc, and seen tray-after-tray of hors d'oeuvres of endless variety and quantity, and all tasting really good, and, really much tastier than the stuff that you prepare each night during dinner service? Well, this book will show you how. And, really, hors d'oeuvres really are not that hard to do, as long as you know which end of the knife to hold in your hand, and the boss has provided you with quality ingredients. IMHO, the selection of flavors is, well (how to say this charitably?) extremely personal to the tastes of the author. The varieties he presents are VERY far from being standard or conventional or anything else; the recipes herein are HIS tastes. Recommend that you treat the specific flavors as a mere starting point, so you can impose your own flavors and tastes, not to mention the specific quality ingredients that you can obtain locally.The puff pastry chapter (simple, filled, combination, pizza-gougeres-roques-monsieurs, mini tartelettes) might cause the home cook a few problems. There are no recipes of puff pastry or pie dough or instructions on how to handle and roll them or how to fill molds. There are some recipes for cream sauces, but no cooking instructions.The mini sandwich chapter has some stuff for pain au lait along with some preparation hints, but no recipe. It also has a picture for the 7 types of filled rolls, but does not list what they are.P. 66 of the canape chapter has the most amazing chart: a listing of 57 canapes, along with ratings for cost, prep time, and a difficulty rating. This chapter also does have a few recipes, but they only list ingredients.The Mignnonnette (\\"assorted snacks\\") chapter divides up into 4 types: small sausage, fish, fruit, vegetables. This is what used to be called finger food or cocktail food.The chapter on hot appetizers requires a bit more logistical planning, but still well within the reach of the home cook.The centerpiece chapter is rather sad. It has: surprise breads, canape hedgehog, Viking ship, and crudite bouquet. It has reliable instructions so you too really can do it at home. Pity that these things are really pass&eacute;.The chapter on brochettes/skewers has some rather involved items, but it also includes a helpful diagram to tell you what to do and in what order; very useful.Personal note: yes, it is true, that using aspic IS ESSENTIAL to a good hors d'oeuvre flavor and texture. OTOH, using plain, unflavored, cheapie gelatin from the grocery store will suffice as a substitute."},{"Title":"Pastry Hors d'oeuvres, Mini-Sandwiches, Canaps, Assorted Snacks, Hot Hors d'oeuvres, Cold Brochettes, Centerpieces for Buffets (The Professional Caterer Series)","review":"Those Mini- samiches are some good eatin!

Set in the mountains of 17th Century Peru, Saint-Germain becomes a subject the Inquisition after a daughter of Incan royalty captures his heart. Yarbro's writing is given flavour with the impeccable research she has used in this novel, making the actions and emotions of her vampire-hero more believable and enjoyable to read. The reader not only gets a fascinating glimpse into the immortal's 4000 years of life, but also becomes a part of one of the most violent periods of all time. The only problem I found in the book was that several of the names were hard to digest, but this conflict is resolved immediately after the first several chapters, when the plot thickens and the characters come to life"},{"Title":"MANSIONS OF DARKNESS","review":"Or tenth, if you count &quot;Out of the House of Life&quot;, which is primarily a spinoff novel about Madeline de Montalia, but which does include some of Saint-Germain's early history.Or thirteenth, if you count &quot;A Flame In Byzantium&quot;, &quot;Crusader's Torch&quot;, and &quot;A Candle for d'Artagnan&quot;, the spinoff series about Olivia Atta Clemens.This book, set in 17th century Peru and Mexico, details what was happening to Saint-Germain while Olivia was experiencing the events in &quot;A Candle for d'Artagnan&quot;. It is one of the best of a very good series; as usual, Yarbro's historical research is excellent, and her characters (with the exception of Roger, who seems somewhat lacking in the personality department; what does this guy do for fun? Thirteen books and counting, and I have no idea) come alive, even if I did find Saint-Germain's willingness to turn the other cheek after Dona Azul had Oaxetli poisoned somewhat out of character.For those unfamiliar with the series, the Saint-Germain series is a series of historical horror novels in which the hero (and he IS a hero, not a villain or even an antihero as is so common in vampire fiction) is a 4000 year old vampire. The vampiric aspects are very subdued; he needs blood to maintain his strength, which is formidable, and is susceptible to running water and sunlight, but both of these weaknesses are significantly less pronounced than in much vampiric fiction. As long as he is wearing shoes with some of his native earth in the heels and soles, he can mostly ignore them; even without, he hardly bursts into flame when exposed to sunlight; in this book, he is crucified for two days in the Mexican summer, and while seriously injured, he survives (no spoiler, considering that several of the previously written books are set in later time periods). Basically, without his protective shoes, he sunburns extremely easily and extremely severely. The books are well-written, and even the worst of them so far have been well worth the read."},{"Title":"MANSIONS OF DARKNESS","review":"Alright, I have to admit it, if a vampire is in a book, I simply must read the book. I've read all sorts of vampire-literature -- from books with grammatical errors and no plot to speak of to, well, Yarbro's novels.

Yarbro's novels include something to satisfy everyone: a well-researched historical setting (I learned more history from Yarbro's novels than I ever learned in school -- sorry Mrs. O'Keefe!), a heart-wrenching romance, plenty of action between a hero and lots of of nasty folks, and, my personal favorite, a passionate and dashingly handsome vampire! Yarbro's writing style is intelligent and, in just the perfect spots, very suspenseful (and, hey, no grammatical errors)!A word of warning is in order: once you've read one of Yarbro's books you'll be eagerly awaiting her future releases (thank goodness Amazon.com Books has electronic notification of new releases, huh?).A novel that you will keep you thinking long after you finish the book!"},{"Title":"MANSIONS OF DARKNESS","review":"My exposure to Chelsea Quinn Yarbro was accidental.

The second half of the book contains a great collection of information about different cocktail categories, sprits, liqueurs, as well as a review of mixology tools, terms, and processes in general.However, I do take issue with several of the recipes he provides. He describes both the Old Fashioned and Sazerac as being filled with water or soda as the final step, neither of which is correct.

Why?),Sidecar (no sugar rim. why?),There are no explanations as to why the recipes are so unorthodox, they are just stated as fact. Blindly following these recipes leads to bartenders who think they know it all, because they are using Schumann's recipe, but not having any indepth knowledge of the history of the cocktail.If you are a bartender, or want to be, then you will probably end up buying this book anyway, just to see what the fuss is about. Do yourself a favour and make sure you buy plenty of other books, so you can compare them.As someone who has been a bar manager, and head bartender, I wouldn't hire someone who insisted on making cocktails to Schumann's specifications.There is some sound advice in the back of the book, but the recipes themselves are not worth buying the book for.Buy this book, and lots of others to compare it to."},{"Title":"American Bar: The Artistry of Mixing Drinks","review":"For all those enjoying a good dinner party where cocktails and longdrinks are essential parts, this book gives you a most comprehensive guide in this category.

These reviewers are entitled to their opinions, but I think potential readers of Schumann's book would do well to note that there is no definitive recipe for any sufficiently well-established cocktail, just as no two chefs will agree on the recipe for a perfect omelette.

Also, there is a nice section from an 80 year old man who was an army private who knew the Cherokee people well and provides a touching account of their forced migration from eastern Indian territories to land in the West. Good quick read for younger peoples wanting to learn a little bit about Native American history and hopefully getting the urge to investigate more."},{"Title":"The story of the Cherokee people","review":"At first I thought that this was an overly simplified version of the history of the Cherokee people and I didn't like it. It is simple but it was also published in 1961. Looking back at the time(1961), this was probably a very good introduction particularly because it was so short. Today I would want to see a more expanded version particlarly if it was written by a Cherokee scholar. I am hopeful that the Cherokee people are revitalizing their heritage and will share their culture with a world desperately in need of courage, forgiving and guidance."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center: Sea of Fire","review":"Hmm. I normally like Tom Clancz - even in this spin-off series. However, this book is a dog of the first water. Why? Simple. It is written by someone who hasn't bothered to do even the most basic research on ... well, on *anything*. Basic things - like Australian politics, the Australian Military and its ranks and organization, and even, damnit, *geography*. In the book, for example, we have a Singaporean patrol boat in the sea off the Celebes (what it's doing in Indonesian waters is not obvious -but it's *way* to hell and gone off course and out of the area it has any business being in) and the action then, within the space of a few hours, moves it from there to the *east* Queensland Coast off the Great Barrier Reef. Bzzt. Sorry. No. Unless Singaporean Patrol Boats are capable of supersonic flight, this simply isn't gonna happen. Not to put too fine a point on it, it is simply impossible. To those readers who are (like the writer, one presumes) Americans, this may not be obvious ... though looking at something as basic as an atlas should have clued the author in... but it is bleeding obvious to an Aussie.The story is sort of OK, but, frankly, the background flaws are of such an order of magnitude I simply couldn't rate this as anything other than poorly written crap."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center: Sea of Fire","review":"WAY TO BORING AND HARD TO MAKE CONNECTIONS WITH THE FLOW OF THE BOOK. I HOPE THE NEXT ONE IS BETTER BECAUSE IF IT IS NOT THEY SHOUDN'T HAVE WROTE IT AND I WILL NOT READ ANOTHER"},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center: Sea of Fire","review":"Tom Clancy final has a novel with his name attached that actually is worth reading.This is a vast improvement over many of his previous &quot;joint efforts.&quot;"},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center: Sea of Fire","review":"Big improvement over last outing. More international in scope. Bob Herbert in his wheelchair takes on &quot;bad guys&quot; in believable and satisfying fashion. Even the obnoxious Lowell Coffey becomes fairly likable as his character is expanded in this read. A little slow and slightly cluttered on the front end,but middle picks up nicely and it has a satisfying ending."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center: Sea of Fire","review":"Before I reached page 50 I realised this author had confined his research on Australia (the setting for much of the action) to a Sydney Street Directory. Yes, you can see the Sydney Opera House from the Park Hyatt Hotel and that's the limit of his accuracy.The protagonist travelled from Sydney to Darwin in 116 minutes? Not in a P3 Orion he didn't (unless it is unique among propellor driven aircraft in that it can travel at Mach 2. Maybe it was a Concorde in disguise.) The distance is more than 2000 miles (about equivalent of LA to Miami or New York to Phoenix). The offending yacht travelled from the Celebes Sea to Cairns (well over 2000 miles) in 30 hours. Australia's P3s are owned by the Air Force, not the Navy. In the RAN, a Warrant Officer is not a senior officer. A wommera is not a means of throwing darts, it is a means Aborigines used for throwing spears (it applies extra leverage as an extension to the length of the arm). In itself, a wommera would be about as useful a weapon as any other thin stick and it is hard to imagine why anyone would carry one, especially as that character was supposed to be half Aboriginal..A willing suspension of disbelief in the interests of a good yarn is one thing, lamentable research and gross (easily checkable) error is quite another. Don't waste money on this dog."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center: Sea of Fire","review":"Among the countless and careless errors throughout this book, as attested to by several other reviewers, the one that bothers me the most is the author's horrendous misunderstanding of the terms &quot;contamination&quot; and &quot;radiation.&quot; Being an ex nuclear submariner and nuclear engineer, I have always been impressed by the accuracy of Tom Clancy's research, whether it was the details of nuclear submarine operations or his insights regarding interactions among members of the officers and crew. Tom Clancy was a meticulous researcher. Tom Clancy understood the difference between &quot;contamination&quot; and &quot;radiation&quot; and never would have written a book based on such a misapplication of science.Lee Tong, the &quot;radiation man&quot; who sets off the entire story, conceivably could have been irradiated by gamma rays from the nuclear cargo on his target ship but that exposure, no matter how intense, would in no way have made him radioactive. There would be no need for a lead shield as described in his hospital room. If on the other hand he became contaminated with radioactive material from the target boat as a result of the explosion, then the target ship and many of its crew members would also have been contaminated. But they weren't. You can walk away from a radiation source, but if you are contaminated with radioactive particles, it goes with you.For those of us who have been conditioned to read anything with Tom Clancy's name on it, and who do so because we have learned to trust the authenticity of his work, this book is extremely disappointing. We used to read Clancy because we trusted him and because of this trust we had confidence that the technology described in the story was accurate, not science fiction. Apparently, that is no longer so, a sad finding for thousands of Clancy fans.Much of the public fear about nuclear power comes from misunderstandings, such as Jeff Rovin's misunderstanding of contamination and radiation. Also, co-creator Steve Pieczenik, having a Ph.D. from MIT, would have easy access to the science that is at the heart of The Sea of Fire. He has no excuse to get it so wrong. For a ready reference, the difference is very clearly described on the Internet at:Definitions Related to Radiationor go to: http://www.orau.gov/reacts/definitions.htmIf you are looking for fairly good science fiction read, and don't care about its technical accuracy, or how big Australia really is, this book might do it for you. Otherwise don't be misled, find another book.Thomas Banfieldtvbanfield@aol.com"},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center: Sea of Fire","review":"Each of the Op-Center books has presented a crisis based on the current events and global political circumstances at the time of its writing. This one isn't different. The prospect of terrorists obtaining and using nuclear material is daunting, and the job of preventing such a disaster even more so. This book isn't quite as gripping as some of the earlier books in the series, but it did present a few surprises, and it wrapped up the story nicely. This book placed some of the Op-Center staff in new roles in the field, which was refreshing, and it introduced at least one new character that I suspect will return in future volumes. This was a fun, light read, perfect for any fan of espionage/political thrillers."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center: Sea of Fire","review":"The story ran smoothly, but the ending was not exciting...it just ended. Definitely not up to Clancy standards. One good thing: The chapters were short --- just right for bedtime reading."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center: Sea of Fire","review":"I agree with the others who panned this. It is full of obvious errors, and they show the gross ignorance of the author. The one that got me and sticks is his description of the men in the Sampan using the oars to get close to the yacht. They 'oared' there. Oared is not a word. When men use oars to move a ship, boat, or any floating vessel, the term used to move it is ROW. You row a boat, you use 10 foot oars in a viking ship to ROW the ship. One paddles a canoe, but one does not OAR a boat. Obviously this book was thrown together in as short a time as possible, given minimal proof reading, and then published. Tom Clancy should be ashamed to have his name put on it."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center: Sea of Fire","review":"I being an ex Military Officer and a military historian have always respected and appreciated the detail and accuracy in almost all of Mr Clancy's works. He is regarded so highly that certain titles like &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; are on an officers must read which list supplied by Training Command.Thus it was with sadness I read the multiple inaccuracies in this latest feature. My frustration occurs because the information is readily attainable and in some cases just common sense.Some glaring errors are:1. Tasmania is a Island state of Australia not a country...that would be saying Hawaii is a separate country to the U.S.2. A Warrant Officer in the Australian force does NOT rate a salute.3. There is only one minister of Defence in Australia, not numerous.These are but a few of the more obvious errors, I remember that in an earlier book of this specific series another Australian character was briefly introduced an he also was incorrectly researched.Apart from these errors the book was not as enjoyable as others of the series and I would NOT recommend it to any Clancy fans. Also if your going to write about Australia and the Australian Military please get someone who has been there to proof read."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center: Sea of Fire","review":"I snatched this book off the english book rack at the Munich airport thinking it was a Tom Clancy book. When I realized later, that it was written by someone else I was already suspicious. After reading the first couple of chapters I was astounded that Tom Clancy even let his name get close to this novel. The writing is so amateurish it's embarassing. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time. Personally I'm not going to buy any of Clancy's stuff anymore either. You'd think he'd be beyond this type of cheap marketing rip-off. I know he doesn't need the money."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center: Sea of Fire","review":"This is a tale oF suspence but the suspence is yours.YOU think you see the plot and then you don't.

I highly recommend it to any fan of Mr. Clancy's writes especially in audio format."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center: Sea of Fire","review":"I really enjoy action/thriller books, and the Op-Center series is consistently first-rate. Indeed, these books are the most true to the quality and fast pace of Clancy's early books Red Storm Rising and The Hunt for Red October. Sea of Fire is a good, solid read, and typical of the Op-Center books well thought out and nicely detailed.Like the last Op Center, Sea of Fire uses geo-political events as a backdrop. This time, it is the Pacific Rim and nuclear smuggling. Lowell Coffey, the Op Center lawyer, finds himself in the middle of a rapidly unfolding crisis while attending a conference in Australia. This was a surprising twist, since Coffey has been a behind-the-scenes-player in the other books. Also of interest, wheelchair bound Bob Herbert makes his first appearance in the field since being maimed by a terrorist bombing. The use of these two, more human characters in lead field roles was refreshing -- always good to see lead characters that well, are frankly, more like you and me.As usual author Jeff Rovin did his homework. You'll gain a lot of useful and discomforting information about the nuclear smuggling trade and how much needs to be done to secure these dangerous materials. I noticed that Rovin went so far as to ensure he had the correct title for members of the Australian Fire Brigade. It's the small touches that sets this apart from the pack of other action-thrillers.Anyway, this is a great, quick read. Take it on the plane or train, and finish it on the beach. Well worth the time and much fun."},{"Title":"Southern Fried Spirits: A Guide to Haunted Restaurants, Inns and Taverns","review":"Ghosts, goblins, specters, and apparitions have always fascinated. Now, for those who might enjoy bedding down by a phantom or supping with a spook here is a guide to many of the South's supposedly haunted spots. Which state leads in the number of addresses for the adventuresome? Why, Texas, of course! San Antonio's Alamo Street Restaurant, which was the Alamo Methodist Church until 1976, has a dining area and kitchen on the first floor while the second floor is home to live theater, concerts, and weddings. That's not all its home to - the owners boast &quot;friendly spirits&quot; who make their presence known by moving dishes around, pushing cooks into the refrigerator, and turning lights on and off. Does the staff mind? Not at all. Every once in a while a waiter will holler, &quot;Now you just stop that!&quot; Spring, Texas, a bit North of Houston, also has its share of unexplainable happenings at the Wunsche Bros. Caf&eacute; &amp; Saloon. This two-story turn-of-the-century building has been turned into a country style eatery. Evidently, Charlie Wunsche, a former owner, likes the arrangement because it is said that he visits frequently - making ghostly appearances in linen closets and wandering the second floor. Austin's Driskill Hotel not only has registered guests but registered ghosts. Colonel Jesse Driskill, the builder makes his presence known by smoking cigars in guests' room and playing with their bathroom lights. Mrs. Bridges, a former employee, returns to the front desk near the witching hour clothed in a Victorian dress. Regrettably, not all of these spirits are affable as some current guests have complained about being awakened in the middle of the night &quot;to the sensation of someone pushing them out of bed.&quot; Waxahachie, South of Dallas, also reports eerie events perpetrated by a trio at the Catfish Plantation Restaurant. It seems that when the house that now contains the restaurant was built in 1895 the owner had a daughter, Elizabeth. According to reports, she was throttled in the house on her wedding day by either or lover or groom. A second woman died in the house in 1970, and a third ghostly visitor is &quot;believed to be a farmer named Will, who lived in the house during the Depression and died in the 1930s.&quot; Management, guests, journalists and psychics give the threesome credit for flying coffee cups, refrigerator doors opening and closing, and coffee brewed by non-human hands. The Country Spirit, a two story restaurant in Boerne, serves spirits and hosts a few, too. Evidently, these phantoms like to party as the beer spigot has been known to operate at the touch of unseen hands, and laughter has been heard coming from downstairs when it is unoccupied. Add to this list the LaBorde House Inn in Port Aransas which has a few invisible guests, the Grey Moss Inn near Helotes which has mathematically inclined specters who operate the adding machine, and Houston's La Carafe with exploding glasses and a painting that flew off the wall. According to Southern Fried Spirits, Texas has a surplus of the supernatural!"},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm","review":"Published in 1932, this novel is a hysterically funny, tongue in cheek parody of the heavy handed, gloomy novels of some early twentieth century English writers who had previously been so popular. Tremendously successful when first published, \\"Cold Comfort Farm\\" caused quite a stir in its time.The novel starts out innocuosly enough, when well educated Flora Poste finds herself orphaned at the age of twenty. Discovering that her father was not the wealthy man she believed him to be, she is resigned to the fate of having to live on a hundred pounds a year. Opting to live with relatives, rather than earn her bread, she seeks out a most unlikely set of relations, the odd Starkadder family who live in Howling, Sussex.Therein begins what is certainly one of the funniest novels ever written. When Flora arrives in Howling, she meets her odd relatives, who live in neglected, ramshackle \\"Cold Comfort Farm\\", where they still wash the dishes with twigs, and have cows named Graceless, Pointless, Feckless, and Aimless. Headed by a seventy-nine year old matriarch, Flora's aunt, Ada Doom Starkadder, who has not been right in the head since she \\"saw something nasty happen in the woodshed\\" nearly seventy years ago, they are a motley and strange crew indeed. Confronted with their dismal and gloomy existence, Flora sets about trying to put things to right.Peppered with eccentric, memorable characters, this book will take the reader on a journey not easily forgotten. It is one that is sure to make the reader revisit this novel yet again, like an old friend who is missed too soon."},{"Title":"Condition Critical","review":"This is the sequel, as it were to Echo Hero's first biographical volume 'Intensive Care' and for the most part, continues in the same entertaining vein. I really symathised through the account of her burn-out, but felt the attraction for me dwindling during the Monserrat section of the book. None the less, definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Condition Critical","review":"So far this is the only book that I have read by Heron but its indeed the best picture of the critical care nurse's work life. Incompetent physicians, critical patients, demanding families, lazy co-workers, and of course the constant surprises, are all highlighted in hilarious quips. I love how Heron makes nursing sound as challenging as it is. I have been working critical care for only a short time but its amazing the power that your knowledge has over determining a person's outcome. Heron highlights different scenarios and what interventions she had to do to make sure that the patient's condition improved. She is an extraordinary nurse and an excellent author. This book would rattle many would be nurses, while getting an appreciative nod from experienced ones. Its a great book and Heron should be proud of this work. It really shows people how hard nurses work and that there is a lot of compassion in this field."},{"Title":"Condition Critical","review":"This review comes from a non-reader. I read only if it keeps me reading. I read Intensive Care after a co-worker had given it to me and found a common bond with Echo Heron having been there myself. I bought Condition Critical when it first came out and she did it again. I left a hospital after the &quot;assistants&quot; came to help with our staffing problems. In this book, she tells it like it is and stands up for nursing--I wish she was still nursing and writing. We need nurses who can say what needs to be said and let the public know what's going on. All her books are entertaining and the real life one's are so funny, many a time I was laughing out loud!!"},{"Title":"Condition Critical","review":"I loved Intensive Care and was thrilled to see Echo Heron's continuing story. The first two-thirds of the book had tales just as good, if not better, than the stories in her first book. However, her burnout and departure from nursing was an abrupt and sad ending. I hope that Ms. Heron has since reconsidered leaving the profession because it is obvious that she is a nurse with much to give. Though hospitals will never be perfect employers, there are many that are far better than &quot;Redwoods Memorial&quot; and I was disappointed that she did not try working somewhere else rather than giving up in disgust and despair. That said, I hope that laypeople as well as medical professionals read this book and see the things that are happening in medicine today that are driving so many excellent nurses out of the profession. Perhaps if enough people recognize the value of the contribution nurses make to medicine they can pressure hospitals into doing everything they can to recruit and retain the truly gifted ones like Echo Heron."},{"Title":"Condition Critical","review":"This book is great. It really gives a very accurate portryal of what a &quot;real nurse&quot; is and does. A great addition to any nurses book collection that you should read over and over again throughout your nursing career. We all can relate to her tales of a typical shift."},{"Title":"Condition Critical","review":"Echo Heron's novel proves an excellent read for anyone in health care or interested in health care.With a perfect blend of the human as well as, administrative side Ms. Heronmoves the reader sometimes with tears other times with anger.A must read for anyone who wants to make a difference and care for their fellow mankind."},{"Title":"Condition Critical","review":"a book i could not put down, a real eye opener into the real life of the medical feild. this book will both make you cry, and laugh. i am a big fan of this writter, and went on to buy every book she has written."},{"Title":"Condition Critical","review":"This book was given to me by a friend, and I really enjoyed it.

She writes with humor and with honesty. However, her writing is somewhat choppy and even slow in places. I felt disappointed at the end of this book, somehow let down by her lack of 'depth' and insight into the suffering that she witnessed daily. Her clinical evaluations and uplifting sense of humor were a treat, but spiritual and psychological observations were not easily found in this work."},{"Title":"Condition Critical","review":"Echo Heron---nurse, author, world traveler, athlete, recluse, patient and nurse advocateand.....political zealot, hater, and mean person extraordinaire? In true Tolstoyan fashion,Echo Heron delivers another epic rant about the inner workings of the nursing profession andthose who dictate the direction of said profession. I read Ms. Heron's first book, IntensiveCare, and loved it. I loved this book, too. Who wouldn't? The stories are captivating,the writing is superb, and the overall message of the book is important.However, in this follow-up to her first book, I found Ms. Heron to be unnecessarily aggressiveand tactless in some of the words she chose to use in describing other people. For instance,here are some of the gems that turned my stomach and wounded my internal cerebral image ofthe caring and wonderful person I know Ms. Heron most assuredly is:---\\"I could tell just by looking at her that I was in L.A.-the land of the Ultrabeautiful, Slender,and Flawless-Bodied People, where even the waitresses are ravishing.\\" Pg. 76---\\"Dr. Ostermann raised his shoulders and put out his hands. Instead of a cardiologist, he lookedmore like a Jewish grocer from the Lower East Side telling me he was out of knishes andgefilte fish.\\" Pg. 102---\\"Through the shadowy grays and soft whites, the dark outlines of two distinctly familiar objectsseemed as out of place as Ronald Reagan at a Mensa meeting.\\" Pg. 131---\\"Mr. Williams\\"-I smiled sweetly-\\"I don't give a d-mn what color you are. I don't even care ifyou're a Republican and speak in tongues, you can't bullsh-t me into giving you morenarcotics.\\" Pg. 180---\\"I invited the policeman to fill out the report on Risen at the table in back of the physicians'station. Armed with his own personalized Dunkin Donuts mug, and a half dozen jelly doughnuts,Officer Lansing contentedly dunked and chewed while going over his report sheet.\\" Pg. 232---\\"Just realized it's Tuesday and I have an appointment with Miss Milks. Must sleep before Isee her. Seeing Miss Milks on no sleep would be like going to a Young Republican party onLSD.\\" Pg. 273---\\"Yeah,\\" I chimed in, \\"either that or Dan's (as in Dan Quayle) come to see if they can reversethe zoograft he had done on his brain at birth.\\" Pg. 300---\\"Valerie was a refrigerator person-cold and loaded down with hundreds of containers of moldy,leftover problems from an unfulfilled life.\\" Pg. 307Et cetera and so on. Why, why, why is it necessary to belittle another's occupation, hurt another'sfeelings via overt and decidedly hostile insults, and to outright demonize another person'sopposing political ideology? Why? Even the waitresses, Ms. Heron? Kind of like a nurse being \\"justa nurse,\\" right? When my father died when I was 12, my mother worked as a waitress to support my sister andmyself. I'm glad she hasn't read this book. Glancing at the above passage would do nothing for her self-esteem.I'm betting her feet hurt every bit as much as yours did at the end of one of your shifts, Ms. Heron.The excerpt about Ronald Reagan was so disappointing and so gratuitously unnecessary and hurtful onso many levels. Guess what? Someone with an opposing political ideology has feelings too, and gasp,not all Republicans are horrible people, Ms. Heron. Why write something about someone you wouldn'twant written about someone you love, Ms. Heron. I understand why some nurses are angry, but come on....Be that as it may, and despite the excerpts from this book that I find questionable, I stillcame away from this book a better person. It was fun, informative, and a veritable rollercoaster ride of emotion from beginning to end. Mr. Heron has talent, and I'm so glad she hasused her gifts to inform the public about the conditions nurses face on a daily basis from alldirections. When all is said and done, this is another amazing book from an amazing author."},{"Title":"Condition Critical","review":"Echo Heron has written many books, about four or five that I have read. As a computer scientist, I loved the look into a nurse's life, which is difficult at best."},{"Title":"Condition Critical","review":"A very absorbing and wonderfully written book. I have read all of Echo's books and I can never put them down."},{"Title":"Condition Critical","review":"A friend had read the book and enjoyed it, and recommended it to me. I wanted to give it to someone as a birthday gift, but couldn't find it in the stores, so had to order it online. The online price of this paperback book was $17.99 plus $3.99 shipping charge, for a total of $21.98. When this paperback book arrived in the mail, the price on the back cover said $6.99. A charge of $22 for a paperback that actually costs $6.99 is outrageous. I will be more careful about buying books online in the future."},{"Title":"Condition Critical","review":"I found the book entertaining, because like Heron, I used to work as a nurse and am now a full time writer. I also lived and worked in the Bay Area, and know the hospital that she writes about. However, Heron seems to find enough people to lash out at, but she seldom mentions that nurses are their own worst enemies. Nurses rarely if ever stand up for themselves, they are great at complaining among themselves but when it comes to doing something about a problem--well, nobody wants to rock the boat. Nurses are great at backstabbing, they don't stick together--in short, nurses are treated without disrespect by doctors and hospital administrators because they tolerate it without a peep. So it always bugs me when high and mighty nurses complain about everyone under the sun except themselves. As for Heron's writing, it is okay but a little melodramatic."},{"Title":"Allah & Elohim: Are They the Same God?","review":"...This book, superior to the previous one by the same author, lays out plainly the differences between the Biblical God and the Allah of Islam. While not going into as much depth as it could, it certainly does a superb job of illustrating the stark differences between Muslim and Christian/Jewish conceptions of God. My only wish would be that it would expound more on the pre-Islamic pagan origins of Allah as the moon god, titled \\"al-ilah\\" - which could conceivably be a book in and of itself. Allah's name evolved from the title given all across the Arabian peninsula before Mohammed to various astral deities, primarily lunar deities. There are even stories that can be found in very early Muslim source traditions which refer to pre-Islamic Arabians worshipping in the Kaabah, praying to \\"allah\\" while standing before idols of Hubal, a god who at various times was a god of storms, the moon, the sky, etc..."},{"Title":"Allah & Elohim: Are They the Same God?","review":"It is definately a great read.

Shirly Isaac compares the characterists of Allah as listed in the Koran with those of Yahveh listed in the Bible. This reveals that Allah and Yahveh are not the same divine person. Moreover, the comparison reveals that you will want to be associated with Jesus and Yahveh. You will want Allah and Muhammad to stay far away!"},{"Title":"Allah & Elohim: Are They the Same God?","review":"Allah is not some idol that muslim's worship and the Prophet Muhammad was not the first muslim prophet. Muslims believe that our religion came from Adam and Eve and that Prophet Muhammad was the last of a line of prophets, including Jesus, Moses, Abraham, Noah, and others. Allah is the same God that Abraham and all the other previously mentioned worshiped. In fact, Christianity and Judaism are branches of Islam, since their texts came from the same God, Allah. Muslims believe in the original Talmud and Torah, which were given to David and Moses. We also believe in the Bible as given to the Prophet Jesus. Jesus is also a messiah, or messenger of God, to Muslims. But he has no divinity and does not belong to any trinity.This book is nothing but propaganda to mislead people about the true message of Islam and to create lies and misconceptions. It's purpose is to poison Islam's image and encourage conversion to Christianity by trying to link Allah to idol worship. In fact, Muslims do not have any idols whatsoever that they worship in their mosques/masjids. Islam is opposed to any religious images."},{"Title":"Allah & Elohim: Are They the Same God?","review":"The points this book tries to bring up can be more so asked about the differences between Jesus and Elohim.this book asks; \\"how it is possible that we see a total contradiction in the message of the Bible and the message of the Quran?\\"The fact is that Jesus contradicted Elohim on the laws of divorce, sabbath, defense, dealing with adultery, parents, food, etc...This book also ignores that the momentous 10 Commandments from Elohim are reaffirmed in the Quran while they are abolished in the NT, you can't get more contradictory than that.

The ferocity with which some of the book's critics attack it makes me suspect these people still harbor fantasies for Stefano that motivate them to preserve and revere his memory--as if they knew him in the first place! The real insight about gay men and their values is in the Amazon.com reviews of this book, and not the book itself.What most of these commentators seem not to notice, however, is that this is one of the most unintentionally funny books ever written for gay men. What a hoot! Isherwood--whoever he is--writes about a dead, drug-addicted, illiterate porn star with all the gravitas usually reserved for heads of state. Methinks the author had, and has, a crush on his subject. At his worst--and funniest--Isherwood tries to carry out a line of Freudian interpretation and to execute some kind of half-assed theory about \\"the real\\" Stefano (Nick Iacona--Stefano's real name) versus the gay cause celebre who had become Stefano the porn star. It's as if Mike Meyers got trapped in the body of Austin Powers and couldn't get out--so to speak. To those who slammed this book I say: \\"Get a life.\\" Those who didn't slam it, on the other hand, and therefore would seem to be moved or elucidated or both by this book, probably need some secondary education and, well, a life.Gay men are supposed to be good at detecting camp--what happened to the camp-o-meters of this book's readers and reviewers? Oh, behave!"},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"This is a pretty saucy read overall, but also a little silly in that the author was trying to convey a sense of surprise that Stefano's life turned out to be such a big disaster. I mean, what would you expect? He was a porn star, drug addicted prostitute. That does not lend itself to a bed of roses. Not to slam the actual Nick Iacona fellow, I know it was horribly tough road for him, though he did get to get a few kicks along the way.I think the book best serves as a true cautionary tale for anyone who might actually consider making a porno film on a lark or thinking about a harmless and quick stint in the adult film industry. This book makes it appear as though you had best have your last will and testament notarized before the cameras start rolling."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"Chi Chi LeRue, Karen Dior or Mickey Skee should have written this, or even Crystal Crawford.

Not many books tell us the background of these guys careers and how when your good looking you don't always have the most intelligence in the world. Fortunately I have both but I'm not going to brag about it. Only seen 1 of his films and a few trailors I wasn't impressed with Joey as much as the author and sevral hundred people who bought this book seems to be. I always read things that are about a topic of sorts. I don't kno"},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"The only thing that I got out of this book what that Joey Stefano broke the glass celing in the porn world for being a bottom. It is his life story but it is just the same: A troubled kid with a drug, sex, and alcohol problem. I would have like to have read a store where he turned his life around and made an impact. I dont recommend this book."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"i havent read the whole book but it has hurt me. the book couldnt have been all that better from what it is right now because iacona(stefano) was a very taciturn guy. he didnt talk about his personal past life that much. so the author cudnt go taht much into his childhood or even his problems but he did acentuate on the fact that stefano didnt talk about anything so that we know why he degresses. his digressions usually include genreal information about general gay issues or lives or little mini biographies on stefano's associates. i am hurt by stefano's story. although the fact that we've spent a lotta time in the same city(philly) doesnt help me get conected to him. but i was hurt by what i read so far. the authout dilineates all the charcaters in a well organized fashion but gives info on them in profuse amounts which distracted me. anyway, im thinking of writing a screenplay on his biography next summer."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"Just spent a sad 5 mins reading the reviews about the life of Joey Stefano. Christ the guy is dead. tragic. Always hear the same sad old queens harping on about porn and the drugs industry. Yes Joey was responsible for his life and choices. He was rewarded handsomely for his roles. He didn't deserve to die.Strange how the very guys who berate porn stars have book shelves filled with porn. If it get to you that much don't buy the stuff and don't buy excellent books which light the arena of gay porn.Plain scared people are the worst. They never have to worry about the industry because their chances of attaining any porn career have been hampered by mother nature at birth.Shut up and let the rest of us star in and buy what we enjoy."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"Although it's no fault of the author, I simply could not feel sorry for Mr. Stefano. The book spends a lot of time trying to build a case that the porn industry did Stefano in; but I didn't buy it. He was basically a drug addicted prostitute and chose his own lifestyle. When we lose an artist in the music field (like Janis Joplin, Jimmi Hendrix, etc) or the entertainment field (like River Phoenix, Judy Garland, etc) from an overdose, there is a real void in our culture because these people brought something to our arts and culture. I'm sorry, the loss of Joey Stefano certainly doesn't bring any kind of loss to society. It's too bad a young man died the way he did, but his &quot;talents&quot; are not irreplaceable or to be mourned for."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"This is a book that could have been a more interesting read had it been written by someone who wasn't so obviously enamored of his subject. Joey Stefano was a porn star of the first degree and lived his life in that fashion. Thats all well and good but he was a rude and obnoxious user who snorted and shot up any money he made. He was weak and was taken advantage of but after reading this book Stefano was the master manipulator! I cant muster up much sympathy for someone who sells their body and the author almost has you beleiving that what Joey was doing was noble. Forget college and working hard, if you are halfway goodlooking and well endowed you can make a living like this and never work a real job again! I have never seen a more disgusting lifestyle and world depicted as an almost &quot;wonderland&quot;. As a self respecting gay man I hope my world NEVER comes anywhere near this and if it does I hope that Isherwood is there to write about it! The book isn't a total loss, for entertainment value it isn't too bad. I just can't get past the fact that this book idolizes such a pathetic loser."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"UNFORTUNATELY FOR JOEY STEFANO,THOSE WHO WOULD PROFIT FROM HIS ILL GAINED FAME, NEVER SEEMED TO APPRECIATE THE PERSON BEHIND THE PERSONA, SO IT GOES WITH THIS NOVEL.

While I don't mind admitting publicly that I'm addicted to porn, I will certainly be looking at the movies differently from now on, especially those starring poor Nick, or Joey as we've come to know him. What has struck me the most about the book is that it strays from the tabloid style that you might expect, considering the subject is a younger gay porn star who died of a drug overdose. The book also tries to avoid placing the blame for Joey's death simply on the industry that made him famous. That would have been the easy way out and perhaps would have sold Joey short. The book does give us a brief glimpse into the way the movies are made (behind the scenes) and the stars themselves, again forcing us to examine our own mindsets when watching our favorite stars frolicking on the screen.While this is hard terrain to traverse, since we know the inevitable conclusion, it's a fascinating ride. I recommend it to anyone who has popped a quarter into a peep show booth and been mesmerized by Joey Stefano. Maybe, you'll be able to see him and his peers as more than just a set of genitalia (as I am now beginning to do)"},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"I give this book four stars, not because it's so well written (which it isn't), and not because it's so full of facts that I didn't know (which it isn't), but because it was a book that dealt with a person who trusted all the wrong people, made all the wrong choices, and in spite of it all, created an aura of success and absolute joy for his audiences.Nick Iacona was probably one of the hardest working people in the industry, or maybe he was just the most over-used. I can't claim to have seen every film he was in, but every film I've seen made me appreciate him more. It seems unlikely that he could have been so productive, if he was as devastated by drugs and emotional problems as this book suggests.Reading the words of people like Chi Chi \\"Larry\\" Larue, who were supposed to have been Nick's friends, made me even more aware of how treacherous business relationships can be. I don't believe much of what I read in general, and this book is full of obvious lies, but I guess that can be expected when the lies are told about someone who is no longer around to defend himself.As I said, it's a story that needed to be told, but I don't think it will ever be told properly. Buy this book as a momento if you like, and take it's contents with a grain of salt. Nick Iacona is gone forever, and with him went the truth about Joey Stefano."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"A gut-wretching biography of a beautiful man who could never get a handle on his life. It tells us a good bit about the exploitive gay-porn industry in the unhappily meteoric career of Joey: quick fame, over-exposure, and sinking star. The destructive catastropes of drugs, AIDS, self-destructiveness all come home in the life of one of the hottest bottoms in the porn trade. The final third of the bio moves with an inevitability that is good, but sometimes pretty obviously worked. You won't forget this book."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"Isherwood begins with the famous words of Dr. Samuel Johnson, \\"All excellence has a right to be recorded\\", and while this is solid enough justification for the biography, his execution of the task is far from excellent. This is not for lack of trying, it appears that I. has employed all of his talent and training as a journalist to their fullest degree. He has found those who knew Joey when he was still Nick from South Philly and has collected revealing statements about Stefano's own take on his life from rare interviews, usually from studio-backed skin mags and old issues of AVN. He fleshed these out with reminiscences from the auteurs who gave him his start (notably ChiChi LaRue, the corpulent granddiva of gay porn, and bisexual transsexual Karen Dior, who starred with Stefano in his first adult film), the stars whom Stefano worked with, old roommates and friends. These form the heart of I.'s writing, but his account lacks any sort of soul.If there were a phrase which would best describe I.'s book it would be artificially compassionate. Rather than letting Joey's truly lamentable decline into depression and heavy substance abuse create genuine sympathy with the reader, I. never gets over the journalist's need to offer an interpretation, no matter how superficial or obvious. The title of the book comes from two staples of Stefano's existence, the peanut butter sandwiches made on fluffy white bread he ordered from the gay-owned grocery store near his apartment in W. Hollywood and the popular designer drug he became increasingly dependent upon towards the end of his short life. But instead of making us more sorry for the blue-collar kid who had a rough life, wound up with HIV dying in a vicious industry, it makes Stefano sound like the gay Elvis. This isn't compassionate, it's cloying.In order to feel sorry for Stefano, we have to suffer along with him (indeed, this is the root meaning of compassion), but I. refuses us this, instead we are led along a duller and duller path of Joey's in-and-out drug rehabilitation sessions, cut with surprisingly lackluster accounts of his in-and-out film sessions. In all honesty, I purchased this book expecting to be slightly titillated (Joey appears suggestively unclothed on the cover, and a reviewer quoted on the cover suggested \\"This book may titillate you. . .\\"), but I. focuses almost maniacally on Stefano's career path to self-destruction than on his career. Thus I.'s ostensible purpose in this biographical expose is apparently to point out how the gay porn industry (pardon the pun) thrusts these boys to stardom and just as quickly passes them over for the next big. . .well, thing. But rather than viewing Stefano's own self-destructive habits as at least as contributing to the studios' gradual distancing themselves from him, I. seems to pin the blame squarely on the filmmakers for employing him less and less. This is true enough, but the evidence points to the fact that little Nick, Jr. was adept enough at hustling for the cash to support his habits well before he came to W. Hollywood.Not to say that Stefano's tale is not heart-breaking and torturous, from all accounts he was a genuinely sweet guy who needed love and approval more than anything, and unfortunately wound up in a profession where these were at best short-lived. But, again, the journalist in I. wins out. Rather than letting the story speak for itself and letting us draw our own conclusions, he fiats rationales for Joey's behavior. His abusive father died when he was 15, and therefore his need for approval was driven by some universal unconscious need of gay men to please their fathers. Thanks, Freud, but sometimes a porn career is just a porn career. Not all of us have bad relationships with our fathers, and those of us who do live rather well-adjusted lives are frankly tired of the clich&eacute; of a universal gay male experience, one suspiciously patterned on back issues of Psychology Today (or is it old Pottery Barn catalogs?). Another amusing identifier of I.'s narrow West Coast worldview is the final sentence of the blurb on the rear cover, which tags Joey as coming from \\"the country's heartland.\\" Yes, Philadelphia, breadbasket of the nation. I. also draws significance from the fact that Joey was born on New Year's Day, 1968, which he misidentifies as the \\"summer of love\\" (in fact it was 1967). Thus Joey becomes the porn superstar who shaped a generation, offering us a cultural alternative to those Reaganites who \\"were tuning up BMWs, turning on CNN, and dropping into the best restaurants.\\" This certainly creates an interesting notion of what I. understands by the word \\"generation\\", but it is more telling of his penchant to let his well-developed gay male ironic sensibility (never let me be guilty of avoiding a generality when it suits my purpose!) determine his conclusions rather than let the facts speak for themselves.At its best, I.'s book paints a stark portrait of a bleak life, one bereft of much joy other than the occasional acid tab or peanut butter sandwich. There are moments where the sheer pain of Stefano's existence comes through and we see the young man, without much to his name other than his attractiveness (indeed he was all too aware his greatest asset wasn't going to last forever), and who was facing the prospect of the end of his career and his likely death from AIDS with little to show for it other than a stack of videotapes and hollow memories. But I. peppers this truly compelling story with unwarranted dispensations of talk-show psychobabble and indictments of the industry which did this to Joey. But, in the final analysis, the ultimate responsibility for the life and death of Joey Stefano rests squarely on his own shoulders. If the sad career of Joey Stefano, as told by I. means anything, it is not only that it's lonely at the top, but it's also pretty lonely on the bottom, too."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"I loved this book, but I will admit to being a Joey fan. I found the book to be not the best written thing out there, but the story was great and so were the lessons that it taught. I think more than a cautionary tale about porn, it is a warning about not loving yourself enough to do the things that are right for you. Here is a portrait of a man who had great looks, and little else to help him make it through life. But yet there was so much potential there! You wonder what happens to ex-porn stars that don't burn out like Joey did. Where do they go? That would be a great book right there!"},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"Not to say that Charles Isherwood's style isn't a little heavy on the melodrama, but even without it, the tragic story of this 26-year old gayporn sex godlet is the stuff that movies are definitely made of nowadays. (One can almost hear the cel phones of Stephen Dorff, Billy Zane and Leonardo DiCaprio ringing with the turn of the final page.) For anyone who ever wondered what the flip side of &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; is like, here it is, warts and all.Mr. Isherwood is surprisingly objective the way he chronicles both sides of Stefano's life and personality, and the friends, lovers, hangers-on and other players in his life who by turns helped in many cases to both nuture and destroy him, putting the dichotomies and hypocricies of the porn world fully on display, which in their own context, aren't much unlike those which we &quot;normal&quot; people face in the &quot;real&quot; world.Entertaining and engaging, chilling and sobering, this not only serves to present a close-up view of the world of gay porn and its denizens, but offers up a cautionary fable for the '90's, to all those who have ever entertained starry-eyed notions of what it would be like to become part of that millieu."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"in fact i don't really like the book, but there is something which is really make me feel sorry with this guy. that is the part when stefeno was asked to write down all his problems, and he simply wrote down: No job No money No self-esteem No confidence All I have is my look and my body and there's not working anymore i feel washed-up Drug problem Hate life HIV-positive!

Now i understand how is a porn star feel behind the charm."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"I've always liked watching Joey Stefano in videos, but I had no idea how sad his life was! The book chronicles his early life and then goes into how he got into porn. Reading the book, I felt a great deal of sympathy for Joey -- it seemed like every time he tried to get out of the dismal hell he was in, he'd get pulled right back in. Even though I knew how he ended up, I had been so hopeful that at one point he'd have at least a small amount of happiness. Anyone who likes Joey's films should read this book. Then watch the films again -- tell me that you won't forever see Joey in a different light."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"i bought this book expecting a steamy expose of the gay porn industry. unfortunately, what i got was a boring and poorly written account of the life of a dim-wit loser. in all fairness to joey stefano, there might be a great story to be told about his life but this author is not the one to tell it. whatever entertainment value there is in this book is destroyed by his dime store psychology and less than enthralling insights into the gay male psyche. mr. isherwood seems to blame all of joey's problems on our homophobic society or the diminished job prospects for young people today, conveniently ignoring that fact that the joey stefano that his book portrays is a pathetic, drugged-out, whiny, sex-obsessed idiot who had lots of opportunities to pull himself up by his jockstrap and make something out of his life.it seems ironic that mr. isherwood puts a lot of the blame for joey's death on his ruthless exploitation by the gay porn industry when this books seems to be just as much of an exploitation as any of his jerk-off videos were. from the naked pictures of joey on both the cover and inside illustrations to the frequent descriptions of joey's physical attributes, mr. isherwood's book seems to be guilty of the exact same thing that he is condemning...the exploitation of an emotional unstable but attractive young man in order to make a quick buck."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"Charles Isherwood certainly doesn't have a dull subject on his hands, and this book is a decadent page-turner. Titillation is part of the reason, and so is camp. As one reviewer correctly points out, in its gravitas, this book reads like the biography of an accomplished artist or senator, and the serious lengthy discussion of Stefano as opening the \\"top\\"-dominated gay porn world to the possibilities of a superstar \\"bottom,\\" drive the camp quotient up that much higher.Most of us are both attracted to and repelled by pornography. Sex is a shortcut to everything, and the world of flesh and juices created in X-rated films is one most males and a few females are drawn to at certain times. As I found out in life, the unlikeliest people have collections of porn so ample they almost need the Dewey Decimal System to organize it. As Camille Paglia has said, \\"A day without pornography is like a day without sunshine.\\"I knew picking this book up that I'd be reading a tragic life. Joey's physical flaws were few (a flattened nose, a slight doughiness) and his physical attributes were many (a stunning Tom Cruise face and an arse that should be cast in platinum and displayed in the Prado) but psychologically this young man was a mess.Author Isherwood is a good reporter and gathers most of the important facts about his subject's life. His psychological theses are on shakier ground. The most important thing to know about Nick Iacona/Joey Stefano was that he was an addictive personality. Addictive personalities are usually not confined to one addiction, because this personality type is really a mode of response to any pleasure, one which is compulsive and unrelenting.When Nick/Joey wasn't doing porn films, he was going to orgiastic parties, and when these two allowed him any spare time, he was calling up sex lines, cruising parking lots, or soliciting other hustlers! Now this, my friends, is a sex addiction if any doubt lingers.Ecsape through drugs, frightening and blissful, was another of Nick/Joey's obsessions, and everything from heroin to morphine to cocaine to ketamine found itself in his system. Spending money compulsively and completely rounded out Nick/Joey's trio of addictions. A well-paid erotic film star, he never had a dime to his name, and couldn't even save up for a used car.With his good looks, Nick/Joey didn't lack for sugar daddies, and some of these transcended the role and became genuinely fatherly; alas, it was too late, and the porn star's problems were too weighty and too many. Lacking a human lover in his life, Nick/Joey courted death; his twin obsessions with sex and drugs dealt him a dual death sentence: HIV and an overdose.People with addictive personalities are also quite productive, since their work often becomes an addiction as well. Nick/Joey made 17 erotic films, and became one of a small group of icons in gay pornography. This may seem a dubious accomplishment, but it's well out of the reach of most of us. \\"The privileges of beauty are enormous\\" as Jean Cocteau said, and green-eyed Joey Stefano was clearly beautiful. But he was the kind of guy who could win the lottery and run through the money in a year. Tortured soul, his problems were a spooky and endless chasm, and we end up agreeing with his biographer with a chill and a sigh that at least death brings peace."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"I expected this book to give insights into the porn industry and its ride to ruin, but I didn't get that. All I came away with was a junkie who sold his body, used dope when people treated him like an object, then died. The author kept a neutral attitude toward the pornographers that was journalistic, to be sure. I don't think I would have been so objective."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"What I got out of this was a portrait of a beautiful, self-involved, rather self-indulgent young man who gave in to his weaknesses and lack of motivation or ability to do anything aside from relying on his looks and sexual prowess. As such stories usually go, this mindset led Stefano down a road of self-destruction and eventually death. It's certainly a fascinating portrait of a time and place very specific in Gay pop culture and adult-film history; this is a must-read for any porn aficianado for the very colorful events and characters that pop up in Joey Stefano's story. The author does a good job of outllining the events of his life and contextualizing them in the gay-porn scene of the late '80s to early '90s when gay video really came of age.However, i must again disagree with those who characterize this story as a \\"tragedy\\". A tragedy implies that the participants had no choice or fought valiantly against the forces which eventually overwhelmed them. Joey Stefano made his own choices and was clearly not willing to own up to them---yes he was gorgeous and had great sexual mystique but he was all too willing to squander his gifts in a morass of drugs and self-degradation which he enthusiastically participated in. Clearly he was too willing to buy into the myth that you are only worth as much as your beauty allows (a too-prevalent attitude in the gay world) and his unfortunate lack of self-awareness was his ultimate undoing.Compare and contrast him with the story of his mentor, Chi Chi LaRue---a large, homely man who became one the most successful business people in the porn world. LaRue had enough character and self-awareness to realize that looks would not get him along in the world---hard work, character, and a willingness to confront harsh realities are all necessary qualities for anyone but especially to those not gifted with dazzling good looks. LaRue becomes the de facto hero of \\"Wonder Bread and Ecstasy\\", especially considering that although Stefano barely gave him the time of day during their friendship/collaboration LaRue stood by him through anything and everything. That Stefano perished at an early age, burnt out and used, and LaRue emerged successful and thriving to this day, says much about the vagaries of vanity, empty self-gratification and excessive worship of beauty in the gay mainstream media."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"I'll cut some slack for this being Isherwoods first book but alas ther is nothing to see here. His Norma Jean approach to Nick Iaconna life is cliche' at best. To Isherwoods credit he does include morsels of what was going on in gay culture at the time of the early nineties which are genuinely intresting observations. Isherwoods took the E! true hollywood story approach to this bio and quite frankly been there done that.There are no new insights or revelations about the porn industry or gay culture."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"Not as badly written as I expected. Joey Stefano clearly was not a man of intellect (indeed quite the opposite) so the book is very short and can be read in 60-90 minutes. The ghost writer is mediocre. But the content.....what a sad miserable life without a moment of happiness, with no goals or aspirations, or joy.The hedonistic lifestyle he sought only made him more empty and despairing. I thought perhaps he was just poorly educated but it is clear he hardly had 2 neurones to rub together. Actually according to the book the whole porn industry is sad , despairing , desperate and drug addled and I am sure that's an accurate depiction. Perhaps the punishment for beauty is misery, it seems to be the inadvertent theme to the book. A good read if you've got nothing better to do for a short time (or a better book to read) and have a prurient interest the porn industry of late 80's to 90's. But it is 90 minutes you'll never get back."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"Extremely well-written, fascinating story of life, pornography, and death of a troubled young man who briefly became a super star of gay porn."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"This book is extremely well written.

It gives me a good sense of what was happening in the culture during Joey's (Nick's) time. I have owned this since it's release and have read it numerous times just for the sake of a quick mindless read. It takes me back and makes me feel like I was there. I wish I would have been an observer to the industry at that time, it was really fascinating. It is sad that someone could live their life believing they are only good for that type of work. One of Joey's movie was the first &quot;movie&quot; of the kind that I owned, although I wasn't entranced with him, I did find myself wondering what things must have been like for him and this book filled me in.

Besides also be very interesting the fact of,when a new character appears, the author makes a brief biography, which helps to situate ourselves in this history. Personally, I always thought Joey stefano very exciting, with a different beauty. I was born 18 days before him, in another country with a culture and a very different sense of relationship (but with the same prejudice). Joey was part of my discovery of gay porn videos just when gay videos began appearing here in Brazil. So I knew Joey Stefano, but the one from the videos and magazines, but, for example, I had never realized his importance (such as being the first \\"bottom\\" respected in this industry) But more important of all was meeting Nick Iacona Jr.This book deserves to be read and, without pseudo moral prejudices. And nowadays, with the internet, you can see what is described (videos and photos), but in a different way, a way with the aura of bitterness that accompanied the life of this beautiful young man."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"He was born in south Philadephia Nicholas Iacona Jr. Jan. 1, 1968, which the author of \\"Wonder Bread ..\\" points out was one of America's flashpoints in near self-implosion. Just 26 years later, in 1994, Nick died of a drug overdose. More than an all-too-common tragic story of a young, young person getting into drugs and OD'ing, somewhere along the line in Nick's life, he became gay porn icon Joey Stefano. Author Charles Isherwood mercifully respects his subject's memory by not commenting on his obvious physical endowment but, instead, gives us a portrait of a multi-faceted personality desperate for validation by anything other than what Isherwood describes as a cruel film industry in which its stars live and die by their bodies that are as easily thrown out as last week's garbage. It's not really clear what happened to Nick after he became Joey, but Isherwood may only be positing possibilities. Was he scarred by the thorns of his industry, or had it happened years earlier when Nick's father couldn't or wouldn't give his son the love and acceptance he craved? Whichever, Nick made the all-too-frequent lethal decision to seek solace and self-acceptance in drugs, and they're what got him in the end. But if they hadn't, HIV complications or AIDS would have eventually. And it presumably was the devastating combo of drugs and HIV presumably that physically devoured Joey long before his death. By then, he was virtually unrecognizable from the wholesome Wonder bread kid who would become a gay icon. His is a tragic and sad story of pain, drugs and reckless sex that, if our own houses aren't cleand up, threatens Everyman."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"The Stefano story is sad but fascinating one. The problem here is bland writing, an obsessive dwelling on the boring \\"tragically doomed\\" aspect of porno, and completely unsubstantiated research."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"The reason I got this book was that it was a biography of a performer who's movies I was once thrilled to watch. Joey Stafano wasn't particularly intelligent but he loved sex and, from this Isherwood biography, wanted to be a porn star from a very early age.Isherwood has a very fluent and visual writing style that makes for easy reading, but there really isn't much to read about. As one reviewer pointed out the author makes it a point to tell the audience that Stefano was private and didn't discuss his youth, so instead of investigating and researching and interviewing those who were a part of his pre-L.A. history, he tells us stories from those Stefano had told stories to. So, to fill in the pages we get miniature biographies of Chi Chi LaRue and various roommates and porn stars and drag queens who were, in some way of another, connected to Stefano.So, three stars...because Isherwood is a very talented writer, but not talented enough to overcome a thin story."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"Stefano was beautiful -- pretty, actually -- and was determined to have a career in porn. Unfortunately he lacked the self-confidence to resist the drugs and build a new career beyond porn.From my own life I know what it's like to watch a friend spiral into self-destructive behavior and not know what to do to help them. So this story touched me in a deeper way -- I felt the helplessness his friends around him felt about his behavior.Lacking from the book, I think, is more info about his home life before he met LaRue. We don't get to know his family at all before the porn career begins and we only see his mom briefly fter his death.Also, I get the feeling the author (Isherwood) met or knew Stefano. I wish the author had written a foreword or afterword that discussed why he chose to write a biography on Stefano. Part of the story is missing."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"Joey and I were about the same age and came into the gay scene at about the same time. I was mesmerized by the beautiful Joey and still think of him often. His movies are my favorites.Hoever, no that I am older, when I see them I wish I could just grab him out of the TV set and hold him safely. I feel sorry for the life that he had and what he went through at the end.I cried reading certain aspects of what this poor young man went through in his life and how he was used and abused by the industry and the gay community in general. After reading this book I so dispised Chi-Chi La Rue that if I ever met him I think I would spit in his face."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"I don't know that I can review the book, so much as the subject of the book. The book is written much like a Hollywood gossip column and bears little resemblence to a real biography, HOWEVER, it does give insight into a line of work that has been glamourized in the gay community. It's a world where flesh is currency and manipulation and lying are the name of the game. It seems that the flesh brokers (the filmmakers and distributors) are the only ones going to the bank with the proceeds of the films. How sad it is that the porn actors seem to be so insecure and uneducated that they don't save for their future or keep away from the drugs. Not a great book - but a great insight into the porn biz. Maybe we should print bumper stickers saying, &quot;Have you hugged your porn star today?&quot;"},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"With the explosion of porn distribution on the net and the constant rise and fall of \\"stars\\" being basically anyone paid to be naked for an orgasm in front of a camera at any time in their lives, the story of Joey Stefano is a cautionary tale that many ought heed. This entertainingly written and fairly well researched biography is a brief but revealing text. Perhaps Stefano's life could not carry a longer book, either. In any event, the reader will join him on a fast down escalator into self-destruction that shows the reality of low self-esteem, emotional insecurity, and short life span (in the marketplace or, like Stefano, literally) that often marks the human fabric of this industry. Well worth the investment of time and money, not least because a number of the people in the book, like Chi Chi LaRue, continue as active presences in the business of the meat market."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"He had AIDS...most didn't know this. He wanted love and fame and friends...he got fame, maybe just a few friends. He did drugs...and ended up where most who do drugs get close to before falling off as he did. This is a hell of a book. What it lacks in photos it more than makes up for in the new art of voyeurism that is the porn industry and the authors of books who are brave enough to write about a segment of the American population that the mainstream fears to tread into. Four stars--FOUR BIG ONES FOR OUR JOEY! f fletcher"},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"In general this is a well written and insightful account of the life and death of one of the 20th centuries latest and greatest porn stars.Isherwood gives us a warts and all picture of the greatness, the loneliness and the vacuity of the gay porn industry. Stefano, it appears, is another tragic example of how a beautiful, talented young individual can be bled dry by a community that took too much and gave nothing back.Overall, the book demonstrates that the enjoyment gained from the consumers of porn can be at the great expense of those who perform for our pleasure."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"I'm not going to cover the content, as a few others have done an admirable job of that, better than I ever could, what I'm going to cover is that the book, though there was a great deal of potential, failed at the delivery when it came to weaving an interesting tale. It was a poorly written book that made my head ache while trying to read it for several reasons.It's obvious the author is proficient at writing but journalism is different that writing something such as this, something that was proven in the delivery. The research wasn't that good, the delivery was horrid, the style was such that it made a subject that should have been quite interesting very dull, not something that would lend to a story such as this as all the elements that make something exciting (sex, drugs and excess) were there in abundance. There was also that matter than it seemed, going in, the author was bound and determined to blame the industry for something that this young man already had a problem with to start rather than take a neutral stance about it. That was rather off-putting and shaded things on my end.I think, perhaps, if someone else had told the tale that it could have been pulled off and turned into something quite interesting but, as it is, I would honestly say that it wasn't that good."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"Anyone who has watched a gay adult video from the late eighties and early nineties knows the name Joey Stefano. He was probably one of the more \\"pretty\\" boys from this era who was known mostly for being the more \\"passive\\" partner on screen with big names like Ryan Idol.This book, \\"Wonder Bread and Ecstacy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano\\", is an exceptional book that delves behind-the-scenes of the Hollywood based gay adult film industy. It shows how the industry can destroy young lives in a second and what can happen to innocent people all for the all-mighty dollar.The book discusses Jeoy's drug addiction, his prostitution, the time he spent in front of the camera when he was at his most popular, and his downfall as a washed-up porn star at 26 and the discovery he was HIV positive."},{"Title":"Wonder Bread & Ecstasy: The Life and Death of Joey Stefano","review":"I had always been a ardent fan of Joey Stefano and was very saddened by his death. His young life was tragic, depressing and too short. Much of what he went through is detailed in this well written book by Charles Isherwood in no holds barred graphic detail. Although an insightful look into the world of the gay porn industry, what struck me more than anything else was that Joey Stefano was a good person, albeit, with his own personal demons to battle (as we all have) which ultimately gained the upper hand and destroyed him. Another thing evident in this biography is that Joey's purported friends were anything but. When he needed them most he was cast adrift and virtually on his own. I hope Joey has finally found the peace he sought in his life."},{"Title":"Triumph Bonneville & TR6 (Motorcycle Color History)","review":"I remember attending a vintage car rally organised by the VCCI in Bombay a year back. As I was strolling about camera in hand looking at all the old beauties, I heard the roar of what could only be a twin cylinder thumper. Even before I turned my heard towards the source of the sound my heart was beating faster and I knew that what I would see would be immensely and instantly desirable. Small wonder then that it turned out to be a gleaming red and white Triumph. The Triumph Bonneville caused a similar reaction when it landed on the American shore in 1959. As a matter of fact it started a revolution that would define sportbike performance over the coming decade. Triumph: Bonneville and TR6 by Timothy Remus retraces the evolution of this icon that started of as a 30-horsepower bike and evolved to a 60-horse power screamer. With a delightful number of stunning pictures that will have you wishing you had one of these bikes, the book captures the bike at each step of its developmental journey. There's the 1959 model, the watershed TT bikes and the top-of-the-line 1970 model. The book with its 120 plus photographs and an authoritative text bring the Triumph Bonneville and TR6 back to life. If you are the kind of person who drools over gleaming chrome and the thumpy roar that Triumphs are all about this book is definitely for you."},{"Title":"Sanity, madness, and the family (Studies in existential analysis and phenomenology)","review":"Gregory Bateson and Robert Lifton figured out the mechanisms. Salvador Minuchin and Stephen Karpman figured out the systems of triangulation. Ron Laing and Aaron Esterson documented it all right here.There really are a lot of \\"great books\\" in this field, but this one stands out as an absolute must for anyone who'd call him- or herself a \\"master\\" of family therapy.We can't say for sure if the authors saw the crazy-making (\\"schizogenic\\") family as a half-conscious, mind control cult run by parents trapped in religious and cultural \\"common sense.\\" But they surely understood Karpman's notions of covertly controlling rescuers, crafty persecutors and duty victims in family systems where the parents believe to their very core that the painful memories and emotions they suffered in their own crazy-making families of origin are \\"intolerable.\\"In the service of affective \\"stuffing,\\" these people infect their children with the contagion they contracted in their own psychogenic youth.Alice Miller was asked by an interviewer if she'd read Laing. She had. She went no further, but it's clear in her own work that she saw all this in her \\"Prisoners of Childhood.\\" As valuable as Miller's many books have been for a generation of therapists, however, none of them illustrate her notions of \\"for your own good\\" and \\"thou shalt not be aware\\" as well as this one.The crazy-made parents need a crazy child upon whom to project all of their intolerable guilt, shame, worry, remorse, regret and grief for the suffering of their own childhoods. Fortunately, most of them are insufficiently gifted to be able to maintain the say-one-thing-and-then-say-another borderline organization that these eleven pairs of earnest dingbats and denial experts perpetrated on these eleven young women.That said, I have encountered dozens of people who came from families like these: some poor and truly clueless; many wealthy and smugly certain of their righteous rectitude and poisonous pedagogy. The children of the former stand a better chance in most cases. For in the latter, the parents often have too much legal and political power to break through, and too much sophistication to overcome the persecuting control over their adult children's lives that is seen by those parents as so crucially vital to their own emotional well-being.As Claudia Black and Alice Miller put it, these familes force their children to live for their parents' narcissistic benefit, and not the other way around. These children are made to be stand-ins for the guilty grandparents who drove their parents crazy. Being sacred objects of the Fourth Commandment, those grandparents cannot be indicted, tried or convicted. So the kiddies take the rap.Do some parents see the intolerable image of themselves in their own children, refuse to accept the truth, and imitate their own abusers? =Bet= me."},{"Title":"Sanity, madness, and the family (Studies in existential analysis and phenomenology)","review":"Famed psychiatrist R. D. Laing gives a study of eleven families and thier children whom are schizophrenic. Laing gives no interjections, but rather lets the conversations that the families have amongst themselves give their own testimony. Laing lets the reader know where language patterns occur, in which he believes is largely due to the psychic split. The &quot;double bind&quot; theory introduced by Gregory Bateson, in which the child has been given mixed messages. In the cases given, the studies are all female, and the mothers are usually the aggressor, while the father the passive, and if other siblings are included, they usually side with the mother against the sibling. Shocking, sad and enlightening all together, Laing gives a great look on how schizophrenic in this light can and does occur. Highly reccomended and should be read by all psychologists entering or in the field (it is a shame that this book, like so many of R.D. Laings books are out of print). One should include with this book Gregory Batesons &quot;Steps to an Ecology of Mind&quot; which includes the essay which explains the &quot;double bind.&quot;"},{"Title":"Sanity, madness, and the family (Studies in existential analysis and phenomenology)","review":"That is to say there are logical means to schizophrenia, and nothing that confers to a physical disability. An amazing study of eleven families and the children who are hospitalized because of their &quot;illness&quot; (incidentally noted, they are all female patients). Dr. Laing and Dr. Esertons account of schizophrenia all points to the facts that this mental illness is not a physical impairment, but a distrust in a persons reality, through communication, through insecurity of beliefs and senses. Schizophrenics choose logically and intelligently under the confines of family life with the parents (who are more delussional than the patient). Although this book is primarily a psychological study, it reads like a novel."},{"Title":"Sanity, madness, and the family (Studies in existential analysis and phenomenology)","review":"This book is a series of interview transcripts of the families of schizophrenics, with a forward describing each family situation and the patient. The authors' theory was that schizophrenia in a person could be a result not of illness in the patient, but of family dynamics. To test this theory, Laing and Esterson interviewed the patient's families -- usually the mother, father, siblings, and grandparents if available, as well as the patients themselves.The interviews certainly show that many jumbled signals were being received by the child; and many factors (projection, denial, extensive control of the child's behavior etc.) were at play.For example, a patient might say, \\"I was very unhappy at school... I felt ashamed of my (whatever),\\" And the mother chimes in with, \\"You enjoyed math, didn't you?\\" Even though she and the father actively discouraged the child to study mathematics. Thus the patient stops talking, mystified by this comment which is so at odds with what was actually their experience.... and forgets to pursue their telling the mother about the shame they felt. These poor souls become catatonic, unable to speak or unwilling to.Often it seems that the parents had a stake in denying the patients their selfhood.Like Laing's other work, the feeling one comes away with is of empathy and sympathy with the patients, and a feeling that they are not so insane as others think them to be. This is what I take away from Laing's work -- empathy ---- but also a focused look at what could be causing the mental illness.This wasn't as helpful to me as \\"The Divided Self,\\" but I still found it to be sobering and in some places humorous, in a sad way, because it was quite familiar in spots, the convoluted way these families \\"communicated.\\""},{"Title":"Sanity, madness, and the family (Studies in existential analysis and phenomenology)","review":"My father was Asperger like myself. My mother was schizogenic. Not schizophrenic but schizogenic: A refrigerator mother totally impervious to the needs of her children. Never once in her life did she kiss or hug any of us, and we were raised by the maids. To be fair with her, she did take an interest in us when we were sick. I remember that being sick was like visiting Disneyland.My brother is schizophrenic and he has spent several years of his life in the loony bin. All my seven sisters are downright crazy. Even if they do not hear voices or see hallucinations, there is something very wrong with all of them. One of them reads the bible 24/7 and speaks \\"in languages\\". A couple of them appear on the surface to be OK, but have done things throughout their lives that defy understanding. One let her children hang out with a well known homosexual pedophile, and even wanted to marry him. Another induces her two daughters toward promiscuity. Her younger daughter already has herpes and who knows what else.Another thing I have to point out is that although all my sisters are downright crazy, none of them is schizogenic. None of them was impervious toward their children, and none of their children ever went crazy. But one of my nieces, the daughter of my bible reader sister, is conspicuously impervious toward her children, and one of her sons is quite weird. I would not be surprised if he goes nuts when he grows up. It fits the pattern.The shrink I had the misfortune to know, the only thing that interested him was squeezing as much money as possible from his patients with endless sessions of \\"therapy\\", and seducing his female patients. One of my sisters fell for him, and she still considers him the love of her life. (I don't believe her late husband ever got wind of this). Some professions breed dishonesty. I consider psychiatrists to be at the top of the list, along with lawyers and politicians. The point of this paragraph being, I believe that bad parenting schizogenia theories became so popular 50 years ago because psychiatrists had an overwhelming monetary incentive: To put the blame of schizophrenia on bad parenting meant tons of money in family \\"therapy\\".Now to the book: Even though bad parenting schizogenia hypotheses have been totally discredited, the scientists' field observations are still valid and genetic schizogenia is a fact of life. The genes of schizophrenia impinge on all family members in varying degrees of severity, and on the mother of the future patient, in this different and strange way.No need to mention that this book is a must if you want a better understanding of schizophrenia. Even if you do not have the stomach to finish it, you will get a taste of what our families are like.Schizophrenia is preventable today by giving low doses of antipsychotic medication to the suspected future victim. I cannot help wonder if the same doses would soften the hearts of schizogenic mothers.PS. I once read on a psychiatric journal at the University of Santa Clara that there are six different types of schizogenic mothers. Unfortunately, I lost the photocopy and after so many years cannot remember the name of the publication. I do remember though that one of the types was the \\"seductive\\" schizogenic mother. This is the type that appears on the novel \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\". Ken Kesey couldn't have invented it out of the blue. He must have seen it at the hospital were he worked."},{"Title":"Sanity, madness, and the family (Studies in existential analysis and phenomenology)","review":"A bright star in the constellation bridging the literary and philosophic psychiatry of the past to the psycho-pharmacological dominated present."},{"Title":"Meetings with Remarkable Muslims: A Collection of Travel Writing","review":"(Lisa Kaaki)Since 9/11 there has been an international interest in the Islamic world which has continued to the present. One of the latest efforts to shed some new light on Muslims comes in the form of a delightful book: \\"Meetings With Remarkable Muslims, a Collection of Travel Writing.\\"The idea for the book came after the editors, Barnaby Rogerson and Rose Baring, witnessed the marches in London protesting against the invasion of Iraq: \\"Realizing that the lies, half-truths and manufactured fears by which this war had been sold to the public were backed by the images of the Islamic world latched onto by our media - of bearded fanatics, suicide bombers and veiled gunmen - it seemed important to offer a broader, truer picture. As anyone who has traveled regularly within the Muslim world will know, this perception is willfully, even perhaps maliciously, false. \\"The collection is divided into three parts, \\"Here and Now,\\" \\"Memories,\\" and \\"Ghosts,\\" in which the authors show the lives of Muslims, highlighting the varieties of their practices and traditions. The book is more than anything about ordinary Muslims leading ordinary lives: \\"There are no world-famous presidents, revolutionary colonels, or publicity-hungry preachers in this world-view. Instead it is the porters, drivers, smugglers, musicians, teachers, mothers, neighbors and restaurateurs who are cherished for the example of their ordinary lives,\\" say the authors.Although most of the writers in this collection would not describe themselves as writers at all, the pieces are beautifully written. Alberto Cairo, a lawyer by profession, has been making prosthetic arms and legs in Kabul for the past fifteen years. In 1996, he was described on the front page of the International Herald Tribune as \\"the most beloved foreigner in Afghanistan.\\" His personal account of life in Kabul is of a country still searching for peace: \\"In Kabul new restaurants and pizzerias are opening all the time with exotic foreign names such as Golden Lotus, The Great Wall, New York Restaurant; the cinemas show romantic Indian films with songs and violence; you see mobile phones everywhere, the traffic is chaotic, much of the city is a building site, refugees have returned in their thousands. Life seems to be surging ahead triumphantly. But peace has not yet spread through the land. \\"In another piece, Robin Hanbury-Tenison writes about his life with his Tuareg companions when they wandered through the northern Air Mountains, a part of the Sahara few outsiders have ever visited - or even know about. In a moving account of his travels, he praises his companions who \\"would die rather than let anything happen to me... In my whole life I have never felt safer, more wrapped in friendship. \\"Brigid Keenan, a diplomat's wife who has lived in Muslim countries for more than ten years, was impressed by Thala Khair, \\"the daughter-in-law of a Syrian Defense Minister and the wife of a colonel in the Syrian Republican Guard; she doesn't sound like an obvious choice but that's one reason I decided on her; she goes against all the stereotypes - of Syrians, and of women in the Arab world\\" writes Keenan.Eamonn Gearon learnt the traditional skills for living and traveling in the desert and later moved to the oasis of Siwa where he lived eighteen months and befriended Muhammad: \\"I was lucky to have him as my friend when I lived in the oasis... Since Sept. 11, 2001, I have thought a great deal about jihad, and my friend Muhammad whose example showed what it means to be a jihadi. As surely as jihad can mean fighting the enemy without, so must it also be understood as the fight against the enemy within, fighting the urge to sin, and through introspection trying to defeat evil. It is in this way that the believer wages jihad daily. To fight the good fight.\\" writes Gearon.One of the most moving stories of the book is told by William Dalrymple, author of the much praised \\"White Mughals.\\" Presently living in New Delhi, Dalrymple writes about his meeting with Dr Jaffrey, a scholar who converted an often illegible manuscript which was a court chronicle of Shah Jehan into clear Persian typescript, and then had it translated into English by a team of Persian scholars in America. The manuscript deals with the golden age of the Mughals when India, Pakistan and parts of Afghanistan were ruled from the Red Fort in Delhi.From his small, dark room in the heart of Old Delhi, Dr Jaffrey speaks about changing times: \\"Today there are no longer any educated men in the old city. I am a stranger in my own home... All the learning, all the manners have gone... Everything is so crude now. Here everyone has forgotten the old courtesies. For example... in the old days, a man of my standing would never have gone to the shops - everything would be sent to his house: Grain, chilies, cotton, cloth. All these things have gone now. People see the educated man living in poverty and realize that learning is useless; they decide it is better to remain ignorant.\\" But more than his knowledge and devotion to his scholarly work, it is Dr. Jaffrey's faith which impresses Dalrymple. When Dalrymple confesses that he is no longer sure what he believes in, Dr. Jaffrey tells him: \\"You make God sound so complicated. God is simple. To follow him is not difficult.For John Carswell, the most remarkable Muslim is Fazlar Khan, the designer of the famed Sears Towers as well as the striking Haj Terminal in Jeddah: \\"It was not just that he was a structural engineer of genius, but that he was also an extraordinarily nice and intelligent person, and a great humanist.\\"It is impossible to mention all the pieces but one cannot ignore Sabiha Al Khemir's emotional encounters with exceptional characters such as Mary Belle, a black American she met in Central Park during a lunch break. During their conversation, Sabiha believes that Mary Belle doesn't know anything about Muslim Arab women until she hears her say, \\"Al-Hamdullilah.\\" She then realizes how prejudiced she had been: \\"Mary Belle was a Muslim? Having heard her thank God in those Arabic words startled me, bringing the insight that it was she who was invisible to me and that a Muslim could also be a large, black, American woman eating a hamburger in Central Park.\\"This enjoyable book has become, in the words of the authors, \\"A testament to friendships and to the chance encounters that unexpectedly enhance our lives. It is also about how the Islamic world continues to enchant, delight and bemuse the West. It has no political subtext follows no academic discipline and sharpens no doctrinal axe.\\""},{"Title":"Jack and Jill: A Village Story (Illustrated)","review":"This book has approximately one typo per page, which is annoying in itself but also detracts from the flow of the text. It also underlines every occurrence of \\"store\\" or \\"buy.\\" Is this some weird subliminal message? It has a very small font, which is strange given that the target audience for this book would be ages 8-12. The interior pictures were repetitive versions of the ugly cover picture.

Before reading Indermark's book, I had no idea who Shiphrah and Puah were, though they figure very strongly in the story leading up to the Exodus. And Indermark exegetes these two characters in such a way that they connect very well with contemporary life.

It is breezy and topical, not detailed or exhaustive. But it does its job well.Mr. Dana had a uniqe perspective on the Civil War. First enlisted to go &quot;out West&quot; and check out &quot;this General Grant&quot; by Edwin Stanton, Dana soon became a trusted advisor to both the President and the Secretary of War. He apparently spent most of his war service in the field, at the side of various union generals so that Washington would have a trusted and immediate voice to report on what was really happening on the various fronts. His advice helped advance officers Dana thought effective and cashire those whose service was detrimental to the cause of the Union. His advice and counsel was also influential on various war policy issues.One belives that Dana had much to do in helping Grant, Sherman and others overcome their reputations and distance from Washington to reach their appointed places from where Union success ultimately sprung. He is a concise writer and offers strong opinions on personalities associated with the Union's management and prosecution of the war. These are interesting because Dana is often quoted in more recent books on the war. His story helps show why these quotes are meaningful as well as tells an interesting tale of an individual who can best be described as the highest ranking civilian in the field from 1863-1865.An interesting book from a unique vantage point."},{"Title":"Peking Diary: a Year of Revolution","review":"When the Communist Eighth Route Army entered Peking in January 31, 1949, the lights flashed on again in the darkened city, and more brilliantly than they had in many a month.

Apparently a fifth edition changed the paperback cover spelling of \\"Islaam\\" to \\"Islam\\", probably for easier discovery on websites by researchers.) Written in English. Jameelah Jones was born in Georgia, USA, and she accepted Islam in 1971. The author explains well the many facets of the theory of Islamic polygyny and how Muslim spouses should respect it. Not a critical look at the practice; after all, how can one criticize something that the Muslim god Allah permitted as revealed by the Prophet Mohammad in the Quran? While it cites various Islamic scholars, it still comes across as rather \\"mellow\\", rather than a deep scholarly analysis of this topic. As the author noted: \\"Love, as it is known in the West, is not a prerequisite for marriage in Islaam; hence the concept of plural marriages does not have as emotionally deveastating an effect on true Muslim women as it would have on ther non-Muslim counterparts, except where western influences are great.\\" Their belief is that the spouses will eventually \\"fall in love\\" with one another."},{"Title":"Legion of Super-Heroes Archives, Vol. 11 (DC Archive Editions)","review":"This edition covers SUPERBOY (first series) #203-212 (c.1974-1975) with artwork by Mike Grell and scripts by Cary Bates, E.

This book starts off with a bang with the death of a Legionnaire and follows up with appearances by the Legion of Super-Villians, Legion of Substitute Heroes, and the retirement of a Legionnaire. There are several fun back-up stories here, including the romance between Brainiac 5 and Supergirl and the story of how a normal fan got to be \\"Hero for a Day\\".

Mike Grell, who left a lasting impression on the team, is the main artist and he even takes a turn writing one of the comics and offers an interesting foreword. Cary Bates wrote most of the stories in this collection but there are also tales from E. Nelson Bidwell and Jim Shooter's return to the Legion.These comics come from an odd period as the Legion tries to emerge out of the shadow of Superboy. There are some fun moments that offer a great deal of insight into the characters on the team. While one of the leading members of the Legion is killed and another leaves the team for other service in this collection, some of the comics simply fail to provide memorable plots. Besides Grell's art, the stories that focus on character development are what stands out in this collection which should appeal to most Legion fans but will probably not do as well beyond that audience."},{"Title":"Legion of Super-Heroes Archives, Vol. 11 (DC Archive Editions)","review":"i love dave cockrum's art but mike grell was a good replacement. his run started with the death of the first invisible kid and lead into many character developing moments for the legion. also great to see returning villains the legion of super-villains, universo, the origin of karate kid and him staying with the costume that i feel best suits him. even the subs were able to show they are not to be ignored. a great collection among all the other legion archive series."},{"Title":"Legion of Super-Heroes Archives, Vol. 11 (DC Archive Editions)","review":"If you liked Mike Grell art, then you will difinitly engoy this valume, the stories might be short, but the art work make up for it."},{"Title":"The Pathans: 550 B.C.- A.D. 1957 (Oxford in Asia Historical Reprints)","review":"This is one of the most comprehensive books on the subject of the Pathans (Pukhtoon or Pushtoon. Written by the last British Governor of the North West Frontier Province, this book traces the geneaology of this unusual race. Recently the Readers Digest (July 2000) wrote a story on the connection with Alexander the Great. This is a scholary work so if you are looking for light reading this is not for you. At one time Afghan and Pathan or Pukhtoon/Pushtoon were synonymous. It was the fear of the Pathans of Pakistan joining with the Pathans of Afghanistan that led Pakistan to deny naming the province \\"Pashtunistan\\" (Land of the Pashtuns)for fear of lending legitimacy to their desire for independence. Winston Churchill fought here. So did Sherlock Holmes' friend Dr. Watson. The general fascination with this area can be gauged by the number of National Geographic articles about it. This book brings these people to life and gives them the honorable treatment they have earned. I should know, I am a Pukhtoon of the Yousafzai (Joseph's Children) tribe."},{"Title":"The Pathans: 550 B.C.- A.D. 1957 (Oxford in Asia Historical Reprints)","review":"This is a good read notwithstanding the sometimes academic treatment of the topic which at best is boring and long winded. Having said as much, the author does a pretty through job of addressing the various aspects of Pathan history which departs quite significantly from the common understanding of the average Pathan of himself and his heritage.I for one was quite amazed to see the argument posed by the author and the facts laid therein to substantiate his proposition. However, by and large it is a book worth reading given the subject of Pathan history is something that can not be fully understood from a single read."},{"Title":"The Pathans: 550 B.C.- A.D. 1957 (Oxford in Asia Historical Reprints)","review":"If you are not a Sindi, Punjabi, Hazara, Tajik or other enemies of the Afghans/Pakhtoon, this is a must reading for you."},{"Title":"The Pathans: 550 B.C.- A.D. 1957 (Oxford in Asia Historical Reprints)","review":"This book is an extremely useful work for historical reference, perhaps the only one in its category extant. It can be called a magnum opus. The narrative of its writer is, of course, tinted heavily with his own emotion--and he has pointed this out to the reader himself when describing the nature of his book--therefore this aspect of the book may also be taken as a &quot;historical reference&quot;, to its VIP author's attitudes, but otherwise has no value and is sincere, but very harmfully misleading to the unacquainted reader, about the true nature of the evil Pathan society and its ways, in the present time especially. The Pathans/Pakhtuns/Afghans were always a backward, turbulent society with a criminal culture, but they have changed drastically for the worse in the 44 years since this book was first written, mostly in the last 20 years or so."},{"Title":"The American Diesel Locomotive","review":"This book gives history and interesting facts with color illustrations; a very good choice.

Each example is explained with carefully chosen analogies that are comprehensible to the average academic. While complex and somewhat technical, this collection is well worth the attention of the passionate amateur or professional."},{"Title":"The Fifth Essence: The Search for Dark Matter in the Universe","review":"I found Krauss's writing about a very difficult and enigmatic subject remarkably accessible. What has to be grasped is that no one -- NO ONE -- knows to any degree of certainty what makes up dark matter, nor how many forms it might take. It is the job of particle physicists and astrophysicists to, yes, speculate about what it could be, come up with a model that just might work, and then try to find ways to quantify and prove that model. New particles are being discovered on a regular basis: just because the concept is beyond our realm of understanding doesn't mean it's \\"science fiction\\" or that these discoveries are deserving of scorn because they don't seem to affect our daily lives. Krauss delivers his information in an engaging way that doesn't pander to the lowest common denominator, nor does he shy away from challenging his reader. I found The Fifth Essence to be one of the best examples I've read of science writing for the general public. Cheers!"},{"Title":"The Fifth Essence: The Search for Dark Matter in the Universe","review":"We are accustomed to having our questions answered. This book discusses a question without giving the answer. The subtitle is The Search For Dark Matter In The Universe. That's right. It's about the search. Reading this book is like spending a few weeks with a flashlight, poking around in the dark. When the last page is done, you still, as U2 sang, haven't found what you're looking for.Before reading this one, I read a book that told me that the dark matter consisted of Jupiter-sized black holes in space, millions of them, formed in the first fraction of a second after the Big Bang.This book mentions that possibility but doesn't buy it. The answer here is that the dark matter consists of sub-atomic particles speeding through space, flying through planets and stars without being stopped by them. They also fly right through our skin and bones, constantly. Do I have that right? Who the hell knows.On the back cover, the author is described as a \\"superbly clear writer\\". I wouldn't go that far. Consider the source - another physicist. Clear to him. He knows this stuff already. Clear as mud to me. Well, some of it, anyway.We now believe that from 90% to 99% of the stuff in the universe is invisible to us and undetectable by our technology. And we think that stuff is ... umm ... chocolate pudding. We're testing for it. Maybe that stuff is heaven. Or maybe the calculations are way off and there is no dark matter, and we shall soon prove that we don't exist.I was surprised to see how the processes of physics and cosmology seem to work. We fantasize. We imagine. What if ... ummm ... what if there was a particle that was such and such a size and had such and such properties .... would that explain anything? Okay, let's say that it exists, let's call it a floooeyon. Now let's go search for it. This reads like sci fi.Hey, Henry, I think what happens is that for every particle there is an anti-particle, and when they collide they destroy each other, and there are exactly the same number of particles as anti-particles, but then again there may be 1,000,000,001 particles to every 1,000,000,000 anti-particles, and they all destroyed each other, leaving 1 particle undestroyed, and that particle, multiplied a gazillion times, is what makes the universe.What???????No, for real. It is a ballooneon. Now if only I could measure the effect that one ballooneon has when it flies through the earth and bangs into a proton in a big vat of orange juice below the surface of the earth, we'd be all set.One of the strongest impressions you take from this book is just how unimaginably huge the universe is. There are billions of galaxies. With that in mind, it seems that only an absolute fool would believe that this is the only inhabited planet. Instead of thinking that the UFO-believers are loonies, it seems that the UFO-skeptics are the loonies. We are less than a grain of sand in the universe. Of course there are others out there. Otherwise, what are all those billions of galaxies out there for?"},{"Title":"Things to Come: A Study in Biblical Eschatology (Dunham Publishing Co.)","review":"One's eager anticipation of our Savior and the completion of His marvelous work among us and for us in eternity are fueled by the truths that Pentecost teaches in his book.

He includes a detailed discussion of the timing of the rapture, the events of the seven year tribulation period, and the second coming of Christ, followed by the 1000 year Millennial reign of Christ. He then has a helpful section about the eternal state.It must be stated that this is a 600 page heavy duty textbook. It is not like reading a Frank Peretti novel or a Left Behind book.

It is not intended for someone looking for a comprehensive view of biblical prophecy. I've resorted to go over the book pretty much in the way one goes over a textbook: picking certain chapters and sections. And I've assigned myself as the professor that will decide which chapters are worth studying. :-(Not a very good method but it was that or putting it in the shelf to be forgotten.Perhaps the word \\"monumental\\" should have called my attention?"},{"Title":"Things to Come: A Study in Biblical Eschatology (Dunham Publishing Co.)","review":"This is a priceless foundation for anyone interested in, or embarking upon a study of Biblical prophecy.This book has correctly been described as being of encylopaedic proportions. Indeed, comprising of over 600 pages, it is as comprehensive a study in Biblical prophecy as there is currently available.I was first drawn to the works of Dwight Pentecost through his excellent book entitled \\"Your Adversary The Devil\\". The manner of his approach to the latter subject and the provision of such a well written and in-depth discussion really impressed me.Having studied Biblical prophecy for many years, I was thrilled to discover that Pentecost had also written a comprehensive study on Bible prophecy as well. Having now acquired this work, I have not been disappointed.Other reviewers here have commendably outlined in detail the topics covered in this study so I will not go along that path. Suffice to say that the content is exemplary.Pentecost approaches Biblical prophecy and the &#65533;End Times' from the perspective of a &#65533;Pre-Tribulation' Rapture of the Church. He eloquently presents his own interpretation of what many see as perhaps the controversial subject of the timing of the Rapture itself.I have read a number of books where individual authors disagree about the latter aspect of prophecy. Taking everything into consideration, I personally feel that this &#65533;controversial' issue should be approached and discussed prayerfully and in love, not allowing the matter to prove divisive and thus giving ground to the Adversary.With the latter in mind, may I respectfully suggest that students of Biblical prophecy also make reference to another excellent, encyclopaedic study, (itself exceeding 500 pages) by Robert Van Kampen, entitled \\"The Sign\\". Van Kampen's study is also a thorough, in-depth study, yet approaches the Rapture with a slightly different interpretation which places it within the Tribulation itself. Anyone basing their studies on these two books will find an absolute wealth of information at their fingertips to assist them with their research.In closing perhaps I could also suggest another extremely useful aid to study, in the book by John F. Walvoord entitled \\"Every Prophecy Of The Bible\\". Thank you."},{"Title":"Things to Come: A Study in Biblical Eschatology (Dunham Publishing Co.)","review":"As a whole, I did not find the book difficult or too technical for the average student of the Bible. Though some of the extensive input from other sources used archaic and technical language. I found reading the entire book enriching but it could also serve as a reference book on eschatological issues. Personally I prefer the writings of Thomas Ice on this subject but I do not believe Ice has ever written a book this exhaustive. Many consider Pentecost's work the definitive textbook on the subject. Among pre-mill, pre-trib student of the Bible, this book is a classic. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Things to Come: A Study in Biblical Eschatology (Dunham Publishing Co.)","review":"Pentecost begins with a thorough examination of the methods of interpretation to be employed in a study of eschatology. He then proceeds to discuss the four eschatological covenants and their implications on the end times from a premillennial pretribulational point of view. He cites several authors representing all views and defends his own preference quite well. He assumes some (but not much) prior knowledge of the amillennial, premillennial and postmillennial views, but no one interested in eschatology should allow that to stop them from reading this book. In fact, when I began this book I had no idea what eschatology was. I was confused for a while, but I soon caught on, and I have now benefitted greatly from reading this very biblically sound, informitive book on God's plan for bringing justice to the world. I would recommend it to any serious student of the Bible."},{"Title":"Things to Come: A Study in Biblical Eschatology (Dunham Publishing Co.)","review":"This may seem like a mouthful...but it is the viewpoint that Pentecost builds from and defends.

Dwight Pentecost, the author analyzes the alternative interpretations and then presents the premillennialist perspective. This book is much more academic than the writings of Tim LaHaye and Hal Lindsey. I have read and heard amillennialists argue that the premil school of thought was a recent invention. Dr Pentecost demonstrates that premillennialism was the school of thought in the first and second century of Christianity and that is was not until the rise of St Augustine's allegorical interpretation of Scripture that brought the rise of amillennialism. The only draw back with this work is it's academic emphasis; this book is heavy reading.

In 2009, I made a second pass through this book, and I am amazed at how solid a piece of work it is. It filled in a lot of pieces of the prophetic puzzle for me ... and has clearly stood the test of time! I heartily recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the study of Bible prophecy. It helps to have some basic Bible understanding to gain full value from this work ... or at least have a Bible handy and be prepared to look up Scriptures for those topics that you are exploring.The table of contents and the indexes (by topic, and by Scripture verse) are very good.The book takes the traditional viewpoint of eschatology, i.e., classical dispensationalism: the historical-grammatical (literal) approach to the study of the Bible, taking symbols/metaphors into account, where appropriate. It references many authors, and quotes much Scripture.I applaud Pentecost for his clear treatment of topics such as the nature of hell; the characteristics of Heaven, the Millennium, and the New Jerusalem; the major covenants in the Bible; the topic of sin; Ezekiel's description of the Millennial temple; the tribulation (Daniel's 70th week) and the rise of Antichrist; the relationship between Israel and the Church; the Rapture; the judgments; and many dozens of other prophetic topics.I will continue to use this book as a reference for many years to come."},{"Title":"Things to Come: A Study in Biblical Eschatology (Dunham Publishing Co.)","review":"In his ground-breaking 1948 work on Systematic Theology, Dr. Lewis Sperry Chafer (then President of Dallas Theological Seminary) wrote concerning Eschatology, \\"It is assuredly the desire of God that His own who are in the world shall know what He is going to do.\\" Ten years later, Dr. J. Dwight Pentecost (also of Dallas Theological Seminary) carried forward Chafer's passion for illuminating biblical prophecy by writing Things To Come, the book that is still accepted by many conservative, evangelical scholars as the most comprehensive, systematically detailed, doctrinally sound study of Eschatology available today.As did Chafer, Pentecost bases his teachings on a literal (grammatical-historical) interpretation of Bible Scriptures. Preceding the body of his work with an entire section explaining the \\"allegorical\\" and \\"literal\\" methods of interpretation, Chafer then covers the entire field of prophecy from the Abrahamic covenant in Genesis to the \\"new heavens and new earth\\" in Revelation. The strength of his work lies in his ability to clarify the differences in God's plans for Israel and her future kingdom on earth and His plans for the Church, which will reside in Heaven.Although not a book for lazy-minded prophecy faddists, any serious student of Eschatology should have this book in his or her personal library.Edwin Scroggins is the author ofBible Prophecy in a Nutshell: A Mini-Survey of God's Great Plan of the Ages"},{"Title":"Things to Come: A Study in Biblical Eschatology (Dunham Publishing Co.)","review":"This is not a book I'd reccommend someone just read from cover to cover as you would a novel but it sure is an excellent reference book for your library.

(I'm not sure I want meet someone like that, but I'm sure there must be a few out there!) ;)The value of the book is as a reference and means to study for the student or pastor who wishes to thoroughly work through the Biblical references.Don't expect very much ambiguity on the part of Dwight Pentecost. You will get dogmatic and definitive answers to the different minute elements of prophesy and eschatology (study of the end times) with little or no room for differing approaches and understandings. It is not a work to go to if you are looking for a spectrum of differing opinions. You will get dispensational, premillennial, pre-trib doctrine and it will be presented to you as unassailably true.The issue in rating the value of the book is not whether you agree or disagree with the positions espoused. The value is that you will get what the book advertises itself to be and know what the foundation is for the teaching presented.If you want a broader view you must look elsewhere or supplement your reading with other sources. Indeed, any serious student should do that, even those in primary agreement with Pentecost's exhaustive and dogmatic positions.4 stars given instead of 5, not because of the qualities of the book, but because even an academic tome of this nature could have been written to read easier and smoother. Sympathies are extended to any who are required to read it from cover to cover. As a reference it is an important and valuable work for any student of the eschaton to have in their reference library, which is where it rightfully belongs."},{"Title":"Things to Come: A Study in Biblical Eschatology (Dunham Publishing Co.)","review":"This book is a must-have for any Bible student or for anyone who is interested in eschatology in general.

A fantastic read!!!"},{"Title":"Things to Come: A Study in Biblical Eschatology (Dunham Publishing Co.)","review":"This is the book that destroyed my belief in dispensationalism.

I may still have it. For me the poor layman it surpasses my ability to endure. I read 110 pages of it and quit! I did learn that my style of Bible interpretation was the literal-historical interpretation. While people like Benny Hinn, who I have observed trying to teach the Bible is allegorical. I used one chapter which identifies the players in Ezekiel 38 and 39. Eveyone's books just say that Russia will invade Israel. But I remember him call \\"Gomer\\" there Germany. So, I just described Ezekiel 38 based on that book chapter as the nations of the world invading Israel to go to war with Jesus Christ in armageddon-Russia, the Germans and EU and the Arabs. I remember some complicated teachings about God's covneants with Isreal and Abraham. Too much for me. I just used it as sort of a reference book to look some things up in. My fomer P Chem prof, Dr. Thompson actually looks like Dwight Pentecost-how amusing!"},{"Title":"Things to Come: A Study in Biblical Eschatology (Dunham Publishing Co.)","review":"I read this book as a requirement for a class in eschatology in seminary. Pentecost block-quotes other authors for about 60 percent of his text, at which point he could've just provided a bibliography. There is little originality in thought here. Pentecost surveys the narrow world of premillenial dispensationalism and says anyone who disagrees with his viewpoint does not take the text \\"literally\\" and ignores the \\"clear, plain meaning of scripture.\\" But his hermeneutic is a bit inconsistent. He insists that various parts of the apocalyptic imagery presented in Revelation, Daniel and other parts of the Bible must be taken literally.But he then turns around and says the odd beasts in the Revelation are figurative. Okay...who's not being \\"literal\\" here?Like too many evangelical theologians, Pentecost has no concept of how apocalyptic worked in the Second Temple period. I would imagine that, having translated the Testaments of the XII Patriarchs, I've done more background work than he did in the area (unless reading the notes in the Scofield Bible counts).Instead, he spends all of his time demonizing those blasted amillenialists. An enormous waste of time and energy.Then again, the book is almost 600 pages long, and uneducated people are always impressed when they see you reading something large. But for my money, you could learn more about how to live like Christ in the light of his imminent coming (the point of eschatology) by reading an even bigger book you probably already own: the yellow one with restaurant listings."},{"Title":"Things to Come: A Study in Biblical Eschatology (Dunham Publishing Co.)","review":"If you need a new door stop OR a class Dispensational reference guide to eschatology, then Pentecost will do the job.If you are looking for eschatology that's faithful to the history of redemption, better to look elsewhere.Ironically, there's more good eschatology in Acts via the *real* Pentecost than J.D. Pentecost's understanding of Acts!!"},{"Title":"Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology","review":"I find it extremely ironic that the majority of reviews for this book address Gregory Boyd's personal beliefs--views that quite frankly have little to do with this particular work. It is first and foremost designed to be a comparative theology resource, and as such, it functions extremely well. As pointed out in the introduction, the authors do *not* intend to advocate one view over another, and each perspective is given fair and impartial examination. At no point do Boyd or Eddy adopt a personal stance or advocate a certain belief. They rather maintain objectivity throughout, a fact that is apparently overlooked by other reviewers. Again, this book is merely designed to give background on differing theological views and the evidence for such views, and it succeeds quite well in that regard. The aforementioned criticisms of this work derive from ad hominem attacks on Boyd. Regardless of the beliefs we may hold, such personal attacks belie both insecurity and inconsistency with genuine Christian beliefs. Read the book and judge for yourself."},{"Title":"Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology","review":"I read and discussed this book with three colleagues at work, all of us evangelical Christians, and we found it a very useful educational experience. Unlike what is implied in so many of the reviews found below, the authors present each position objectively. It is important to read each position carefully and to study the scriptural passages cited. One must do the spadework of checking each citation because sometimes the references to particular verses do not really support the proposition for which they are being asserted.I guarantee you that careful and diligent study of this book can be a profound and eye-opening experience. If we wish to be effective in defending the evangelical faith, then we must have a rich understanding of the traditional view and a working knowledge of alternative views. Burying your head in the sand is not an effective strategy.Read this book, but do so with great care to study the underlying scriptural references, and you will be a much stronger advocate for the faith."},{"Title":"Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology","review":"I appreciate the approach to disputed theological issues that provides an explanation of the various views associated with the issue and the biblical reasoning for those views. That is what is provided in \\"Across the Spectrum\\". Boyd and Eddy address a number of important areas where Evangelical Christians disagree, e.g., The Inspiration Debate; The Foreknowledge Debate; The Sanctification Debate; The Destiny of the Unevangelized Debate; The Charismatic Gifts Debate; and many others. These authors definitely jumped head-first into some very real and passionately argued subjects.When Boyd and Eddy address a viewpoint they provide the biblical argument for the position; as well as supporting arguments; and a response to the typical objections for the position. I got the impression that they did not intentionally shortchange a viewpoint. In their defense of each position, they made a genuine attempt to provide a compelling and convincing argument. In fact, occasionally, I agreed with all the points of view that were presented regarding an issue. In those cases, it was helpful to read an \\"Archie\\" comic book and then lay down for a while to regain my mental equilibrium.For many years, I've heard Christians defend a particular theological point of view with an attitude that suggested: \\"It's impossible for any thinking, rational, biblically sincere person to arrive at any position on this matter other than the one I'm explaining.\\" That bothers me. It's fine to be sincere and it's fine to be firmly convinced. But it seems to me that it can be intellectually dishonest to look at a theological issue that has been debated by brilliant minds for centuries without resolution--for example Predestination vs. Free Will--and suggest that your viewpoint is obviously the only conclusion that any true Christian could possibly reach.A book like \\"Across the Spectrum\\" is very helpful to someone like me who would like to try to understand the various positions and why they are held."},{"Title":"Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology","review":"This book reads a lot like the '5 views on...' series, but is probably a bit more scholarly in tone. It's a great introduction for anyone starting out studying Evangelical Theology."},{"Title":"Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology","review":"They are true to the spirit of helping the body of Christ understand the whole spectrum that compiles us. Yes, we do disagree. This book helps us at least understand why those with differing viewpoints hold the views they do from a biblical perspective, while also laying down clearly what we hold in common."},{"Title":"Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology","review":"There is a verse in James that says Christians are to be be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry. That does not seem to apply to many of the one star reviewers of this fine piece of work as they seem angry at the fact that it intends to represent diverse viewpoints taken seriously by evangelical theologians. If you are the type of person that needs to have your views affirmed and then reaffirmed, then this is not the book for you. If you are the type that wants to be fully informed of contrary opinions that present the other side's arguments in their best form, then this will be a treasure for years to come.Across the Spectrum surveys a number of important issues that have arisen in the theology of evangelicalism over the last 60 years. Greg Boyd and Paul Eddy competently represent divergent views on issues like providence, the atonement, the millennium, the nature of scripture, the genre of Genesis, and Open Theism. The book does not advocate a correct view on all of these things, but rather leaves it to the reader to think critically through the issues and polarities raised by each theological argument.If you are familiar with Zondervan's \\"4 Views\\" books, this will be similar. However, it will be better, because Boyd and Eddy are clearer communicators that reason well and write with stunning brevity. Technical language is helpfully defined in a glossary and objections as well as complementary arguments are offered at the end of each case that is reasoned from Scripture.This is the best book available for creating theological literacy and sharpening the iron of the evangelical mind."},{"Title":"Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology","review":"With all due respect to a prior reviewer about the long-standing nature of many of the disagreements highlighted in this book about correct Christian teachings in fundamental areas, the following points need to clarify his mistaken notions.1) Several of the disputes are in fact fairly recent in church history. Inerrancy (error-free Bible) was not really an issue until about a hundred years ago. There have always been squawkers who claim to have found mistakes in the Bible. But only since the late 1800's has this infiltrated into the church in any major way requiring 'Athanasian confutation'. The same could be said for annihilationism, inclusivism (salvation apart from the Gospel being heard/believed), the ramifications of the Atonement(substitutionary, judicial vs. merely exemplary or non-propitiatory), and the heterodox open theoreology of divine ignorance of free-will futures + theo-repentism + God changing as it is beneficial to change + surrendered sovereignty + risk taking vulnerability to failure + other Hartshornian Processism-like ideas (&quot;Trinity and Process&quot;,&quot;Omnipotence &amp; Other Theological Mistakes&quot;).2) While it seems true that the authors do not advocate any one position over another or try to 'convert' anyone to their liberal views, the fact that aberrantly minority views are placed side by side with historically held non-liberal majority confessional teachings with no judgment call gives them equal billing and tacit approval as &quot;no less evangelical, just as valid&quot;3) Some reviewers like lots of options to choose from. It seems so democratic, American and independent to be able to vote for what suits personal preference. What about what the Lord's preference is? See Revelation 2 &amp; 3. How does John the Apostle of Love look on false doctrines/idolatrous notions in his epistles? If only Christians today would read the epistles from the viewpoint of the Lord and the apostolic authors, they would not so cavalierly be open embrace so many differing viewpoints in fundamental areas. Spectrum in this case really means Speculation, Spectral scattering, diffusion of Truth.4) Some think only what is in the Apostles'/Nicene Creeds should be the bounds of what is Essential Truth. But any review of Church history and what Luther, Arminius, Wesley, Knox, Spurgeon, and others had to say about what are Fundamentals will see this is grossly oversimplistic and naive. Aren't the Attributes of God Essential? The Nature of Scripture, Inerrant or not? 100% Verbally Inspired or not? Heaven &amp; Hell - literal, conscious, eternal, bodily or not? The list goes on for thoughtful Christians who know better, or ought to.This book is deceptive to such a degree as to lead many astray as to what is appropriate for Christians to profess.&quot;If you hold to My teachings, you are truly My disciples, and you shall know the Truth and the Truth will set you free.&quot;"},{"Title":"Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology","review":"Too often people are taught in the church that a particular tradition is what the Bible teaches.

I've also found that pastors and church study groups have tended to avoid developing even a simple theological understanding of scripture. The books i've read so far haven't, until now, really focused on key ideas as if being succinct were a fault, and, these same books have tended to display considerable bias. I am very pleased to have in my hands a book that has not [yet] shown bias on the part of the author and the author has done such a good job of succinctly presenting all of these conflicting ideas in a manner that makes both the original ideas and their conflicts very clear. Thank you to the author for having provided this important text.I've given this book 4 stars because the footnotes are not live. You have to search the book, just as you would for a printed book, to find each book mark. By \\"live footnotes\\" i mean that you can click on a footnote and you will be taken to the footnote and with a button you can return to the point where you were reading.

Easy to read and comprehend. For that I give it two stars. Recommended for those studying the topic. It really does not get overwhelming for the lay person.One warning: Pastor Boyd's \\"open theology\\" viewpoint leaves me absolutely awestruck that such a learned man could be so in error.Pastor Boyd is selling a man-centered viewpoint of God that plays perfectly into the selfish, \\"Me-First\\" generation of growing evangelical Christians. It sure has translated into large crowds in his church. His mantra is: \\"I have choice... and God doesn't know who is going to be saved.\\" Ultimately, such teaching leads a \\"seeker\\" or an immature Christian to have a far too small picture of a sovereign God and a much too large sense of human control and power than the bible teaches. Christians are merely the clay. God is the potter. (2 Cor. 4 and Romans Ch. 9)Boyd lifts sections of Old Testament scripture where God rhetorically asks questions such as \\"I didn't know man could be so wicked\\" and \\"I never imagined man could do this\\" and builds a theology around non-literal speech. See Isaiah 4:4-5 for an example that Boyd likes to use: God said He didn't expect bad grapes to grow where he thought good grapes would grow. Boyd's conclusion: God doesn't know the future. Baloney. The author of the Bible, the Holy Spirit, is merely getting the reader to think. By taking isolated verses out of context, Boyd fails to accept the bible's consistent message of how God has revealed His complete omniscience, if no other place, through continual, countless examples of fulfilled prophecies. If God doesn't know the future, how did Zechariah know that the Messiah would ride into Jerusalem on a donkey? (Zechariah 9:9) 450 years before it happened !! There are hundreds of more examples in the bible of God detailing history before it happens and the events happening. Daniel Chapter 11 was exactly fulfilled in the years before Christ's first coming. Boyd chooses to ignore the obvious lessons of prophecy and pick on the Holy Spirit's poetic speech upon which to build his doctrines.Boyd is growing a mega-church here in the Twin Cities area ala... Rick Warren and Bill Hybels. Like Saddleback and Willow Creek, the church growth is through worldly seekers attracted because of an incomplete picture of God and a drastically superinflated picture of man. (These mega-pastors know that a solid, true biblical message will be largely ignored so they have gone off and invented an approach that will play to the crowd. They are more like used car salesmen than biblical pastors!! )This distorted approach to evangelism fits perfectly with Revelation Ch. 3 and the Church of Laodicea which is neither hot nor cold. These kind of churches hold a form of godliness but deny the power thereof. Such messages tickle people's ears but are rubbish, dung. Paul warned against such teachers who preach to people with itching ears. (2nd Timothy 4:3-5).Buyer beware of Open Theology. Broad is the way that leads to destruction. Few find the narrow way."},{"Title":"Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology","review":"If an author's plot is worthy, it will stand on its own merits.In this case, the plot is unworthy. It totters on its demerits.What Mr. Kuruzovich is innocent of is the crucial fact that historic evangelical confessions were clear in affirming cardinal truths while rejecting heretical alternatives in the same document. Never did they use the approach of this book in placing Right and Wrong side by side with no verdict. They always boldly declared (even at the risk of life &amp; limb) this is right/acceptable; this other is wrong/unacceptable.Essential doctrines encompass much more than the skeletal Nicene or Apostles' Creeds. Anyone like myself, a student of Reformation History, only has to look at the documents and see how the Protestant churches contrasted Biblical truth with the heterodox positions. Orthodoxy was upheld as correct. Unorthodoxy was condemned and rejected as invalid and incorrect in no uncertain terms.For one of the few times in church history, a book like this has dared to place Orthodox and Heterodox on the same pages and label both/either correct. Nothing is flagged as incorrect. It's fine to affirm or reject an error-free bible? Both will fly across the sky in Heaven's eye?What would the Church Fathers and Reformers think of us watering down their unambiguous stand for Jesus' own truth? How far have we fallen?"},{"Title":"Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology","review":"This book rates 1 reluctant star. Engagingly written, but serves only as a mask of Boyd's true intention: to claim his personal positions 'Evangelical' while subtly undermining the Genuine, Historic Biblical Doctrines of Christianity.While posing as a 'devil's advocate' of the opposing side on many issues of contemporary Christian Theology, Boyd unwittingly goes too far in his essays revealing his antipathy for the Evangelical position in many cases, especially Inerrancy. He couldn't be more patronizing to true Evangelicals.Cleverly calling his position 'Infallibilist', he violates his own BGC Affirmation of faith at Bethel College (where he is a professor) and his own church Woodland Hills. BGC clearly states in Affirmation of Faith: Bible is INERRANT. But Boyd slyly and short of intellectual integrity writes the essay refuting Inerrancy in favor of an ERRANT BIBLE. He leaves the reader hanging about apparent discrepancies in the account of the \\"70(sic) missionaries\\" in the Gospels. 'Staff or no staff?'Embarrassingly, not only is Boyd himself ironically ERRANT (it was the 12, not 70!), he fails as a serious scholar to admit this issue has been chewed on and resolved satisfactorily by the Reformers and recent real Evangelical scholars like Geisler (When Critics Ask)and John MacArthur's Study Bible (Luke 9:3). Mark says 'take nothing except a staff'; Matt./Luke say 'do not acquire/go get a staff'. Boyd cries, Aha! Mistake! Gotcha!Sorry, Gregory. All Jesus is saying without contradiction is basically, \\"Take along only what you have in hand; if you have your staff, fine. If not, don't go get/buy/procure one. Don't bring anything extra but the sandals on your feet and the clothes on your back.\\" The accounts are most likely composite of several trips or likely Mark is one specific representative trip. All are excerpts. We don't have full transcripts or the whole packing list. Boyd is looking for errors/conflicts when they can readily, plausibly be explained(since Church Fathers).Why not give the eyewitnesses who were actually there - and the Holy Spirit Himself - the benefit of the doubt?? Fair enough??Since he rejects his own BGC denomination's Affirmation on Inerrancy, his presuppositions are showing in his 'devil's advocate' essay.Why his own denomination President Jerry Sheveland or Bethel trustees don't resolve the matter by Boyd's public, repentant retraction or resignation is not Across the Spectrum, but Beyond the Bounds.This book is Boyd's 'coming out' as clearly NON-Evangelical, aberrant, heterodox, false doctrine, pseudo-theology.However the book is recommended to see how far some who claim Evangelical status have strayed from the Inerrant Word of God."},{"Title":"Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology","review":"After reading this very misleading book, I came to these conclusions -1)The church is in trouble as rarely ever before in understanding what the Bible has to communicate about the reality & eternal torment of hell, the inerrancy of scripture, the attributes of a God Who knows for certain all free futures in their entirety, among other important teachings people seem to have lost2)Many otherwise sincere Christians and theologians are confused as to what constitutes Bible truth. \\"Academic Freedom\\" seems for many to trump sound doctrine. There is a \\"smorgasbord theology\\" approach to all things Jesus commanded. Even scholars with their ThD's are swept up in the deception that multiple versions of key doctrines are tolerable, even if mutually exclusive or contradictory or modernist philosophy-based3)Unbelievers are then also seriously misinformed by inconsistent witness if the wide range of opinions in this book can all be called 'Evangelical Christian Major Beliefs'.I was almost in tears as I went through chapter by chapter. Doctor Greg Boyd writes so convincingly of his misguided teachings as to make them palatable to unwary readers not grounded in principal doctrines of God's error-free Word.I do thank God for the genuine traditional truth the book communicated, especially about the Gospel of Jesus. But to have truth mixed in with false ideas and scholarly misbeliefs and labelled 'This is alright to believe as long as you are sincere' is sad, so sad.Prayer to the Lord: Please forgive these authors, for they know not what they do in blending the wrong with the right, the false with the true, the opinions of men with the certainty of God.

Arranged into sections by the specific \\"Debate\\" in question, such as \\"The Foreknowledge Debate\\" or \\"The Atonement Debate,\\" the authors cover each of the major viewpoints within the debate, with evidence for and evidence against each view. No conclusions are drawn for the \\"best\\" position and no personal opinions of the authors are specifically stated.As far as outlining the basics of each issue and presenting valid for/against evidence, the authors succeed admirably. They cover all the foundational issues without lapsing into detail-obsession or gross generalization. For these reasons, I can recommend this book to others. My own convictions, however, require me to address another important issue. One of the authors, Greg Boyd, has a very political interest in the success of this volume. As a leading proponent of the Openness of God, as well as Inclusivism and a non-literal interpretation of Hell, Boyd very subtley includes these less-than-widely-accepted evangelical beliefs in the book. Maybe he thinks that by repeating the mantra, \\"We ARE evangelical, we ARE evangelical, we ARE evangelical,\\" everyone else, who have their doubts, will eventually catch on. Personally, I have my doubts (lots of them) and I am not catching on. Both Boyd and Clark Pinnock have accused the defenders of traditional theism of presenting political, rather than theological, arguments and strategies. Clearly, the same could be said of them, or at least of Greg Boyd. This book, though offered with a different stated purpose, is a very flagrant attempt to broaden the evangelical \\"tent\\" and include theological positions that are, according to many if not most evangelicals, cleary less-than-evangelical.

The more I read, I found a literal hell and a non-literal one? Inerrant Bible and Infallibilist(?). God knows all free decisions in advance and/or He does not?

One opinion is posited as no better than another, as long as we love and tolerate each other and widen the 'evangelical tent'.Bizarre doctrines like annihilationism (the Jehovah's Witness' non-literal Hell, which inanely downgrades one side of the Eternal Coin not realizing the automatic downgrade on the Heaven side of the same coin!)and Open Theory of Bible Interpretation and its presumptuous and preposterous pontificating of &quot;Theo-repentism&quot; and &quot;Divine Nescience&quot; are just a few of the major problems with such books.While the authors try to make a readable showcase of all the varying points of view, by not taking a stand or being clearly Pro-Scriptural or Anti-Scriptural on major doctrines, the novice and the undiscerning are left to flounder and shipwreck on the reefs of aberrancy.The issue is not &quot;understanding issues in evangelical theology&quot;;the issue is Understanding Scripture and letting it define what Evangelical is. Much of the material in this volume is beyond the pale of Evangelical without being clearly identified as such. It unfortunately acts as a platform for the &quot;new vs. true&quot; tendency by many seekers after new winds of doctrine. It emboldens many to keep stretching the envelope until it overflows or bursts, unable to hold anything.As long as 'evangelical' can encompass the spectrum of heterodox aberrations of Open Theory as espoused by Pinnock, Boyd, et al, denying a literal Hell as taught clearly by Christ, and redefining the Attributes of God, we end up with a different 'christ' and render the term 'evangelical' devoid of Biblical distinction.One star is one too many. Better is Millard Erickson's Christian Theology which does a far superior job of comparing the various positions of doctrinal issues and comes down clearly and Biblically on TRUTH, not speculation and iffy indecision, leaving the reader to guesswork or conjecture and at risk from the cults and the slippery slope toward heresy."},{"Title":"Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology","review":"To paraphrase a saying, \\"In essentials unity; in other things liberty; in all things charity.\\" With \\"Across the Spectrum\\", Greg Boyd and Paul Eddy have put this into practice, surveying a wide variety of what I call \\"next-tier\\" Christian doctrinal questions. In this unique book, each chapter deals with a different issue in Christian doctrine, each issue the subject of considerable past and/or present interest and debate among evangelical Christians, and each one outside the common ecumenical core of Christian doctrine. Or rather, not outside that core, but at a more-detailed level of extrapolation and understanding of that core, while remaining within it.For example, Body and Eddy explain in their first chapter, all traditional and evangelical Christians affirm the divine, infallible, and unique inspiration of the Bible. This is a core (ecumenical) doctrine. But what does it mean to say the Bible is inspired of God in this way, particularly with respect to mundane and spiritually-ancillary Biblical details such as geneologies, chronologies, observations of nature and creation, and so on? Is it to say that the Bible is without face-value error in all its statements, even these? Or is it to say that the Bible faithfully communicates what God intends it to, without pollution that would interfere with his redemptive message - a position allowing for imprecision or inaccuracy in Biblical details extraneous to faith and practice?In other words, is it verbal, plenary, inerrant inspiration? Or infallible concepts transported by human literature? This is the \\"next tier\\" to the inspiration doctrine, and most other Christian doctrines likewise have \\"next tiers\\" of their own. In these \\"next tier\\" issues, Christians have long had liberty to explore and debate, even while both affirming the general doctrines within which they nest, and charitably acknowledging one another's faith.\\"Across the Spectrum\\" affirms this charity, presenting chapters on such issues as:- What does it mean to say God is in control? Predestination? Or mere foreknowledge?- What does it mean to affirm humans are free and morally responsible? Is this compatible with predestination and election? Or not?- Was Christ's atonement limited or not? Does God save (and condemn) by election? Or by human response to his grace?- What happens to the unevangelized, those who die without the knowledge of the core Christian doctrines?- What is a permissible way of interpreting the \\"days\\" creation account in Genesis? Is Genesis 1 scientific and historical fact (perhaps phrased phenomenologically)? Or is it storied theology?Each chapter begins by summarizing the issue and presenting the core, general doctrinal stance taken by all traditional Christians at all times, in contrast to modernist or non-Christian views on the issue. Each chapter then, in sections, puts forward a well-argued case for each position. Arguments are based primarily on Biblical exegesis, but include some theology and philosophy and also include counters to common objections. Naturally, space limitations constrain each argument to a high level and just a few pages. But arguments for each position are nonetheless faithfully, fairly, and forcefully presented (I often found myself agreeing with whichever position whose argument I read most recently :-).In summary, charity for the diversity of viewpoints within Christianity is perhaps the hallmark of this unique book. For that reason, some conservative Christians will have a hard time with this book, believing many of these \\"next tier\\" issues are, in fact, obviously answered by Scripture, and that those answers are thus squarely part-and-parcel of the general core doctrines themselves. Thus no debate over them is legitimate, and other views (such as many of those presented by this book) flirt with apostasy. For a doctrinely-legalistic Christian, who defines the saving essentials so that they include a hundred or more narrow, systematic theological claims that would take dozens or hundreds of pages to explicate, \\"Across the Spectrum\\" will be a hard swallow. For Christians more inclined to the example of the Bible itself - a work of anything but systematic theology - \\"Across the Spectrum\\" will be a valued resource."},{"Title":"Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology","review":"Most of the reviews of this book are missing the point of this book. The varying views given in this book have come out of thought and interpretation of what is written in the Bible and who they believe God to be. The point is for the reader to not only read the different views given in this book and \\"pick and choose\\", but to thoughtfully read along with the Bible and try to come up with their own coherent worldview.Not to mention this is only an introduction to the different evangelical viewpoints that are around. It's not that they are supposed to choose one or another (more than likely their views are already solidified), perhaps it could be viewed as a tool to understand and communicate with christians who have different views on God, Creation, etc... Maybe even a way to debate with someone who you might think has the wrong view."},{"Title":"Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology","review":"Boyd and Eddy have written something close to a masterpiece when it comes to discussing issues in practical theology. In this book, arguments for each side are clearly presented, argued, and argued against. In the end, the reader is left to decide what they think is true, and is given resources to help them figure out what is true.Howeverm, one may object (as Mr. Scott does) that the Bible is the sole source of truth, and we must follow its word. Granted, but what exactly does the bible say about these issues? That is the issue at hand, and to simply reject one side of the discussion without careful thought is outrageous. Indeed, if the Bible were as clear as many people would like to believe, then there would be no need for this book. However, to sustain this position, one needs to simply denounce the works of many evangelicals, without regard to the work God has done in their lives, dismissing it as the work of Satan.I apologize for that excursion, but such character attacks are silly and unfounded, and the authors deserve to be defended against such attacks. The book they've written, though not perfect, is a model for how evangelicals should deal with differing viewpoints; in love, and with an open heart and mind."},{"Title":"Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology","review":"I came on-line today, looking to purchase 50 copies of this book. We use it as a supplement in the second year of the discipleship program we run at our church (based on a 21-month curriculum I co-wrote). I couldn't believe that the reviews are only averaging 1.5 stars-- and had to write a review (my first). A low rating for this book is patently absurd. This book is AWESOME for looking at the two or more \\"sides\\" of various topics within the pale of Christian orthodoxy. If you're looking for an objective account of how \\"good people have disagreed\\"-- now and in the past, then you've come across an unmatched resource. If you insist on dogmatically holding to a single view on these complex topics, this book will frustrate you. Unfortunately, that is a reflection of your legalism/dogmatism, not an underlying flaw in the book."},{"Title":"Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology","review":"This great resource reads kind of like a collection of cliff notes on those \\"3 Views\\" and \\"4 Views\\" books I'm always thinking about reading but never get around to. Boyd and Eddy do a fantastic job of appropriately representing the various positions on a number of confusing topics. With only two exceptions (The Threefold Self and the Cessationist View on the Gifts) I found myself either agreeing or saying \\"Wow, I guess I see how someone with a high view of scripture can actually believe that.\\" Oh, and there is an on-line appendix that covers another 12 topics.I agree with some of the reviewers that a couple of the positions (e.g. the openness of God) I would not include in self designated evangelical discussion. However, in the author's defense, there are individuals and movements that would like to both call themselves evangelicals and hold these positions, so they are worth being informed about.The text focuses on the biblical data with lesser space devoted to philosophical arguments and appeals to church history. This is not a devotional text (look elsewhere for that). However, on the whole it is a worthwhile and accessible 263 pages that will help a reader defend their position, understand the diversity in their movement and give a hearing to the vast reservoir of Biblical data."},{"Title":"Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology","review":"This is an excellent book.Its excellence is not so much in the contents discussed but by the fact that the differences within Evangelicalism are finally laid open for all to examine. In the spirit of Zondervan's &quot;views&quot; books &quot;Across the Spectrum&quot; will only serve to improve academic, intellectual, theological, and philosophical reflection.Differences in theological issues are many. However, they need not divide but make up the richness of what Roger Olsen calls the Mosaic of Christian belief.Those who attribute to Boyd malicious ulterior motives are misguided. &quot;Across the Spectrum&quot; to anyone who reads it is not meant as a defense of any particular view. Opposing views are each fairly represented and easy to understand.Rather than labeling our brethren as heretics for holding diverse viewpoints (within the pale of orthodoxy) and accusing some of attacking God I wish others would look beyond their own insecurities, biases and presuppositions and enter into humble dialog with opposing views."},{"Title":"Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology","review":"It shouldn't have to be said, but since no one has REALLY said it, I will. Do you negative reviewers actually believe that the authors hold all of these views? And that it is their intent for you to just pick any of them (cafeteria-style) and that they're all equal? Do you think that they crafted all of these positions? From many of the comments, some of you are placing the blame on Boyd and Eddy for presenting views held by a good number of your fellow believers. PLEASE....before blasting away with all the negativity, understand what the intent of the book is.Several of the reviewers here \\"get it.\\" I have read this book and refer to it regularly when trying to understand the basis for a position that I do not hold when I have come across someone who does hold such a view. And, by the way, you can't tell from reading this book what position the authors actually hold, anyway. Can any of you tell me which of these views are held by Paul Eddy? I don't think so. Just because you may have read some of Boyd's other books and think you have him pegged, doesn't mean that these topics aren't treated very fairly in this book. It's a great resource and its a shame that many of us are so quick to criticize without using the wisdom that God has for us.Note to Jan from Baltimore - I read your four other reviews, too. Do you have anything edifying to say about anything? You're very verbose (are you sure you didn't go to an Ivy League school?) but really didn't say anything of value, in my humble opinion.This book has helped me to strengthen my conservative beliefs (not obtained from \\"liberal Yale or Princeton\\", Jan) via solid scripture and to better understand other evangelical beliefs (and their history) held by Christians with whom I will celebrate with in heaven. Just because we don't all hold the same EXACT beliefs about non-core salvation issues, if we have repented and now follow Jesus, we can sing His praises in the Kingdom....together.Let's focus on what we have in common as believers rather than simply trash something we don't understand.By the way, if you're an evangelical Christian, I'll bet that your beliefs are fairly presented in this book. Nice work to the authors on this one!"},{"Title":"Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology","review":"How very frustrating this becomes. Within two days of my pointed observation regarding the purpose of this book, another review again targets it for reasons beyond that very purpose. I now feel as if it's almost pointless to try further elucidation of its value, but I might as well try again.Firstly, Ms. Ashton suggests that Across the Spectrum reveals severe divisions within the modern church, resultantly causing the actual Biblical truth to be scattered. Quite frankly, such an opinion betrays a severe lack of knowledge about church history. Of all of the views presented in this book, *none* are younger than two hundred years, and most have been passionately debated for well over a thousand years. I seriously doubt that modern culture has caused this diversity of opinion when the opinions themselves predate that culture by hundreds upon hundreds of years! These same types of theological argumentation can furthermore be traced directly to the generation immediately following the apostles--such debates were the very reason for the canonization of the New Testament. Contrary to Ms. Ashton's belief, the &quot;splintering&quot; of the modern church does not exist due to these beliefs, and the church has never been fully united on any *one* of these issues.Secondly, Ms. Ashton refers to many of the arguments for various positions as &quot;theospeakish doubletalk&quot; that call into question even the essentials of Christian faith. Again, this raises questions regarding the reason behind her position. The Christian position, as defined by the Nicene creed (generally accepted by nearly all denominations as the uniting Christian beliefs), describes only a few *necessary* beliefs: Christ, the Son of God and one with both the Father and the Holy Spirit, became man, was crucified to redeem mankind of its sins, rose on the third day, and will return to judge mankind. *That* is the uniting Christian belief, and none of the positions in Across the Spectrum call these claims into question. Ms. Ashton's identification of Christian &quot;essentials&quot; is completely off-base.Finally, I do not intend to criticize or belittle, but I simply cannot stand idly while individuals criticize a book and its author on the basis of perceived flaws and ideological motivations when those very criticisms have no sound basis. Again, this book is intended as a RESOURCE to better understand differing theological perspectives, and succeeds very well. It does not advocate one position over another, it does not call into question core Christian beliefs and it most certainly does not intend to &quot;convert&quot; you to one perspective over another. Perhaps once more people begin to realize this, they will give Across the Spectrum a more fair reading."},{"Title":"Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology","review":"In spite of all the criticism it has received here, I think this book does a good job of presenting the various evangelical positions on the issues it covers. It's a great starting point for anyone wishing to explore or develop their own views on these issues in light of the differing positions taken by other evangelical Christians. Some have criticized the authors for bias toward their own views. But that's to be expected from a book like this. No one is completely unbiased. The intent of the authors is not to have the last word, but to help Christians begin to think through their positions on important theological issues. If you are afraid of having your theology challenged, either don't read the book or don't be afraid. It can be a great learning experience if you approach it with a critical, but open, mind. If you do read the book you should also be willing to do further reading and study on issues that are important to you. Each chapter has good list of further reading at the end for that purpose. Whether or not some of these positions are held by a majority of evangelicals is beside the point. The Bible is used as the authority in defining every position described in this book. That should be enough for any evangelical Christian to give it consideration.As far as Janine Wigram's comment on and earlier edition this review goes, \\"Just because some theologaster quotes verses to 'support' the position doesn't legitimize it. How naive and silly to suppose that mere citation of Bible texts sanctions a theological position as Evangelical or Scriptural.\\" This is is true. It's just as true of her quotation of Rom. 16:17-18 and her application of it to the views that oppose hers in this book. As anyone who has read the book can see, Boyd and Eddy do more than just prooftext Scripture. I think they are doing with it what any honest and committed Christian ought to do: Study it carefully to see what it really teaches us. For those of us who admit that our interpretation of the Bible may not be on par with the Apostle Paul, this book is a good place to start (not the last word, by any means)."},{"Title":"Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology","review":"Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology by Gregory A. Boyd and Paul R. Eddy is a fantastic introductory book on the various doctrinal viewpoints of evangelicals, including the foreknowledge debate, the creation debate, the Christology debate, Calvinism/Arminianism, charismatic gifts, women in ministry, and end times I used it in the preparation and teaching of a Theology 101 course at National Community Church.It is not meant to be a systematic theology textbook nor is it written from the doctrinal positions of the primary authors. It does not attempt to present a balanced overview of Christian doctrine or to argue for the superiority of one viewpoint over the other. Rather, it serves as an introduction to the diverse theological perspectives represented in the evangelical church. Obviously, we don't have everything figured out yet and probably won't have most things figured out this side of heaven. But this book made me want to dig into Scripture more, search for the Truth more, and appreciate the diversity of the Body of Christ more.The writing is clear, concise, and engaging. It was an easy yet informative read. It's not comprehensive, and some of the chapters certainly do not capture the complexity of the issue at hand. But it's a great reference point for understanding the diversity of thought in evangelicalism.As endorser Dennis Okholm of Wheaton College said, \\"At a time when some are tempted to mistake the white light of evangelical orthodoxy for a single band in the spectrum, Boyd and Eddy remind us just how colorful evangelical theology can be. The authors do what no book on the market does: In one volume they faithfully represent divergent views on the crucial issues that divide evangelical, and they do so in an ubiased, succinct, and lively manner.\\"If you are looking for a quick snapshot of Biblically-rooted theological perspectives, I would recommend Across the Spectrum. Hopefully, this book will help us understand and appreciate the diversity in the Body of Christ more."},{"Title":"Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology","review":"Much of this book is quite helpful when it sticks to basic Bible truths historically held by genuine Evangelicals regarding the Gospel, Deity of Christ,Justification, Sanctification and so on.But 4 stars deducted for labeling liberal, non-evangelical philosophies/fabrications as 'Across the Spectrum' i.e. within the bounds of Evangelical Historic Christian Faith.Right off the bat, Boyd (a Bapt. Gen'l Conference pastor of Woodland Hills Church and Theol. Prof. at Bethel College) denies his own denomination's Affirmation of Faith regarding Bible Inerrancy. BGC used to require all pastors/professors to uphold and abide by its Affirmation of Faith in all matters.(Will BGC Pres. Sheveland and upcoming Annual Convention enforce their Affirmation by requiring a retraction or resignation from the wayward false-teacher??) But Boyd for upwards of a decade has not only jettisoned much of his denomination's Doctrinal Statements,(see his first book Trinity &amp; PROCESS, liberal,unbiblical non-evangelical philosophtheology that is the fountainhead for all his beliefs/books) but publicly teaches and authors books promoting clearly heterodox, aberrant and liberal (Princeton/Yale variety)neo-Processism theories about God's attributes no longer being literally OMNI in nature; theo-repentism, God 'changing as it is beneficial to change' including the Divine Mind/Will; 'the future doesn't exist until free agents create it for God to know as fact';etc.Where does Boyd get all these ideas? Not from an Inerrant Bible. He believes in 'Limited Infallibility' which is theo-speak for the Bible is error-ridden in matters of science, history, nature, philosophy, biology, geology, etc. It is only 'infallible in matters of faith and practice' according to Boyd (see his Woodland Hills Doctrinal Statement re the Bible). Of course, Boyd does not address in his essay in the book how the Bible can err in matters not relating to faith/practice (things we can see, taste, test, verify), but not err in areas we can't verify. Evangelicals historically have believed the entire Bible relates in one way or another to 'faith &amp; practice', even history, science, nature, etc. If the Word of God can't get the one motif right, how can it get the other one 'without fail'???If God can author the universe by saying, 'Let there be Light!'Can't the same Author author a flawless Book and get it right?Another problem is Boyd's dismissal of a literal, real, eternal hell for the lost. He speculatively advocates a form of annihilationism or reprieve or some other neutralizing of the full force of the Biblical description. (Why he doesn't advocate making similar neutralizing adjustments to the language for the 'Heaven side of Eternity's coin' makes his position even more dubious and lopsidedly inconsistent.) Boyd claims that the Bible's language for hell is contradictory: 'flames of fire' and 'outer darkness' are &quot;mutually exclusive&quot;. Boyd can't envision how darkness and flames of fire can co-exist simultaneously.But genuine Evangelicals can. Look at aerial news footage of a volcano lava flow or forest fire at night. Pitch dark atmosphere, but glow of deadly, devastating fire in the damage path. Dark and fiery at the same time. Boyd cavalierly dismisses the metaphoric language of Jesus Himself in describing the horrors of a real, literal, burning, outer darkness eternal punishment. That's his privilege. But to call his contrived 'non-literal,non-eternal' hell an evangelical belief is Beyond the Bounds of Christian and academic integrity. Revelation says, &quot;They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever&quot;, &quot;will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and the Lamb&quot;, &quot;the smoke of their torment rises for ever and ever&quot;. If anything, the real darkness,literal fire, endless conscious torment of hell vastly exceeds the limits of inerrant Biblical language to convey. The Bible understates the facts, where Boyd would have us believe it overstates/exaggerates the literal truth.Sorry, Gregory Boyd. We'll stick with Revelation, and what Jesus, John, Peter, Paul, Jude, Isaiah and the Word of God inerrantly declare as fact about eternal conscious punishment.This book is helpful to see just how far some Christians will go to stretch the tent ropes to include all sorts of contra-Biblical modern theories and presuppositions under the label'evangelical'. But calling a sterile mule or diseased donkey by the name of Stallion does not make it so.If this book is compared to &quot;Beyond the Bounds&quot;, &quot;God's Lesser Glory&quot;, &quot;God Under Fire&quot;, &quot;Bound Only Once&quot;, &quot;Battle for God&quot; and the forthcoming &quot;God's Greater Glory&quot;, Boyd's aberrancy can be clearly documented in detail for the concerned Evangelical.It is dismaying to see how Boyd's processist philosophy lens has blurred his theological teachings into myopic heterodox nearsightedness. He needs a new Optometrist: the Holy Spirit and a Large Print Bible."},{"Title":"Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology","review":"Are we to condone Open Theism, the Literary Framework view of Genesis, and the Moral Government view of the atonement as legitimate evangelical viewpoints that can be set along side other historically credible believed truths? Moreover, if so, are they to be given equal space? Should evangelicals be led to believe that anyone affirming the Bible contains mistakes be given equal credence with one who believes the Bible is inerrant? Granted, the authors have sometimes specified where a new belief has entered the discussion. For example, under arguments against women in pastoral ministry, the topic of church tradition is mentioned, but only briefly. It states, \\"...the church has almost always forbidden women leaders until recent times,\\" p. 229.However, it is the opinion of the reviewer that more weight should be given to well-established beliefs that have guided the church for centuries. No one new to the Christian faith should be taught that the annihilationist view has run concurrently along side the classical view throughout the last twenty centuries.It seems that in a world of pluralism, it is popular to present a smorgasbord of ideas for consideration and let the readers \\"fend\\" for themselves. Books seeking to avoid coming across as overly dogmatic and authoritative present multiple options with the hope that the shear weight of the truth will carry the day. Surely, Boyd and Eddy, themselves two evangelical scholars, want readers to come to the truth. However, instead of writing to convince, they write in a very non-biased way (self-described as the \\"liberal arts approach\\" to theology, p. 6). Boyd and Eddy use this approach with hope that the beginning theology student will not only gain the correct perspective amidst all the dizzying array of point, counter-point, banter, but that they will understand the truth, and in the process, gain a deep appreciation for the other side.This may not be the best approach in a day and age when truth and clarity are so needed. Instead of being conformed to the world's subjectivism, evangelical writers should write to persuade readers, contending for the faith once delivered to the saints. Evangelicals should be more polemic. Classical positions that were once secure need to be fought for again with added vigor. It seems wishful thinking to present four or five different perspectives to readers, some novices at logic and theology, with dangerous ideas and incredulous thoughts, along side with classical views, all with the hopes that they will be better off in the end.Boyd and Eddy hope the beginning student will be tempted to get more direction from the bibliographies, but alas, that is often not the case. A student confused about what to believe about the hell debate goes to the bibliography only to find more confusion in the form of Crockett's \\"Four Views on Hell.\\" Granted, there are books that argue for the truth, but they are thrown in with others that militate against it. What is a person to believe? Why are there so many evangelicals writing \\"View\\" books, and less and less writing for the truth? Evangelicals are loosing their influence because they are loosing their passion to advance the truth. Moderate and liberal writers seem to have no such problems. While \\"Across the Spectrum\\" is a well-written, well-researched book, it cannot be recommended to college students (the targeted readership, see p. 6) because it is the firm conviction of this reviewer that students introduced to biblical theology should be introduced to a more conservative work that seeks to advance what the church has taught for centuries."},{"Title":"Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology","review":"\\"The Bible is used as the authority in defining every position described here.

How naive and silly to suppose that mere citation of Bible texts sanctions a theological position as Evangelical or Scriptural.Where does this sort of sloppy thinking lead? Cults, that's right. LDS and Jehovah Witness quote more verses than almost everyone. Does that make their doctrines Evangelical or Scriptural???? NOT.Think again, amigos, when imagining that multiple differing viewpoints about significant doctrines is acceptable in the Evangelical Fellowship of Faith. Is that how the Lord taught his disciples - agree to disagree? Is that how Paul in Romans taught his flock, with the apostolic injunction to tolerate doctrinal diversity in key areas like afterlife, God's attributes of Omniprescience and Omniscience, whether Scripture is wholly inerrant/infallible or only Ltd. inerrancy???? Sounds a lot like speculative theospeak and redefining of terminology to confuse the weakminded.This book teaches the polar opposite of Paul's warning in Romans 16:17-18:\\"I urge you brothers to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way contrary to the teaching you originally learned. Keep away from them. For such purveyors are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own appetites (intellectual speciousness).

Her husband's gone missing. Why then, instead of going to Missing Persons, has she sought out the Chief of the Murder Squad? It turns out that Kevin Coyle isn't truly \\"missing\\". He simply hadn't made it home without assistance. The help was needed because Kevin's heart had taken a knife. And Katie Coyle, with some help, fetched him to his bed. Dublin, however, was suffering an unusual heat wave. The unusual wake would have to close and the murder, after three days, finally be reported. Kevin, it seems \\"is going off now in the heat\\"!This bizarre opening typifies the remainder of a story of a quietly dedicated Dublin copper. Peter McGarr, who starts his office mornings with a strong tot in his coffee, is compelled to deal with Katie Coyle, her unusual cronies, and Kevin Coyle's former role as a \\"Joyce Scholar\\". Joyce's magnum opus, \\"Ulysses\\", which McGarr pitched into a corner the first time he attempted it, figures large in this story. Not least because one of Coyle's tasks was acting as a \\"Joyce Tour Guide\\" for his colleague's tourist business. If the world needs yet another analysis of \\"Ulysses\\", Coyle has just completed one. It was to be launched just after he was murdered. Publishers being what they are, the release goes ahead on time, accompanied by the usual fanfare and parties.McGarr, not being a \\"private eye\\", has a team of his own colleagues. Working, as they do, in Dublin provides both flavour and spirit to this narrative. Hughie Ward, a boxer on the side, is a young policeman with ambition. A detective \\"as soon as was possible\\", Ward is a notable figure in many ways. But when he slips up, the result is almost as devastating as the figure he cuts. The most interesting member of McGarr's team, however, is its \\"token\\" woman. \\"Rut'ie\\" Bresnahan is an ample country girl who knows that to rise in the Garda Siochana, she must be better than the men. Since she believes she's better than the men, this should pose no problem. However, her respect for McGarr still leads her to bring his coffee during Squad meetings. Rut'ie is confronted with a string of challenges in proving her worth. How she meets these makes for wonderful reading. Her shopping expedition provides a delightful image of the \\"new\\" Dublin compared with Rut'ie's rural origins and the older Ireland they represent. None of Gill's characterisations are flawed. Encountering them is a treat in each circumstance.The \\"Ulysses\\" connection pervades this story, but Gill, a reasonable man, makes no assumptions of his readers. You needn't have read Joyce to follow McGarr as he copes with the many ties between this murder investigation and the classic. In many ways, of course, this story provides a reflection of Joyce's, as Gill intends it to be. Both are, after all, reflections of the Dublin of their time. Gill's superior handling of these ties as we progress through the mystery demonstrate his prose skills and dedicated scholarship. This book might actually prompt me to start Joyce's classic again.

The murder being handled sometimes seems secondary to other issues in their lives. While I did have some trouble keeping the three potentially villainous women in this novel clear in my mind, it was nevertheless a fun read. I have always avoided the reading of Joyce's Ullyses, but Gill makes an excellent case for my reconsideration of that decision.

Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Death of a Joyce Scholar","review":"In 1986 I went on a literary tour of Ireland visiting the country for the first time.Our first day in Ireland was in Dublin and dedicated to the writings of James Joyce. We visited Glasnevin Cemetary and afterward went downtown to Bewley's Cafe for lunch. We visited Trinity College (to see the Book of Kells) and various pubs and shops near the quays of the Liffey River. We saw the Shelbourne Hotel, the boarding house where Nora Barnacle lived, and St. Stephen's Green. The next day we went out to the Martello Tower featured at the beginning of ULYSSES; we climbed up the narrow steps to the parapet and gazed across Dublin Bay to Howth Head. All these places are in Gill's novel.Peter McGarr is a Dublin Garda policeman charged with solving a modern-day murder of one Kevin Coyle found in Glasnevin Cemetary. Coyle has just led a Bloomsday tour of the places visited by Leopold Bloom, James Joyce's intrepid Irishman and protagonist. ULYSSES chronicles the passage of Leopold Bloom through Dublin during an ordinary day, June 16, 1904 (the day of Joyce's first date with his future wife, Nora Barnacle). McGarr reads ULYSSES to follow in the footsteps of the murder victim and find a murderer. We the readers get to look over McGarr's shoulder as he reads.Toward the end of THE DEATH OF A JOYCE SCHOLAR, the suspect is spotted by a squad member as he dashes across Grafton Street and heads for Bewley's Cafe (where we had lunch that first day in Ireland):\\"In a few quick steps he was off the curb and across Grafton Street toward the swinging doors of Bewley's, which was always packed but especially at this hour and time of year...bumped through the swinging doors into the wide foyer of Bewley's, a baked-goods and candy-sales area...moved toward the main tea room and the lift and stairs that led...to a second floor dining room.The main dining room was a turn-of-the century relic with tall ceilings and large, multicolored, leaded-glass windows. It was divided into two sections: the smaller served by waitresses; the other cafeteria-style, with tables and deep, red-plush sofas...there was a long line at the sandwich, salad, and dessert cases, a longer one still at the hot-meal, steam-table service section. Only the four women at the tall, chrome coffee urns that dispensed Bewley's renowned brew seemed to be filling orders quickly.\\"Oh, goodness, I just enjoyed a coffee white, a fresh-cut sandwich, and some of that finely-cut veggie salad that has no mayo. Wonderful!Everytime I read this Peter McGarr title....I revisit both Dublin and the pages of ULYSSES. Wonderful!(Postscript: Joycean scholar Michael J. O'Shea was so impressed with Gill's novel that he wrote a witty book review for the Spring 1990 James Joyce Quarterly declaring \\"Look, Muffy, a book for us!\\")"},{"Title":"The Death of a Joyce Scholar","review":"One reads a detective story for the mystery, yes, but also for ambience and for the peculiar collection of people that a good author typically assembles as suspects and others touched by the crime. These are the particular strengths of this novel. The setting is Dublin: the very real modern city and the almost mythical version of it that has grown up over a century or more or literary history and national struggle. The mythic element is enhanced in this case by the fact that the murdered man is the leading Joyce scholar of his generation, and the colorful cast of characters (ranging from rival academics to decidedly liberated women plus the odd urban punk) all seem to know their Joyce also. Not only know him, but live him: the novel is colorful, exuberant, erotic, but also quietly insightful.It becomes clear that the murder, which happens on Bloomsday -- the day portrayed by Joyce in his great novelULYSSES-- is closely tied to events in that book; but fortunately I could still enjoy Gill with only a cursory knowledge of the Joyce. While this book did not particularly grip me as a mystery, it did send me out to buy a copy of ULYSSES, and give me not only the inspiration to read it properly, but also quite a few clues on how to do it."},{"Title":"Manual of Developmental and Behavioral Problems in Children (Pediatric Habilitation)","review":"This book will help you evaluate, diagnose and manage pediatric patients with developmental and behavioral problems.

He's received some attention recently because his novella \\"Dream Story\\" inspired Kubrick's \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\". (\\"Dream Story\\" is also excellent and can help you understand the movie.) \\"Casanova's Homecoming\\", if you can find a copy, is well worth reading--compact, simply told, carefully plotted, thoroughly thought-provoking. It relates a fictitious episode in Casanova's life when he has become an old man of 53. Most of his charm and all of his money are gone, but his cravings and amorality remain. Quite by chance, he comes to visit the home of an old acquaintance who is much indebted to him, and immediately sets out upon a dark seduction. It is a story about growing old, about how one's struggle to remain young can become pathetic and ugly even when it succeeds. Schnitzler likes to write about sex, dreams, coincidence, free-thinking, and deep mysteries of the soul--\\"Casanova's Homecoming\\" gets you thinking about all these themes, mainly because it's very hard to ascertain Schnitzler's attitude toward Casanova--does he like him? Loathe him? Pity him? Does he have any feeling toward him at all? After reading this, you may find yourself asking many such questions. This may have been the author's intent: his writing seems designed to provoke questions rather than provide answers. He does it well!"},{"Title":"Fanny Herself","review":"Last year I had to do a research paper about three American authors for an English class. I picked Edna Ferber as one of the authors, hoping that I would be able to relate better to a female author. I was at first skeptical about the book, because I'm not a big fan of classic books, but I sat down with it and after a few hours of convincing, I finally opened the book. To this day I'm still glad that I did. The story tells the tale of Fanny, a young independednt Jewish girl from a small midwestern town who's drive to become a business woman soon takes her from the small town she grew up in and plops her down in the middle of a large city where she takes a job as a sales lady, determined to prove herself. Through light humor and a playful tone Ferber shows the reader how Fanny at first struggles, but then succeeds in turning a thriving business completely around, and giving the company a whole new meaning to life. Though at first I didn't think this book would be any good at all, I encourage everyone who has ever strived for a goal in life to read this book--it will give you such a respect and admiration for Fanny that you won't be able to put it down until the very last page."},{"Title":"Fanny Herself","review":"The daughter of a Hungarian-born father and Milwaukee-native mother, Edna Ferber spent much of her childhood years in small midwestern towns. Her family, while not observant, always closed their store for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, never missing a Passover seder. Ferber felt that being Jewish was to be subjected to anti-Semitism. In 1917 she wrote Fanny Herself, based largely on the experiences she had while growing up in Appleton, Wisconsin and later in Chicago, Illinois. Her's is a tale of a young Jewish girl trying to become a successful businesswoman in early twentieth century America without denying her Jewish roots or subverting her social conscience. This newly abridged, four cassette, six hour audiobook edition (wonderfully narrated by Suzanne Toren) will introduce a whole new generation of listeners to a remarkable literary talent and an engaging, personal, affirming biography."},{"Title":"Fanny Herself","review":"I downloaded this on my kindle as I had never before read anything by her and I have to say its a wonderful read. Its an amazing semi-autobiography narrative of an independent smart businesswoman in a time when women, let alone Jewish women, didn't often pursue business and the influence of environment and family is timeless. I can't wait to read some of her more famous novels -- Giant that became the famous movie and So, Big for which she won the Pulitzer Prize. I googled her and found many fascinating facts about her including the many plays she wrote with George S. Kaufman and the anti-semitism she faced by some of her contemporary authors.Worth the read for a voice on being a woman and being a Jew in an earlier American era. But more so, its value is that it is a well written charachter study and just a really great read. I wish I'd discovered her years ago and I'm excited to jump into her whole collection."},{"Title":"Fanny Herself","review":"I love Edna Ferber's work because she offers such a detailed look at her characters, and also succeeds in capturing a moment in time, place and history. The ending took quite a leap, for me, but overall I loved the book. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Fanny Herself","review":"Edna Ferber's classic novel \\"Fanny Herself\\" is many things. It is a \\"semi-autobiographical\\" novel about a young girl growing up in Appleton Wisconsin in the late Nineteenth and early Twentieth Century. It is loosely based on episodes from her own life, and other family members. Her older sister was named Fannie, and was the author of a famous cookbook titled \\"Fannie Fox's Cookbook\\". In her autobiography \\"A Peculiar Treasure\\" Ferber even quotes several episodes from this book saying that the account cannot be improved upon.But this is also a novel about religious tolerance and the culture of the midwest during this period of history. Ferber is an acute, humorous, and precise observer of culture and behavior. Her eye for detail, and her ear for dialogue are apparent in the many plays and movies which she wrote. Her observations of the pleasures of growing up as a bright, curious, and Jewish girl in small town Wisconsin are both revealing, and amusing.Ferber also writes tellingly of the dynamics of her family, a father who could not work, and had no business instincts; a mother who was proud, capable, and competent, unafraid of taking risks, and a sibling for whom much was sacrificed.Perhaps the most interesting story in this novel evolves after Fanny leaves home and goes to work for a new, rapidly expanding, mail order catalog company based in Chicago. A thinly disquised version of the new and explosive company subsequently called Sears and Roebuck. Although this part of the story is fiction, the descriptions of Sears, how it operates, how it changed American business, it's management, and it's methods are excellent. As with her famous Emma McChesney stories, Ferber is able to capture the essence of business transactions as interpersonal relationships in a way that no other author has done. Ferber wrote about businesses all over the United States, from the riverboat business of Showboat, to the oil business of Giant! Her novels are extensively rooted in the growth and challenges of business owners, workers and customers.One of the great scenes of the novel is the description of a Suffragette parade in New York in the years before WW1. It brings into sharp focus the feelings of women who were unable to vote, even as they expanded their roles into all other areas of society.This novel is a great place to start for anyone who has not read Ferber. It has many of the themes and even some of the characters of her other work.

This is one of his most interesting works. And his ruminations are quite relevant today. A key point at the outset of this work (Page 19): \\"If I am right in what I have been saying, there has developed in this century a functional derangement of the relationship between the mass of people and the government. The people have acquired power which they are incapable of exercising and the governments--they have lost power which they must recover if they are to govern.\\"He notes another disjunction--between \\"the people\\" and \\"THE PEOPLE\\" (my distinction in caps). As Edmund Burke, he does not believe that the people, as in government by the people, refers just to those living. In his view, THE PEOPLE is (Page 32) \\". . .a community of the entire living population, and their predecessors and successors.\\" Applicability? In today's toxic political atmosphere, the parties are only interested in their current base and those independents whom they can claim and, perhaps, scraping away some of the other party's supporters. In the process, the past and the future are neglected (again, Burke speaks to the same issue).Democracies need civility to function; they also need a \\"public philosophy,\\" based on core values, to bind the country together and to structure political discourse. I suspect that Lippmann would be most distressed to see the partisan divide today (although this is certainly nothing new in American political history). For instance, he argues that such things as an absolute right to property is not appropriate when one has a public philosophy. There is a greater good than the right to property. That gives a taste of his views with one specific example.It might be that many Americans would be richly rewarded by reading Lippmann's work. I surely have many questions about his argument, but the seemingly quaint arguments that he makes might lead to a more productive political process. The current \\"blood sport\\" does little good for the larger public's interest."},{"Title":"Public Philosophy","review":"Walter Lippmann is one of my favorite non-fiction writers. He is a brilliant man, and his work has contributed greatly to the modern American political landscape. It's sad to see this book going out of print. Few tomes grant such insight into the fundamental weaknesses of democratic nations. In an age where the United States is the undisputed military power, some have confused democracy with god. It seems democracy is a word thrown around carelessly as a cure all for the world's ills. The Public Philosophy stays true to the Founding Father's fears that a democratic majority is capable of being as oppressive as a monarch. I highly recommend this book to any serious student of political science."},{"Title":"Public Philosophy","review":"Walter Lippmann's The Public Philosophy is as relevant today as when it was written in 1955. His assertion that the traditions and customs of civility are in decline in both America and the West is only reinforced by the growing unreason and incivility of our age.Lippmann's belief that a role for political philosophy(ers) is of vital importance if our free and democratic institutions are to be preserved is right on the mark. The Socratic pursuit of the &quot;examined&quot; life is more rare today than ever. And yet, for that reason, it is all the more important.The Public Philosophy is a &quot;classic&quot; and serves as a reminder that the solutions to the problems of democracy are not found in further democratization.E.

The book is full of boring BS passing for history, but when Lippman kicks in accusing the public of being ill informed and stupid, he's at his best, or worst depending on how you see things.He's pretty much in bed with Aristotle, so if you agree with that jerk, you'll love Lippman."},{"Title":"Fair Play: The Ethics Of Sport, Second Edition","review":"Simon's book is a classic in the discipline. His account of sport as \\"a mutual quest for excellence through challenge\\" is influential in the field, and in my view is correct. The book deals with many ethical issues in sport, such as performance-enhancement, gender equity, college sports, and the commercialization of sports. This book could also be useful as an introductory text in a philosophy course, as a way to show the value of philosophical reasoning for issues in daily life. It is very readable and free of jargon. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a thoughtful exploration of some of the key ethical issues in contemporary sports, in both theory and practice."},{"Title":"Fair Play: The Ethics Of Sport, Second Edition","review":"FAIR PLAY: THE ETHICS OF SPORT appears in its third edition to provide new sections analyzing sports, games, and ideas of philosophy.

It includes Holocaust testimony and fiction, autobiographies of mental breakdown and journeys to the innermost chaos of the psyche, as well as feminist, postmodern, and post-colonial interventions and re-interventions into the discourse that Kurtz in Conrad's Heart of Darkness summed up so vaguely, improperly, but memorably, as 'The Horror! The Horror!'.These writers that Falconer has chosen to discuss, are generally of a secular rather than a theological bent and as the book argues eloquently, when faced with the traumatic events that have shaped Western reality {in particular the Holocaust], they have reinterpreted and rewritten the older classical narrative of the descent into Hell or the Underworld as a way of trying to come to terms with their experiences and feelings. It is perhaps the central paradox that the book brings to light that such stories for all their difficult engagement with horror and pain also seem possessed like their classical and Judaeo-Christian models of the energy of heroic and angelic struggles that seem to gain their fractured protagonists the urgent power of truth.I would tend to disagree with the review above which takes the book for fault for not being interested in the more quasi-traditional reworkings of Hell found in populist Horror writers such as Stephen King, Anne Rice, Clive Barker, Peter Straub. These texts are in fact just re-workings of an older, imaginatively drained theological understanding of the descent into Hell narrative for our more secular age, and are like all Gothic fictions capable of little more than an ability to drum up the salaciously measured terror of things which we know in truth do do not exist. In contrast, the writers that Falconer chooses to focus on tell us of a world that we not only knows exists but which is our own, however uncomfortable that makes us feel. Primo Levi lived in and wrote with a memory of hell on earth that was quite real, while Anne Rice's world is just re-manipulating previous elements of the Gothic genre. Jacques Coulardeau thus misses the obvious fact that just because writers may share a similar imaginative idea they are using it for the same reasons, but while adverts for chocolate bars remind us of the memory of how pleasant chocolate is to eat that does not mean that such adverts are doing the same thing with memory as Proust is.In the end, what Falconer has done here is examine how narrative itself while it does not offer any kind of salvific strategy to redeem or transcend chaos, suffering and pain for the writers under discussion in their perception of the world, does at least allow the story to be told. As Beckett remarked in the Unnameable, surely itself an impressive descent narrative. - 'I can't go on, I'll go on'.Steve Barfield, UK"},{"Title":"Hell in Contemporary Literature: Western Descent Narratives since 1945","review":"Rachel Falconer has a hell of a good subject for a fascinating book in her title. Unluckily the book is not up to the title. She only considers the books (and most of them are not fiction but memoirs) that are historically oriented and rooted. She excludes from her study all these authors who deal with Hell, Satan, the devil, etc, in a purely fictional and imaginary way. She also imposes onto her subject a vision she derives from Dante, distorting his Inferno on the pattern of Orpheus's descent to Hell to get Eurydice and his re-ascent, his coming back from Hell. In the Inferno, Dante imagines that he is a tourist there, and he is the one to descend to Hell, hence an intruder and an unwelcome body in this universe. His conclusion is that he is defecated out of Hell by Lucifer himself (Falconer reads Dante coming out of Hell through Lucifer's torso : we must not have the same version of the book). And then he finds himself on a road up to Paradise through Purgatory. The book is full of interesting remarks but she misses Stephen King, Anne Rice, Clive Barker, Peter Straub, and so many others. The book is also biassed by a post-modernistic ideology that makes her consider that the present world is too much of a hellish place to have any future. We can only dive into the Hell of this world and enjoy its exquisite suffering. She also considers that the vision we can have of the world has been radically changed by Auschwitz and the Shoah and that this event is the starting point of modernity, of our modern world, and our post-modern phase in this modern world. Then she pushes the ideological bias one iota further by circumscribing the modern world in its post-modern phase, between Auschwitz and September 11. That is a limited catastrophic and apocalyptic vision of the world. She then misses the attempt of most writers and film-makers since the Second World War to rethink these concepts of Hell, Satan and evil in order to show that Hell is never what we think it is and that Hell is never where we think it is. We may think of the novel Memnoch by Anne Rice. But we have to think of the underworld in Stephen King's Dark Tower saga, an underworld that used to be pure and to support the balance of the overworld, till the overworld, our real world, was perverted and soiled by evil characters and actions, which created an unbalance and a rotting process in the underworld menacing in its turn the overworld. And we have to think of the end : killing the crazy Crimson King, which opens on the same finishing page in the seventh volume as the opening page of the very first volume. Starting all over again, but with a few changes because the conditions of this repeat have slightly changed in the seven volumes of this saga. Falconer gets the idea that nothing is that black or that rosy with Salman Rushdie who obviously considers his moving to the West to be an ascent and not a descent. But she does not develop and it remains marginal in her book though it should have been made the very central starting point of her research.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"The Bible book by book","review":"Josiah Tidwell Blake taught scripture at Baylor University in Texas for 36 years.

In fact, I'll go so far as to say that I picked it up, read the first page and put it down in favor of something else.A few months later it was still sitting in my book bin, and I suppose I must have felt sorry for it, being neglected as it was, so I chanced it and cracked it open.I'm so glad to be wrong! I really, honestly and truly, enjoyed this book from start to finish. I found the hero refreshing, engaging, and a man I could really cheer for in the end.In reading many of the other reviews, I will agree that the way the book begins was the reason I didn't wish to read it at first. I just simply wasn't in the mood to deal with the possible let-down of the heroine dying before the book's end. Having finished it, however, I think the beginning was a rather brilliant stroke on Ms. Putney's part, as I spent most of the book in fevered anticipation of when \\"the bomb\\" would drop.It was a well-crafted bit of work, and I would recommend this author to anyone."},{"Title":"The Bartered Bride","review":"I enjoyed this story. It was intense and unusual; the plot kept changing with the setting. I could never tell what would happen next, as is often the case in many \\"cookie-cutter\\" romance novels. The setting was different, the plot was original/creative(to say the least!) and the story was unpredictable up until the last few pages. It has gone in my \\"keeper\\" pile!"},{"Title":"The Bartered Bride","review":"My favorite Mary Jo Putney books are about characters fighting their own flaws(Rake and the Reformer). Once again, she's given us a depressing story about characters fighting extraordinarily evil and appalling circumstances, being victimized in excruciating detail.Like \\"The Spiral Path\\", the reader is more depressed than entertained(I guess for our own good),and is given descriptions of sex rather than romance.About the only saving graces are that the book is a bit short, and the dour Michael Kenyon makes just a brief appearance. I guess I'll just go back and pull out my tattered copies of her earlier paperbacks."},{"Title":"The Bartered Bride","review":"Mixed reactions - riveting first half, slower second half; ending felt rushed and seemed ridiculous, trite and cliche all at the same time; a hero too good to be true (though that wasn't so bad, Gavin Elliot was pretty great in The China Bride too). What bugged me (and others) was an overloaded plot line that had holes big enough for a truck to drive through. Many characters/subplots are introduced and then disappear for no apparent reason (think Daisy, the mysterious slaver, the obsessive former flame). It got to be weird and distracting after a while. I kept wondering what happened to the editor for this one. I am not surprised it received a lower rating than The Wild Child (amazing) and The China Bride (almost as good). It is not necessary to read this story to get any \\"closure\\" on the Bride Trilogy, which is not something I would say about the Fallen Angel series by way of comparison. So, I recommend skipping it. Certainly don't waste your money buying it - check it out from a library if you're curious."},{"Title":"The Bartered Bride","review":"This book was exciting, a page turner, and refreshing reading about a strong heroine and respectable hero in the days of long ago, where pirates and treachery abound. For what Alex endured in the hands of others, Gavin was the perfect healer of those wounds. He had his demons but not to the extent of complicating the story, just making him human. I look forward to more of Ms. Putney's romance novels, her mix of characters and passion in a world of time past."},{"Title":"The Bartered Bride","review":"This is my first book by this auothor. I found it to be exteremely different from the conventional historical romances which I'm used to reading. I do have to admit, that Gavin was described as the epitome of male perfection - which obviously is very unrealistic. I found many facets of the story quite realistic, for instance how the characters dont immediately fall - like how its usually portrayed in other novels...it took them a good 6 - 8 months to fall in love.... i found this idea quite close to reality. The initial attraction is present of course, and it wasnt overstated.All in all...i enjoyed this book and the writing style of Mary Jo."},{"Title":"The Bartered Bride","review":"I agree with other reviewers who discussed the lack of written emotion in this novel. In fact, I considered it as I read it and noticed that as the novel progresses, so to the characters and the emotions. Alexandra Warren first meets Gavin Elliot while she is a slave in the East. She was captured by pirates, seperated from her daughter, and sold into slavery. Gavin Elliot lost is wife and child and has spent his life on the sea making a name for himself in the shipping industry and meets Alex just when he is about to make some very large changes in his life. From the moment they meet their lives are changed forever and they are thrust into an adventure more rich than any I have read about before. From freeing Alex from slavery to arriving in England there is never a dull moment.However, from the beginning of this book it is obvious that both will have to overcome tremendous obstacles, emotionally and physically in order to make their relationship work. Due to their circumstances they are required to do things in a more backward fashion than one is used to reading about. Therefore, the book progresses slower and more delicately...but no less enjoyable. All in all, THE BARTERED BRIDE is a novel filled with adventure, history, and a lesson in the gift of learning to love and trust, even when you did not think it possible. No couple deserved a &quot;Happily Ever After&quot; more than Alexandra and Gavin."},{"Title":"The Bartered Bride","review":"I loved the story, I loved the characters, I loved everything :)What I especially like about MJPs writing is that she never reveals all that happened to her heroes at once. Reading her books is like unwrapping a gift - on every page, you remove one more layer and see what is underneath much more clear. That makes the story much more interesting - I really don't like it when all the problems are revealed on page 1. I also like all the cats she has in her stories - I love cats, and they make everything a bit more interesting :) And, last but not least, her author's notes are always worth reading.Thank you, MJP, for another great book! One more keeper on my shelf :)"},{"Title":"The Bartered Bride","review":"I am usually a huge fan of Mary Jo Putney but this particular book left me wanting more. One of the issues is that the first chapter is actually near the end of the story. This sort of tells you what things are leading up to. This for some reason really annoyed me.Another issue was that while the book was unabridged by tape 5 I found myself skipping parts that seemed to have no bearing on the story as I thought it was dragging on and on and not going anywhere fast.In this story you learn about Alex who was taken prisoner (along with her daughter) while sailing home from Australia to England. Along comes Gavin 6 months later and sees Alex up for auction at a slave market in the East Indies. He tries to buy her but the Sultan know what he wants and makes him win her instead, yes the last item in the game is easy to figure out is going to happen.Then they find her daughter and eventually get married along the way there is fires, murders, dishonesty, brutal rapes, unexpected inheritance, deception, an almost hanging etc...I still recommend the book but I wouldn't put it on my top 10."},{"Title":"The Bartered Bride","review":"Mary Jo Putney used to be one of my all time favorites because her characters who had depth. Like many readers, I reread books because I fall in love with the men and women. In \\"The Bartered Bride,\\" Mary Jo picked an interesting plot, full of possibilities, but it was boring! It had no magic, no zing! Although there was plenty of sex, there was no passion. I found myself not caring about either of the protagonists. I knew I was supposed to feel sympathy for them and suspense at the various trials the hero underdoes, but I didn't. I read the first 60 pages and just scanned the rest of the book. It was almost as if this novel was written by the numbers by an author who was herself not particularly interested in her characters but had a contract to fulfill. Writing is a magical process and for the last couple of Mary Jo's books, the magic has been missing."},{"Title":"The Bartered Bride","review":"Mary Jo Putney has added another book onto the list of must reads.

THE BARTERED BRIDE is strongest when set in Indonesia... Putney handles the emotional damage done by Alexandra's captivity and brutalization perfectly...The English component of THE BARTERED BRIDE is still fine adventure. Still, the motivations for Alexandra's kidnappers to hold her alive seems stretched.

I really enjoy Mary Jo Putney's writing and now want to read every one of her books."},{"Title":"The Bartered Bride","review":"I'm a little surprised at the bad to mediocre reviews for The Bartered Bride because I absolutely loved it, getting completely drawn into the sweeping adventure. Although in saying that I'm brand new to author Mary Jo Putney and don't generally read a lot of historical romances so I can't make any real comparisons either. What I can say is that I couldn't put this book down; I loved MJP's style of writing, the depth of her characters, the original story ideas, the suspense, the exotic locations and the absence of any TSTL moments.This was a couple that actually talked to each other, so that the conflict here wasn't based on silly secrets or misunderstandings. Gavin and Alex are both adults carrying scars and they dealt with things sensibly. (i.e. they don't jump each others bones and fall in love within a matter of days) They get to know each other, they disagree, and they have issues that need time and patience to work through.And speaking of patience what a superb hero we get in in Gavin, he's just, well...such a nice guy. I fell a little bit in love with him even though I prefer my heroes more on the alpha side. And without going into detail I also have to give credit to the research into the time, it felt very authentic. I even learned me a thing or two.Alexandra Warren and her young daughter are returning from Australia after the death of her husband when their ship is attacked by pirates. Captured, separated and sold into slavery its going to be 6 months before Alex gets her first glimpse at rescue in that of Captain Elliot.American shipping merchant Gavin Elliot has built a fortune in the Far East but his adventures are coming to en end. En route to England he has one last anchor drop before he starts a new life. Whilst being shown around the (make believe) Indonesian island of Maduri by the ruling Sultan, Gavin is appalled to see a European woman being auctioned off in a slave market. Before he can buy her freedom the sultan acquires the woman for himself, (to use against Gavin as a means of blackmail and to acquire his shipping fleet.) The Sultan then offers a wager; if Gavin can beat him in \\"the lion's game\\"- a series of tests decided on by the role of the dice, the woman is his; if Gavin loses he gives up his fleet and ten years of his life in servitude.The first half of this book is just awesome, I never knew what contest the role of the dice would bring next, I defiantly didn't expect \\"worshipping the goddess\\" however. And while this enters into bodice ripper territory its handled here with ... can I get away with sensitivity? Yeah it's still rape no matter how you look at it but remember Gavin is a nice guy and kinda forced into it.Okay anyways, the second half of the book takes place in England and while very different its no less enthralling. We have a marriage of convenience, two strangers getting to know and trust each other, a forced lordship, a kidnapping, some surprising sex scenes and charges of murder.While others have complained about the predictability of the plot here it didn't bother me. Yeah the villains were a bit cartoonish but I found it clever how the story opens with Gavin awaiting trial in the tower of London and then makes its way back to how he got there (big surprise who he \\"murdered\\") Towards the end of the story I had forgotten all about his fate and was then on absolute pins as he walks to the hangman's noose, assured of certain death. His inner thoughts here were real and heart wrenching. I'm just so happy to have found a new author with such a huge backlist for me to discover. Adventure and romance await. Cheers"},{"Title":"The Bartered Bride","review":"I have read many of Putney's delightful historical romances, but of them all this one is my favorite.

Very good and it's always nice to see members from her earlier series. The fallen angel books where some of the first romance novels I have ever read so those characters have a special place in my heart!I just wish those older books were available for download on my Kindle."},{"Title":"The Bartered Bride","review":"I like books that start off with a bit of a bang. This one certainly does.In the Tower of London, an adventurer is awaiting trial for the murder of his wife, whom he loves quite dearly. For Gavin Elliot life on the seas and dry land has been a long series of hairbreadth escapes, and winning the love of not one, but two women. Now he's lost everything.We get the heroine, the blond and beautiful Alexandra Warren in the middle of a pirate attack in the East Indies. Recently widowed, and with her young daughter, Katie, in tow, she's seeking to return to England and her family. But captured by pirates from a close by island, not only is she separated from her beloved daughter, she is subjected to a life of horrors.Noted romance author Mary Jo Putney gives us another entry in her \\"Bride\\" series, with the title in this one coming from the events surrounding Alex's captivity by the decadent Sultan Kasan. The Sultan offers Elliot a choice -- to rescue Alex he must win at the challenges of the Lion's Game, or help the sultan build a merchanting empire. The fact that the sultan uses piracy to terrorize local shipping is a little matter here as well -- and Elliot has pressing business in England over a touch of revenge. How he manages to outwit the Sultan and rescue Alex and her daughter makes for one of the more entertaining sections of the novel.Returning to England, our two main characters have managed to make a marriage of convenience, but further troubles await in persistant would-be lovers, a pack of in-laws (mostly characters from previous Putney novels that I found to be distracting), and that murder charge that the novel opened with. While I don't mind flashbacks as a plot device, sometimes it gets annoying. To the author's credit, her handling of the old tried-and-true \\"captured by pirates\\" storyline is here told in an inventive style, and kept my interest until the end of the novel. Both of the characters have emotional baggage that they cart along with them, and Putney handles the sensitive issue of rape and abuse in a dignified manner, much different than the usual \\"forcible seduction\\" that's a stock in trade of bodice rippers.The bad part of the novel is that the villains are pretty much stock characters here, with only the Sultan being at all interesting (enough to make me wonder if Putney was setting him up as a future hero in a forthcoming book), but the others are pretty much one-notes. The really bad part is that the novel could have been more interesting if the extra characters had been cut out -- I kept getting distracted and bogged down with the little tidbits that Putney kept tossing here and there. Still, it's an interesting read for those of you who like their romance novels with plenty of adventure, and Putney has a deft touch in her writing style. Even the erotic bits are tasteful, and that's rare thing to find these days."},{"Title":"The Bartered Bride","review":"Mary Jo Putney is never afraid to tackle more complicated issues in her historical romances (i.e. alcoholism in \\"The Rake\\" and depression in \\"Veils of Silk\\"), and she takes on some doozies in \\"The Bartered Bride\\"--slavery, rape and its aftermath.The heroine, Alexandra Warren, is a young widow who is traveling back to England from Austrailia with her young daughter when their ship is attacked by pirates in the East Indies and Alex is sold into slavery. Six months later, Captain Gavin Elliott is visiting the island of Maduri and sees Alex being sold in the local slave market and attempts to buy her freedom. The Sultan of Maduri refuses to let him, recognizing that Gavin's concern for the English slave woman may be a way to control the independent Captain. Gavin must risk his own freedom and even his life in a series of tasks known as \\"The Lion Game\\" before the Sultan will agree to release Alex.Gavin is about as decent a guy as you will ever find in a historical romance and Alex is a *very* strong heroine. The story is complicated and the situations heart-wrenching as Gavin tries to help Alex recover from the abuse that she endured as a slave and resume her life. This is definitely *not* light, fluffy romance, but it is different and interesting and very well-written for the most part. (The boiler-plate last minute rescue scene at the end was a bit over-dramatic for my taste, but was fun to read if a bit predicable.)A well-written book about a complicated subject with a wonderful hero and strong heroine."},{"Title":"The Bartered Bride","review":"I am with those that do not like to start out going backwards when I read - I prefer to read beginning to end. However in spite of that fact Putney creates a truly emotional read with her story of Gavin & Alex. When Alex is captured and enslaved early in the story you truly wonder how she will come out of it not permently scarred. How fortunate she is that Gavin Elliot comes along and becomes her protector and rescuer - He truly is the kind of man women are all looking for. I mean he has only even had one woman in his life - unique to these stories for sure. It will take much patience and trust between this couple to ever find true happiness though. And their horrors do not end with the islands of the East - when they return to London they still have demons to fight. Of course when a couple fears they have lost each other for good that is when they realize the love they have long felt. This is truly a wonderful love story!!"},{"Title":"The Bartered Bride","review":"Okay, I have to share right off the bat, this is my first Mary Jo Putney book. How this writer escaped me, I'll never know. To say she is a SUPERB writer is almost an understatement.Accosted by pirates while traveling back to London with her small daughter, Alexandra Warren finds herself sold into slavery. She immediately finds herself separated from her young daughter. Unable to accept this, or her captivity, she's passed from master to master because of her unwillingness to accept her fate. It's not long before she finds herself on the block in the market, being sold to the highest bidder.Gavin Elliott, merchant prince of the high seas, finds himself touring a foreign island with a feared Sultan. Because the Sultan is trying to court his agreement on a business venture, he's giving Gavin the red carpet treatment. While touring the market area, Gavin finds himself entranced by the woman who's up for auction. When he realizes she's a European, he feels obligated to do what he can to help her escape her fate. The only way the Sultan will allow Alexandra to be free, is for Gavin to compete against him in an ancient challenge-if the Sultan wins, he gets Gavin in service for ten years. If Gavin wins, he getsAlexandra, and the Sultan will trace her daughter. Finding himself unable to let the beautiful Alexandra suffer, Gavin agrees. He's faced with many tough challenges-but the toughest is something he'd never dreamed of. Can he betray Alexandra's trust and grant their freedom?Alexandra is bitter and scarred, and can't imaging allowing a man to touch her and enjoying it. But she finds Gavin a beautiful person, both inside and out. A man who's good and moral, she wishes she'd met him long before. And Gavin is quickly finding himself falling for the spunky and courageous Alex...but how to gain her trust, and help her overcome her fears?Wow! I think I read the first 50 pages without even blinking-this story is that riveting. Beautifully written, Ms. Putney paints such a clear picture with her words you can actually smell the air, hear the activity that's taking place, and feel every emotion the hero and heroine go through. This is one of those stories you reserve a special spot on your keeper shelf for. I know this reviewer is going to be out glooming Ms. Putney's back list-If they're even half so good as The Bartered Bride, I know I'll be impressed."},{"Title":"The Bartered Bride","review":"The historical romances of Mary Jo Putney are usually peopled with eminently civilized and sensible characters, who know that passion is destructive if it is not governed by reason, friendship, and respect. They often find themselves in exotic locales and impossible situations, but love - and a stiff upper lip - always prevails. The Bartered Bride is a perfect example.Gavin Elliott is a prosperous merchant. While trading with the Sultan Kasan, tyrant of an Indonesian island, he spots a beautiful European woman being sold as a slave. Appalled, he tells Kasan that he wishes to buy and free her. Kasan, who desires to control Gavin, acquires the woman himself. The two men make a wager: if Gavin succeeds in completing a series of Herculean tasks, he will win the woman to do with as he wishes. If Gavin fails, he must work for Kasan for a period of ten years.The woman who is the prize of this contest is Alexandra Warren (those who follow Putney's works will recognize her as Amy, the intrepid daughter of the heroine of Shattered Rainbows). On her way home to England after being widowed in Australia, Alex and her daughter Katie were taken by pirates. Alex has been raped and brutalized by her captors, and she is desperate to find her daughter. She recognizes that Gavin is a good man and trusts him with her friendship.The last task in Gavin's contest with Kasan puts Gavin and Alex together in a painful situation that jeopardizes the fragile trust that is building between them. This is only the beginning of their adventures together.The first half of this book, which takes place in Indonesia, is a real page-turner. Putney excels in her description of the frightening Kasan and of the imaginary Indonesian island he rules. When Gavin and Alex return to England, the romance heats up while the adventure slows down.Gavin is an engaging hero. A strong man, he is secure enough in his strength to forego the swaggering that so many romance novel heroes seem to enjoy. Born in Scotland and raised in America, he has staunch republican convictions and a deep contempt for Europe's aristocracy. Upon returning to England, it will come as a shock to him that, not only is Alex closely connected with the nobility, but he is, as well. Gavin's obvious love for Alex is touching, and his patience and understanding with her make him thoroughly sympathetic.I had a more difficult time imagining Alex, who I found to be serene beyond belief. Admittedly not all women respond to rape and abuse the same way, but Alex's reactions were sometimes difficult for me to imagine. For instance, immediately after being rescued from slavery, we learn that \\"Despite nightmares, the next days were the happiest time Alex had known since she'd married and left her parents' home.\\" I thought, \\"She is so in denial.\\" Throughout the book, Alex will have some difficulties in the marriage bed, some emotional ups and downs, but overall she is so reasonable and sensible that I found myself having a hard time believing in her at all.I don't expect that all readers will agree with me about Alex. She is definitely admirable, and I liked her - I just found her so heroic that I couldn't identify with her. Sometimes I found myself wishing that Gavin and Alex were both more passionate and flawed, less controlled and logical. They are both experienced people, but they're also young - their sage comprehension of their own emotions made them seem, perhaps, much older than they are.I also didn't care for the way suspense plot in the second half of the book panned out. I found it somewhat predictable (and whatever surprise it might have contained is given away by the book's unnecessary prologue). The villains are a TSTL lot who eagerly give Alex all the information she needs to foil them, which she does.I've read all of Putney's books. I've passionately loved some and was bitterly disappointed by others. This book reaches neither extreme; it is as comfortable and soothing as a bathrobe just out of the dryer, but it didn't make my heart pound.Of course, in my opinion a medium Putney is better than even good efforts by many authors. With its great hero, exotic locales, and sympathetic (if somewhat flawless) heroine, The Bartered Bride is more than worth reading."},{"Title":"The Bartered Bride","review":"In 1834, American sea merchant Gavin Elliot sets sail from The East Indies for London after making his fortune in trade. He plans to reestablish his family name previously disgraced among the aristocracy.On his journey to England, Gavin stops at the island of Maduri where Sultan Kasan surprisingly orders a personal visit from the sea captain. While there, Gavin learns that English widow Alexandra Warren is held in bondage after her ship was captured by pirates. Alexandra's eight-year-old daughter is either dead or incarcerated elsewhere. Though he knows not to intercede, the honorable Gavin challenges Kasan to play Lion's Game in which his loss means two decades of servitude, but a victory frees Alexandra. Of course, Gavin has never played before while his opponent is a pro in this deadly encounter.THE BARTERED BRIDE is an exciting, action-packed historical romance that never slows down until the tale is completed. The story line is loaded with a taste of an exotic 1830's environment that provides a fresh outlook to the audience. The lead couple is a courageous duo though the odds of Gavin defeating Kasan in the Lion's Game seems greater than Douglas-Tyson and would have been kept off Vegas and White's books. Still Mary Jo Putney continues to provide a vast panorama of an intriguing bygone era by placing her romances in unique locals.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Bartered Bride","review":"THE BARTERED BRIDE is worth every penny. I couldn't put it down. If you haven't read WILD CHILD and CHINA BRIDE be sure to check them out. Each book stands alone, and all are exquisitely written exciting adventures I know you won't want to miss. Mary Jo's books are some of the best ever written. If you've never read this author please start now...you are going to love her!THE BARTERED BRIDE, the final book in the bride trilogy, is going to thrill readers, as it is beautifully written, highly dramatic, and a real page-turner. Set against the exotic backdrop of the East Indies it fills the senses with sights and sounds of the Orient in the first part of the book and then moves on to England's aristocracy in l835. Gavin Elliott, an American Yankee, who has built Elliott House, is quite a businessman and adventurer who wishes to rescue a European woman sold at a slave auction on the island of Maduri when he is visiting a sultan.Alexandra Warren had been on her way home to England from Australia with her young daughter after the death of her husband when pirates struck the Dutch ship she had been on kidnapping her daughter and separating them, and then making a slave of her. It was only when she encountered Gavin in the slave market and called out to him that she had any chance of survival and of finding her beloved daughter.Since being a slave, things have happened to Alexandra that would test the heart and soul of any woman. She and Gavin have shared much together in this trying time and have become friends. Hating to seeing this beautiful, courageous woman hurting so after a shocking event Gavin marries his bartered bride and they arrive in London as intimate strangers bound with many painful hurts and deep secrets.I can attest first hand that this book holds you in its grip and never lets go."},{"Title":"The Bartered Bride","review":"This was my first MJP book and it won't be my last - thanks to Amazon's concepts of reader reviews and book lists for this find.The story touches complex social issues (slavery, rape) and not just as a tool to make the reader sympathize with the protagonists, give the heroine something to cope with or as an interesting facet to enrich the story. The problems become real and are eloquently portrayed, enough to make you think and understand but insufficient to distract from the plot or characters.The places and people feel genuine, their characters plausible and lush. After all the campy stances, shouting matches or silly misunderstandings I read so often in this type of literature, I was delighted to see some reasonable people, who actually communicated and tried to understand each other. The fact that the reader often gets to see Gavin's view, helps this impression. Can you believe it, here you'll find two people who don't let days of brooding and steaming in wild conjectures go by before resolving or at least tackling an issue.People were also not so easily categorized into good or bad or measured again our usual western/Christian yard stick, as for instance Edmund, Phillip or Kasan.Although this is actually not realistic, considering the period, there is a good deal of marvelous female role models in the novel. You'll find strong, smart, independent women that are partners to their husbands. They have no need to constantly prove themselves but just have the natural self-image, bearing, confidence and charisma of a truly emancipated woman.All this is described in a rich language involving an exciting plot. The only gripe I would have are a few loose ends when the last page is turned. The reader never finds out who the strange \`public figure' is, that is supposedly also a slave trader or what happened to Daisy. It's also left to speculation what becomes of the Pierces and as another reader said here before, the scenes of the scorned lover could have safely been cut without loss.Still I highly recommend this book to any discriminate lover of romance novels. You'll find your desire for a multifaceted love-story, an engaging plot and plenty of sensuality just as much satisfied as you'll get an unexpected dose of cultural, social and political deliberations."},{"Title":"The Bartered Bride","review":"I'm a big fan of Mary Jo Putney, having most recently finished the China Bride (which I heartily recommend), but this book seems contrived to me. There are so many plot devices: kidnapping, slavery, frigidity, surprise pregnancy (not giving much away, most of this is on the flyleaf) that the characters have to work hard to move the story ahead. Usually her work is so finely textured and the characters richly defined, but this work seemed shallow. Read it, but buy it used...!"},{"Title":"The Bartered Bride","review":"I think that this one rates up with my top favorites of MJP's. I was a little surprised that MJP chose to start her story like she did with China Bride; giving away one of the biggest details of the story. But, in actuality, that's what got me hooked. I wanted to read it to see what happened to LEAD to Gavin's trial/execution.I know MJP doesn't usually do stories about her previous characters' children, which is why I was excited to read this one. I was surprised when I found out that Alex was actually Amy, Catherine's daughter. I admired Amy's hardened stubbornness and will in Shattered Rainbows, and was amused by her. To my surprise, here she was. Gavin wasn't anything new, either. I found him to be a gentle, kind character in China Bride, and found myself wondering if there was going to be a story on him, as well.I loved Gavin and Alex's relationship. She was a strong-willed slave with island eyes, and he was the captain of a tea-trading business. He was entranced from sight, and everything went from that moment. They were brought together by a very dangerous man, and his shadow seemed to haunt them throughout the story. I found it interesting how Alex had the same fears of intimacy as her mother did (although for different reasons), and the same tortured theme was reoccuring in this story, as well.I was deeply drawn in by this story. It's well-written, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I think I like it so much because it's so different from anything you'd expect to read. I knew from the beginning that Alex would \\"die\\", and Gavin was the accused, but never had I imagined that it would be something so profoundly maddening and deeply complex. Frederica and Pierce were truly an evil pair.I found myself gasping when I read that Gavin was saved, and my heart was still pounding by the time that I finished the book. I LOVED this book, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who loves complex plots."},{"Title":"The Bartered Bride","review":"Well done, Mary Jo Putney! The author gave us an authentic love story between Gavin & Alexandra. Really authentic. The story wasn't boring in the least. These characters were finely written and I felt as if I were IN the story with all these people rather than just reading the book. My only quirk with the story was this: within hours of the tragic fire at his warehouse, when Gavin was supposed to be so distraught, he decided to fill out the paperwork for an insurance claim. Huh? Wouldn't that have been the very least thing on his mind?"},{"Title":"The Bartered Bride","review":"If you like old fashioned romance, this book is not it. I'm not sure what I would call it. The book starts out with a flash forward of the hero, Gavin, in prison, facing a trial and probably execution and it's all Alexandra's fault. Chapter 2 starts at the beginning with the telling of Alexandra's story. Both hero and heroine have been married before, and she has an 8 year old daughter. He was married and his wife died in childbirth. He's a sort of boring, too perfect hero, only been with one woman his whole life guy-his dead wife. Alexandra is enslaved and raped several times before Gavin comes to the rescue. There is not an immediate attraction between them... a lot of dialog and not much depth on thoughts and emotions of either character expressed in the writing. The plot had some twists and interesting events, but nothing romantic. I confess I skipped a few chapters here and there and didn't even finish the book. However, I could tell it would be a waste of time, so I am sure I didn't miss anything. The writing lacked depth and romance and that wasn't going to change. It's a shame because Uncommon Vows is one of my favorite books, also by Mary Jo Putney."},{"Title":"The Bartered Bride","review":"This was my first book by this author. I was quite excited because of all the good reviews for her writing. I could not connect with these characters. There was absolutely no chemistry between the two. I found it quite annoying that Gavin always said and did the perfect thing. He had no passion whatsoever. Very boring book."},{"Title":"The Bartered Bride","review":"I must say that I agree with the previous reviewers who expressed disappointment in this latest effort by Mary Jo Putney. If I had never read any of her previous works, then I might have rated The Bartered Bride more favorably. Compared to the average romance novel, this one is not so bad. However, having faithfully read and loved her previous books, I found this one to be just \\"fair to middling\\" in comparison and deserving of only three stars at most. It is competently written, but it lacks soul, much like a pianist who can strike every note in a piece of music correctly and yet never stir the heart to \\"feel\\" a song. The story is driven by a rather far-fetched plot involving white slavery, rape, torture, pirates, kidnappings, rescues, \\"Survivor\\"-type games of skill, a forced marriage, arson, attempted murder, a sensational trial and a hanging. Amidst all of this excess, the poor characters get lost in the shuffle and emerge as long-suffering victims who would rather dwell in the tragic past than move on with their lives. The most unbelievable part of the story comes at the end when the hero, a peer of the realm, is convicted of murdering his wife based solely on the perjured testimony of a \\"shifty-eyed man who looked like a thief.\\" Is it really credible that members of the House of Lords in the mid-nineteenth century would take the word of some sleazy street dweller over that of one of their own, particularly when our hero has the backing of his wife's noble family, one of the most powerful in England? Not bloody likely, as the Brits would say. I could have perhaps overlooked the plot contrivances if the hero and heroine had been a little less self-absorbed and predictable, but, alas, it was not to be. Mary Jo Putney is capable of truly wonderful writing, and I hope that with her next book she introduces us to some entrancing, real people who have a heart-felt story to tell, rather than relying on exotic locales and convoluted plots to carry the day."},{"Title":"The Bartered Bride","review":"I opened the book and read the Prologue entitled The End Game dated Autumn 1835 Place The Tower of LondonGavin Elliott is being held for trial, he is accused (falsely, of course) of killing his wife Alexandra.Then we go to Book 1 of the previous year.. 1834 and I threw the book on the table...I cannot tell you how much I dislike reading this kind of story.Why do I want to re-live history?

As one of the other reviewer's notes, the story involves several guests at an English country house in the early 1930s who each gets a very brief glimpse of a different page from the London Times one year in the future. Buchan is a superb writer and I found his account of the fates of these people very well done. However, you need to have some interest in England in the 1930s to truly appreciate this book. A couple of the story threads involve the political maneuverings in the British Parliament in the early 1930s as the Great Depression threw the normal party alignments into disarray. Naturally, these events were more interesting to people in England in 1932 when this book was published than they will be to readers in the contemporary U.S. One of the other reviewers found these parts of the book boring, but I think Buchan writes so well that they remain interesting.A couple of points: The book starts a bit slowly and the best of the story threads is the one that ends the book. In fact, I found the last story thread to be quite moving. So, don't abandon the book too early! Finally, [SPOILER ALERT] I found the twist at the end a bit farfetched, but it didn't spoil the book for me, particularly as it allowed for a happy ending."},{"Title":"The Gap in the Curtain","review":"The reviewer below has done a good job of summarizing the basic premise of this book's plot: a country-house party is given the opportunity to see for an instant the front page of the Times a year hence. Each member sees something affecting himself, and the rest of the book tells what each one did with the knowledge gained thereby.As a premise, this is great. Unfortunately, Buchan allows his story to become bogged down with uninteresting characters in contrived situations. Perhaps the up-and-coming politician's story was interesting to an Englishman in the 1930s, but today it seems dull indeed. Form a coalition government already! Or something! Don't agonize over what to do for months on end.Ultimately, I feel that this book fails as a thriller because it can't make the dramas playing out in its characters' lives have much meaning to the reader."},{"Title":"The Gap in the Curtain","review":"As a long-time fan of John Buchan, I especially enjoyed my re-reading of \\"Gap In The Curtain\\".

Additionally, the only way to really use this book is to sit down and memorize things-quite a boring way to learn to read Chinese.Additionally, this is a book about modern medical Chinese and contains no classical grammar.

Great Book."},{"Title":"Corridors of power","review":"Apparently, it was Snow who coined the phrase \\"corridors of power\\" in an earlier book. This one is all about English politics, and the machinations that go on in trying to change policy. I suspect it was far more riveting to an English reader who knows more about the workings of Parliament than I do. Rather dry, and involved, with many, many characters. Only in the last fifty pages or so is there any semblance of suspense. As usual, Lewis Eliot is the narrator and at the heart of matters. Exactly how he got to be such a confidante of Roger Quaife, who seems to be a Minister in another department, I never could figure out. Snow, I suspect, lived these times and questions, but perhaps he was too close to see that his reader might need a little more explanation. Quaife is trying to disengage England from the nuclear arms race, a thoroughly admirable position, but one which would have required Parliament to own up to the fact that England was no longer a super power, a hard pill to swallow indeed. Many times, throughout the book, one or another character expresses the thought that no man can really do much of anything, that government will go on in its own way no matter who is at the helm. If you like to read about power and politics, all the weavings in and out, and subplots, the goings on behind the top, this book would probably rate high with you. I do not think it Snow's best. Once again, he is too detached. Too close to the heartbeat of things."},{"Title":"Corridors of power","review":"This book concerns the efforts of an ambitious Conservative politician on the rise - at the start of the book, he becomes a Minister in a newly formed Cabinet. With his power, he wants to prevent Britain's clinging to an independent nuclear deterrent in the late 1950s (Suez makes a brief appearance). Some interesting questions are raised as to whether the moral rightness of this goal -- of which Snow, channeling the scientists who opposed even the use of the bomb at Hiroshima, clearly has no doubt -- can/should be compromised in the interests of furthering the minister's political rise (at the summit of which he can, presumably, do more good) and, too briefly, in the interaction of public opinion with 'informed' expert opinion. The accounts of the English civil service and its interactions with elected officials are excellently-drawn. But as a guide to the intracacies of parliamentary procedure, this book is a bit of a letdown. Much of the action takes place at dinner parties at various aristocratic homes, and the real focus is less on the policy questions than on various characters' love lives. Reason, not emotion, is Snow's strong suit in description and narrative, and so while his language -- at once crisp and dense -- often has a real appeal, it does not move one to care as much about the characters as one is probably supposed to. All in all, an interesting read, but not an essential one. The policy issues, by the way, were real: if they are of interest, they are better explained (and, despite being more or less contemporary with _Corridors_, in a less dated manner) in Richard Neustadt's forgotten gem \\"Alliance Politics\\" and the report on the UK's \\"Skybolt\\" nuclear deterrent Neustadt wrote for John F Kennedy in 1963, now declassified and published by Cornell University Press."},{"Title":"Corridors of power","review":"To appreciate this book properly, of course you must have read Neustadt, Allison and a host of other historians of the Cold War. That practically goes without saying. A good dose of political biography - Eden, Macmillan, Duncan Sandys - also would help. Don't approach this novel without the necessary historical background - it's not for casual readers. Secondly, there are protagonists whose personal histories Snow has charted in earlier novels, so don't read it without having read all the previous novels in the sequence. Corridors of Power kicks off the third volume in the series. But if you've done both of those things, it's a joy to read - gripping stuff. For me, the most interesting thing of all is Sir Lewis Eliot himself - I completely disagree with the contemporary perception that he is in some sense a purely hypothetical character, a detached observer. For me, he is the Greek hero personified. Snow beats the odious Powell hands-down as a writer - it's about time people started saying so."},{"Title":"Corridors of power","review":"This book is probably the best-known of a series of novels by Snow, which he wrote almost after the manner of Dickens, about one every couple of years, starting in 1940 with 'Strangers and Brothers'. He gave the same name to his series of I believe eleven titles. (Snow got off to a false start with a detective novel; then a story about science fraud, which H G Wells liked - Snow had a science background, but couldn't or wouldn't make a career of it).Snow was something of a poor boy made good, as Muggeridge pointed out - a similar type to Melyvn Bragg and Clive James. Ambitious, and certainly not willing to rock the boat. In my view, his novels give a highly realistic picture of conventional life in Britain both before and after the Second World War. Even if Snow ever harboured dangerous thoughts, he would not have put them into his novels, except in the actions of flawed characters, which of course his novels have. (E.g. a convinced technical Communist; an unsatisfactory wife; a scheming head of an Oxbridge college).'Corridors of Power' fits into all this... as a shrewd reviewer here noted, there is in fact very little about actual 'corridors of power' - Prime Ministers, Civil Servants, Cabinet Ministers, military heads, nuclear physicists, directors of research establishments, and so on. The action is outsider stuff looking in - candidates for Parliament, backbenchers, people in country houses, acquaintances. Snow is incurious about the 'Hitler War' as he calls it, the 'Cold War', Churchill - he accepts all the usual attitudes. He accepts the oddities of the Oxbridge system, has no criticism of the legal system (his protagonist is a lawyer), believes in removing capital punishment because progressive did. If you're looking for something of this sort - an evocation of England in the 30s, 40s, and 50s - I think Snow's series must be high on a list of consistent portrayals of the period as perceived by people in Britain who hadn't learned to look below the surface."},{"Title":"Corridors of power","review":"This book was first published in 1964 as part of the STRANGERS AND BROTHERS series. Lewis Eliot and his wife Margaret are to dine at Roger Quaife's house. Quaife is a Conservative politician. Lewis works in the department of Sir Hector Rose which has someting to do with defense.Roger Quaife is an effective public speaker. Roger notes that a politician lives in the present. One must first get power and then do something with it.He perceives that it is not realistic for England to possess its own atomic weapons. He seeks the assistance of Lewis to arrange a meeting with the scientists, Walter Luke and Francis Getliffe. The game being played by Roger is that he seeks the ministry held by Lord Gilbey.Lewis and Margaret become the guests of a great hostess, Diana Skidmore, at Basset, Diana's house in Hampshire. The subject of Roger's wife's brother comes up during the weekend. Roger claims that in observing etiquette, truth has suffered.Just following the weekend, Lewis and Margaret are invited to see Douglas and Mary Osbaldiston. Douglas is a highly placed fellow civil servant. Lord Gilbey becomes very ill. Lewis and others visit at the clinic. It is believed that whatever the physical outcome of Lord Gilbey's circumstances, Roger will get his post, unless he has damaged his chances in defending his wife Caro's brother Sammikins.While visiting Lord Gilbey Lewis earns that he has received a telegram from a former acquaintance of Lewis, Ronald Porson. When Lewis travels to see Porson and complain of his act, he is stopped by the obvious drunken state of the man. Later Lord Gilbey receives the news that he is being removed from office. Roger Quaife is appointed to take his place.Francis Getliffe is a radical through conscience. He does not want to be a member of a scientific advisory committee but yields to the pressure of Lewis and Roger. A Michael Brodzinski, a person holding diametrical views, is also to be on the committee.The book concerns, interestingly, the formation of political opinion. The story takes place at the time of the Suez crisis and Suez drives the story inasmuch as a certain sort of jingoism arises in reaction to the French and British embarassment over Suez. Possible defects in Roger's character may have also contributed to the defeat of Roger's policy. He is made to live with the fact that his unfaithfulness to Caro may be disclosed.As things develop though the machinations of Brodzinski, whose strong held views verge on madness, Lewis and Francis Getliffe become subject to enquiries concerning their political stances in the 1930's. Cold war issues intrude in the alliance with the United States. Lord Lufkin, an aerospace manufacturer and Lewis's former employer, warns him that he knows secrets dangerous to Roger Quaife's official position.Caro Quaife's world is not kind. It is tolerably good-natured. If you are really in trouble you are on your own. Roger Quaife is compelled to resign. Lewis then submits his own resignation to Sir Hector Rose. A novel of politics resembles a novel of manners in Snow's excellent rendering."},{"Title":"A New Song for the Lord: Faith in Christ and Liturgy Today","review":"Some months ago I set as a goal for myself the promotion of the ideas of Joseph Cardianl Ratzinger as a source of a far, far richer appreciation of the Eucharistic Liturgy. I have read and continue to read the Cardinal to further my stated goal. However, perhaps more importantly, I find in the course of this exercise my own appreciation of the Liturgy being significantly enriched.Participating as a Deacon at the Liturgy can very easily become a matter of routine, mere ritual. One must spiritually &quot;pinch&quot; oneself periodically to bring about a renewed sense of the importance of this, the Catholic's central act of worship. This particular book is just that; a spiritual shot in the arm to renew one's faith and love in our most beloved treasure, the Eucharistic Liturgy.A NEW SONG FOR THE LORD is far more than just about song at the Liturgy. There's Scripture, History, Theology. This group of collected essays builds a fundamental basis for the Liturgy itself as the book's sub-title suggests, &quot;Faith in Christ and Liturgy Today.&quot; We must once again refocus our liturgical attention upon that to which it belongs: Jesus / God / Adoration. Cardinal Ratzinger points out the danger of the congregation focusing upon itself, of the community celebrating itself and thereby becoming a vehicle for merely social purposes.We get the &quot;Song&quot; right when we have gotten the fundamentals of the Liturgy right. We thereupon can join with the angels in a most beautiful act of worship on that special day called the &quot;Lord's.&quot; We've been prepared for it because already the Cardinal has given us a renewed appreciation for that day of days: the &quot;third,&quot; the &quot;first,&quot; the &quot;eighth.&quot;In contrast to some of the other of Cardinal Ratzinger's books, this one is a fairly easy read. Anyone seriously interested in the Mass and its attendant liturgy should find this book a most valuable encouragement that the Church truly does understand itself and its worship. Liturgists and church musicians alike should make available a special spot on their book shelf for this important, little tome. In fact, every Catholic should find in A NEW SONG FOR THE LORD a valuable source of rejuvenation and edification.I give this one a five star rating for everyone."},{"Title":"Between Text and Artifact: Integrating Archaeology in Biblical Studies Teaching Volume 8 (Archaeology and Biblical Studies)","review":"This is the best scholarly book of its sort that I know about.

Robert McCloskey. New York: The Viking Press, 1957. Wolf, Virginia. &quot; The Cycles of the Seasons: Without and Within Time.&quot; Children's Literature Association Quarterly 19:2 (1990). The book Time of Wonder is a children's book written and illustrated by Robert McClosky. The book is about an island that undergoes many changes through out the story. The illustrations portray nicely the transitions the island encounters with the passing of time. The illustrations help elaborate each change the island is going through at the time. Time of Wonder's plot falls into a series of continuous changes and a repetitive cycle of seasons. Many of the book's ideas relate to Virginia L. Wolf's article, &quot; The Cycle the Seasons: Without and Within Time&quot;. In her article she states,&quot; Similarly dependent upon the natural cycle, people find the seasons multi-leveled and universal symbols&quot;(170). She also states,&quot; the cycle of seasons becomes the birth, death, and return of divine things&quot; (170). This relates to McClosky's book in that the book starts off with the beginning of summer. Then things begin to turn to fall and certain changes begin to happen with the passing of time. With the beginning of fall, the hurricane develops and damages much of the island, symbolizing death. After the hurricane is over, the people come out to repair the island, discovering new things left behind by the storm. The humming birds are out singing joyfully. The tone is energetic and uplifting. The people seemed to be filled with new life, symbolizing the return of divine things. In the beginning, the children are playing in the rocks and in the water amongst the summer sun at the edge of the island, symbolizing the birth of the cycle. Wolf refers to Northrop Frye's Mythoi, or generic seasons, which are characterized by the seasons. He says,&quot; the full cycle may suggest permanence, promising transcendence as spring follows winter or threatening endless repetition as summer leads to fall&quot;(171). In a Time of Wonder the idea of permanence and promising transcendence to a following cycle of seasons, is depicted in the end of the book. As summer turns into fall and the humming birds fly south for the winter, it is time for the families to pack up and say goodbye to the end of another summer. They must wait for the continuous cycle to complete and bring about another summer so they can return once again. Time of Wonder was a book I enjoyed reading very much. The illustrations went along very nicely with the text and added definite zest to the book."},{"Title":"Time of Wonder","review":"This book is about a summer at the beach, but it has a dry writing style &quot;In the evening, when the tide is high again, and all yor guests have gone, you row around to the point, feeling lonely...&quot; It is pretty wordy and my children (5 and 8) did not want a it read a second time - that is very unusual for a new book at our house. Something about the story seems boring. I would pass on this one."},{"Title":"Time of Wonder","review":"I know that Make Way For Ducklings is the most popular of his books, but this one is actually my favorite. My 4 year old loves it and has since he was 3. We've been reading it for over a year and he still asks for it frequently. Some people may think that a book like this would be too slow moving for kids today, but i don't agree. It's a great book. And if kids never experience anything but fast-paced, television style entertainment how will they ever get to enjoy the simple things in life."},{"Title":"Time of Wonder","review":"The wonders of the world as seen from a child's perspective are rendered beautifully in this story. I long to visit this part of Maine to capture the same wonder as the two girls, from jumping off a rock into the bay, to the sounds heard through the fog, to an oncoming hurricane and the preparations for it. Everything is described in calm language and illustrated beautifully. Probably McCloskey's most exquisite, wonderous children's book. A child will love having this book read to them--it brings a time and place to life that all children should experience."},{"Title":"Time of Wonder","review":"Being a fan of Make Way for Ducklings, I was in search of other books by Robert McCloskey when I found this gem of a book. It is gentle, lyrical and so beautiful in it's prose and artwork. My children like to listen to it at bedtime and it lulls them to sleep each time. It is a book that celebrates nature and it's beauty. It's hard for me to describe but it touches me deeply, evokes memories of my childhood camping trips in the mountains."},{"Title":"Time of Wonder","review":"Great book, especially for those of us who love Maine. You can almost smell the sea air, feel the wind coming off the water and hear the gulls in the distance as you read this!"},{"Title":"Time of Wonder","review":"I have fond childhood memories of my mother reading this book to me.

I have not read through this book in years, but I hope to be able to read it to my kids someday."},{"Title":"Time of Wonder","review":"Time of Wonder was read to me as a young girl, as was most of Robert McCloskey's other books, Burt Dow, Blueberries for Sal, Make Way for Ducklings. I treasure the memories of seeing those startling pictures as a child. The uprooted tree! The glacial scratch where the children went swinmming! The storm! Only through repetition and re-reading over several years did the stories come together and make sense, but the process was completely enjoyable and enthralling.The best part of all was re-encountering the stories as an adult. For some reason I especially love \\"Time of Wonder\\", but all his books occupy a toasty and happy place in my heart."},{"Title":"Time of Wonder","review":"This is one of those timeless books by McCloskey with such lovely drawings and great text for reading aloud.

This book takes one back to an age and a time when life was simpler, and accordingly more interesting. Imagine how difficult this story would be to write if the children in the story all had cell phones and iPods. While there is a bit of an upper middle-class bias here - sailboats and island exploration not being an option for most children, the essential truth behind the story is that an understanding of the world comes through direct interaction with nature. This is a book to be read to the 3-6 year old the night before a trip to the park. The illustrations are superb and perfectly complementary to the text, which comes close to poetry. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Time of Wonder","review":"Robert McCloskey's \\"Time of Wonder\\" is just that--an examination of a wondrous summer spent in Maine. He follows two sisters (and nominally, their parents and friends) as they spend their days sailing, swimming, battening down for a big storm, and so on. Nothing of great import happens, but McCloskey has a lovely, calming way of relating their story so that we feel the sisters' closeness, their connection to their environment, and their childlike ability to find beauty and interest in nearly everything.McCloskey's book was first published in 1957, and the illustrations show this--no life vests in a lot of the boating pictures, children swimming without being watched over by a lifeguard or adult, and so on. Still, that's not a bad thing--it shows the protective, exclusionary nature of childhood and the risks children take without even being fully aware that they ARE taking risks.The illustrations are lovely. These paintings depict Maine as being beautiful without neglecting to show the dangerous side of coastal life as well (witness the storm scenes towards the end of the book). There is a caressing, rhythmic feel to the text which subtly imitates the tidal pull of the ocean. What a perfect gift for anyone who vacations in Maine--or wants to."},{"Title":"Time of Wonder","review":"Time of Wonder is Robert McCloskey's lyrical tribute to the joys of being young in the summertime. The setting is his beloved Maine coast, on Penobscot Bay. The story builds around the approach of the rain, the cycle of the summer, the transition from morning to dark in a single day, and a hurricane. As wonderful as the story is, the illustrations are the highlight of this delightful book. They capture stunning panoramas, wind-swept moments, and gay times in the sun equally well in free flowing watercolors that are as fluid as the wind or the ocean. This book was awarded the Caldecott Medal for the outstanding quality of its illustrations in 1958.Two unnamed girls are overlooking Penobscot Bay, watching the rain form in the distance . . . until they themselves are drenched!Next, a full day evolves from the typical summer fog with sidelights about porpoises, lobstering, gulls, cormorants, the forest and its trees and fiddle-head ferns. Finally, the fog burns off and the scene shifts to bees, hummingbirds, other birds singing, sail boats, fishing boats, seals, the beach, rocks and children playing. Then, as dusk settles in, an owl, a heron, eider ducks, fishhawks, a crab, a rowboat, a flashlight and the stars frame the experience. At each moment, nature holds great adventures and mysteries for the girls to explore and exult in.A seaplane symbolizes the coming and going from the area. The bulk of the people and animals are summer visitors.Suddenly, everyone realizes a big storm is coming.&quot;We're going to have some weather.It's a-coming!She's gonna blow.With the next shift of the tide.&quot;There are boats to get ready. Windows need to be secured. People have to go inside. Once there, the rain and wind can still blow their way in. Eventually, the storm ends and the full moon reigns. The next day, the girls inspect the damage and find an old Indian shell heap that probably predates the first European visitors.Then the girls have to help prepare for the next year. They get seaweed to put on as fertilizer for their garden. They pack up.As they leave, they are&quot;A little bit sadabout the place you are leaving,a little bit gladabout the place your are going.&quot;One last thought hits them. &quot;Where do hummingbirds go in a hurricane?&quot;This story does a marvelous job of helping children understand their connection to nature and to the powerful forces around them. Whether they are watching the wind, using it to push their sailboat, or riding out a hurricane, they know that they are a small part of a great scheme. If your child has yet to see many of these animals or scenes, you can use the illustrations to explain them. You will smile when you see the porpoises playing in the wake of the girls' sailboat.A good application of this book is to think of a place where you and your child can go on a regular basis to observe and enjoy nature. It may be a near-by park. It may be a family vacation home. It may be a public beach. Take your child there. Take her by the hand, and show her the easy-to-miss wonders all around. And remember to visit in the fog, rain, and winds, as well as on sunny days. You can take pictures, draw sketches of what you see, and make a scrapbook that contains your thoughts and observations.See beauty and harmony in the balance around you."},{"Title":"Time of Wonder","review":"The reviewer who found this book \\"boring\\" must not have much in the way of imagination. This was one of my favorite books as a child and I still remember it fondly (I'm 38). It doesn't matter if you haven't had experiences exactly like those of the children in the book. The writing and the illustrations make you feel as if you are there. You can practically smell the sea, hear the wind and rain, and the laughter of the kids at the beach. While drawing a vivid picture of a concrete time and place, the book also invokes a sense of timelessness, as well as of \\"deep time\\" and the ancient rythyms of nature. I think my favorite moment is when one of the girls stands in a forested area on a misty morning, her eyes closed, and listens to nature awakening around her.This is a book about taking a break from the fast-paced modern world and connecting with nature (and appreciating its power), with the past, and rediscovering your sense of wonder. Written in the mid-50's, it was ahead of its time in some ways and is definitely as relevant today as it was then, if not more so."},{"Title":"Time of Wonder","review":"I have been a fan of Robert McCloskey books since I was old enough to remember (which was quite so time ago) and I only recently discovered this book. I think I have all of his other books and have read them over and over again through life, finally passing them on to my own daughter.This is no less of a joy to read than any of the other books written by Robert McCloskey. If anything, it seems almost more lyrical and more developed than his early books.One item of particluar note is that the illustrations are in color, as opposed to the single color or black and white of his other works.

Rarely has an author captured natural beauty and people's enjoyment of it so eloquently and so clearly. I grew up with the Ducklings and Sal, but this book is the best. It is one I hope to grow old with, and I hope my 4 month old son will enjoy it as much as I did and still do. BUY IT!"},{"Title":"Time of Wonder","review":"(...)The story, such as it is, follows a family in their summer home on an island in the ocean. Mostly following the children, the story reflects on the wonders of nature itself. The kids walk out into the mist on warm summery mornings. They leap from high ocean rocks, and sun themselves as the rocks grow warm. They sail a boat at night (they've fairly trusting parents, I'd wager) to spy on deep water crabs. Eventually, a hurricane comes to batter the family in their sturdy little home. In the end, the family must return to their real house/life/school and wait to return to the island another year. As they leave, the narrator opines that such moments as these make living a real time of wonder. A time for pondering things like, \\"I wonder where hummingbirds go in a hurricane\\".Working in a medium unlike his usual pencils and inks, McCloskey seemed to draw the images in this book from a very private source. Though you may never have been in a summer home such as this or experienced moments like the ones the children go through, you feel the nostalgia embedded in this story. I may not have ever summered in places where I could make forts out of huge sea stones, but after reading this book I know what it would be like. People may say books such as this don't move quickly enough for kids today. Don't believe it. Kids are kids and good books are good books. The child that appreciates Elmo's World is still going to feel a sense of (for lack of a better word) wonder when they stare at the picture of the hurricane blowing the house's inhabitants in all directions. Kids interested in technical ship jargon and the process of buying supplies before a big storm will be fascinated by this tale as well. Some stories do not age. Others, age in such a way that they become deep and full-bodied like a good fine wine. \\"A Time of Wonder\\" falls into the latter category. Take a moment to enjoy it fully."},{"Title":"Time of Wonder","review":"I read my children to sleep with this book every night.

McCloskey's descriptions of his adopted home area of northeast coastal Maine make me want to move there, at least for the summer. A late spring rain causing fiddlehead ferns to grow; summer afternoons diving off the age-old rocks; evening sailboat rides; preparing for an end-of-season storm and surveying the altered landscape the next morning; and the final bittersweet packing up, bringing home a few island treasures and adjusting the clock from the rise and fall of the tide to the come and go of the schoolbus (&quot;And children, don't forget your toothbrushes&quot;) -- all these images are rendered so lyrically that you can read &quot;Time of Wonder&quot; 274 times to your toddler and never want to rush through it to the end.Treasure this book.

Unpolluted I am not, but I truly hope that today's progeny not be denied the joy of books, especially McCloskey's Time of Wonder, the story of two girls waiting out a gently blustering Maine hurricane. The short plot, to this steamy southern girl, was exotic and intriguing, and I can still close my eyes and visualize the soft watercolors of the patchwork quilt the girls used to huddle before the fire, and the brilliant blue of the post-storm ocean.

In this book, you will learn everything from rehydrating wetlands, to sprouting wild seeds like acorns and pine cones. It is great reference to get you started in the good fight of Earth preservation.

Some are. What could be simpler than mixing mayo and wasabi, spreading it onto salmon fillets and shoving it in the oven for 10 minutes? However, the 18-hour slow-cooked pork, while very easy, needs 6 hours absorbing its spices, and 18 hours in a very slow oven. Not quick. And the pears Belle Helene need you to poach some pears, make sorbet with the others, stuff the pears with sorbet and top the lot with chocolate. Neither quick nor all that easy. Nor does the book reduce pantry space with its reduced ingredients; you'll want to stock up with garlic oil and hunt down pomegranate molasses, for example.What the book does well is give you a feel for how ingredients work in a dish. Once you've saut&eacute;ed asparagus in sesame oil, you'll never look back. If you're a beginner cook, you may find the book less useful, as it assumes you have basic cooking techniques. If you're an innovative and enthusiastic cook, you'll be poring over it for hours and producing some rather spectacular results."},{"Title":"Cooking 1-2-3: 500 Fabulous Three-Ingredient Recipes (1-2-3 Cookbook)","review":"Your first concern must be: \\"Only three ingredients?! The recipes can't taste that good.\\" Let me assure you that the recipes are absolutely delicious, despite the fact that they contain only three ingredients. (Recipes often contain salt and pepper, which are not considered ingredients.)However, here's the caveat: While the recipes call for only three ingredients, many of those ingredients are rare indeed. Examples: saffron threads, Thai curry oil, za'atar, pomegranate molasses, rutabaga, Asiago cheese, creme fraiche, fresh tarragon, tandoori paste, mango chutney, etc. You were probably thinking: \\"Only three ingredients, I'll definitely have all three ingredients in my house.\\" Think again. Unless you have fennel seeds in your house, you can't make the roast pork recipe on page 164. So many recipes call for obscure ingredients, I felt the need to alert potential buyers.That being disclosed, many recipes call for ingredients that you will probably have.

Rozanne Gold is a genius and genie when it comes to flavors. I'd recommend this book to aspiring chefs to understand flavor systems as well as home cooks who want a little sophistication in their menus. This is NOT open a can or box and dump cooking---far from it. This is a collection of recipes developed over nearly a decade by a chef who looks at minimalism just as an artist or poet does.

The vocal part requires that you listen to the CD to know what it is actually supposed to sound like on the verses, as Sarah changes them a bit. The piano part is a good mix of the original piano part plus some of the synth and guitar parts, a mix that is very pleasing to the ear.

Fifteen years later, for Andie, Julie and Raven, someone's after them, when they try to solve the murder of \\"Mrs. X\\" and the disappearance of \\"Mr. X\\". And sometimes, Andie doesn't know if she can trust them, even if loyalty binds them to murder.

Andie, Raven and Julie, all come from broken homes. But their lives are turned upside down after they begin to watch a kinky couple engage in dangerous sex on a weekly basis. The friends begin to keep secrets and lie to each other. Each girl is effected in different ways. The book mostly follows Andie around. After a long string of bad books, I really enjoyed reading this one. It's over 500 pages but I finished it quickly. Yes, the reading is very simple and easy like Mary Higgins Clark's work. But if you can overlook that, you'll find this book to be worth the time and effort."},{"Title":"Shocking Pink","review":"This book was a great read. The book is thick but I just flew through it. I love Erica Spindler. I first read her book BONE COLD. I loved it and looked for a second book by Spindler. I found SHOCKING PINK and I loved it even more than BONE COLD.This is the book of 3 young girls who found themselves watching a strange sexual encounter in a supposed empty house. They know they aren't suppose to be there and they shouldn't be watching. So what do they do when they realize there has been a murder? They all have different opinions and it breaks up there friendship. Now as adults they have resumed their friendship. But there is another murder and it seems connected to the one from their youth.

The suspense was building and the climax was definetely worth waiting for. Highly recommended. Another Spindler classic!!!"},{"Title":"Shocking Pink","review":"In terms of literary merits, this books deserves less than one star, but on the other hand it does not make any sense to compare it with a book written by a Novel prize winner. Their nature is so far apart that they can not be measured by the same rule. In this case, my rating is based on the simple fact that it is a simple plot with simple characters for those moments when you want fun, simple uncomplicated reading. In other words, this is not the type of book you suggest as a program for a reading club, but you will enjoy it in an airplane if the in-flight movie is too lousy to watch.An the plot? Oh yes!!, three female teenagers who are best friends, but at the same time endure rotten family lives, during an excursion around the block see a couple engaged in kinky sex. .All of them get mesmerized by what they see but for different reasons. Sadly a crime occurs in which somehow all of them get involved, and those events will come to haunt them fifteen years afterwards, forcing them to recognize a crude reality among themselves."},{"Title":"Shocking Pink","review":"This book was truly shocking, I thought I had the whole thing figured out, but the twist that bit me, just made me appreciate her books even more! The whole story ended up great, like always with her books. All the characters didnt end up all happy and fairy-tale like but with twists!! This author truly has a way of making all her characters seem very realistic and somehow have &quot; a mind of their own&quot;....if that makes sense. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a edge of your seat suspense mixed with some romance!!"},{"Title":"Shocking Pink","review":"This is the first negative review I have ever taken the time to write. The book is about 500 pages, which is about the same amount of times I rolled my eyes while reading it. The cliches are so deep you might want to bring a shovel to dig your self out. The syrupy sweet friendship the story revolves around is totaly unrealistic. The plot was about as hard to figure out as a Scooby Doo cartoon. The characters were stereo-typical - the dumb pretty one, the tough one, the very normal average one... are we watching Charlie's Angels ? Or maybe an episode of the Power Puff Girls ?If you're looking for a VERY easy read, that will not challenge you in any way, you'll enojy this. The story idea isn't bad, it could have been a good book. I'm sure there are many people that will like this book. The author and I just have totaly different ideas about what makes a good book good. Why did I bother to finish it ? If I start reading a book - I'm going to finish it."},{"Title":"Shocking Pink","review":"Wow! One of Erica Spindler's oldest novels just so happens to be her best.

I really, really loved this one. It may be out-of-print, but it's well worth tracking down."},{"Title":"Shocking Pink","review":"Andie Bennett and her two friends, Raven and Julie, lives were changed during the summer they were fifteen. What started out as a lark between three teenage girls soon turned into something deadly. For Andie, seeing the shocking sexual acts performed by two faceless people was horrifying. She had never realized that there were people in the world who got satsifaction from the sick sexual acts she has witnessed. Raven was facsinated by the control that 'Mr. X' had over 'Mrs. X'. All her life she has strove for control over her life and the people in it. Julie has always believed her father, the Reverend that she was the spawn of the Devil and is heartbroken to find herself aroused by the acts that she has seen go on in the abandoned house. Then their world was rocked when one night, Mr. X left and Mrs. X was found dead two days later.Nick was the detective on the case of the murder on that summer night fifteen years ago. It has always bothered him that the murder went unsolved though he holds little hope that the crime will ever be solved. Then all three girls seem to be in the small town at the same time and bizzarre things start happening.Then Andie starts getting odd phone calls and anonymous mail and a terrifying gift laying on her bed one night. She finds herself turning to Nick instead of her two best friends which changes the course of her life once again. She also has a client that admits he has a sexual problem and claims he needs her help before he hurts the woman that he loves. Bound by doctor-patient confidentiality, Andie feels the conflit rising within herself when she sees Julie going down a self-destructing path with the very client that makes her question her morals as a therapist. Then there is Raven, who is acting more odd as the days go by. They had always been best friends, her, Raven, and Julie, but Andie had always missed how possessive and obsessive Raven was about loyalty and family.Spindler brings the reader into a terrifying place that involves three friends who witnessed something that would shape their lives and the paths they would take. It will alternatly make the reader sad and scared as these three people try to find their niche in life.Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Shocking Pink","review":"This was the second book that I have read of Erica Spindler's and I was shocked!! I had hardly heard of her books but they definitely deserve some praise! This book does have some sexually explicit parts but they are put together to take you on one heck of a thrill ride.

This author knows how to grab you on the first page, and doesn't let go until you've read the last page. Even though I figured out the killer's identity fairly soon--and the author gives ample clues but enough doubt to make it really interesting--it's the ride to the finish that's the true enjoyment. The love interest is just enough without overshadowing the plot, the secondary characters come alive with believable motivations, and the details are well-researched. Bravo, Ms Spindler!

I found the friendship a big unbelievable, though. I don't think there are any friends like that in the world that constantly say &quot;I love you&quot; and &quot;you're my family&quot; as much as that was repeated in this book.

The curious girls return another night and discover that Mrs. X has been killed.

Then strange things start happening: Andie receives a newspaper clipping about Mrs. X's murder, Julie has a sadistic new secret lover, and Raven suspects that her new client is using business as an excuse to insert himself into her life. When another woman is found dead, the local sheriff realizes that the three girls' memories may hold a clue as to who the killer is, and all secrets are revealed.This book is very good for what it is - an escapist thriller geared towards women.

Never a dull moment...a hard to put down book."},{"Title":"Shocking Pink","review":"I just can't recommend Shocking Pink to anyone, unless they have too much time on their hands and nothing else to do. The opening sequence, set in the past, dragged on for WAY too long. So much so that I was about to give up on the book altogether, and it is very seldom I put down a book without finishing it. But it finally segued into the present, and it did pick up from there with a good story and more interesting characters. (although as one other reviewer notes, the three leads are stereotypes.)Once you're done, there's not much explanation of WHY the killer did what h/she did in the past, just a flimsy premise. Read something else of Erica Spindler's, pretty much anything else, and you'll be better served."},{"Title":"Shocking Pink","review":"Contrary to one recent review, I really enjoyed this book.

Though the three have typical teen-type problems, they also have family troubles that threaten to engulf them. Julie's father, a local pastor, is always punishing his daughter for being a sinner. In doing this, he pushes her in the direction of act like the town tramp. Andie's world crumbles when her mother announces that her father is obtaining a divorce. Raven hides from even her best friends that her mother deserted her because she could not deal with the non-substantiated jealous rages of her spouse. All three decide to clandestinely watch a couple having a love affair. However, they see more than they bargained for when rough sex, leading to the unsolved murder of the woman, occurs.Fifteen years later, the three femalesare still the best of friends. Andie is a psychologist and Raven is an interior designer. The often married Julie suffers from sexual addiction, a disorder that her two buddies hope to help her control. Entering the separate lives of the triad, one at a time, is David Sandler. Is it coincidence that he has entered the lives of each female without the others knowing about him? Or does his actions tend towards a secret purpose known only to him?SHOCKING PINK is a chilling shocker that will thrill fans of both romantic intrigue and suspense. The characters, especially the wholesome threesome seem so genuine that most readers will think that they complete the quartet. It is the realistic background that spins Erica Spindler's story into what will surely be acknowledged as one of the best, but most frightening novels of the year.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Shocking Pink","review":"Although I found this book to be interesting, well written, and the characters worth caring about, I didn't think it was one of Erica Spindler's best books. Though the storyline is sexually explicit and deals with an adult theme, it was done in a tasteful and inoffensive manner.What kept me turning the pages was not necessarily the murder mystery itself, but rather the intricate and sometimes cloying relationship between the three young girls who grew even closer as they grew older. All were obsessive regarding family and loyalty due to various happenings in their own family dynamics. I had to keep reading to see if any of them would develop a life of their own.I did figure out the mystery before the end and wasn't the least bit shocked.

Great book by a great author!"},{"Title":"The Sacrificial Mother : Escaping the Trap of Self-Denial","review":"Although this book provides some interesting reading for an experienced mother it would be dangerous if it fell into the hands of a new one. The author continually advises against falling in love with your little one and seems to ignore their feelings completely. This is contrary to what most new mothers need. Beginning mothers need to have their feelings of love and devotion validated not ridiculed. The author uses examples like a mother giving up drinking soft drinks for breakfast as an example of a sacrificial mother. Is this a bad thing? Is there anything wrong with our children being the catalyst for positive change. There is a lot to lear about mothering but this book offers a mother nothing."},{"Title":"The Sacrificial Mother : Escaping the Trap of Self-Denial","review":"Rubenstein makes some compelling and insightful observations in this book, and the author's message is a valuable one for a mother or mother-to-be. However, the book is annoyingly repetitive (I wondered if Rubenstein's editor was on vacation??), hammering the same point over and over. The book seems disorganized, as well as filled excessively with anecdotal information (\\"my neighbor,\\" \\"my friend,\\" \\"a woman I know,\\") that simply reillustrates points already clearly illustrated. The book should have been trimmed down to a third its published length.In a nutshell, Rubenstein's thesis is thus: Most mothers sacrifice too much for their families, and frequently all this sacrificing spoils the children (and husband) and simultaneously causes the mother to lose her sense of self. A vicious cycle results: the children and husband rely on the mother/wife to do everything for them, and although the mother/wife gets increasingly frustrated, exhausted, and angry at this, she continues to feel it's her \\"job\\" to sacrifice for her family, to *always* meet their \\"needs\\" (which are often not real needs) before--or instead of--her own. The rest of the book simply shows examples of this pattern, ranging from the absurd to the commonplace.Rubenstein is NOT saying that women should give up sacrificing--just that they shouldn't sacrifice quite so much, since it can be costly to their mental and physical health, to the health of their marriages, and to the developing autonomy of their children. She IS saying that women need to make sure their husbands and children also learn to sacrifice--so the whole family works as a team.The book is worth reading, or skimming, if these are issues you are struggling with. Even if you are not, it's not a bad message to be pay attention to anyway. Many women exhibit this kind of behavior even before they become mothers or wives."},{"Title":"The Sacrificial Mother : Escaping the Trap of Self-Denial","review":"This is an excellent, enlightening book. If you are a woman reading it, you will laugh and want to cry at the same time. Carin Rubenstein paints a painfully realistic picture of women that we all know so, so well (think &quot;Mom&quot;) but may not have labeled before. The book will open your eyes to both your own actions as well as those of other women you know and have known. It also tells you how to break out of the &quot;sacrifice mode&quot; that society encourages you to be in and to build a more equal relationship with your mate. I am in my 20s and do not *yet* have children; and the information provided in this book has drastically altered the way I plan to approach motherhood. My mom gave me the book as a &quot;must read&quot; *before* I give birth to my first child. However, it is equally important for anyone who still has children at home to read it."},{"Title":"The Sacrificial Mother : Escaping the Trap of Self-Denial","review":"I thought my mother was the only mother who drove herself to near mental illness with her constant sacrificing. Even though my sister is 22 and I am 28, my mother still refuses to do anything just for herself. I have learned a lot about why my mom is so troubled and why my sister and I have such a difficult time coping. I am going to suggest to my mom that she read this book.

Bailee & Carter are both virgins & don't have much clue on love or romance. It's fun watching them discover each other as well as themselves. Carter is not your typical hero. From the beginning he is very shy & quite but it plays into the story very well. You may see him as a weak person when he gets beat up a couple times but I still liked him. Bailee is a little bossy but if I were in her shoes I'd have to set some ground rules also. I highly recommend this book & can't wait to read the next."},{"Title":"The Texan's Wager","review":"This was the book that made me a Jodi Thomas fan. It was very sensual and I mean that literally, not sexually. Carter's silence and Bailee's attempts to understand him without words took the story down some interesting roads. Their physical interactions were so present and sincere. I cheered for them and it was a charming story."},{"Title":"The Texan's Wager","review":"I thought I'd found a new historical author to check out but after reading this book I'm backing away from Ms. Thomas.This book starts off so good. Really good then Ms. Thomas adds subplots that aren't necessary and she loses the magic and potential this book had. It's not horrible but close so I give it a C.Bailee, Sarah and Lacy are a part of a wagon trail headed West. When Sarah's husband and baby die of fever and Sarah gets heartbroken sick, the wagon trail members vote Sarah out of the group. After the death of her family, Lacy and Bailee pull together to nurse Sarah back to health and by default of being with her, they too are voted off the trail.While trying to find their way to Texas, the 3 women are accosted by a man wanted to kidnap Lacy and take their wagon. Thinking quickly, Bailee hits him over the head with a board and fearing she's killed him, Lacy and Sarah each hit with the board as well so they can all say they shouldered the blame. After turning themselves in at the nearest town, the sheriff deems their crime self defense but to get out of jail they need their fines paid so he raffles them off in a bridal auction. The man they pick from the hat, if he can pay will be their husband. Sarah and Lacy are chosen and ride off into the night with their new husband and father in law respectively. Bailee pulls town recluse Carter McKoy's name out of the hat and agrees to marry him.Carter is right away a sweet character and Bailee is headstrong and bossy and the two fit night together. She's talkative while he's quiet and introspective. Carter finds Bailee beautiful and is intrigued by a woman feeling comfortable with him in spite of his silence.Right away you can sense the chemistry between the two yet Ms. Thomas RUINS the potential between these two by just chunking in too much crap.Soon, it's found out that the man Bailee, Sarah and Lacy supposedly killed is alive and well since no one can find his body. This right here gives the book enough of a mystery and drama to go on. Instead of following through with the impending romance and closeness of Carter and Bailee, Ms. Thomas throws in just random stuff and completely forgets about Bailee and Carter as a couple. There's a mystery with a train robbery, a random Gypsy family, hookers at a whorehouse, the revelation that Carter's parents were murdered and that his mother was deaf and Carter knows sign language, the one lone survivor of the train robbery is a deaf girl who brings out Bailee's maternal instincts. Ms. Thomas spent the majority of the book introducing and focusing on characters that will be in other books and sequels rather than focus on the characters this book is suppose to be about: Bailee and Carter. They get lost in the fray of introducing everyone else under the sun.Just...SOOOOOO much stuff that moves this book from a romance novel to a mystery novel. The beginning was good for for freaking EIGHT ($8) I expected a stellar book or at least half of that and it wasn't even 1/4 of that.Overall: PASS this book on by. This book has turned me completely off the author if this is how she writes her stories."},{"Title":"The Texan's Wager","review":"I really like two leads. Great character development. I didn't like all of the secondary charaters. I found Lacey particularly annoying. I also did not like how the book took a left turn in the middle and focused on issues outside of the primary relationship(which was really working for me). The emphasis on the mystery of Whittaker was distracting. Still, these things were necessary to bring the hero out of his isolation and back into the outside world. Though the hero was unusual, I found him very endearing. Bailee was a great heroine. Emotinally vulnerable, but able to step up and get things done when the moment called for it. I really liked these two and wish they were featured more in this book."},{"Title":"The Texan's Wager","review":"It was fantastic! I loved Carter so much in this story! I can honestly say that I will probably read this book again in the future and you should too."},{"Title":"The Texan's Wager","review":"This was my first book my Jodo Thomas, and I enjoyed it. I find that I am drawn more to the male character, as with some other reveiews Bailee comes across to mixed up. She is hot or cold, never a true likeable warm person. The story was good but it did go from one problem to the next and putting those together it seems was a bit difficult for the writer. There are also inconsistency's in the story where the authors tells us that Sarah's husand sent word to the sheriff that he was taking Sarah to a doctor, but we find in the second book that never happens?? There are other things in the book that do not flow with others. Whitaker is taken by the Texas Ranger in this book, but in the second he says that he heard Whitaker was in jail, so what happened there? Sometimes I feel like the writer forgot what she has already written and changes the story line. Overall the book was enjoyable and I plan on keeping it for a reread, but I am confused as to why Jodi Thomas books are so expensive?? You find most authours for 50. to 5.00, but Ms. Thomas's books are very high in cost at second hand sites."},{"Title":"The Texan's Wager","review":"Thomas is clever at plot and character, also suspense.

OMG one of my favorite hero's EVER!!!!He's the strong silent type, which as the story progresses you will realize why. You will also learn that his still waters run DEEEPPP!!! He did'nt just tug at my heartstrings he ripped them out of my chest! He's shunned, he does not even realize he's so lonely. What he writes on his plain brown sack for the bride raffle is both simple and heartrendering. Then their are his first few spoken words to her, SSIIIGGGHH.I usually don't wax SO poetic over every novel I read but this one just stays with you.The heroine Bailee, although not as sigh-worthy as the Carter is still really likeable. She's brave, passionate, but also insecure, unwanted and untouched. They fulfill in each other the basic human need to love and be loved.Bravo Mrs. Thomas!Would have given this book a 5 star rating except for the middle where it gets unneccessarily convoluted with a child, train robbers, sheriffs, gypsies, whores, a ranger, a widow, and other people and sundry. Took away from the main characters beautifully blossoming romance. Of course some of this conflict helps the characters bond and realize how important they are to each other. Their was just too much melodrama.Still the ending, (not the epilogue) the last chapter in this book, was also pretty sweet and satisfying.This one made me want to write the author and beg her to re-write this one if only so I could spend a few more hours with Carter and Bailee.Read it!"},{"Title":"The Texan's Wager","review":"I read \\"When a Texan Gambles\\", the second book in this Wife Lottery series. before I read \\"The Texan's Wager\\". Having never read Ms Thomas before, I was certain that the first book could never equal the second book. Boy was I wrong.Ms Thomas constantly delivers new and compelling people with heartfelt dilemnas that she mends in her most unique way. She creates sensuality in her characters without morbid sexuality, and truly delivers a fine story.Bailee was thrown off of the wagon train with her two friends, and after some time found herself and her friends put into a wife lottery. Carter, a lonely and unusually shy young man, takes a chance for once in his life and puts his name in the hat for a wife. With a little help from the sheriff, his name is drawn and he becomes wedded to the bossy Bailee.

I just wanted to give him a big hug and snatch him out of the book. It was so cute watching these two discover love together and the intimacy that goes with it.The only thing I would have done to improve the book, and pretty much every book by Jodi, is make the love scene, once you finally get to the big event, longer and not have it happen right at the end with only a paragraph or two. It's pretty much left to your imagination and while I don't need pages and pages I do like a good strong love scene. It's the emotional build up that Jodi is famous for, which I wouldn't change for anything, that makes it so wonderful and deserving of more than a few paragraphs. I must admit however Jodi does tease you with some sensual scenes that create a great build up which is a must in any romance in my book. That is sorely lacking in todays romance books.Don't miss this book. You'll love it! It's going on my keeper shielf."},{"Title":"The Texan's Wager","review":"Finally a romance that keeps you reading.

The story begins with three women, Bailee, Sarah, and Lacy, abandoned by their wagon train and left stranded with no weapons and very little food. The people who abandoned them might have thought they would die, but these are very plucky women. As they make their way to Texas, they are accosted by a criminal and local bully who decides to take their wagon and kidnap the youngest woman for later sale to commancheros. The women have finally taken enough from life in general and this person in particular and they him with a club. Horrified that they seem to have killed him, they decide their only option is to fess-up at the nearest town and plead self defense. Soon they are confessing their sins to the sheriff of Cedar Point, who doubts the story but must keep a hold of them while he checks it out. It doesn't help when they can't find the body. In the meantime the women are taking over his jail and eating his small budget into the ground. Knowing that even if they find a victim, he would never get a conviction in this woman-starved town, he manages to talk them into participating in a bride lottery where any man willing to pay their fine would be allowed to put his name in a hat to get a chance to marry one of them. This is Bailee's story and it is a very moving and funny romance. I like the touches of humor and the way the author deals with this oddball romance and makes it work. She makes you like these people, and care what happens to them. When it turns out their victim is not only not dead, but is carrying a grudge and suspects them of robbing him while he was unconscious, the plot heats up. Throw in some train robbers, a deaf child who is the only witness to their crime, some gypsies on the run, and assorted deputies, Texas rangers, and ladies of easy virtue, and you have a lively and amusing tale. This one is a keeper."},{"Title":"The Texan's Wager","review":"I collect Jodi's books and this one didn't get back to me after sharing it with everyone in my family. Had to replace it."},{"Title":"The Texan's Wager","review":"THE TEXAN'S WAGER by Jodi ThomasJodi Thomas' THE TEXAN'S WAGER is the first book in a trilogy of books that take place in - you guessed it - Texas. These three historical romances take place in the state of Texas during the 1800's, when life was still rough and wild and civilization was considered to be back East.In this story, the reader is introduced to three strong women, Sarah, Lacy, and Bailee, who are abandoned by their wagon train and left to die because of prejudice, fear and ignorance among the rest of the settlers. The three make it back to a populated part of Texas, but along the way they murder a man to defend their lives. Because of this they are given two choices - go to jail, or be auctioned off to three lucky men who are looking for wives in a land nearly void of eligible women. Women, besides those that work in the saloons, are far from being plentiful in this part of the country, and it seems that nearly all the single men in the town of Cedar Point are in line to find them a wife.It doesn't take long for the three women to find new husbands. Sarah disappears with her husband, and her story is continued in the second part of this trilogy. Lacy's husband is away at war, so she goes with her future father-in-law to help him take care of the family business. Bailee's new husband is a man named Carter McKoy, who is known by the town to be a very strange and different sort of man. Carter rarely ever speaks a word, and as Bailee struggles to get to know her new husband, she learns why he is a man of no words.The women's troubles are not over. They soon find out that their lives are in danger when word is out that the man they thought they had murdered, Zeb Whittaker, is still alive and is on the warpath. No one crosses him, especially a woman. At the same time, Bailee and Carter take in an orphan child named Piper, and their lives are now complicated even more, with the child being witness to a train robbery and being the only survivor, her life is now in danger as well.The plot lines sound a bit convoluted, but Jodi Thomas does a good job at making the story as believable as one could make it. She also does a good job at creating such well-developed characters, which adds to the story's believability. I was very impressed with this book and found it a surprisingly enjoyable one. For those fans of historical romances, I highly recommend THE TEXAN'S WAGER. I plan on reading the rest of this trilogy and will look forward to new books by Jodi Thomas."},{"Title":"The Texan's Wager","review":"You can read a synopsis of this story in the Editor's review. I have read several of Jodi Thomas' books, and I am a \\"Texas Story\\" lover. I just wanted to say that I found this story truly delightful. It wasn't the usual down and dirty, full of sex story that most romances are. There are a few intense scenes and the final act at the end, but there is so much story in between. There is the story of 3 women, who are down on their luck and have suffered, who band together to survive, emotionally, mentally and physically. They confess equally to a murder (in self-defense) none of them really committed. The comedy, of a sheriff that doesn't really know how to handle this, had me giggling. There is also the sadness and shock that Carter, at the age of 5 or 6, witnessed and survived his parents brutal murder, but never had the sympathy and love of the towns people that knew them. As for Carter and Bailee, I didn't find Bailee too cold, only unsure of herself as a properly raised woman/virgin, who suddenly finds herself married to a complete stranger. I found Carter to be a refreshing change in the hero role, also. He was tough in the sense that he had learned to survive, however, there was still a lot of the confused, lonely little boy in the man. I found it nice that he was new to the sex scene too, and that they had to learn together what marriage and love were about. Maybe some of this stoy is unrealistic, but if a reader wants absolute truth instead of entertainment, find a non-fiction book...I loved it and can't wait to read Sarah's story... When is it coming out?"},{"Title":"The Texan's Wager","review":"This is a story about the wife lottery. Three women confess to murder but since the sheriff can't find the body he gives them a choice. Stay in jail or participate in the wife lottery. Bailee, one of the woman, agrees and is won by Carter, a very quiet farmer. The story is mainly about their relationship and its growth however there is some action in the story which include train robbery and revenge.Now I really loved Carter. I loved the way Thomas developed his character. Why he doesn't speak (that often), why his home is like a fortress, and why the town shuns him. I felt so much heart ache for his character that even when I finished the book his story remained with me. And I loved the parts about how he would tell Bailee his feeling (I'm not going to give away the secret but it's pretty clear within the first several chapters).Now Bailee is the one I have a problem with. At times I really liked her but at others I just wanted to smack her. I think the main problem was her fear of intimacy. At first I thought maybe she had been abused or raped and that would explain her actions toward Carter but it turned out just to be low self esteem and feeling no one ever wanted her. Maybe in the begining it was ok but after the way Carter treated her so sweatly I could not figure out why she didn't losen up. This is why I gave the story only 4 stars instead of 5.I can't wait for Sam and Sarahs story but I'm hoping that Sarah's character isn't going to be like Bailee. That would be a disappointment but still probably a good read."},{"Title":"The Texan's Wager","review":"After she and two companions are thrown off of a wagon train, Bailee Moore is forced to help them kill a man who threatens the three women's lives. Since they are not murderers, they confess as soon as they find a lawman to whom to confess. The sheriff is perplexed as to what to do with them, especially since the victim was scheduled to hang anyway, so he settles on offering them in the wife lottery.Carter McKoy, a man still damaged by his past, wins Bailee as his bride. It is not long before she completely disrupts his carefully ordered world, breaking down all his defenses and finding her way into his reluctant heart. Then, they invite danger into their home when they shelter a deaf mute girl who is the one survivor of a train robbery and the sole witness who can identify the killers. Their newly discovered love may die a young death if the robbers have their way.Carter is a hero that presents contradictions; at once he is both naive and wise, with a strength and power that reaches across the page to captivate the reader. Bailee, as with most heroines in historical romances, is a woman ahead of her time, with guts and determination that leads her to strike out and get what she needs, rather than wait for someone to provide it for her. However, not only are the lead characters interesting, but also the background ones, from Bailee's companions to the local whores and the lawmen. Readers will eagerly await the next entry in the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Texan's Wager","review":"In 1883, the Roland Wagon train tosses out ailing Sarah Andrews whose husband and daughter just died and for helping the ailing woman Bailee Moore and teenage Lacy Dillavou.

They reach Cedar Point and turn themselves into Sheriff Harmon Riley as murderers.Harmon knows no Texas jury would convict these women especially here when there is a shortage of females.

As they become acquainted they begin to fall in love especially when he risks his life to save hers and when she sees how tenderly he communicates with a frightened lonely little girl, but Zeb lives and wants vengeance on the three women.This is an exciting western romance filled with engaging characters especially a deaf five year old girl who watched her mother and others die in a deliberate train wreck. The lead couple is a delight as both, but particularly Carter, must overcome their respective demons in order to become a couple for life.

That entire experience caused him to grow into an emotionally scarred man.When it is her turn, Bailee draws from the lottery hat and reads Carter's name. He pays her jail fine and they are married. Immediately, Carter's strange behavior takes Bailee back; obviously, he is different from most men. Yet she realizes he is gentle, intelligent, and willing, but his experiences as a child and his remote lifestyle continue to haunt him. Carter cannot relate to people, let alone a wife. He knows the world only through his books.And this is where Jodi Thomas should have kept her story . . . focusing on the growing relationship between Bailee and Carter. I think then THE TEXAN'S WAGER would have been a winner. Ms. Thomas has the unique gift to write a gentle, tender love story. Here she elected to introduce and run with several subplots, and her story slipped away. What a shame, because as a couple, Bailee and Carter had great potential . . . as they explored, discovered and grew together. Such an uncovering would have distinguished Thomas' idea. Nevertheless, it did not happen. Still, Jodi Thomas remains a golden author, her tender stories usually draw around an unusual source and THE TEXAN'S WAGER is true to that format. However, it had such wonderful possibilities.Grade: C+MaryGrace Meloche."},{"Title":"The Texan's Wager","review":"(PG 16: Minimal swearing, if any, and no religious cussing. Only one sex scene (in the dark, sadly, and not very explicit). Some violence, but nothing too gruesome, and a rape threat.)I read the first three books in the Wife Lottery series. This book -- the first in the series -- was the best. Almost 5 gold stars, but really 4.5, rounded up to 5, because I felt the author teased out the lovemaking too long. Much too long. They were married and in love, after all, and even if Bailee is shy of intimacy, Carter has his needs. &#12484;I loved the strong, silent, and lonely Carter. My heart ached for his childhood and I felt angry at the townspeople for their initial unkindness. Carter brought me near to tears a few times. I was happy when he was happy -- like when he got a kiss, or when the chair fit Bailee, or when she first baked homemade bread for him. Sigh. &#9829;Bailee was also a strong and likeable character, in general. HOWEVER!! I was shocked when she revealed her distrust of Carter at one critical point half-way into the story. Bailee didn't trust Carter, but Carter trusted his Bailee, and he was justifiably heartbroken by her lack of faith. I couldn't believe she said what she did.I loved the opening chapter, when the three stranded women bonded together (practical Bailee, brokenhearted Sarah, and scared-but-strong Lacy). The three women stood up together against the entire cast of superstitious and small-minded miseries on the wagon train. Really loved how they stood together against the killer and thief, Zeb Whitaker: \\"No, I'm the one who did it!\\" Each woman is the heroine of a book in this series. However, in this book, after the lottery occurred, we never saw Sarah again, and only rarely saw Lacy. Disappointing.High marks for the sequence of events surrounding a train crash and little Piper, a deaf and mute girl that Carter helps. Carter was SUCH a hero in that whole section, from there until the end, really. I loved the scenes involving Bailee and the gypsies, too, and really fell harder for Carter when he met the gypsies.FLAW: I really liked how Carter had secured his home from any intruders. Some fun little surprises in store for any unwelcome visitors. BUT, I could not believe that Carter did not TELL Bailee about the secret safe place. After all, he knew Whitaker was out to kill her. In fact, one of the major problems I had with this book was the LACK of conversation about IMPORTANT topics, like safely, love, and love-making.A satisfying and gripping read!!The second book,When a Texan Gambles (The Wife Lottery)-- Sarah's book -- was very good, too! I loved Sam, the lonely bounty hunter, and it was great to see sickly Sarah come into her own! I'd give it a solid 4 stars. One thing that bugged me was that Carter and Bailee did not make any appearance in book 2. So what's the point of a series, anyway!!??The third book,A Texan's Luck-- Lacy's story -- was my least favorite, but still it was enjoyable and interesting. About 3.5 stars. It sure had a bizarre beginning, and what's with calling people \\"old maids\\" all the time? A Texan's Luck included nothing of Sarah and Sam from book 2 (drats), but Carter and Bailee played fairly important roles. &#12484;I did not read book 4, about Nell (aka Two Bits) and the Texas Ranger, Jacob Dalton. Maybe someday.Content Cautions: No cautions, really. Minimal swearing, if any, and no religious cussing. Only one sex scene (in the dark, sadly). Some violence, but nothing too terrible."},{"Title":"The Texan's Wager","review":"Jodi Thomas is an excellent writer of western romances.

Everything from simply living spaces, simple food, the outdoors, being content with less and more observant about the world around us. Call it Scandinavian zen or simply wise living.The author hits the nail on the head when she shares how our choices can make our lives better and that these choices often have to do with being still and observant and not allowing big business or hurried people to sway us from taking the path less traveled.Its a book that I read and then set down, then pick up and read some more, and set down. I savor the lessons I have learned from the book and have recommended it to simple living group friends who like myself try and live a self sufficient lifestyle void of so many of the 'must haves' that American society pushes.Living here in the Sierras I also appreciated the authors wonderful stories about what the outdoors offers.

It appealed to me because of its emphasis on simplicity and place---a place known for darkness and coldness, interestingly.

And inspired I was!The author sees Scandinavia as \\"an exotic culture with universally relevant ideas\\". After moving to a simple life on a small Swedish island, she transformed the way she saw life and well-being. The author details how this well-being can be manifested in a Scandinavian-inspired way of life no matter where you live.Highly recommended.*****"},{"Title":"On My Swedish Island: Discovering the Secrets of Scandinavian Well-being","review":"While reading On My Swedish Island by Julie Catterson Lindahl, I noticed I had a myriad of feelings towards it. At times, I was bored reading about herbs that are apparently capable of making your life more enjoayble, but at other times, I perked up upon reading about Sweden's \\"Every Man's Right\\" law. The book was well organized and easy to read through. I felt as if I could do some of the things Lindahl mentioned and create my own Swedish paradise inside my New Jersey home.To begin with, Lindahl suggests various ways to achieve inner peace. The Swedes are big on being outdoors and this value shines through in the writing. Although Lindahl is British, she married a Swede and appreciates and respects their values. She used to run on the treadmill everyday but ditched this habit and began going outside to run and cross country ski. \\"..I live in part of the world where the overwhelming majority of people perceive going out into nature as an integral part of life. A 1995 study showed that 80 to 90 percent of Swedes and Danes...spent recreational time in forested and natural environments or parks.\\" (Lindahl 49-50) It's hard to get out and enjoy nature when no one else around does and too many things are going on.

Well-organized into chapters dealing specifically with outdoor life, plants and herbs, relaxation, design and the Scandinavian diet, the book offers many ideas to help the reader find a balance in life and to enjoy the everyday. A section on resources is provided for those who wish to pursue any topic further.After a short trip to the Scandinavian countries recently where I enjoyed nettle soup and lingonberry pie, I particularly liked the section on food that included several unique recipes along with references to the Vikings and Nordic mythology.However, as much as I liked this book, the rather preachy tone got a little tiring after awhile and some of the material the author chose to include could best be called just general knowledge that is often found in newstand magazine articles.These factors aside, those seeking a more holistic lifestyle and a respite from the barrage of consumerism and everyday workplace stress will find this a pleasant read."},{"Title":"On My Swedish Island: Discovering the Secrets of Scandinavian Well-being","review":"I honestly don't know what everyone else sees in this book.

Also I am desperate to travel to Scandinavia although I have never been. This book also got me thinking about how appealing white can be in decor.

Angela was a model child until her baby teeth fell out and were replaced by teeth that came to a sharp point, like a shark's. Then her step-parents noticed that Angela liked to eat meat, and beets, cranberry juice, red cabbage and raspberries. The Battys were puzzled, but then they learned the truth: Angela was really the daughter of Count Dracula. Having a vampire for a daughter can be a bit upsetting to any parents. But then on Angela's 7th birthday (October 31st of course), her &quot;real&quot; father shows up ready to take &quot;Fangella&quot; home.&quot;Dracula's Daughter&quot; was the name of a black &amp; white film sequel to the famous Bela Lugosi version of &quot;Dracula,&quot; but Mary Hoffman's story puts a fun twist on the idea. This time around Dracula's daughter has been adopted by a couple of people who have to get used to the idea their daughter is a vampire. I wonder what adopted children would think about this story and its implication that a &quot;real&quot; dad could be a real monster, but I am pretty sure Hoffman was not trying to come up with some sort of story to reassure such children. At least, I hope not. Chris Riddell's illustrations make it clear this is supposed to be a charming story and not a scary one, and the pictures of Angela eating raspberries and the first appearance of the Count all decked out in his best gap, do a very nice job of capturing the characters."},{"Title":"flatnessisgod","review":"Just three words...WOW!

This book tells the story and history of America's oldest amusement parks. My fovorate was Rocky Point Park of Rhode Island, the SECOND oldest amusement park in America. Rocky Point had a good run, opend in 1847 and lost to economic changes in 1995. The first Presidential telephone call was placed at Rocky Point by President, Rutherford B. Hayes to Alexander Grahm Bell in Providence. George M. Cohen first performed \\"Yankee Doodle Dandy\\" at Rocky Point. The Three Stoogies made many appearances at Rocky Point. These amusment parks were invented by the Trolley Companies. They built the parks on Trolley Routes to promote their services and boost ridership. The parks were originally called \\"Trolley Parks\\" and most major cities had them. Coney Island got it's start from a Trolley Service in New York.

He was vastly powerful. He was dazzlingly brilliant. He was extremely handsome. And he was thoroughly charming. All of which made the beautiful Miss Jessica Sutton-Drew exceedingly nervous.Jessica had long since resolved to have nothing to do with this perilously perfect man. For she took her strong-willed aunt, lady Susan Peel as her model--and Lady Susan was the most formidable bluestocking in London, a champion of every worthy cause, including that of women's independence.Jessica would only be breaking faith with her admirable aunt if she surrendered to Sir Brian's blandishments. Instead she had to armor herself against his most enticing entreaties--even if it meant betraying her own treacherous heart. (end)This is the story of a woman's journey in self-identification. Instead of submerging herself in other's ideas of what she should believe in Lady Jessica over the course of the book grows into herself with the help of the hero, Sir Brian. The characters are written quite well, I think, and come alive almost instantly. The writing is very well done and quite a few rather topical issues of the time are covered such as plantations in Jamaica, slavery, and the courts system.I found it not only to be a very enjoyable read but also a knowledgeable one. I recommend this book to everyone who enjoys a regency where the characters take their time to get to know themselves before they rush into a relationship, resulting in a most happy relationship."},{"Title":"The Money: The Battle for Howard Hughes's Billions","review":"This book has come under heavy criticism for not covering any new ground (both authors have written about Howard Hughes before). That may be so (the large biblography indicates the extent to which Hughes life and death has already been dissected). However, outside of America there is less of an obsession with Hughes; so if this is the first book you have read on the subject (as is the case with this reviewer), it is actually pretty entertaining - and that is how it should be read: as entertainment rather than heavy-duty information.Phelan and Chester, after giving a reprise of Hughes' life and death, plunge into an analysis of the chaos he left behind: no will, not much idea of how much money was in the estate, no list of assets, not even a clear place of legal residence. The person press-ganged into the role of fireman was William Lummis, a lawyer and cousin of Hughes.In ways that only Americans can manage, the determinaton and settlement of Hughes' estate was the subject of an avalanche of litigation and bizarre claims, as a parade of fake wills and fake relatives appeared and then were removed from the stage by a large hook. In fact, the outright looniness of some of these claims makes for the most entertaining aspect of the book, although they were perhaps not much stranger than Hughes' own life.Lummis gradually managed to consolidate the estate: the last big struggle was with the IRS. The estate (under a billion dollars; the figure varied depending on how and when it was calculated) was eventually divided amongst Hughes retainers and employees, his relatives, and the bulk (after tax) going to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The HHMI had been set up as an elaborate tax dodge, but it eventually managed to rebuild itself as a genuine philanthropic and research organisation. So Hughes (as one commentator noted) did leave a useful legacy after all - but probably not what he expected.This book might not add much to the pool of knowledge about Hughes, but for those to whom the subject! is fairly new ground, The Money is a pretty good read."},{"Title":"The Money: The Battle for Howard Hughes's Billions","review":"If you thought that Howard was interesting, you will find what happened to his money after his death fascinating.

The people who came out of the woodwork claiming to be relatives or wives, and some with unsubstantiated wills were not necessarilly left out. Some think that the Hughes Aircraft Company was the extent of the Hughes estate. That company, actually belonging to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, was only a part of the monies that flowed during the probate of his estate.An interesting man left a fascinating story to be told.

It's a dizzying array of contrasts and passages: not only her (and her family's) adjustment to American society of the 1940;s and 1950's, but the passage of Arnold Schoenberg, and the contrast of John Cage and Schoenberg. Perloff sheds a personal light on the ambivalences towards Jewishness and the imperatives of conversions. The photographs of girls in dirndls and her prestigious grandfather in morning suit are stunning reminders of the power of illustration and the evocation of period. Though this is memoiristic, Perloff remains a literary critic and there are efforts to re-address Adorno and Gombrich (for example)in terms of their own refugee pasts. Marjorie Perloff changed her name from Gabriele to Marjorie, her school from PS 7 to the fashionable Fieldston, her academic address from Catholic University ultimately to Stanford. The book is about what change means, how it reiterates, to someone whose life was abruptly forced, by the Anschluss, into a totally new mode of looking at the world and thinking about it."},{"Title":"The Vienna Paradox: A Memoir","review":"I picked up a copy of The Vienna Paradox: A Memoir, by Marjorie Perloff because the idea of a memoir about Vienna intrigued me, and because I've always been enthralled by the critical mind of this noted and innovative literary scholar. After I'd read it, I ordered some more copies to bestow on friends, most of whom have no particular interest in Vienna whatsoever.\\"Why are you giving me this book?\\" one of my more suspicious friends asked me. \\"What is there about this book that sets it apart from all the immigrant narratives, from all the nostalgic recounting of \`old Vienna,' from all the other autobiographies that people turn to when they begin to realize that time is passing and whatever they don't set down will be forgotten?\\" The central distinction is this: Perloff doesn't just record her own experiences or those of her family and friends, she uses those experiences - the experiences of her extended family, experiences of other famous emigrants from Vienna, together with information about books, museums, websites, as well as restaurants, street guides and all kinds of other information - for other purposes than telling about her self. She's not seeking her own \`roots,' but draws on those roots to examine some of the important and pressing questions that only a critic of the world with great experience, perspective and expertise can ask.What Perloff is exploring with her delineation and examination of the civilization in which her family was nurtured and from which it was expelled is far more complex than just where she comes from, or even what really were the negative effects of the Holocaust. She is asking what are the functions, the potential and the limitations of civilization: what should we value in culture, what should we discard, what can we know, what can we improve, and what are the individual limitations. At one point Perloff quotes Wittgensteinif we think of the world's future, we always mean where it will be if it keeps going as we see it going now and it doesn't occur to us that it is not going in a straight line but in a curve, constantly changing direction. (33)The lessons from history are not imperatives for the future, and therefore every detail must be examined, and it is the role of the artist and the critic to perform this examination, and to edify . Therefore Perloff delineates the achievements, on all sides, of her family - their successful careers in Austria and elsewhere, their connections, their accomplishment throughout - but she also notes their failure to perceive and/or act within Austrian society to counter or prevent what was to come. Except for some foreign bank accounts that came in handy for the family after their escape in August of 1938, there seems to have been little understanding of the dangers inherent in the historical situation. If Grandfather Schuller was allowed into Italy because of a welcome from Mussolini to his former negotiator, it was not political foresight that made Schuller prepare an escape route for a Jew, but belief in Austria transcending personal considerations that saved him.The technique of postmodern pastiche is everywhere, but it is not here an indication of the eradication of values. Perloff is an expert at weaving together associations, websites, museums, biography, memoir, gossip, lunch, poetry and making sense of them all. This pastiche is born from the sensibility of the multicultural, world-wise individual, comfortable everywhere in the universe. Perloff, in opposition to the refugee, the outsider, really believes in a society, but it is an ur society, which incorporates and transcends the differences. Her criticism of European disdain for American society, and American naivet&eacute; as to European society, is an attempt to bring the two together.More than anything else, there is a love story in this autobiographical account -- it is a love story with America, that country that whatever its cultural limitations in comparison to the hoch kultur of Vienna, gave her and her family shelter and opportunity to thrive to such an extent that politics could be safely and comfortably ignored. Written after September 11, when the US is besieged not only by enemies without but also by the intelligentsia within, this book serves as a reminder of perspective. So that although it begins with the story of Arnold Schoenberg who despite his appreciation for the United States, never found in it a lasting and appreciative audience, it concludes with Adorno, who longed for the taste of European culture and returned there after the War."},{"Title":"The Vienna Paradox: A Memoir","review":"Marjorie Perloff's memoir was a complete pleasure from start to finish - it was a lucky accident for me that I came upon this gem.Absolutely delightful - charming in all ways, along with being particularly outstanding in combining the author's areas of professional expertise as a first class literary critic with her memories of an earlier Vienna and the traces that remain. This is not meant to slight at all her sharp remembrances of the events of growing up and the succinct clarity with which she describes them.Her memoir has many sections that point the reader to new areas for exploration: the Neue Gallery in NYC with its scintillating art collection (Schiele and Klimt), Arnold Schoenberg's writings and music, and the brilliant Austrian writer Thomas Bernhard, just to mention a few.The other reviews do a thorough job of providing more details about this book. I'll add that Ms. Perloff, the complete professional, includes an excellent index, helpful notes to accompany the text, and thoughtful illustrations that augment the memoir. A quote from the book jacket's inside cover is particularly apt: \\"This is, in other words, an intellectual memoir, both elegant and heartfelt, by one of America's leading thinkers, a narrative in which literary and philosophical reference is as central as the personal.\\""},{"Title":"How to Make War (Fourth Edition): A Comprehensive Guide to Modern Warfare in the Twenty-first Century","review":"Dunnigan was part of the now gone SSI war gamers generation. This books is not a collection of war stories but a lay person's guide to how wars are managed from a broad perspective. This is not the book written by a beltway bandit trying to sell the next generation of wonder weapons, or an author who uses the usual beltway pompous pointless semantics that offend no one and says nothing. This is a book that talks about war at the retail and wholesale level. There are comparison tables, weapons charts and explanations of what it takes for modern war. You might get a 5 second blip about this on CNN. Dunnigan's books should be required reading for all those who want a more than casual shoot'em up approach to war. His chapters are organized around topics and themes such as &quot;Leadership&quot; or &quot;The Poor Bloody Infantry&quot;. Those who are military academy students or citizens who want a more direct explanation of the mechanics of warefare management should read this book."},{"Title":"How to Make War (Fourth Edition): A Comprehensive Guide to Modern Warfare in the Twenty-first Century","review":"Mr. Dunnigan is an respected authority on wargames and military simulations, having produced more than one hundred (mostly manual) games between the late 1960's and early 1990's. The rise and complexity of computer and video games has mostly left him behind, however, in producing profitable products in recent years. This book is best suited for a reader interested in wargaming or as a basic introduction to broad military topics. If you already own the Updated Third Edition (1983), very little substance has changed in the Fourth Edition. The post-9/11 war on terrorism and current war in Iraq are not covered in any useful detail. In fact, lessons from the first Gulf War are not explained much at all. The \\"How to Make War\\" editions are written very much from the perspective of a wargamer and to a lesser extent a civilian historical and military analyst. Mr. Dunnigan is not a military professional and did not command men and machines in combat as a career soldier, sailor or airmen. His insights are good and in many cases spot on, but an experienced reader will quickly realize that the book superficially covers most topics and never really explains the psychology, politics, and specialization behind the numbers. It portrays an idealized and romantic view, akin to Tom Clancy\`s fiction, by simplifying the issues into mathematical analysis and technical explanations of systems. John Keegan's books do a much better job of giving readers a good understanding of men at war and how they win. Mr. Dunnigan's writing style may also put some readers off, as he tends to lecture and ramble. Given his expert stature in the wargaming community, this professor to pupil style is easily understood. In summary, this book makes a good introduction for non-professional military readers and in particular wargamers."},{"Title":"How to Make War (Fourth Edition): A Comprehensive Guide to Modern Warfare in the Twenty-first Century","review":"This book is one of the best I've come across on the subject of modern warfare.

It doesn't focus on only the infantry or only tanks but dabbles into a little of everything. For that same reason, it doesn't go into specifics about any one branch of the military but that's not the point of the book. It also not a book of tactics nor a book trying to explain why wars happen. It just tries to lay out the different weapons and branches of the military armies use in war.

It is comprehensive, thoughful, and insightful. Dunnigan is not afraid to provide an educated opinion where precise data is not available.The book is full of facts and detailed information about weapons and systems, and the various armed forces, but also covers broader issues like leadership and even the effect of military spending on the economy and what is the real source of military strength.I was blown away by the amount of information and insight packed into just over 600 pages. I have no military experience so I am not in a position to verify the accuracy of everything in the book but in the areas I do know about he was spot on (computers, in the chapter on cyberwar)."},{"Title":"How to Make War (Fourth Edition): A Comprehensive Guide to Modern Warfare in the Twenty-first Century","review":"The author of this book does a good job of explaining what is going on behind the scenes before, during and after a war. However, his attempts at placing numbers on things are misleading. He goes on and on about tactics and strategy yet he fails to see that there is more to war than just sheer numbers (he does mention that but doesn't follow his own advice). The analisis in this book, in my opinion, are leading a lot toward the superiority of US forces while diminishing the fighting potential of any other nation. This makes the book bias to one side and thus useless when one wants to see a honest comparison. Some of the numbers given are incorrect or misleading, for example Canada does not have 2400 AFV (maybe if you count all the trucks :)). Overall good explanation of war as long as you ignore comments about country X vis country Y that are not a direct result of an actual combat (i.e. ignore predictions)."},{"Title":"How to Make War (Fourth Edition): A Comprehensive Guide to Modern Warfare in the Twenty-first Century","review":"Not only is it extremely informative, but Dunnigan takes a potentially dry topic and makes it fun. Provocative thinking, excellent writing."},{"Title":"How to Make War (Fourth Edition): A Comprehensive Guide to Modern Warfare in the Twenty-first Century","review":"This book is good and complete, but as usual in handbooks about battles and military, it has the sight pointed in yesterday, and usually a war can't be won with past strategies. War, I think together with investing in stock exchange or playing cards is between the most hazardous activities men must have to attempt, but Napoleon, Gral Lee or Guderian didn't follow dated doctrines.And this is the case that just now the world has become very dangerous, but it's clear, nobody goes to deploy enormous divisions of tanks, thousand regular troops or dozens of battleships against the USA: simply nobody can afford these, and it's that delayed class of war what Dunnigan explains, but real war of today is terrorism. Modern compact explosives, electronics and devices permits to execute more easily facts of sabotage and terrorism. World War I needed to begin, a desperado firing a revolver from few meters, to murder the Austrian archduke Francis Ferdinand and his wife Sophie in Sarajevo. Today all that isn't necessary and these it's a big danger for all people in civilized countries."},{"Title":"How to Make War (Fourth Edition): A Comprehensive Guide to Modern Warfare in the Twenty-first Century","review":"An encyclopedia of modern military machinery and warfare. Thorough in its look at tactics and the weapons that are used by the armed forces. I would have liked to see a bit more of a look at what could be next though admittedly the author does answer the question in a way by saying that it's more likely to be more of the same with a lot more electronics until the next big war. And then it'll be lots of surprises. I guess my only complaint about the book is that it's not sexy enough. And considering that real war and the armed forces that gets the job done aren't sexy that's probably as big a compliment as anything else.

He's too skilled a writer not to have some effective passages, but the story and characters were underdeveloped. His social commentary regarding homeless kids is pointed, but I missed his dark, satiric humor. The mystery of the stabber is solved, but ironically, the resolution doesn't really contribute to any of the characters' development, leaving me curiously uninvolved with them.

I'm usually one that loves lots of examples but these are mostly useless as the problem statements in both the examples and end of the chapters are written like the author made them up at the last minute. Variable presented are undefined, numbers are reversed from intended or vague, too many assumptions are made and steps left out, and even his standardized variable definitions can get confusing as pointed out before (x, X, x', etc). By the way, the solutions are even worse.All problems and examples are heavy in difficult math concepts. I know the book is on difficult concepts but it feels like the author likes showing off when the concepts can be explained and practiced in better ways.The course I'm in is heavy on homework from the back of the book and the problems statements and solutions manual is driving me crazy.

It is true that there are 'better' stochastic processes books out there if the comparison is made in mathematical rigor for example or even in the unsolved problems etc. However the book holds a value of its own. I personally use it to teach stochastic processes to students who are not mathematicians. I find that it covers a great variety of topics leaving no important gaps on the way. Also I find each chapter of a particular importance. I dont understand why other reviewers found for example chapter 3 problematic.To finilize my comment, I think that this book is written in a mathematical mood (the sequence of chapters and the approach, also using CDF instead of PDF) but simplified for people who do not want to go deep into the maths of stochastic processes, so I would love to had been tought this textbook in my engineering degree."},{"Title":"Probability and Random Processes for Electrical Engineering (Electrical and Computer Engineering Ser.)","review":"This is a good book for a subject that is simple but not easy.

Yes, the homework problems at the end of the chapters were harder than the examples: aren't they supposed to be? And yes, not many answers were given in the back of the book, but the nature of the material is such that having the answer doesn't really help you.

Each section is punctuated with examples which were either exceedingly simple and of no use in aiding understanding of the subject or challenging yet incomplete and only sometimes useful in helping solve the end of chapter questions. The end of chapter questions follow a similar theme with difficulties ranging from far too simple (and occasionally not even particularly related or pertinent) to nearly unsolvable for any student who doesn't already have sufficient previous experience with the subject.That all being said, I found this book to be a terrible resource to learn from or be taught from. I do however see how this book could be used, to some success, as secondary material in a class that is well structured and well instructed.

It develops topics using intuition rather than beating you over the head with abstraction (those looking for measure theoretic approaches to probability look elsewhere like Billingsley).

I would really like to warn other people from using it.The book describes everything with a lot of examples. As a result of this you do not get a basic understanding, but rather some examples that you can adapt and use for a problem that you have to solve.It is like learning that a wheel is turning because you might turn it with your hand, rather than because you are applying a torque to it. Or that a lamp is turned on because you might hit the switch, rather than because a current flows through it.For some reason everything has to be described with CDFs instead of PDFs in the book. It seems like PDFs are something that is difficult to imagine for the author.I once had a teacher in a class, and a book containing a lot of examples like this one.

Most of the examples were just useless explanations graphs. The book also seems to gloss over some of the important concepts needed to solve the homework problems. The only homework problems that I found useful were the MATLAB examples. I would recommend doing these problems even if they are not assigned.The book also does a poor job covering applications, especially in the later chapters on random processes.

For reference, I like Papoulis, for enjoy reading deep insights, I like Gardner, and I recommend Peebles for people who hated this book. However, Leon-Garcia is easier to read and faster moving than Papoulis and Gardner. It is not easy attempting to combine mathematical rigor (which this book still lacks) and engineering point of view from many application areas in one text book. Three stars because I like other books better, but this should be the lower bound of evaluation given to this book."},{"Title":"Probability and Random Processes for Electrical Engineering (Electrical and Computer Engineering Ser.)","review":"If you are in EE, at first glance this book looks perfect. All of the example are on electrical engineering stuff, you see lots of graphs and the book has many tables on the cover making it nice for reference.However... when you really get into this book, you will quickly realize it is pretty worthless.For example chapter 3 is over 100 pages long. It is called random variables. In this single chapter they introduce random variables, functions of random variables, expectation of R.V. and functions of R.V., Markov and Chebyshev inequalities as well as Moment generating functions and Characteristic functions, entropy as well as a few others. I hope you are thinking WHEW!! This should have easily been 2 or 3 chapters.Now to boot, there are 160 end of chapter problems! In the chapter there are 71 examples, BUT only about 20 of them are actually useful. The other 51 examples are strange things like Ex. What does the greek character rho mean? It means an outcome! That is not an example in my book. Meanwhile the end of chapter problems are like Q. Take the Laplace transform of the characteristic function and show that it is a Cauchy R.V. Right... and that is in the book where. Oh yeah, I get it, I am just suppose to be able to piece that together from this amazing book and its 71 examples, whatever.Now, there is a solution manual available for this book with worked out problems. Guess how many are done in chapter 3? There are 34 worked out problems, and they are all of the easiest problems. Out of those 34 problems, only one of them uses the characteristic function. Yet, there are about 50 problems at the end of the chapter on characteristic functions.Overall I am very dissapointed in this book. No worthwhile examples and the explainations are very weak at times. Compared to Papoulis this book is perhaps equal.

I think probablity theory is a very fascinating subject, however, I don't think this is a good book to learn it from.Where do I begin:-The biggest grip I have with this book is the problem set. The problems in this book are, literally, just plain hard. The author expects you to do problems,using the techniques they used in proving an actual theorem! I'm not talking about using the actual theorem, but the actual steps they used. I'm an undergrad in a graduate course, and most of the graduate students aren't even doing well on the homework assignments. I consider myself a pretty decent student. I was able to learn DSP using the Oppenheim book(with the aid of a teacher's solution manual of course). The problems in this book are harder than the problems in Oppenheim's DSP book(and I have a teachers solution manual for this prob. book). The bottomline is that 80-100 problems per chapter won't do anyone any good if they can't solve those problems.-The author's notation is extremely weird, confusing, and downright bad.-I just have the strangest feeling that the author is trying to make the students,whom are using the text, feel like they're stupid.-This book is nine years old. I think the author should rewrite the text from scratch.-My instructor is literally terrible, so I'm going through a lot of hell in this course.-And finally, the author, when explaining the theory, uses alot of tedious reasoning and formulas when doing certain theorems. For example, when he's explaining the concept of a bernoulli distribution, the author uses the indicator function to explain the concept. This is not even needed to explain this concept(I have checked this several books, and this was not done), and it's a bit tedious and pointless to include it in the theory.-My communication systems teacher told our class last semester, that learning from enigneering books is not a good way to learn material. This is all because the authors like to show off their intellectual skill and nothing more. They usually forget to include problems by the time of publishing, and have to delay the release of the book to include problems. And what do they include, diffcult problems, which are really not needed to learn introductory concepts."},{"Title":"Probability and Random Processes for Electrical Engineering (Electrical and Computer Engineering Ser.)","review":"I intend to burn this book once the semester is over; it is utterly worthless. My professor was coerced to use the book and assigns homework from the book, but the exams look nothing at all like the homework or material from the book.My complaints:Insuffucient examples to teach a concept. There is an inextricably, monotonous presence of teaching. The examples are nowhere near adequate to be able to do the problems in the back of the chapter. Superficially, the content looks great, but when you try to learn it from the book, the frustration builds until you cry.The wording of chapter exercises and end of chapter problems is vague and problemmatic. It is difficult to understand what is being taught, if anything is being taught at all. I would like to use this as a reference when I graduate, but realistically, if it's as useful as cow dung now, then why would I keep it?So, get it all over with now, the crying, the late nights pulling hair out, seeking antidepressants for the incessant crying and depression due to frustration. Be realistic in the beginning. Unless you have an excellent professor, you will probably not make a good grade based on homework and/or exams from this book. Better yet, don't buy the book - you might get a better grade on the exams if you are exposed to the unnecessary stress.[This is just an opinion - don't sue me. If, by some strange reason, you're a math major, then you might have a partial background to cope with the book's inadequacies and take a different view.]"},{"Title":"Probability and Random Processes for Electrical Engineering (Electrical and Computer Engineering Ser.)","review":"I am a senior in Computer Science and this book was used as a text book for our Probability class. Our class was very unhappy with it. The author is a very intelligent person, but our class had a hard time keeping up with him. Many of the complex problems refer to equations, tables, and more importantly previous problems that had been touched briefly on 20 or more pages previously. All of the tables were given only once and in a few cases, Chapter 5 problems have you flipping back to Chapter 3 just to read a table. This meant we were constantly flipping pages back and forth to try and read the material.There were also errors in the book that I couldn't believe hadn't been caught by now. Many of the errors are difficult to catch as a student because they fall in equation definitions that are only given once. One error had a double integral misdefined.The author also assumes that the students can identify Taylor series expansions, geometric, and e^x by solving discrete summations, which to be honest I would have appreciated the author going thru at least one example, or giving the student some tips on identifying these.The notation in this book is also confusing. Many of the problems deal with finding the double integral of a function that invloves 'x' and 'y' yet the author uses X and Y to denote a random variable from the respective functions, therefore the book is riddled with equations that sometimes have x, X, and x' all meaning completely different things. This was extremely confusing once we started doing joint probabilites that involved y,Y,y',x,X,x'. Also the author introduces &lt;x&gt; to define the mean, but he doesn't explain this is a defintion but instead introduces it in chapter one problem 7 and asks the student to prove the discrete summation, which I won't try and convey here.In my opinion this book is too difficult for undergraduate classes, but perhaps it would suit graduate level students, if the errors were corrected, the notation was cleaned up, and a few more examples were given."},{"Title":"Probability and Random Processes for Electrical Engineering (Electrical and Computer Engineering Ser.)","review":"Probability and Random Processes for Electrical Engineering is not a very well-written book. The book seems to be gaining more favor with EE and computer science programs, not because of the quality of the book, but rather the need to standardize on texts, regardless of the quality.The book itself is extremely sketchy and lacks mathematical rigor, perhaps because it is supposed to be meant for engineers and not for math majors, but even so it does not explain its subject very well, even though preface states that it is accessible. For example, the concept of counting theory is extremely important in probabiity, but the author devotes a total of six pages to the subject and even notes that counting theory can be skipped without loss of continuity. I don't think so! Also the author's definitions of discrete and continous sample spaces are not quite correct.There are not enough examples outlined in the book and many of the homework problems have little relevance to the examples presented. A good instructor could make something out of this book, but be sure to get a Schaum's outline for more problems and another text to complement this one."},{"Title":"Probability and Random Processes for Electrical Engineering (Electrical and Computer Engineering Ser.)","review":"I used this book in a sophomore-level probability course for electrical engineers and I found the book a bit confusing at the time. The notation is somewhat awkward and examples are interleaved throughout general concepts, making it difficult to discern key ideas.During my doctoral studies, I gained a different perspective. I consistently found the book to be a valuable starting point for many concepts and I now find the examples a quick way to brush up on elementary principles.However, Leon-Garcia doesn't give a thorough approach to probability theory (there are essentially no theorems) and avoids set theory almost entirely. To really put my teeth into something, I would have to track down a more advanced text for any particular concept I was interested in. Basically, Leon-Garcia tries to seperate &quot;Probability and Random Processes&quot; from rigorous mathematics.... something similar to eating fat-free cheesecake."},{"Title":"Probability and Random Processes for Electrical Engineering (Electrical and Computer Engineering Ser.)","review":"This book is a confusing muddle and for students who have no prior knowledge of the subject, it could not be a worse textbook. It seems as if more graduate programs in electrical and computer engineering are using this text, not because it teaches the subject well, but &quot;to keep up with the Joneses,&quot; so to speak. There are too few examples to illustrate problems, and many of the homework exercises are not well explained and have no relevance to the text. The text itself is too bare bones. The introduction uses the words easily accessible or similar terms to describe the book, but that is not true. In the hands of a good lecturer/professor, it may be worthwhile but if you are taking a class with a bad lecturer who is using this text,then you are in deep trouble!

It is a mathematical physics version of the popular books on elementary forces and elementary particles except gravitation: the electromagnetic, strong, and weak forces, which occur in quantum electrodynamics (QED), quantum chromdynamics (QCD), and quantum flavor dynamics (QFD) as well as the standard and and grand unified models. The reader without the mathematical background should buy the book and hire a good consultant or tutor to translate the book into almost ordinary English or even to teach the mathematics involved. The Editor and some other reviewers have commented on the easy to read bold face print. Most people do not realize how rare the use of easy to read print is in physics. It is more common in mathematics, thanks largely to Springer/Springer-Verlag publishers in Germany where Nachtmann is one of the outstanding physics algebraic theorists. Nachtmann emphasizes Lagrangian densities and the Hamiltonians and Least Action Principle related to them, which is one of the highest level and most effective concepts in all of science and mathematics and should be understood by people in other fields as well. I have argued elsewhere that Lagrangians are a fundamental mathematical logic basis of the universe (sort of a Kurt Godel type argument in physics - recall the prize-winning book Godel, Bach, and Escher), but Nachtmann's approach is algebraic and experimental."},{"Title":"Elementary Particle Physics: Concepts and Phenomena (Texts and Monographs in Physics)","review":"I have found this one of the most outstanding books in the field and particularly easy to teach out of.

Anyone who's ever dreamed about becoming a star will love this book.Ali's a rich girl who inadvertantly becomes a television star when she joins her wannabe-actress friend Dana at an audition. Jamie is a former child star now living with her mother and sister over a chinese restaurant. She is joyous at learning that she's been cast in a new TV sitcom, until she learns that she's been paired with amiture Ali simply because both girls have bright red hair. Jealousy and friction occur between the girls, maily on Jamie's part. These issues are not handeled lightly; instead, they are portrayed as realistically as possible. In later books, issues of body image, class conflict, and absent parents are discussed, and none are given easy answers. That's what I like about this book -- it always feels very true to life. As a reader, i identify with both girls at different points in their lives. As well, I can't help but fawn over the lush and lavish descriptions of Allison's house and the life of fame.

It was.I particularly liked that it was based in New Orleans and yet didn't get into all the voodoo type of mystery that so many New Orleans mysteries seem to involve. What a refreshing change. I also liked the fact that the story had several stories within a story- in other words, it wasn't just about Skip solving a crime end of story. There was the boyfriend substory and the best friend who has kids and needs help story and more. That kept the book interesting and the realistic.There were several things I didn't like- First, this book seems very dated to me regarding the internet. The characters on an bulliton board site that had thousands of users and yet they all seemed to be good buddies, at least that is what the author would have you think. Also, has been widely used for a long time, yet for Skip this is a new thing. It makes the book seem very dated. This one thing really bothered me. I kept wanting to jump up and explain to her how this whole internet thing worked. The people around her were not doing a very good job of explaining things or demonstrating things to her.The other thing I didn't like was that I wanted a happy ending for her and her boyfriend and that just didn't seem to happen.

However, considering the overall strength of Julie Smith's novels, it is still an enjoyable read for those who have followed Skip's career from &quot;New Orleans Mourning&quot;.In &quot;New Orleans Beat&quot;, Homicide Detective Skip Langdon is assigned a case in which an &quot;accidental&quot; death has too many oddities to leave it uninvestigated. The victim was a &quot;computer nerd&quot; who lived with his mother &amp; stepfather in a dilapidated house. As Langdon investigates, she discovers there are a number of people who have already been playing private eye for days; these are the victim's friends from his cyber-world. In addition, an open case from the late 60's has a direct bearing on the current case.Smith attempts to make &quot;...Beat&quot; hip &amp; timely by having the mystery revolve around a computer bulletin board group called &quot;the TOWN&quot;. This is a mistake, as it makes the story seem dated &amp; clunky to a reader in the year 2000. It ends up not even being particularly vital to the story, except as a gimmick. The story itself isn't one of Smith's stongest, &amp; could have taken place just as easily in San Francisco (the scene of her other mystery series). Unlike it's predecessors, &quot;New Orleans Beat&quot; really doesn't use the city as a vital character, which is partly the reason it isn't very successful. Personally, I feel that Smith's habit of writing chapters from suspects point of view is a mistake &amp; in &quot;New Orleans Beat&quot; even a glaring plot hole. These books would be much stronger mysteries if they focused only on what Skip Langdon discovers &amp; thinks.Still, if you have read earlier installments in this series (&quot;Jazz Funeral&quot; being especially recommended) you will probably want to pick up &quot;New Orleans Beat&quot; if only to fill in gaps in Skip's personal story.

Not only is this a great history of Johnny Pesky and the Red Sox but it also gives a nice insight into what it was like to be an American male during the WWII period. The book starts with a nostalgic look at life in the Croatian immigrant neighborhood where Paveskovich family lived in Portland, Or, and follows Pesky's career as a player, a member of navy, a coach, and a manager. There are great stories told by Pesky and others, a fine historical perspective, actual accounts of games of note, and the real lowdown on &quot;Pesky's Pole&quot; and the infamous play that ended the 1946 World Series. And then there's the foreword written by Pesky's team mate Ted Williams calling for Hall of Fame consideration for Pesky. You still see the enthusiastic octogenerian Johnny Pesky on the field before every Red Sox game at Fenway with his fungo bat, delightful grin and his obvious love for the game of baseball and the Boston Red Sox.

He'll talk to anybody and everybody and he's so humble. He loves to interact with the fans.''And he loves to interact with the players. Spry, and in better shape than many men half his age, Pesky still hits grounders to today's superstars, teaching them the finer points of hitting and fielding.Pesky's history with the team dates to 1939. Before the days of the amateur draft, a Red Sox scout wooed Pesky's mother with flowers and his father with fine bourbon. His parents, immigrants from what is now Croatia, didn't understand baseball, but they did feel the Red Sox were the best fit for their son even though other major league teams offered more money.They were right.John Michael Paveskovich, an Oregon native, played two years in the Red Sox minor league system before making his major league debut in 1942. That season he set the team record for hits by a rookie with 205, a mark that stood until 1997 when fellow shortstop Nomar Garciaparra had 209.He spent three years in the Navy during World War II, although he did not see combat, before resuming his playing career. He was with the Red Sox through 1952 before being traded to the Detroit Tigers.He spent two years with the Tigers before starting a coaching career that included a two-year stint as Red Sox manager in 1963 and 1964. He came back to the Red Sox in 1969 and has been with the team ever since.\`\`I've had a good life with the ballclub,'' Pesky said. \`\`I just try to help out. I understand the game, I've been around the ballpark my whole life.''Nowlin got the idea for a book about Pesky from Elizabeth Dooley, a longtime Red Sox season-ticket holder, whom he interviewed extensively for his books on Williams.\`\`He asked me about doing it and I said 'It won't sell,' but he said he was going to go ahead anyway,'' Pesky said.Nowlin conducted hundreds of interviews for the book, which includes some interesting tidbits, including the fact that Pesky was a disc jockey for a Boston radio station, spinning ballroom tunes.\`\`In those years, ball players had to have jobs in the offseason,'' Nowlin said.The book, published March 31, is already in its third printing, Nowlin said. He and Pesky would set up a table outside the souvenir shop at the team's spring training facility in Fort Myers, Fla., and sell 75 to 100 copies a day, Pesky gladly autographing every copy and posing for pictures with fans.Pesky is still going strong with no firm plans to retire.\`\`I've been saying if we get in and win the World Series I might retire, but my health has been pretty good,'' Pesky said.Either way, Pesky's legacy with the team is set in stone."},{"Title":"Mr. Red Sox: The Johnny Pesky Story","review":"This is a trip back to my younger days.

However, what's most unusual (from the reviews) it appears one either loves or hates this book. Frankly I think both are correct. How can that be?The general \\"raves\\" are because (a) its easy to use (b) easy to follow and (c)it works. And with that I absolutely agree. It does work! Of all to many dog books I bought this one is the most \\"actionable\\" In other words, within ten minutes of owning it the dog was actually doing \\"trained dog stuff\\". And a month after purchase I had (in my view) a trained dog. No other book accomplished that!The \\"pans\\" are because (a) the book appears \\"dated\\" and (b) it lacks detail. I think these comments are correct but they are really questions of style not substance. Yes, I agree photos might look nicer (and more up to date) than drawings. However, to my mind \\"who cares\\". I know what a dog looks like and I know what a leash looks like! I was just growing tired of knowing what an untrained dog looked like. Many of the slicker books were, well just that, slicker. But I didn't need fancy photos. I needed a trained dog. And all I got with the other books were slick photos. With this book I got trained dog.As to the lack of detail I don't need my dog \\"to be pulling Timmie from a well\\". Although I think the Maller-Feinman principles might well apply to fancier tricks the book is simply designed to get the dog through basic training. I do NOT agree with the criticism of \\"too militaristic.\\" I think the knee example (for example) must be viewed in context of the book. The authors stress over and over again POSITIVE reinforcement. Punishment is designed to send a negative message, never to hurt the animal. This is much like the Feder method of cat training. Feder uses a treat for good behavior and a water pistol for bad. If one drowns the cat or fills the pistol with sulfuric acid they are reading INTO the book (not reading the book). The authors appear to really love animals and the message is certainly not to ever hurt them.Summed up, I loved this book because it worked for me and my dog. Will it win the National Book award? No way! Is this for the individual that has the time and energy to train their dog for slick tricks? Maybe. Is it the BEST book to get the job done in the shortest amount of time? YES! Therein is the rub ...some people want to know how to build a watch and some folks want to just know what time it is.I'm glad I bought this before reading the reviews. However, having gone blindly by the title ... I'm now a happier pet owner. My neighbors are happier! My dog is happier. I think Simon &amp; Schuster only keeps this type of title in print for over twenty when it really delivers. In non-fiction, I define good as \\"solve the problem\\".

Five stars."},{"Title":"Twenty One Days to a Trained Dog","review":"You know how they say about babies &quot;they dont come with instructions&quot;. Of coursde, its the same with dogs. Think of this as the owners manual you didnt get. This is the very best dog training book. I wish I had gotten it before the two impossiblew to follow (and overpriced) manual the breeder suggested. They were worthless. This is priceless!Simple to read, understand and implement."},{"Title":"Twenty One Days to a Trained Dog","review":"The book is clearly written and the instructions work well if you are patient and persistent enough. Mr. Maller is one of the most respected trainers and he knows what he is talking about. Yet, the book does not cover in detail the problems that araise when training for obedience (there are always problems). The lack of photography (there are no photos, not even in the cover) makes the book look a little &quot;cheap&quot;. Nevertheless this book contains some very good information. If you want a trained dog, but not for the obedience ring, this is a great book to follow."},{"Title":"Twenty One Days to a Trained Dog","review":"No ifs, ands or (none housebroken) butts ... this is the best dog training book I've ever seen. It did take me more than 21 days (more like 42 days). However, considering my earlier training attempts fell on deaf ears (I thought dogs have really good hearing) ... I am thrilled. The best ten bucks I've ever spent. Get this book ... from amazon, the library or a friend. These guys really know howw to train dogs. Or actually they know how to train layman to train dogs!"},{"Title":"Twenty One Days to a Trained Dog","review":"I bought this book based on customer reviews and was disappointed. I found not only the look to be dated but the information as well. He actually reccomends kneeing your dog in the chest to break him of jumping up. This is preferable to stepping on his toes because that would be harder for the owner to maneuver-Too militaristic/barbaric for me."},{"Title":"Twenty One Days to a Trained Dog","review":"This book came as described. It is a helpful book for a novice. It is more or less the same way I was taught to train dogs in the seventies. Tried and true although not without some physical B-moding. But if you have a strong minded pup and your new at this its a good easy back round book."},{"Title":"Twenty One Days to a Trained Dog","review":"This book addresses training issues simply and straightforward. I tried it with our 9 month old cairn terrier and it really works. I recommend it for any dog owner who wants to teach their dog manners in a kind fashion. Only thing is we don't believe in collars but use a harness instead and it still works just as well."},{"Title":"Twenty One Days to a Trained Dog","review":"I used this book, in conjunction with other training materials. It's useful, but I wouldn't rely on it as my sole training guide.

The book is written in a simple language and gives easy to follow instructions. It misses the fact that when training a dog there are always problems. It doesn't cover the area of problem solving to any considerable extent. The book lacks photographs of any kind (not even in the cover) which I consider essential to any training book. The info is too superficial."},{"Title":"Twenty One Days to a Trained Dog","review":"This is a good book but you must have patience and a dog with at least a little concentration power. Dolly has learned house breaking and sit very well, she turned one Jan. 10. Come is a work in progress - sometimes she comes and other times not. She has learned not to run out the front door when I open it but to go look out the window. She knows that she can run out the back door into the finced yard. She learned to go out 2 doggie doors (one in the house and one on the deck) to get into the yard. She hates rain and refuses to go out in it!"},{"Title":"Twenty One Days to a Trained Dog","review":"I first purchased this booking the late 70s or early 80s. If I recall correctly, it was on the \\"suggested\\" table at a local bookshop in the Hamptons.Ah yes... the 1980s! In finance, Ivan Boesky personified the times of \\"live big, show off.\\" At the movies ET phoned home, Peggy Sue got Married. The toys to own were a Rubik cube and Pac man.Those icons are long gone ...yet this little book has survived! Ain't life strange?Well since that time (almost thirty years ago) I've had two more dogs and two more wives.I got my latest dog last month. Once again I went back to this \\"21 days\\" classic book. After all it kept me in good stead through \\"Buffy\\" and \\"Charlie\\" and now is being reread for use with \\"Trumper\\" (the dog not the Donald).I see why this has survived almost thirty years on the Simon & Schuster backlist as well as more than thirty five printings in five different editions and four languages. It is a true classic.This is the one book to buy to train your new pup or old dog. It is brilliant in its absolute simplicity.I'm not sure this book actually needed one more review. However, there are very few things in my life that (a) I liked in 1980 and still like (b) that survived from 1980 and (c) that cost under $10.00 yet has brought so much joy.It belongs in every doggie persons library."},{"Title":"Twenty One Days to a Trained Dog","review":"It's an old book with techniques from the '70's (it's published in 1977). If you prefer a book with more positive reinforcements such as treats, petting, etc, I would recommendTrain Your Dog - The Positive Gentle Method--it's better to visually see how to do it.Also, the title made me curious, '21 Days to a Trained Dog' but looks like it would take longer than 21 days, unless you really train your dog every day, at least five times of 5-10 minutes per day (probably even more depending on your dog). If you want a book, besides the DVD I suggested, I'd recommendThe Everything Dog Training and Tricks Book--yes, this one contains easy tricks too!"},{"Title":"Twenty One Days to a Trained Dog","review":"Bought the book, was skeptical, and I turned out to be right.

Ms Elizarenkova refused - and she is 200% right - to retrospectively project what we may know about this language from some less old Old Indian documents to asses this unrivalled language of the Rig Veda. Consequently she has to study this language from inside. Her method is then very simple. She will not build a grammar of the language of the time when the Rig Veda was composed, but rather a stylistic study of the syntax of the particular language of the Rig Veda. First we have to understand the context in which this language was produced. She studies the Rsi, the poet-incantator-priest of those distant days, the way he worked and his social position, a hereditary quasi-divine position. Then she can enter the language itself since she understands the discursive situation that produced it. And she does it logically: vocabulary, metrics and phonetics, morphology and syntax. Every detail, every remark is deeply embedded in and enriched with the heritage collected from all the linguists who studied this language before her. That enables her to show the real position that is hers and to support it with heavy arguments contrasting it with those of her predecessors. I was very fascinated by her study of theonyms, and that of metrics in general based on the use of the repetition of some names or words, or some paradigms of names or words, to build a highly expressive oral language that can be used as an incantation in some religious ritual. I was also deeply fascinated by her study of infinitives and participles in their syntactic complexification of the sentence by appending what can be a sentence, or the equivalent of a sentence, to a verb or a noun with rich semantic possibilities varying with the formal means used to articulate the infinitive or participial clauses onto the main clause: absolute accusative, absolute genitive, absolute locative for three examples. This ancient language has the rich possibilities - if not even more - of Sanskrit and Pali and these possibilities are perfectly used by the authors to support the poetic form and at the same time to reinforce themselves from it. Finally the book is more a stylistic description of the language than a grammar of it. The grammatical presentation makes it easy to read for a linguist. The stylistic presentation she could have chosen might have made the book more dynamic but a lot less easy to penetrate linguistically. She tried to sketch that possible poetical approach in her conclusion, but that makes this conclusion stand aloof when compared to the rest of the book.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne"},{"Title":"Sword and Sorceress: An Anthology of Heroic Fantasy","review":"An anthology can be ruined by one or two stories.

Berg. Written for parents, teachers, and healthcare providers, Underage And Overweight presents practical guideposts for a healthy lifestyle that will help every child and, even more importantly, do no harm. Above all, Underage And Overweight produces a wealth of information stressing that diets don't work - efforts to artificially force rapid weight loss, such as extremely low-calorie diets, \\"fat camps\\", and appetite suppressing drugs will not keep off the weight long term because the body is resilient about defending its fat and its \\"setpoint\\" of weight. Worse, low-calorie diets, pills and extreme solutions such as liposuction or stomach stapling can have long- term health risks or even cause death. So what does work? Underage And Overweight offers a wealth of practical tips, tricks and techniques to improve lifestyle habits, offer a balance of greater activity and exercise, improve nutrition, and deal with the psychological issues of being large size at a young age. In the case of young overweight children, an ideal solution is often to help the child maintain his or her weight at the current amount as he or she grows older, allowing the child to \\"grow into\\" the weight. An active lifestyle can avert \\"setpoint creep\\" upward as children and adults age. Above all it is crucial to love and accept children, as negative emotions will only compound physiological problems, and children are far too hard on themselves and each other as it is. Underage And Overweight is a serious analysis of a problem with no quick or easy solutions, yet it is packed cover to cover with practical advice for fostering healthy attitudes for long-term improvement - from the importance of learning table manners to encouraging regular walking to meal planning based on sound nutritional principles and much more. Highly recommended, and a valuable resource of vital information for adults struggling with obesity as surely as children."},{"Title":"Sons From Afar","review":"I began reading Cynithia Voigt in eight grade. My teacher assigned Dicey's Song and I fell in love. Her style is unmatched...she makes you feel as if you are apart of the Tillerman family and anything that happens to them, happens to you...a sign of a &quot;born to be&quot; writer. James and Sammy seek truth in a journey to find their father who left years before they really new what it would mean to be Tillermans. Excellent book for all ages. I have read all of the Tillerman cycle and ache for more...give them to any child coming of age...Voigt's knowlege of adolescence is astounding. I am twenty years old and they have been a guide and support to me thus far in my life, I am certain they will do the same for my little girl someday."},{"Title":"Sons From Afar","review":"Sons From Afar, by Cynthia Voigt was another huge success. In this particular book, the main characters are James & Sammy. James was the kind of person who wished to find out about his lost father because of his feelings in high school on how \\"being a dork isn't going to get you anywhere.\\" He believes that since all the boys his age had fathers, they were all taught how to catch a ball ever since they were little. Although James had good grades, he wants to find a sport he could play well on. For Sammy, he's like the opposite of James. He's very active: participating in tennis and always being full of energy. When Sammy learned that James wanted to find their father, he didn't hesitate. He even entered a bar that says \\"no kids allowed\\" just to find his father! This was how Cynthia Voigt made this book interesting: describing the differences and problems of two brothers that can also happen in our every day lives. On every single page, there is excitement and adventure to make the reader satisfied on what he or she is reading. I have enjoyed this book, and this book will be an excellent choice for people who want to read about young adult fiction."},{"Title":"Sons From Afar","review":"In another of the Tillerman series, Cynthia Voight explores the relationship between James and Sammy as each attempts to discover his inner self and who he wants to be. As the brothers search for a long missing father they grow to understand and admire each other. Although the plot bogs down in detail at times, there is enough action to keep the reader turning pages through to the finish. Not as captivating as the first two books in the series.Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge"},{"Title":"Sons From Afar","review":"Before anyone reads this, I have a confession to make. I'm thirteen, male, considered intelligent, and my favorite genres are Sci-fi and Fantasy.The concept is intrigiuing. Unfortunately, the author doesn't expand beyond the &quot;Boys look for father, find themselves...&quot; idea. This severly limits the plot progression and character development.The excessive description was taken one step too far, detracting instead of adding to the story. If the books are plants, and description is water, Cynthia Voigt's neighborhood is now a lake. Case in point: There are more than four full paragraphs describing one character's musings about flea eyes.The truth is, I felt very little desire to complete the book...... until I remembered that a major part of my grade depended on it. Even though I resented reading it, others may find it to be one of their favorite books. Everyone has different tastes."},{"Title":"Sons From Afar","review":"\\"Sons from Afar\\", book 6 of 7 about the indomitable Tillerman family focuses on two brothers searching for their father. It keeps us jumping from page to page and we hold our breath through all of their adventures. Read by itself it is exciting to the very end. Read as part of the Tillerman series it fleshes out the family and adds dimension to all of them who we have grown to love. I only wish Cynthia Voight has written 15 books about the Tillermans.

Each successive book is just awful.Sons From Afar (#6 of 7) is another 1-2 star Tillerman series book. The book was about brothers James and Sammy. The whole story line of looking for their father was drawn out the entire book and it didn't hold much interest to begin after the first few chapters.Worse, Voight destroys any vestige of positive feelings about these two characters we felt when reading Homecoming and Dicey's Song. James transforms into a scared neurotic paranoid person who is afraid of what others might think and lets people use him (as in cheating at school) who is afraid to quit a school sports program. This is completely opposite of how James was portrayed in Homecoming and Dicey's Song. Sammy who had been learning to control his anger before now deliberately provokes a bar fight with a man getting both himself and James beat up."},{"Title":"Sons From Afar","review":"Voigt continues her award-winning Tillerman series with this coming-of-age story about 15-year-old James and 13-year-old Sammy.

Though Sammy is uninterested in finding the father he never knew, he helps James in his search, seeing it as an adventure. Where it leads them will change their lives profoundly. Voigt's strength lies in her characters, and this book is abundant evidence of that as we suffer the pangs of adolescence and growing maturity with the Tillerman boys."},{"Title":"Sons From Afar","review":"My opinions of this book differ from most peoples. I am a 13 year old teen. This book contains none of the elements of a story that I enjoy. I thought the book was extremely dull. The plot was well developed, but nothing kept me hooked except the due date of an essay I had to write on the novel. I prefer action, and this book had little.

I like the part when Sammy was giving his report for the class on Greek mythology and he told a story about how the sun God, Apollo, let his son drive the chariot with the sun across the sky. The story was iteresting to me. I liked Sammy because he wasn't afraid of anything or anyone. I didn't like the amount of detail that the author gave, it was too elaborate. &quot;Seek and ye shall find.&quot; That meant a great deal to me because it told me that you can meet certain goals if you try hard enough.

Fourteen-year-old Hugh Rudd comes of age in the midst of his hometown's fight to save its old Hendershot Grocery Warehouse building from destruction by the railroad company executives. Like other boys on the cusp of manhood, Hugh must learn how to relate to women, how to fight with but eventually accept his father, and how to smoke, drink, and question authority. Hugh does admirably well, making this the most positive of all the Sandhill Chronicles in terms of happy endings for the main characters. But the town of Agatite does not fare so well. Caught up in a battle with \\"big business\\" (Burlington Northern Railroad), each citizen uses the cause of historical preservation for personal gain. They all use the chaos created during the fight for the building to jockey for new positions of power. Before long, long-held town secrets are being gossiped about in the streets. Learning to deal with this gossip, especially the stories about alcoholism, sexual infidelities, and cruelties of the people he has known all his life (including his own parents), is part of Hugh's maturation process. Clay Reynolds writes realistic, gritty stories about small-town life.

For example, once the Buddha promised one of his monks divine nymphs if he would meditate - eventually after that monk awoke, the Buddha was freed from his promise. What if the entire often complex teaching of the Buddha was skilful means, merely a complex advertisement or device to draw people in - given they would only truly comprehend reality after they had themselves pierced the veil? What if the teaching had no inherent truth at all?This work tackles not so much compassion or even Skilful Means (Upaya) but the Buddhist attitude towards view and whether Buddhism makes any empirical statements of truth that go beyond a soteriological function. It spans the spectrum of Buddhism in its search for the development of Upaya, emphasised in the Mahayana approach.Of the four \\"heretical\\" teachers in the Pali Canon, Sanjaya Belatthaputta was caricatured as an extreme sceptic. Asked e.g., \\"is the world eternal?\\" he replied using the fourfold logic: I don't say (i)it is, (ii)it isn't, (iii) it's both yes and no, nor (iv)it's neither yes nor no. The Buddha is reputed to have asked \\"Does this apply to your own philosophy?\\" One problem that the student will face is that Buddhism itself appears to have aspects of this \\"eel wriggling\\" approach. Schroeder argues, reiterating the famous simile on the raft, that the bulk of the scriptures could be seen as little more than skilful means with no essential propositions. Whereas Schroeder confines his argument to the realms of Buddhist philosophy and meditation, the idea can extend to our experience of reality and attempts at its reification. There is nothing especially new in this Upayic approach to Buddhism though what begins like the re-invention of the wheel is quickly superseded by the ramifications of this idea and how it affects our understanding of the teaching. Schroeder is at pains to be modest stating that the book itself does not represent another skilful means.The author deepens his approach by clarifying the concept of conventional truth vs ultimate truth that was again enlarged by the Mahayana schools. One highlight of the book is Schroeder's analysis of the old Abhidhamma approach representing a matrix of postulates on the functioning of mind and meditation; in particular the description of the arising and ceasing of mind moments within a temporal frame. According to the Sarvastivadins, says Schroeder, the character of the mind moments changed but the essential underlying substance of experience svabhava remained. The Sautrantika's rejected this as it admitted of a self or atman, but replaced it by stating that only the present is real and that moments arise and cease into nothing. These arguments encapsulate a paradox found in any search for \\"ultimate truth\\". The latter scheme denies causation by ignoring past conditions and the mechanism of present conditioning. Nagarjuna and later schools tackled this problem by expanding the concepts of emptiness in phenomena leading to non-duality, important in Zen.We are taken from the Abhidhamma approach through Vimalakirti and Nagarjuna to Zen including a little on Pure Land. Each tradition in succession seem in part a one-upmanship of the previous approach, trying at each turn to avoid the impression of clinging to theories and external forms. The author incorporates elements of Western philosophy and metaphysics into a narrative that is pithy yet engaging and fairly comprehensive.Schroeder is critical of occidental interpretations of Nagarjuna as a philosopher and metaphysician independent of a soteriological aspect. This is important as more will probably be written on Indian philosophy in the West than ever before.Several scholarly works are cited though a few seem questionable. Schroeder's unfamiliarity with ancient Buddhism is somewhat betrayed in his assertions e.g., that the fire worshippers the Buddha gave the Fire Sermon to (headed by Uruvela Kassapa) \\"ritually burnt their own flesh\\" when there is no precedent that the then fire-worshippers did this. He also mentions the Buddha to be with the five ascetics who \\"once lived in the mountains\\". In this light, Schroeder's analysis of the Abhidhamma approach to Theravada in terms of \\"seven stages of purification\\" may be too fixed belying the diversity of teachings then available. The original Buddhism was not Theravada and traditions can only be defined by comparison to alternatives and due to degrees of sometimes unfortunate polarisation to retain integrity.This academic though accessible book, rich in quotation remains somewhat inconclusive at the end though it can be seen that the concept of Upaya in the sense of an absence of fixed teachings probably existed in all traditions. It will be an invaluable reference and an entertaining read about what the teaching is not. Perhaps the work could have been rounded off to indicate what Buddhism therefore does amount to and how it may critically hinge on the learner's state of mind. E.g. When questioned about the Buddha's views and those of his disciples the layman Anathapindaka admits ignorance but does explain his own view (Anguttara Nikaya X.93). To present Buddhism as merely Upaya could simply entrap us in another view. The teaching is a means to truth and involves a grounding in skilled qualities of mind like love, energy, concentration, equanimity, emphasised by the Buddha several times - perhaps these qualities could have been scrutinised to see if they represented nouns or verbs. If they are to be seen as clunky beliefs or potential wings to freedom."},{"Title":"Skillful Means: The Heart of Buddhist Compassion (Monographs of the Society for Asian & Comparative Philosophy)","review":"This is an academic book, which focuses on the idea of &quot;skillful means&quot; (upaya) in Buddhism. Very broadly speaking, the idea is that the teachings of Buddhism are intended as means to an end, the end being the liberation of all sentient beings from suffering (dukkha). The book argues that the idea of Upaya, though more prominent in Mahayana Buddhism, was in fact present and central even in early Abbhidharma-period Buddhism. Moreover, the book explores the idea of Upaya in other periods of Buddhism, such as Nagarjuna's teachings and Chan/Zen Buddhism. The foreward by the excellent Zen scholar T. P. Kasulis is also interesting. However the book is not for the general audience and will only be useful to readers familiar with the history of Buddhism and its primary schools and teachers."},{"Title":"Three Blind Mice","review":"Three Vietnamese men are found stabbed and ritualistically mutilated after death in the town of Calusa, Florida--and they share a common history. They were recently arrested and tried for the vicious rape of Jessica Leeds, whose outraged husband, Stephen, swore revenge upon them when they were found not guilty in a court of law. Stephen's wallet is found at the scene of the crime and two witnesses come forward to identify him as the man seen arriving and leaving the scene of the crime. It is, says assistant district attorney Patricia Denning, an open and shut case.Most famous for his \\"87th Precinct\\" novels, author Ed McBain is also the creator of a series of novels commonly known as \\"The Fairy Tale Books,\\" which draw their titles from loose parallels with children's stories--in this instance the three murdered, eye-gouged victims--and feature defense attorney Matthew Hope. Published in 1990, THREE BLIND MICE is the ninth in the series, and in many respects it is indicative of McBain's stylish prose and way with character.It is not, however, indicative of McBain's best turn of plot. Although it is never implausible, neither is it--in the best traditions of both mystery and detective novels--realistically inevitable; details tend to overcrowd each other, subplot complications distract from the primary course of events, and although the conclusion is clever enough it lacks any sense of real surprise. Even so, fans of McBain will find it mildly entertaining, as will virtually any reader in seach of a quick read for a rainy afternoon. Mildly recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Three Blind Mice","review":"What is it about Ed McBain and romance? It can turn him from Mickey Spillane to Maurice Chevalier in a matter of two or three pages. Here we are treated to a pair of romances, one involving Florida defense attorney Matthew Hope and a Vietnamese interpreter, the other involving a private investigator and a woman who works at the Calusa Tax Collector's office. There's also a murder, of three restaurant employees who raped a woman and then beat the rap.The Matthew Hope books, which seem to have been brought to a close by McBain in 1998 with the release of \\"The Last Best Hope,\\" was an excursion on the other side of the criminal justice system by McBain, writer of the \\"87th Precinct\\" series of police procedurals. It was a detour in tone, in tempo, in setting, and in character, but for some reason, the Hope novels I read never seemed to benefit from this fresh approach. Unlike the \\"87th Precinct\\" books he was writing concurrently, McBain seemed to plot these ones by the numbers, with little interest in what made people tick, until it came to a romantic situation. Then his focus would bore in on cute meets, long walks on the beach, and post-coital cuddles of quiet satisfaction. Often he throws in lovers of different ethnic backgrounds, showing what a liberated guy he is and all that. Meanwhile the killer continues to kill and the reader gets frustrated. Love makes the world go round, but it is more likely to make a good mystery go down the drain.The mystery here, published in 1990, is one of McBain's weakest. It's not terribly clever in its set-up, and an attempt to set up a red herring is transparent. Hope seems unable to see things about his client, the jailed husband of the raped woman awaiting trial for the murders, and those closest to him which any mystery-versed reader will pick up on fast. At one point, when finally confronting the killer, he does so in a stupid, self-exposing way, without backup, despite the fact he knows someone else doing the same thing ended up losing his life.The romances, picked up suddenly in the middle of the narrative, aren't resolved in any way. About the only thing unique is that one of the romances doesn't wind its way into the bedroom, as the couple want to take things slow for a while. The woman, it turns out, is a virgin, which makes her quite an exotic female in the McBain canon.But this book is not for McBain virgins, or you may lose interest in reading his other, and for the most part, much better books. Then you really would be losing out on something."},{"Title":"Three Blind Mice","review":"Ed McBain's \\"Matthew Hope\\" series is one of the more entertaining and engaging mystery series set in that most murderous of states - Florida! Well, not actually perhaps, but if one reads the vast number of murderous tomes and series set in the sunshine state one might get that impression. Like John D. MacDonald, Carl Hiassen, James Hall, Lawrence Shamus, Dave Barry, Tim Dorsey, and others MacBain makes good usage of his setting. Lead character and protagonist attorney/P.I. Matthew Hope's adventures aren't as madcap and humorous as those of some of the other authors mentioned above, but he is definitely hard boiled and suspenseful.In this novel Hope is engaged to defend Stephen Leeds, a man accused of murdering three Vietnamese immigrants who have just recently been acquited of raping Leeds' wife Jessie. When the men are found murdered and mutilated shortly after Stephen had publicly threatened to kill them, everyone assumes that he is guilty. Evidence found at the scene seems to clinch the matter, but Hope takes on the case and begins to investigate, along with his assistants. As is usual in a MacBain novel, you learn quite a lot about the various characters along the way, making them and their motives believable. I recommend all of the Matthew Hope series. While this one isn't his best, it is still a good pager turner. Recommended.Four Stars."},{"Title":"Three Blind Mice","review":"This is the first McBain book I have ever bothered to read even though I have been aware of McBain for years. I really enjoyed this novel and look forward to reading the other 12 Matthew Hope novels.

A lively read, very informative and plenty of fun."},{"Title":"The Courts of Morning","review":"Not many people read John Buchan's works, but they are without a doubt worth reading. This book is one of his best. He has taken character's from his Richard Hannay series, and in one smooth, skillful chapter he throws them into a different world. While his other books deal mostly with the spy games of WW1 era, in The Courts of the Morning three of his best characters (Sandy Arbuthnot, John S. Blenkiron, and Archie Roylance) are transported to a small South American country to try to bring down a man who is almost insanely bent on world conquest. To accomplish this process, they organize the cleanest revolutionary guerilla war ever concieved, and with a mixture of brilliant spy techniques and unexpected mercy they win a victory better than anything the recent war turned out..."},{"Title":"The Courts of Morning","review":"I'm only giving this book four stars because Buchan and others have written better stuff. This novel, concerning the Richard Hannay menage (but in which he makes no more than a guest appearance) is more the tale of Sandy Arbuthnot, master of disguise, and newlyweds Archie and Janet Roylance. In a South American republic, revolution is afoot and Sandy is behind the scenes pulling strings and living in the danger. Archie and Janet stumble upon it by mistake, but then they join Sandy and co. Then Janet is kidnapped and Archie takes Geordie Hamilton into the heart of the toxic Poison Country in a desperate bid to rescue her.The story takes a little more time to get going, unlike Buchan's tauter, shorter books, but once it does, it's gripping."},{"Title":"The Courts of Morning","review":"Courts of the Morning is part of the extended canon of works about Richard Hannay -- although not properly one of Hannay's adventures, which begin with the classic The Thirty-Nine Steps, he does narrate the prologue of this novel, and one of the conflicts created in Courts is ultimately resolved in the final Hannay novel, Island of Sheep. The principal characters in this adventure are Hannay's friend Archie Roylance; Archie's new wife Janet; and Sandy Arbuthnot, the master of disguise who made his first appearance in Greenmantle, the second Hannay novel. Also along for the ride are the American agent John Blenkiron; his young cousin Barbara Dasent; the dashing Don Luis de Marzaniga of Olifa, the Latin country where the action takes place; and Geordie Hamilton, an ex-soldier formerly in Hannay's service. The Roylances get wrapped up in the attempts of Blenkiron and Arbuthnot to foil the plans of the megalomaniac Castor, who has in essence taken over Olifa, and as the plot slowly but surely unfolds, Janet in particular finds herself the object of Castor's quiet obsession. There's a lot of derring-do, subterfuge which most readers will clearly see through, and a lot of detailing of troop movements, along with some noticeable ethnic stereotyping. Still, I found the characters quite endearing, enough so to counterbalance the tidy escapes and fortuitous happenings. Read as a period piece, much like watching an Errol Flynn film, I found it quite enjoyable, and if you're a Hannay fan it's a must."},{"Title":"Lisp in Small Pieces","review":"This is an excellent book on Lisp implementation. You'll get a lot out of it, whether you are interested in writing compilers and interpreters (for Lisp or any language) or whether you just want to see how Lisp works. It is the modern day successor to Allen's &quot;Anatomy of Lisp&quot;."},{"Title":"Lisp in Small Pieces","review":"This is the English Translation of a book originally published in French, under the title _Les_Langages_Lisp_.In it, Quinniec covers a variety of different approaches to interpretation and compilation. Typically, an idea is presented with a chapter discussing the issues related to it -- then in the following chapter, a compiler or interpreter that implements it correctly. He covers compilation to C, compilation to bytecodes, direct interpretation, token-reduced interpretation, denotational semantics, lambda-calculus, continuations, macros, and an object system. It's well-written and engaging, and unlike some translations, the English is handled very well. The primary language being considered (and used) is Scheme -- arguably the easiest LISP dialect to implement and the hardest to implement well."},{"Title":"Lisp in Small Pieces","review":"I'm not a professional reviewer. But I program a lot, and for a living. After more than 15 years of experience in algorithm development and user interface design, to name some extremes, I get the feeling that \\"traditional\\" computer programming languages like C (C++, C#, Objective C) and Pascal (Modula, Oberon, ADA)and even oldtimers as Cobol and Fortran tend to develop, or rather mature, into languages getting closer and closer to Lisp, Algol, and their ultimate offspring, Scheme.This is not without reason.But although the many qualities of Lisp have long since been known in academia, they need time and, more important, good reference material, to find their way into the real world.Lisp programmers know the value of everything, but the cost of nothing, it is said. Christian Queinnec neatly fills the gap in our knowledge in a book that is a hard read because of the density of the content, but also a fun book because all the source is there (available through the Internet, of course) to experiment with.You will not only gain insight into the workings of your Lisp system. You will gain insight into the basic elements of computer programming languages and their reason for being, their implementation, and the benefits and costs they will bring you.All in all, one of the best books on Lisp I have ever almost, but not completely grokked.I sincerely believe that tomorrow's programming languages, whether they be called C** or Delphi 2010, will be closer to current Lisp than to current C or Pascal, and a way to efficiently implement these languages is available here and now.The book covers all standard material like direct interpretation, compilation towards a virtual machine using bytecodes, and compilation to C. New material is found in the chapter on macro's , a subject that has regained much interest of late. A broad variety of programming styles is used to illustrate all concepts.There is only one drawback to the book. It won't teach you Lisp, or Scheme. That is, unless you already know it."},{"Title":"Lisp in Small Pieces","review":"An unexpectedly good book.If you're interested in implementation choices for Scheme and the Lisp family of languages, this is an amazing book.

This book would help those authors fill in the last few pieces and actually implement the whole language.Where this book falls short is as it approaches final code generation --- after you've generated the first working intermediate representation and want to start producing code you'd actually want to compiler.

That may well be the most controversial issue in this comprehensive, amazingly detailed resource for just about any and all questions about homosexuality. Addressed essentially to the professionals whose work brings them into contact with gays and lesbians, we get a fairly extensive history of homosexuality and its relationship to the mental health profession, from its early days when it was thought to be \\"curable\\" by treatment to the 1973 decision that removed it as a psychiatric disorder, then to contemporary issues. Along the way, though, diverse dynamics such as genetics, demographics, environmental cues, psychological and pre-determinant factors, substance addiction, violence, suicide, religion and, of course, AIDS are thoroughly dissected. Further, the editors even include issues unique to bisexuals and minority gays, subjects that have generated little serious published discussion. This book is not and does not pretend to be for casual reading and, instead, targets mental health, medical and religious providers. But it should also be required of the judiciary whose judges still continue to sentence gays charged with various offensives perceived as sexual in nature to counseling and therapy because they gay, a contradiction to the official psychiatric line that homosexuality is not a mental illness. For anyone shuffling through the mountain of books about homosexuality (most of which advance \\"cures\\" and religion as getting on the straight and narrow) but not interested in opinion and pontificating, this is the one excellent resource to consult with questions that require little more than \\"yes\\" and \\"no\\" answers. Incredibly, it gives us answers to questions we might not think even exist."},{"Title":"Textbook of Homosexuality and Mental Health","review":"I checked this book out from the library and realized right away that I had to have a copy of my own to refer to over and over in the coming years. I'm a graduate student studying to become a counselor. Through the course of my studies I have continually been amazed and disappointed at how little knowledge most people in the helping professions have about homosexuality. With about 10% of the population being gay, lesbian, or bisexual, this textbook should be self-required reading by all those in the helping fields - psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors (both secular and religious), sociologists, doctors, nurses, and so on. This amazing text starts with the early history of homosexuality and the mental health profession, ends with spirituality and religion in the lives of lesbians and gay men and thoroughly addresses every other important issue in between. This book is a giant leap forward in the desparately needed advancement in education concerning homosexuality and mental health in this country."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I have a short list of essential books for the Western mind. There is, of course, the Bible, Shakespeare, Anna Karenina, War and Peace, The Works of O. Henry, Sherlock Holmes, Plato, Robinson Crusoe, and a few other \\"classics.\\"One of my favorites is Russell's \\"A History of Western Philosophy.\\" It is a joy to read because he is taking so vast an amount of information and making it accessible to the reader. Each segment is usually no more than 15-20 pages long (if that), and it gives you a highly intelligent overview of their most significant views. Further, it gives enough information to inform the reader as to whether it would be of interest to pursue a more detailed understanding.While Russell was not a Christian or religious, he speaks with a very solid understanding of Christian thought and the scriptures. Further, he is respectful even when he must bring criticism to bear on some church doctor or father.If I were teaching introductory philosophy, this is THE BOOK that I would use, supplemented with the actual writings of some of the key philosophers.Very simply, if you want to understand Western thought--where it came from and why we believe as we do--you won't find a better volume. Of course, you could read all the books on western history and thought...but why do that when Russell has assembled it so brilliantly in this book?"},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I've read A History of Western Philosophy more than a few times, and even gave it as a gift to a few friends. Russell has accomplished a lot with this, having created a page-turner that you just can't put down, while at the same time providing one of the most lucid histories of philosophy ever written. He also editorialized a good amount, commenting and interpreting the concepts of others in a honest manner."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"\\"a history of western philosophy\\" is a great introduction to the field for the devotee or novice of ideas and is entertaining for intellectuals and book lovers, but russell clearly has not read a great deal of some of the philosophers he attacks and dismisses so sneeringly. ... schopenhauer pretended to believe in the renunciation of the will, but this part of his philosophy is precisely that which we should take with a grain of salt, as schopenhauer himself proved with his life--he loved wine, books, writing, music, etc, all things which clearly involved the excitement and use of the will. his renunciatory, life negating ethic is only a sort of postscript to \\"the world as...\\" and his pessimism is more tongue in cheek and temperamental than objective or philosophical. the value of his work lies in everything but these essentially unimportant and immature elements. nietzsche was not, as russell, portrays him, a grim obsessive over power who did nothing but advocate the the elimination of the average and weak elements of society. nor was he an anti semite as russell implies. in fact, nietzsche despised anti semites and considered the jewish people an exceptionally strong and enduring race of people. russell claims several times that nietzsche's philosophy is essentially a love of pain, which is a caricature if ever there was one. nietzsche preached a philosophy of absolute life affirmation, meaning not only the acceptance but the affirmation of creative joy AND pain and destruction. his is not a philosophy of force worshiping masochism, but quite the opposite, an exaltation of the creative and liberated individual from false values and conformity. 'will to power' rhetoric aside, nietzsche was, in the final equation, anti authoritarian, although he never would have admitted it.taking these substantial flaws into consideration, this is still an immensely important book and one that will be read by those self educators of philosophy who yearn to understand the 'why' of existence."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I have enjoyed Russell's fluid style of writing very much and this single volume History of Western Philosophy is a good quick reference and relatively easy reading for anyone interested in the subject matter. Many works of this nature tend to be laborious and thus discouraging to a newcomer. Russell's book is a joy to read. Regardless of some personal differences in his treatment of certain philosophers I highly recommend the book."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"The first two thirds of the book, which covers Ancient and Catholic philosophy are excellent. Therin lies the value of the book. Russell's writing style is very easy to take, and he discusses (some) historical conditions that shaped the thinking at the time. The last portion, headed &quot;Modern Philosophy&quot; is somewhat uneven. That is perhaps due to the limited amount of space he devotes for each case. One gets the feeling that, for these more complex philosophies, he has been forced to condense the material to the point where a full understanding is lost. Russell does do a good job of following the Scientific / Enlightenment / Liberal / Utilitarian path. But his coverage of the Germanic school makes this reader wonder what all the fuss is about - they come off as practically insane, or at least highly illogical. Other commentators have noted Russell's positivist 'bias' as an explanation for this aspect of his work. That could be the case, or it may well be that the Hegelian school really is nuts. Only time will tell.Russell does spend quite a lot of time on Hume, yet little on John Stewart Mill. That is puzzling since induction is supposed to be the tonic that cures scepticism. I would have expected Russell to have said more on the subject. Also, readers should be aware that the history pretty much ends at 1900. There is no examination of Popper, the Vienna school, Godel, quantum 'reality', or other stimulating subjects from the early 20th century. As a result, the reader is left at the end of the book with the feeling that something is missing - and that more could (and should) be said.That said, Russell sprinkles his history with anecdotes and keeps the tone light. This is not a philosophy book that will put you to sleep. To repeat: his coverage of the Greek and Scholastics is quite good - and is justification alone for obtaining the book. The Modern (post 1600) philosophers get the 'once over lightly' treatment - useful as a starting point - but additional resources will be needed to fully examine those schools of thought.Don't let the carping about Russell's biases turn you off from this book. They are present, but are not outrageous, and they liven up the book. In moderation, a point of view helps keep the reader interested (e.g. Paul Johnson's Modern Times is quite stimulating precisely because he brings his conservative Catholic morals into the text - even if you don't agree with them)."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"The book presents short summaries of the major philosophers, some of whom are not available through today's overly modern curriculum. Russell never panders.The book shows what was required for us to learn to think."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"There are many ways to understand the meaning of philosophy, but I believe Bertrand Russell himself had put it best: &Ograve;Is there anything we can think of which, by the mere fact that we can think of it, is shown to exist outside of our thought? Every philosopher would LIKE to say yes, because a philosophers job is to find out things about the world by thinking rather than observing. If yes is the right answer, there is a bridge from pure thought to things, if not, not.&Oacute; Russell obviously had an eye to spot the bogus and Hegelians and Phenomenologists detest him for that. The dislike is mutual, I for my part can do perfectly well without Hegel, Heidegger and Derrida. I have a very wide reading in philosophy, but I stopped reading philosophy after I had finished with Kripke in the mid eighties. Since then I lean back and enjoy the show without engaging myself in any debate. But that much is apparent: of all philosophers from the 2oth century, Russell is probably the most educational and had been read by more lay-people than any other philosopher. Was that a bad thing? I would say definitely not. His book is still a good travel guide, written by a vociferous and independent mind and in a style of such clarity, that it cant help of sounding offensive especially to acolytes of oracular nonsense. Having said this, I too here and there would prod the old man for an injustice, say about Immanuel Kant or Schopenhauer. In Kants case however, I can appreciate that we look not only at a fundamental difference of opinion, but differences in competence. Bertrand Russells own monumental contributions to mathematics and symbolic logic, entitle him to be a bit snobbish. Kants philosophy still employs a logical tool that seemed to have had barely advanced from Aristotle. It is a point only few critics ever raise, but Kant wasnt up to date even of the logical developments during his own era. So many points in his philosophy that seem to pertain to cognitive functions are actually not logical at all but belong to the set of generic conventions that seem to underpin our linguistic faculties. Its an honest disagreement, and the greater authority is on Russells side here. But he should have given more space to Charles Saunders Peirce, who, among many other things, picked up on Kants table of (basically Aristotelian) categories and put them into the context where they really belong. Russells scant treatment of Peirce who with some justice had been called &Ograve;the most original and the most versatile intellect that the Americas have so far produced&Oacute; is not so easy to forgive. As for Schopenhauer I must say Russell, or his source, is just ill informed. Schopenhauer made his own valuable contributions to epistemology (see my review on Schopenhauers &Ograve;The Fourfold Root&Oacute;) which are of interest independently from Schopenhauers more idiosyncratic views expressesed in his later works. In fact by temperament he and Russell had much in common, Schopenhauer being Russels equally caustic and somewhat pigheaded Teutonic counterpart, and, like Russell, a great stylist in his language. If you want a more limited but more in debt overview on the history of philosophy in general up to Schopenhauers time, then read Schopenhauers essays &Ograve;On the Will in Nature&Oacute; and his &Ograve;Paerga and Paralipomena&Oacute;. Schopenhauer liked to see himself as standing on the shoulders of an illustrious line of philosophers since antiquity, the last link that lays the final stone. &Ograve;Every author creates his own pedigree,&Oacute; says Borges, himself a great admirer of Schopenhauer, and Schopenhauer was very good at creating such pedigree for philosophical ideas and following their course through history. But the most telling omission is that of Russells own protege: Ludwig Witgenstein. After a brief honeymoon the two headstrong philosophers went on a long journey of irreconcilable differences, and I cant help siding with Russell on this. Witgenstein is gravely overrated these days, but apart from his unpleasant personality and the airs of a latter day saint he contributed very little worth speaking of to philosphy proper. Russell has the grace and malicious charm of Voltaire, and like him he was a great popularizer and educator. His &Ograve;History of Western Philosophy&Oacute; is worth every penny."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Russell was both a brilliant scholar and a perceptive man of the world, and these qualities shine equally in this astonishing book. His academic excellence is manifest throughout the work, which is written with the intellectual rigor and logical precision of the great original thinker that Russell was. On the other hand, the author's worldliness is evident in the fact that he wrote this book not for a narrow audience but for the widest possible one. He managed in paragraph after paragraph to relate seemingly abstract philosophical issues to practical aspects of the everyday world. The philosophers whose ideas he explains for us come alive as figures of flesh and blood. And Russell's magnificent prose, arguably the clearest and most elegant English ever written, speaks to our time as effectively as it spoke to the 20th. Dated? Not at all. It is as much of the 21st century as it will no doubt be of the 22nd and 23rd. Own it, read it through like a novel, dip into it again and again. It is a truly great book, a triumph of both learned and popular exposition."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Since we are required to read a bunch of Plato and Aristotle for college class, I really need a kind of book that can help me realize the whole devepoment of western thought. The History of Western philosophy played this important role. So far I think I am getting more interested in Ancient Greek reading after reading through The History of Western Philosophy. Besides, I really appreciate that Amazon sent me this book very fast since I bought it."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"In so far as this work accurately presents the history of philosophy, it would deserve only two stars. Bertrand Russell was an early analytic philosopher, and so you will get only an early analytic point of view on the history of philosophy. He has a terrible understanding of the medieval period, and an even worse one of Nietzsche and Hegel. Further, his understanding of ancient philosophers is, for the most part, rather mediocre. The exception is his presentation of Plato, which is only slightly better than his understanding of St. Thomas Aquinas (he seems to care very little for the artistic elements in the Platonic dialogues and so misses the point almost entirely). The strengths of this work, in so far as it is a history of philosophy, lie chiefly with those figures that generally support the early analytic position (e.g. Locke, Kant, Hume, etc.) Still, as other readers mentioned, I would have liked to see more about his own area of specialty, namely logic.I gave it three stars since I use the book as a counterpoint for papers. Russell's understanding of medieval philosophers, Hegel, and Nietzsche is so terrible that his interpretation turns out to be useful for contrasting better interpretations. He has really presented a paradigm of how not to interpret these philosophers, which can be instructive. This book might also be useful for someone interested in learning about certain modern philosophers, as I read someone suggested it would be useful for high school students.Still, I cannot give this work more than three stars because of its many demerits as a history of philosophy, which is what it is supposed to be. Some reviewer suggested that the terrible interpretations are precisely what one should expect from Bertrand Russell, and that he would have been disappointed if Russell had created a more \\"even-handed\\" work. Such a suggestion might have merit, but it fails to understand the purpose of the book: to present a history of philosophy!In sum, if you are interested in an accurate history of philosophy from the pre-Socratics to the 20th century, you should not buy this book. Period. Instead look to Frederick Copleston's _A History of Philosophy_ in its nine volumes. Even Copleston's understanding of Nietzsche is not totally satisfactory, but it's much better. I would suggest buying this book only for three reasons. First, buy it to use as a counterpoint for philosophical essays (if you are going to do this, you should be at least a philosophy major, though I've only found use for this in graduate school). Second, buy it to understand Bertrand Russell's understanding of the history of philosophy - which might be necessary for some scholarly work. Finally, buy it to gain an understanding of some modern philosophers, pragmatists, and analytic thinkers (which might have been the appropriate goal for high school students). Though if you are considering it for the final option, you could probably just buy Copleston's work for the same volumes."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This is one of those books that you can't put down until you are done. Who cares if it is somewhat biased... who is not??!!"},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Russell in this work has solved a big problem for beginners in philosophy. He has gathered all the gems in one bucket and has given you the opportunity to see and select out of these. I have deep interests in philosophy and wanted a head start with western philosophy. Even though I read works by Plato prior to this, I still felt that I was missing the whole picture and a place to put Plato in that picture. I think I have now found the right door to the fascinating world of great western thinkers. I highly recommend the beginners to read this work. Even though at times you may feel that you are being dragged into unnecessary historical information, but you will realize that it does help you later on. Feel free to skip when you are bored, and get on to the philosophers that interest you.I am giving these book 5 stars, because there is no other work that even comes close to the great effort by this great thinker."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"The details of the book display many things but one thing we all must conclude, everyone has their own philosophy, or biased opinion.

Over the years, I have enjoyed reading and reareading it, learning something new all the time. Russell's writing is superb. His analysis is based on the commitment to consider the facts carefully and to reason about them logically and responsibly. In writing my own reviews, I often keep this book in mind as a model.Although Russell always includes a personal commentary on a particular philosopher, this does not undermine the objectivity and value of his analysis, because it is fairly easy to see where a summary of what the philospher had to say ends and Russell's interpretation begins. Russell's erudition is truly impressive. I agree with almost all of his assessments of philosophers in this volume. Russel was a logician, not a scientist--there is a big difference. The book was written in 1943, yet Russell seems unaware of Popper's falsifability criterion for statements that purport to be scientific. But generally, the book is very close to perfection. This is philosophy in context and ideas brought to life from one of the best writers and one of the most brilliant minds of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Russell's history of philosophy is without a doubt the best single-volume history of philsophy available."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I have long been a fan of Bertrand Russell's books, and this is one of my absolute favorites. I have read it several times, and I still go back from time to time and re-read individual chapters.This is a very human history of philosophy; you get a real sense of the times and concerns the philosophers faced.In addition to an overview of Western philosophy, it also provides a fairly in-depth history of the West. The chapters on individual philosophers are punctuated by ones dealing strictly with historical developments and trends.Russell is famous for both his fairness and his outspokenness about his own views. He does not always agree with certain philosophers, but he tries to present them fairly before stating his objections. He is also fearless in presenting what he thinks is significant. How many other books on philosophy present a chapter on Byron as philosopher/exemplar of the Romantic Rebel?A side note. In his autobiography, Russell tells about the composition of this History. He wrote much of it during WWII while staying near Denver. During very hot days he would retire to a little cottage and take off all his clothes.The image of Russell composing this wonderful and insightful book mainly in the nude is quite delightful."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"As a history of Western philosophy it has its obvious (and by now pretty well-known) shortcomings, although I don't think that dishonesty is one of them. Russell does mention that he counts himself a positivist. He does dish out harsh treatment to some philosophers undeservedly, such as Kant (but even there he starts the chapter by telling the reader that Kant is generally reckoned to be one of history's finest philosophers).One of the most interesting aspects of the book is Russell's thorough attempt to explain philosophy's 'connection with political and social circumstances', as promised in the title. I know too little about history to be able to comment on Russell's exposition of political circumstances, but his attempts to expose the relationship between the histories of politics and of ideas are brave and normally sound convincing. What his approach does is make the philosphy come alive and the reader (this reader at any rate) more appreciative of the impact philosophy (and hence philosophers) can have in the real world - whatever THAT is...Above all, the prose is classic Russell and the book is highly entertaining for several reasons, all good! By no means definitive; but if I wanted that, I'd find a dictionary."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Despite its title, Bertrand Russell's A History of Western Philosophy is not really a history of philosophy at all. Russell, though he claims otherwise, probably knew as much. He comments in the preface that, \\"My purpose is to exhibit philosophy as an integral part of social and political life: not as the isolated speculations of remarkable individuals, but as both an effect and a cause of the character of the various communities in which different systems flourished. This purpose demands more account of general history than is usually given by historians of philosophy.\\"One could agree with Russell that his book is a history of philosophy that provides an unusually extensive discussion of general history if only its account of philosophy itself were not so extremely selective: philosophers as influential as Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger are not mentioned at all. Russell, who was writing during the Second World War, frequently digresses from his ostensible subject into commentary on contemporary events. Clearly, what he really wanted to do, during a time when western civilization appeared to be on the brink of destruction, was to write a work about that civilization, its greatness, its failings, and the conditions that had made it possible. Philosophy, as Russell's particular area of interest, was simply the subject he chose to base his discussion of civilization around. Provided one reads A History of Western Philosophy that way, rather than expecting a thorough guide through the subject, it is a reasonably good book. Russell writes with a dry wit, and his perspective on civilization is always interesting whether one agrees with it or not,"},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This book is vintage Russell: exceptionally written yet cheerfully oblivious to his own blind spots. As far as one volume summaries of philosophy go, this is probably the best--not because he faithfully explicates opposing viewpoints from an objective position; he does no such thing. Rather, he *tells* a story and tells it well. Most reviewers will urge a reader to buy (or not buy) a book based on its merits (or not buy based on its flaws). I take the opposite position--buy the book because of the parts with which you will disagree.Russell's book is a snapshot in some ways of the waning debate between the Anglo-Analytic school of philosophy and the Continental European school. Russell's rejection of most Continental philosophers can be seen in his (admittedly charitable) rejection of Spinoza, \\"The whole of this metaphysic is impossible to accept; it is contradicted by modern logic and with scientific method. Facts have to be discovered by observation, not with reason\\" (578). The problem is that final sentence itself, which Russell takes to be axiomatic (note the irony!!!), is itself unverifiable by the scientific method.I think Russell is sort of aware of this critique when he interacts with E. A. Burk's critique of scientism. Russell tries to respond, \\"It is not what the man of science believes that distinguishes him, but the how and why he he believes. His beliefs are tentative, not dogmatic; they are based on evidence\\" (527). We should note two things by way of response: 1) Russell misunderstands the charge. We are not critiquing Copernicus's scientific methods simply because he had open mathematical errors in his formulations. That's not the issue at stake; rather, 2) the claim that Russell advances--scientists are not dogmatic but simply follow the \\"evidence\\" is itself a claim that is not verifiable by observation and evidence. It is accepted a priori.Anyway, the book ends with a stunning conclusion that the history of philosophy has climaxed, not with Hegel, but with...you guessed it...Russell! Okay, that might be a bit much. Russell is in fact arguing that modern logical analysis is superior to all other systems because of various reasons which the getting into would make this review way too long. In this chapter Russell finally seems aware that most of his ability to think and write is based off of presuppositions which are beyond the realm of sense experience (thus negative about 600 pages of this book). He then proposes that modern logical analysis seeks to dethrone mathematics from its pedestal of Platonic ideals and place it more in the realm of sense experience, except he admits this can't be done. In order to salvage his project, he says that mathematical knowledge is \\"verbal knowledge\\" (832). That's interesting because it places the argument into the \\"communal ethics\\" school ala Alasdair MacIntyre.Conclusion:It's a fine book and used copies can be found literally for a few dollars. In order to really appreciate this book, though, one needs to read a few short bios on Russell. The best one is by Paul Johnson, who admittedly has an axe to grind. For example, Russell was a pacifist yet after WWII he urged the Allied leaders to nuke Moscow, thus preventing a nuclear arms race! That makes sense...I guess. If you don't think about it. Anyway, a fun read."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I was raised in places like Okeechobee, Florida, and Orlando when it was still largely agricultural. This book was my first introduction to the breadth and complexity of this beautiful civilization. It is a wonder. Russell shows how hard it was to learn how to think. He gives everything that matters in the development of thinking in the western world, at least up to the Twentieth Century. Russell's views of philosophy and the philosophers remain connected to the realities of everyday life. This book makes a great G*I*F*T for first-rate high school kids. Feeling that a kid is ready for Russell is a high compliment."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"A great overhaul.

It is very comprehensive, insightful, and easy to understand. A must read for anyone who wants to understand who we are and how we got there."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"What Bertrand Russell brings to the history of western philosophy is a clear, readable style and a delightfully opinionated stance. Unlike some writers on western philosophy, Russell is quick to give his opinion on the rigor and the agreeability of not only the philosophies presented, but of the philosophers themselves. He speaks with authority of course since he is considered one of the great minds of the twentieth century. He reaches a wide readership because of his great celebrity, and he is accessible to that readership because of his elegant, straightforward, and concrete (especially for a philosopher!) style. I understand that Russell wrote one draft, edited it and that was it. This is in contrast to some other writers (James Thurber comes to mind) who wrote twenty drafts and still were not satisfied.He had the gift of a great memory, combined with an ease of composition that allowed him to be a most prolific writer over a long lifetime that began in 1872 and ended almost a hundred years later in 1970. He has something of the English Don and the 19th century naturalist about him as well as the 20th century progressive. He was intensely engaged in various political projects throughout his long life, most notably as an anti-war and later as an anti-nuclear activist while writing academic philosophy and mathematics as well as many volumes directed toward the general public. He was infamous (in some circles) for his free-love advocacy and his public rejection of Christianity. He was thrown into prison for his pacifism during WWI. He won the Noble Prize for Literature (not peace) in 1950.Here he takes delight in surveying the entire spectrum of western philosophy beginning with the pre-Socratics and ending with his own philosophy of logical analysis. Curiously (or not so curiously) he does not mention Wittgenstein. His critique of the Greeks, especially Plato, is most edifying and fun to read. He sees modern philosophy as reaching its zenith with David Hume's empiricism. He finds Nietzsche disagreeable and is dismissive of Kant.I am reading this for the second time, having first read it as a young man. It delights me anew. As I read I am unsure as to whether I find his opinions so congenial because they are so similar to mine or because in fact I acquired many of my early opinions through reading Russell! He had quite an influence on several generations before I came of age, although perhaps he reached the epitome of his fame (at least) during the fifties before I presumed to read philosophy.Anyone interested in philosophy of any kind, especially of course western philosophy, should read this book. It is one of those books that cannot be ignored. First published in 1945, it is still in print today and will be for many decades to come. I only regret that Russell did not take the time to study eastern philosophies as well and to include them in this volume. How interesting it would be to read Russell on say, Buddhism, Taoism and Vedanta."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"A very good introduction, so long as the reader knows with whom they are dealing. Russell is fair and even-handed in his narrative and analysis, but he never pretends the book is written sans opinion. The end of the final chapter is a good example as Russell goes on the war-path against philosophers who he claims have failed to separate their metaphysics from their morals, corrupting both. As far as the breadth of the content, I found it quite adequate for both philosophies with which I was both familiar and unfamiliar. I think the focus on the Greeks and Catholic philosophers is a little inconvenient for students who are more interested in modern philosophy (as most are). The paucity of information on Kant is not that serious of a problem. Russell disagrees with him often, but does make the point that Kant is important-- the reader can read Kant on his own; Russell's summary is adequate. I wish Russell had discussed logical positivism and mathematical philosophy, those things he knows best, at greater length."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Bernard Russell's history is famous mostly for expressing his bias. Nevertheless, the history does give a good introduction to classical and modern philosophy; however, it is &quot;empty&quot; in the middle. The Middle Ages are almost completely forgotten other than Aquinas and a chapter on the Franciscans in general. Too often Russell gives his opinion or worses, his personal experiences to invade the book, such as his section on Aquinas beginning with a complaint that some Catholics complained to him that it is immodest to question Aristotle or Aquinas...that's great, but it doesn't make either wrong or right.Etienne Gilson's &quot;The Unity of Philosophical Experience&quot; fills in the holes and is much better for drawing links between various trends of thought, such as Ockham and Hume or Augustine and Descartes."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This will be less of a formal review and more of a personal take, more or less. Due to the fact I've read several intro books, as well as the primary source material, i have a well-informed frame of reference in the judgment of this book's merits.Not long ago I said the following: Russell's A History of Western Philosophy? Patooey! The all time worst intro book i've ever read!Granted, HWP is witty, no doubt. This is probably the book's only redeeming value, meriting it a star. Scattered throughout are gems like: \\"I would rather be reported by my bitterest enemy among philosophers than a friend innocent of philosophy.\\"On the other hand.... HWP is overrated, underwhelming, and embarrassingly inept for many reasons.Overrated? The inadequacy and shallowness of most interpretations of the other philosophers' works is the biggest factor. Worst of all, the flippant comments are amusing, which provide entertainment in a conversation, but are utterly out of place when introducing a serious work. However, Russell's take on Leibniz is reliable, because he did his homework, occasionally.Underwhelming? Russell, like a well trained 'whiggish', kneels deeply before the altar of John Locke, supposedly the champion of the 'modern liberal republican.' Despite admitting that Locke is an inferior philosopher to Spinoza, the godfather gets more press. Instead of philosophy in the HWP, we get self-serving propaganda.Inept? Not once does Russell ever truly take a problem seriously. IThe complete failure to understand Kant, the philosopher of the enlightenment, as well as Schopenhauer (skipping the World as Will and Representation is not a good idea, Bertie) is a huge let-down. Predictably, he reads Nietzsche as a fascist (exposes his shoddy scholarship by linking him to Nazi socialism), whiffs on Dewey's brand of pragmatism, and for reasons unknown, devotes a chapter on Byron. More bizarre is the excessive attention paid to Catholic philosophy. I don't think the biographer Ray Monk even figured this out, either. Contemporaries like G.E. Moore gets a single mention and Wittgenstein, who he greatly respected, none.Quite telling, Russell was shocked at the book's success - he produced it casually, intended it as a potboiler, compiled from the notes for the adult education classes he taught in the United States.Conclusion: The shallowness, due to its intent to amuse, the odd bulk of space devoted to Christian philosophy, all combine to account for world-wide success for The History of Western Philosophy. It might be a good starter, but it also contributes to the sense that philosophy is not worth bothering with.Alternatives: Copleston's series is lengthy, but thorough, and far superior. You can't go wrong with Durant's Story of Philosophy, although it is a bit dated. Luckily, Durant writes as well as any writer in English, making that book much more accessible to most. T. Z. Lavine's From Socrates to Sartre concentrates on much fewer big-names, but has a lively narrative that sensationalizes the content.After you've read any one of these, then try Bryan Magee's books: Great Philosophers and Talking Philosophy where both consists of interviews with scholars. As for a contemporary account, Delacampagne's A History of Philosophy in the 20th century is a delicious read."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Finally, over 20 years after college, I got around to taking a summer and reading this, by far the book I most wish I'd been required to read in college. The writing style is lively and easy to follow: it doesn't read like a philosophy book. (As Mencken observed, \\"Kant was probably the worst writer ever heard of on Earth before Karl Marx. Some of his ideas were really quite simple, but he always managed to make them seem unintelligible. I hope he is in Hell.\\")One reason for Bertrand's writing style being lively is that he doesn't hesitate to inject his opinion. Some philosophers and historians complain about this \\"editorializing,\\" but I like it. It's fun to watch him rip into Plato or Aristotle or Aquinas, because he was smarter than they were!"},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This is clearly one of the best concise overviews of the major philosophers and what they had to say.

This book is clearly written for the general reader. If you want to get difficult he has other books for the more advanced. I'm not trying to learn everything about all the philosophers but rather a little about some of the more famous. This book is perfect and objective. I am aware of many of Russell's controversial personal opinions and none are detectable in this work as far as I can determine. This is about classical philosophers and their philosophies.

Moses's review is great, although it should be noted that Russell and Flew have different aims. Russell's is to \\"exhibit philosophy as an integral part of social and political life,\\" and in doing so, he gives a remarkably erudite overview of the social-historical progress of philosophy. Flew's aim, on the other hand, is to introduce to the reader the general methodology of Western philosophy. Thus, Russell begins with the the rise of Greek civilization and the Pre-Socratics and ends with John Dewey and logical analysis, while Flew arranges his chapters by subjects and shows, for example, how Hume responded to Plato with respect to the nature of value.Both books are important, though for my money Flew's is more valuable. You won't find the great social context that Russell provides, and to be honest Flew's prose is at times convoluted. Yet what Flew provides is an essential foundation, a toolkit for approaching various problems philosophically. He locates general flaws and fallacies in the arguments of major philosophers and gives those fallacies memorable names. Of course he has his own biases, but they do not detract from his purpose in the way that Russell's biases sometimes do. In the end, while I find Russell's history to be more informative, I find Flew's introduction to be more applicable."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Every person who intents to enter to the world of the philosophy needs to know the historic development of the ideas.

This often makes getting through the book tedious. Beyond this, I found the book satisfied my desire, which was to get a 'warm-up' in the language of philosophy."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"It is impossible to pay tribute to this book to the extent it merits without repeating all the praise of others. Yes, it is comprehensive as well as beautifully written. Although I must agree with the criticism that it is not always accurate in its descriptions or always fair it is also true that I can say without reservation that it is perhaps one of the most important books writing in the 20th century. I do not believe it hyperbole to say as much.First, the most important aspect of this book is that it makes philosophy VERY approachable. Anyone with the slightest interest in philosophy can appreciate this book. I wish I could have met Russell, there are times when the wit of the man made me laugh out loud. For example, he says of Aristotle's criticism of Plato \\"I do not agree with Plato, but if anything could make be do so, it would be Aristotle's arguments against him.\\" Another time he says;ae\\"It is only among fools that the wise are judged to be destitute of reason.\\" (This reminds me of some work experiences I have had.)Second, the man knows how to use language. As I said above, the book is beautifully written. Modern writing is dumbed-down. In order to placate the ignorant or lazy reader authors are told to use simple sentences and smaller words. In the movie \\"Amadeus\\" they tell Mozart he uses too many notes. Russell was not shackled by this small mindedness. He uses the full orchestra of the English language. You have to focus when you are reading him just as you need to pay attention when listening to Mozart.Third, I am convinced that the greatest evidence of genius to most people is the degree to which the other agrees with them. I am just as guilty of this as well as any, if not more so. Russell by this standard, my subjective standard, has a supreme intellect. He describes philosophers as both effects and causes in their society. As position I have long held. In another instance, when discussing infinite sets he explains how the set of all numbers is equal to all even numbers, since all infinite sets are equal. This is an argument I once had with a calculus professor who could not distinguish the value of the object in a set from membership in the set.Fourth, the book is relevant to our time. Russell describes how teleology led science down a blind alley, how ultimately the conception of purpose is only applicable within reality and not reality itself. Something proponents of \\"Intelligent design\\" would do well to remember. Russell also deals with how hundreds of years ago dealt with the fallacies of \\"intelligent design.\\" Keep in mind that this was written in the 1943, showing that the supposed \\"science\\" of this movement has long ago been discarded. He discusses the relevance of Nietzche on the world of WWII or Rousseau's naturalism on \\"modern\\" thinking.There are many more reasons to read this book, but if I were to describe them all the review would be longer than the book itself. Suffice it to say, I love this book. READ IT."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I am not that interested in philosophy, but this book also gives an very well written HISTORY of Western thought. I skipped over the detailed accounts, why for example Plato thought, that God existed (or did not exist - I do not recall..), but I still got a definite \\"feel\\" for the development of Western thought. Mr. Russell also describes the men (it is only men...), not only their thoughts, and he shows, how they fit into their times and were influenced by their times.It is probably ideal for what it set out to be, for someone like me, who puts the emphasis on history, it is a bit lengthy. Therefore, I derated one star."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Philosophy is a series of theories and intellectual structures that predated the development of the scientific method. In years gone by Philosophy was the queen of knowledge dominating universities. Now it occupies small faculties and has drifted of into obscurity.The mass of theories developed by philosophy is enormous. Probably the best introduction is that by Frederick Copplestone which is a multi-volume series of thirteen books. Russell's book by comparison is about 800 pages. This means that Russell spends sixteen pages discussing Immanuel Kant whilst Copplestone devotes one of his volumes of 213 pages to it. To reduce a complex subject such as Kant's philosophy to such a small number of pages makes the exposition summarized in the extreme. Yet Kant's ideas are the basis of Philosophy continuing as a discipline after the development of Hume's theories.Russell is a person who was foremost in developing ideas so that we can understand the scientific method. To some extent his life's work has been to dump idealist philosophy as it now continues on in academic institutions. From that point of view the theme running through his book is development of scientific ideas and the move to the modern age. With this in mind it can be understood why he devotes a limited amount of time discussing ideas which are complex in the extreme.His advantage as an author is that he writes clearly and he is able to convey the essence of most of the people he writes about in a clear and understandable way. The book is however more a book for someone that is not interested in philosophy rather than for someone who is interested."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"From what I understand, this is mostly Bertrand Russell's lecture notes for his History of Philosophy class reworked into a more formal context. As a definitive text on the history of philosophy, this book is not very good. I just want to be clear on that. This book is highly biased. I believe this is also the reason that Russell, as a logician and philosopher of language, has titled the book 'A' History of Philosophy rather than 'The.' I think it would be a mistake to think that this was the title chosen by chance alone.However, it clearly illustrates Russell's infinite wit and also most of his own metaphysical and epistemological theory. To me, that is the most amazing thing about the book. Russell's take on the Presocratics through Aristotle is brilliant and his treatment of the Early Moderns as well as the British Empiricists are also AMAZING. If you read some of Russell's more complex theoretical essays like the masterpiece \\"On Denoting\\" and then go over to this text, Russell's treatment of philosophers like Pythagorus and Descartes bleed with Russell's own theories as critiques of these great philosopher's works. This is exactly what I would expect IF I had the opportunity to take a class with Russell.This book has gotten a lot of negative reviews since its publication but I think this is more because people fail to understand what this book is. You have to pretend you just found Russell's class on iTunesU and you are watching or hearing him give his lectures. Then you can see that he gives a great historical perspective of intellectual development in the western world, then a selective description of the philosopher's works followed by his own critique. This is exactly what I experienced in philosophy classrooms from Junior College through UCLA."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"The lucidity of Russell's mind was tremendous grasping the nuances inherent in all systems of thought being able to flesh out all the themes and contradictions involved as he surveyed the times he lived through and the minds discussed. Yet it remains clear his classification as an analytic philosopher rings true because what he disdains in his analysis are philosophers he construes as poets or artists relying on intuition and emotion or in the case of those philosophies termed mystic or philosophers of Will.Somehow calculating, cold and impersonal is Russell and one reads as though Russell is always right and the pomposity reminds one of an old man alone decrying Modernism and Rock and Roll but not loss of faith.Yet the book is a must in capturing Russell and the great minds as recorded in western philosophy."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Nobel prize winner Bertrand Russell does an excellent job in compiling the most relevant stages in the history of Western Philosophy.

Anyways, this book is a good addition to any Philosophy library."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Some readers of this book rightly complain that Russell has little or nothing to say about their favorite philosophers.

I was thoroughly impressed. Russel presents the history of western philosophy in a clear, concise way. Before this book, I'd only read a handful of philosophers that appealed to me and never understood that new philosophies were often a reaction against the prominent thinkers that came before them. This was all made clear, though Russell didn't speak to it specifically, as I listened to this book.

His bias is obvious from the start and I imagine anyone who actually reads this book will be previously aware of it. The most refreshing debunking of Plato, Aristotle and other Greeks encourages the reader that philosophy is not the fossilised subject, unable to escape from the shadow of the ancients, that it once was."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I learned in college that \\"great\\" philosophers are largely those who were most influential. Each attempted some sort of logically consistent concept of reality. The vision of each is profoundly incompatible with those of others. But taken together provide us with a rich variety of possible worlds.Russell studies each of these philosophers within the context of his own time, where we often find ulterior motives for their work. (See \\"Philosophy's Ulterior Motives\\" in Russell's \\"Unpopular Essays\\".)Philosophy for Russell is closer to science than theology because it attempts to use reason to reach truth. Theology tends toward dogma - things you must believe if you convert to a religion. St. Thomas is an example of the misfortune that results when philosophy aspires to theology. Thomas sought to prove the dogmas of Catholicism by Aristotelian logic so that faith is unnecessary. For Russell, Thomas lacked the traditional philosophic spirit of following wherever reason takes you. Instead he began with his conclusions, and bound by those limitations produced a shotgun scattering of arguments to prove them.Russell began this history by rereading the complete works of the philosophers covered. And explains his approach as follows:\\"In studying a philosopher, the right attitude is neither reverence nor contempt, but first a kind of hypothetical sympathy, until it is possible to know what it feels like to believe in his theories, and only then a revival of the critical attitude, which should resemble, as far as possible, the state of mind of a person abandoning opinions which he has hitherto held.\\"Contempt interferes with the first part of this process, and reverence with the second. Two things are to be remembered: that a man whose opinions and theories are worth studying may be presumed to have had some intelligence, but that no man is likely to have arrived at complete and final truth on any subject whatever.\\"When an intelligent man expresses a view which seems to us obviously absurd we should not attempt to prove that it is somehow true, but we should try to understand how it ever came to SEEM true. This exercise of historical and psychological imagination at once enlarges the scope of our thinking, and helps us to realize how foolish many of our own cherished prejudices will seem in an age which has a different temper of mind.\\"This book began as a series of lectures for art students at the Barnes Institute.It is extraordinarily clear headed and highly recommended."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Yes, since it's original publication in 1945, this book has become a little dated. However, this has in no way diminished its readability one iota; this tome has not become an \\"artifact\\" just yet.Bertrand Russell pulled this book together from class notes he had compiled while teaching in the States in the 1940's; he was broke and looking for any kind of renumeration. The sales success of A HISTORY OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHY caught both Russell and his publisher completely off guard; this book, more than any of his others, established Russell as a great popularizer of philosophy.And yes, Russell does obsess on the logical errors and fallacies of his predecessors: the Greeks, Scholastics, Empiricists, Rationalists, and some of his contemporaries (although discussions of Wittgenstein and the \\"Existentialists\\" are purposefully absent).The writing in this thick book is a lucid and witty introduction to western thought; and since it is an introduction, there is not much that could be considered in-depth. Russell expansively sketches out the western thinkers within the historical contexts in which they lived and flourished. He writes with a wonderful clarity, although his anti-metaphysical bias really slants the focus on most of philosophy's greatest. For instance, he merely glosses over Hegel and Schopenhauer, while bringing out the big guns to rip Rousseau and Nietzsche to shreds. The criticisms, while both acerbic and humorous, are hardly cogent.There certainly is no denying Russell's tremendous abilities as an expositor and storyteller; his wit as a curmudgeon is unsurpassed. The reading throughout is lively and full of animated profiles.

It avoids much of the pedantic dryness and/or painful polemic which burdens some of his other books, while maintaining the compelling critical insight which is often (and in my view rightly) considered to be Russell's trademark. Specialists have often charged the History's treatment of various philosophers as being less than adequate, but the concluding sentence in Russell's preface concedes as much, and offers an apology in advance. His intent is to provide a deliberately broad (though essentially sound) account of major Western philosophers, the social circumstances which moulded them, and the impact their thought has had on subsequent generations. His remarkable success easily justifies the attempt. A delicious read."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Very good book, well written and very well researched.

It's Russell's take on the philosophers and their influence on subsequent philosophy and science. The fact that he was an atheist colors his views of what is good and what is bad in this history. The book may be moderately challenging for the general reader. I found his writing on form vs. substance rewarding (in his &#34;Aristotle&#34;). I long thought my understanding of it lacked something. It is important to understand the view from the standpoint of anything previous to the late 19th or early 20th centuries. A statue (substance + form) is said to have form conferred upon it by the artist. I knew that I couldn't quite visualize this in the soul to man connection. In &#34;Aristotle&#34; I found that in man and animals the soul is what creates form (sort of like DNA). This was before the notion of organic form. Aristotle invoked a god-creator, involving the human soul (not eternal) as the formative principle of the body and its life. A part of the soul, reason, was eternal--but Russell sees this as a non-personal continuation, a sort of merging with god."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"a good place to start the great journeyyou can't beat russell for clarity and elegancethis was Russell's most successful bookenjoy!"},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Russell's &quot;History of Western Philosophy&quot; is not the best introduction to western philosophy that I have read. That place goes to Antony Flew's &quot;Introduction to Western Philosophy.&quot; But for many readers, Russell's is still the better book. Flew's book is purely about philosophy. Russell, on the other hand, strives to place thought in its social context, and he is so successful that the book doubles as an outline history of the western world, and a very interesting one. Also, Russell's deep understanding of the relationship between philosophy and science adds interest. Finally, Russell's clear explanations of difficult concepts should make those concepts clear even to the novice or near-novice; Flew's book, although it assumes no knowledge of philosophy, is more technical, and so is not suitable for all novices.Despite this book's well-deserved status as a classic work, it has some major flaws that a reader should keep in mind, all stemming from Russell's intolerance of viewpoints different from his own. Russell, like other logical positivists, saw no place for metaphysics in philosophy. In his &quot;History of Western Philosophy,&quot; he makes no effort to curb that bias, resulting in what might be considered unfair treatments of all thinkers who did not stick purely to science. Also, Russell has no tolerance for systems of thought that do not conform to his preferences for democracy, atheism, pacifism, and social liberalism. So Plato is described as just another proponent of totalitarianism, Rousseau is portrayed as a crackpot and Nietzsche is depicted as a warmonger, but the much less significant thinkers John Dewey and William James get personal kudos for being nice progressive guys full of human kindness. Russell's book is a great place to start, but to get a fair treatment of thinkers such as Rousseau and Nietzsche, it should be supplemented with material such as the chapters on those thinkers in Strauss and Cropsey's &quot;History of Political Philosophy.&quot; And, of course, read Copleston's &quot;History of Philosophy&quot; if you have time."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"As a novice in the world of formal philosophy, I was entirely grateful for the existence of this book. Russell offers not only an expansive view of western philosophy within rigorous historical context, but manages to convey much of his own philosophy within his critiques. I came, over time, to look at this book as more an expression of Russell's philosophy in relation to the entire course of western thought. How could it be anything different? Russell's perspective is, however well-informed, quite one-sided. So much so that the individual philosophers he takes on have no hope of a fair trial. However much I agree with him about Nietzsche, Russell does not even attempt to be fair. Better to appreciate this book for what it is: a personal view. As such, it is quite expansive, and if you need to know more about western philosophy, you'll easily fill in the missing pieces if you start here. But don't run away hurt if your favorite philosopher gets short shrift - I also find myself disagreeing with Russell in many areas. Instead, as you read, try to keep what he accomplishes here separate from how he does it. This is truly a great work, and downplaying its importance because of skipping or riding some particular fellow would be like criticizing the Great Wall of China because they used sub-par mortar. Here is a journey through history through the eyes of one great man. Keep yours open and you may learn something."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Bertrand Russell's \\"History of Western Philosophy,\\" quite simply, is the best all-around history I've seen. Will Durant's is accessible but more informative about its subjects lives than their thoughts. Copleston's history is much more informative but much too long (11 vol.) for any but the most serious student. Antony Flew's, for all of its strenghts, presumes much more technical knowlege than the average lay reader will have. Russell's book, then, seems the best all around intro - it is long enough but not too long, detailed enough but not overly technical, and interesting enough while remaining all the while informative. And unlike all of the others, Russell writes with the impeccable clarity we expect from him, and admirable enthusiasm.Russell's layout is thus: he sets the stage for each section (ancient, scholastic, enlightenment, romantic, modern) by giving a brief historical chapter. Once done, he sets to work on a 10-20 page walk through of each prominent philosopher therein. While he is quite objective throughout (with the occasional biting remark for humor), he generally finishes each 'walk through' with a critique from his perspective of the philosopher in question. These are useful for both the lay person (who has fodder for thought) and the more experienced reader (who gets both the philosopher's and Russell's view).Before I finish my review of this remarkably clear and interesting book, I must present a quote from the book that I feel is endemic of Russell and how he approaches all the multifarious philosophers that fill these pages. The quote intros his section on Greek philosopher Heraclitus:\\"In studying a philosopher, the right attitude is neither reverence nor contempt, but first, a kind of hypothetical sympathy, until it is possible to know what it feels like to bleieve in his theories, and only then a revival of the critical attitude... Two things are to be remembered: that a man whose opinions and theories are worth studying may be presumed to have had some intellegence, but that no man is likely to have arrived at complete and final truth on any subject whatever.\\" (Chapter IV, paragraph 4)Yes, Russell has biases (as has been duly noted in these reviews); yes, he makes occasional biting comments and undoubtedly betrays misunderstandings (though none, I think, deliberate). All the while though, it is obvious that in these pages, Russell presents his subject as honestly, excitedly, and (yes!) fairly as he can. Even when he does express his opinion, it seems obvious to me that he lets you know when he is doing so, and never proposes (as do many philosophers) to have the last word on the subject or to make the readers' minds up for them.Excellent book."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Perhaps we can say that this book represents the best in philosophy -- and lo -- the worst in philosophy. Widely regarded as one of the century's most eminent and controversial thinkers it is not unusual that this book should attract a great deal of attention. Russell shows that he is clearly a man of his times, and while he treats some philosophers with too much superficiality, this book remains a solid exposition of western philosophy. The writing here is superb, it is both accessible and insightful, and he always keeps the storyline moving forward in a kind of spirited hop, while trying to throw in some humor along the way. With great confidence in his own intellectual devices, he never hesitates to follow calm philosophic discussions with sharp polemical swipes. And why not? This is what gives the book its spice. While the main focus of this book is on western philosophy, the book tries to push into the border disciplines of history, science and mathematics. The reader gets to enjoy a nice introduction into the problem of 2 squared, the mathematics of Tycho Brahe, and the paradox of sets. Russell shows no intention of giving short shrift to mathematics and science. In fact, his chapter on the rise of science in the 17th century is the finest in the book.So what does our Superstar think of philosophy? What makes his opinions so popular to some, but not to others? To avoid any misunderstanding let us see exactly what Russell has to say about philosophy. He says &quot;Philosophy...is something intermediate between between theology and science. It consists of speculations on matters as to which definite knowledge has been unascertainable; but like science, it appeals to human reason. Between theology and science there is a no Man's Land; this no Man's Land is philosophy.&quot; So philosophy inhabits a murky domain between two spheres, a sort of open arena of rational speculation that avoids the the trappings of dogma and the minutiae of scientific fact. Unlike the scientific spirit, which must always remain patient and tentative, the philosophic spirit can be bold and speculative, but unlike the theological spirit, must remain free from dogma. As we shall see later, however, Russell is really a man of science and he evaluates each philosopher on whether or not they pushed philosophy in the direction of science and away from theology and metaphysics. Even things like ethics, politics, immortality and the rest of the fodder for metaphysicians do not pass his legitimacy test since they are not easily illuminated by the light of scientific investigation. Russell thinks all definite knowledge belongs to science and the &quot;philosophers&quot; who point the way out of No Man's Land receive his adulation. Those who don't, his contempt.With this in mind it easy to know who Russell likes and who doesn't. The early Greek, Thales, receives a great deal of grace for originating a distinctive hypothesis -- all is water -- and always seeking to look for natural causes and effects. Moreover, Thales is free from bias; his quip that &quot;all is water&quot; is more akin to an hypothesis and one that has much merit -- physicists used to think hydrogen was the fundamental element and it is 2/3s water. Russell encourages us to think of Thales more as a scientist than philosopher. The fondness he has for many of the Pre-Socratics, especially the Atomists, turns into a rather smug contempt when he gets to Socrates. He expresses particular admiration for the Atomists who were strict determinists and avoided most of the faults to which Greek speculation was prone. More than anyone else, the Atomists had the clearest conception of the scientific method that later Greek philosophers were to reject or betray. Socrates is given very little credit except as a man of deep integrity, but as a philosopher Russell sentences him to a scientific purgatory. Plato pushes scientific interest out of the way even further by rejecting the sensible world as illusory; real knowledge is only to be found in the sympathetic contemplation of true forms. Aristotle, while finding the empirical world fascinating and important, introduced &quot;purpose&quot; (teleology) into scientific explanations and further muddied the scientific waters that future philosophers would drink from. This evaluation of Aristotle seems unduly harsh, since he was by far the most careful, studious, and systematic of all the Greeks. His writings on politics, logic, and most importantly biology are pillars of the western canon. His work On Animals was the greatest scientific achievement of the Greeks. Did the Atomists achieve anything remotely comparable? With Russell however, your achievements matter little, it is your philosophy that counts.Russell is like a college instructor who treats previous philosophers as students. He rates each philosopher on how well they were able to twist it in a scientific direction. Russell even thinks traditional philosophy is an inharmonious blend of values (political, religious, ethical) on the one hand and nature of the world on the other. So philosophy only makes progress when it sheds another of its metaphysical layers and starts to metamorphasize into the finer crystallized elements of science. The philosophy of science becomes just the scientific method. Russell is really a scientist, a mathematician, who sees philosophy as precursor to his discipline, perhaps a logical antecedent, but one that needs to die. Much like chemistry had its roots in alchemy, and astronomy in astrology, so does science in philosophy. No wonder Socrates is sent to Purgatory!Since our Superstar really does have an ax to grind, his writing is dynamic and pugnacious, bringing each philosopher to life in an animating contest of wills; swords crossed. How much more invigorating to see each philosopher in the heat of battle, rather than presented in long, arid ruminations in a stale lecture hall. What this book lacks in substance, it more than makes up for it in style and personality."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This is a fantastic reference book. I bought the &quot;Great Minds of the Western Intellectual Tradition,&quot; a series of high quality lectures produced by TeachCo.com, and I used Russell's book as a supplement. It turned out to be a great way to learn about philosophy. I really enjoyed the fact that Russell gives his opinion rather than trying to be artificially objective. My favorite part, that actually had me laughing (laughing at a philosophy book!), was the bit about what Buddha and Nietzsche would each say to the Almighty when asked to give advice about what sort of world He should create. Buddha would go first, then Nietzsche would respond to the Buddha's arguments. Russell writes, &quot;Nietzsche, whom only Omnipotence could restrain from interrupting, would burst out when his turn came: 'Good heavens, man, you must learn to be of tougher fibre. Why go about snivelling because trivial people suffer? Or, for that matter, because great men suffer? Trivial people suffer trivially, great men suffer greatly...'&quot; The book is very readable. Unfortunately, it was published in 1945, so it does not cover important modern figures such as Foucault, Heidegger, Derrida, etc., but it still absolutely worth owning."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"If you've ever wanted to understand the greatest thinkers in the history of Western Philosophy, here's some simple advice: read all of them and all of their books. No problem, right? Start with the Pre-Socratic fragments, then onto Plato, Aristotle, up through the Philosophy of the Church, then into the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, British Empiricism, Romanticism, German Idealism, Pragmatism, Logical Positivism, and the list goes on. Oh, by the way, if you really want to understand this stuff, you'll have to know a bit about the historical context in which these thinkers thought, too.The reality is that, if you're reading speed doesn't reach 2,000 words-per-minute, and if you don't have the desire to go to college for that doctorate in Philosophy, you're probably not going to be able to cover all of the greatest Western thinkers in their deserved depth.This is where Bertrand Russell comes in. Bertrand, an early twentieth century thinker, educated at Cambridge, does the incredible: he provides a comprehensive history of Western thought, that is not only easy to understand, but amazingly hard to put down. Even if you're not usually interested in philosophy, Russell's lively account will pull you in. It's filled with history, humor, ancedotes and fascinating lives, but, most of all, it's filled with great ideas that will cringe your brow and make you ponder.The History is easy to get through. It's written in quick, easy-to-digest chapters, usually about 10-15 pages in length. Want to know about Aristotle's Ethics? Read the chapter. Want to know about Christianity During the First Four Centuries? About Mohammedan Culture and Philosophy? About the Italian Renaissance? About Machiavelli, Descartes, Locke, Hume, Rousseau, Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, or Marx? Read the chapters. If you're eager for knowledge, your excitement will lead you quickly through this book, and Russell's intelligence and humor will not let you down. He's a great teacher.A few criticisms. Because Russell is not afraid to give his opinion of all the philosophers, sometimes you wonder if you're getting the real picture. For example, he paints Jean-Jacques Rousseau as the arch-villain of history; this is certainly an intriguing perspective, but I can't help but question the author's implicit conclusion that Rousseau is almost singularly responsible for the ills of the world. Also, while the content is generally well-balanced, Russell gives an undue amount of attention to Locke (40+ pages), and two modern philosophers, Bergson (20 pages), and Dewey. As John Dewey is Russell's contemporary, Russell seems to have a keen desire to ingratiate himself to the man, and such toadying doesn't play well in a History of Western Philosophy. On the whole, though, the book sings.You may think you're going to use this as a reference, but, like a good bag of potato chips, once you taste a bit of it, you'll want to finish the whole thing and your hand will be at the bottom of the bag, scraping out the crumbs and yearning for more."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"In my teens this book meant much to me . As one who wanted to know who loved to know this book promised an entrance to the world of higher wisdom. Russell tells the story of philosophy as if it is a continuous narrative, a kind of progress in which successors learn from and transcend their predecessors. It all of course comes to climax in the analytic philosophy of his own time. But he does not present this last chapter as a final conclusion, but rather as a problem still problematic and needing addressing.From the point- of - view of many years later the work still has its charm, still seems a wonderful piece of literary work, but is understood in many ways as prejudiced. Russell did not have space in his heart and mind for Kierkegaard, and the whole world of Existensialism. He did not really give much space to the philosophy of religion, or spiritual experience of any kind. The work does not really take into account sufficiently the scientific and technological developments which transform so greatly our understanding of ourselves and our world. It seems to me the ' philosophy' we need today, the wisdom we need today is much broader than that Russell envisaged. At the same time the Queen of the Sciences has if we rely on the analytic tradition alone contracted and is less central than before.With all objection and qualification however this work is a wonderful introduction to the History of Philosophy, in no small part because of Russell's great enthusiasm for the subject and capacity to convey this in sparkling prose."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I'm going to make this short but sweet. There are many books out there promising the reader an introduction to philosophy. And more times than less these books do not measure up to the reader's expectations, or simply bore the reader and cause philosophy to lose another interested adherent. If you have ever wanted to know what philosophy was all about, whether a novice or simply a victim of an &quot;Intro to Philosophy&quot; course at college, this is the only book you will ever need. But I guarantee it won't be the only book you'll purchase on the subject of philosophy.Written for the intelligent public with a verve and panache in the style that shows the author's love of the subject, this book will stimulate your interest as it makes the foggiest questions clear. No matter what the price you pay for it, it will go down as the best intellectual investment you've ever made. Sure, the are prejudices shown in the book, and Lord Russell was a strong-willed philosopher. But you will find yourself purchasing supplemental books on the subject to determine whether Russell was right or wrong in his opinion. You will already have the facts, due to Russell's diligence and clear style. I myself am on my third copy of the book, having worn out the previous two reading, writing and teaching the wisdom contained within their pages."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"To read Russell and his magnum opus 'History of Western Philosophy' is to open one's mind to the processes involved in reasonable and rational thought. I can think of no other person in the last century who epitomizes the role and purpose of the astute public intellectual. A hero in more ways than one, Russell spoke up for peace and justice and paid a price -- being jailed along with, to this day, not getting his due respect; there's simply no reason he shouldn't be mentioned in the same breath as Einstein, the only reason he's not lies in the fact that he chose to take more of a principled stand on controversial issues, i.e., war and nuclear power, the rapacious nature of capitalism, human sexuality and women's rights.History of Western Philosophy easily stands as the definitive one volume work on the broad subject of philosophy. Russell covers an enormous amount of material including the standard epistomological, aesthetic, logic, ethic and metaphysical questions. He spares no punches and really undresses the dogmatists for any sane reader to see. Nietzsche comes under especially harsh justified criticism. As does the ridiculous nostrums of the Catholic church and religious superstition in general.More than just a straight up philosophical work, History of Western Philosophy is an outstanding history book. Russell boils down the complicated issues of the past and rolls them out in neatly digestable essays. This one should stay on your bookshelf forever in that you'll find yourself reaching for it when historical and philosophical allusions come up in other great works of literature and film.Reading Russell is truly one of the more intellectually stimulating and enjoyable acts. His breadth of knowledge is astounding and his writing style is witty and accessible. No educated person can afford to neglect this great work."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I didn't read Bertrand Russell's \\"History of Western Philosophy\\" because I was looking for a cheerleader for Nietzsche. I might expect a bland \\"even-handed\\" treatment from an undergraduate but by the time Bertrand Russell wrote his history, he and Alfred North Whitehead had already taken Western Philosophy and Mathematics into new territory. Alan Turing himself, arguably the true inventor of the computer, found his inspiration in symbolic logic and in the\\"Principia Mathematica\\" specifically. I would feel cheated by anything less than a \\"critical\\" review of Nietzsche from Russell. To criticize Russell on this basis is akin to trying to discredit Voltaire for lampooning Leibniz as \\"Dr. Pangloss\\". Western Civilization is enriched by both.Moreover, Russell's criticisms are always accompanied by great wit --in themselves relevant contributions to the history of Philosophy. Russell's wit has been compared to that of Voltaire and the very idea of objective, even-handed accounts of Catholicism from Voltaire, for example, is absurd. The idea of \\"objectivity\\" is highly over-rated in any case. No one expects a prosecutor to make the case for the defense while stating his own; it is equally absurd to expect a philosopher whose stature is at least that of Nietzsche to serve us up a PC version of a philosophy that --taken to its logical implications --resulted in fascism and Nazism.If you want a bland history of Philosophy, read an encyclopedic entry knocked off by a professional writer; but if you prefer a perspective on Philosophy from one of the great intellects of the 20th Century and can accommodate a perspective which may differ from your own --read Russell and be enriched."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This book is the best which I have read on Western philosophical thought,and it is proof of Lord Russell's incredible intellectual breadth.Also, the fact that it is amongst Amazon.com's top 6000 selling books, shows that the Western audience, which this book is mainly aimed at, includes a very large number of intellectuals, as this book is very heavy reading. Its definitely not something which you can read at one sitting.It is loaded with historical facts and figures.A brilliant peice of work."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"From what I understand, this is mostly Bertrand Russell's lecture notes for his History of Philosophy class reworked into a more formal context. As a definitive text on the history of philosophy, this book is not very good. I just want to be clear on that. This book is highly biased.However, it clearly illustrates Russell's infinite wit and also most of his own metaphysical and epistemological theory. To me, that is the most amazing thing about the book. Russell's take on the Presocratics through Aristotle is brilliant and his treatment of the Early Moderns as well as the British Empiricists are also AMAZING. If you read some of Russell's more complex theoretical essays like the masterpiece \\"On Denoting\\" and then go over to this text, Russell's treatment of philosophers like Pythagorus and Descartes bleed with Russell's own theories as critiques of these great philosopher's works. This is exactly what I would expect IF I had the opportunity to take a class with Russell.This book has gotten a lot of negative reviews since its publication but I think this is more because people fail to understand what this book is. You have to pretend you just found Russell's class on iTunesU and you are watching or hearing him give his lectures. Then you can see that he gives a great historical perspective of intellectual development in the western world, then a selective description of the philosopher's works followed by his own critique. This is exactly what I experienced in philosophy classrooms from Junior College through UCLA."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"read while an undergrad, rereading brings the minds together. Hav't read the christian philo section yet."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"Being a pillar in the philosophical community, I looked forward to his \\"History.\\" I found it to be very useful, but I was extremely disappointed in his review of Christianity. Knowing a good deal about it, like I do, his failures did not take long to notice. That said, it was good to note his perspective on Christianity - it helps one have a better understanding from an agnostic. He was not always wrong on the subject; in fact, a good deal of what he said was good and useful. In my view this is a must read for students of philosophy."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"This is of course an analytic philosopher's history of western philosophy, which means that Russell presupposes that there is a single rational goal which all philosophers are seeking to reach through collective progress. Unfortunately, philosophy is not mathematics, nor is it science. Russell's account is sometimes troubling, sometimes funny, as he methodically points out every logical error in the Ancient Greeks, the rationalists, the empiricists, etc. The notion of progress as it pertains to philosophy is always problematic. Granted, Russell examines each thinker in their socio-historical perspective, but he fails to give credit to the work and creativity of the thinkers as ends in themselves, not particles of a universal human project. This is not to say that a history of Western philosophy should be all adulation, but it should never be exclusive. Russell is quick to dismiss all religious thinkers as absurd (which isn't that far off the mark), but also treats Nietzsche with supreme cruelty as Nietzsche was a thinker that broke from the Enlightenment tradition and refused to play with numbers. Similarly, Heidegger is a glaringly absent in Russell's account, as he refused to admit that there was any seriousness to Heidegger's thought. This sentiment is more a reflection of philosophy's break between the analytic and the continental modes of thought than it is an honest criticism. This book does have valuable information and it does represent fairly competent historical research. But it should be read always be read as Bertrand Russell's history of Western philosophy, not THE history of Western philosophy."},{"Title":"History of Western Philosophy","review":"I read this book almost 30 years ago as a young philosophy student, and found it one of the best intros to the subject that was available back then. The coverage of some topics is a little uneven (Russell was, after all, more a mathematical logician rather than a philosophical historian like Copleston), but overall, it's a readable, enjoyable, and even-handed introduction to the subject. I eventually went on to read graduate level works in the area (although I was by training mostly a biologist, but I felt it important to know some philosophy), and this was one of the books that was invaluable to my early education in the subject."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],B={key:0},L={key:1};function q(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",E,[(t(!0),a(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",L,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",B,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const O=u(C,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-9d30becd"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/44.md","filePath":"library/44.md"}'),P={name:"library/44.md"},W=Object.assign(P,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(O)]))}});export{j as __pageData,W as default};
