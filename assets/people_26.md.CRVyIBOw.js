Through the story of the Ramsay family, Woolf delivers an enchanting and intelligent story of domestic life and of the relationships between men and women. By celebrating everyday life, she champions women's traditional roles. Each time I read this novel, I am amazed at the cultural commentary Woolf included, and at its continued relevance to life today. And the ways she shows time passing in this novel are simply magnificent."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"I chose to read this book for a class when I was sixteen because a friend complained about it and said it was the most boring book in the world. I wondered if perhaps I might see something in it that she was missing.What a found was a very enjoyable literary style - this was my first exposure to \\"stream-of-consciousness\\" writing. I enjoyed the author's complex 3rd person omniscient shifting of perspectives through the various characters in the tale. The style had great affinity with my own very analytical and philosophical yet aesthetic mind at the time. I read this book not for an exciting plot; but, for the beauty in the writing itself. The themes in it were very abstract - such as the subject of being genuine and the like. \\"To the Lighthouse\\" has a very reflective quality about it. This book is certainly not for everyone; but, it is beyond a doubt a masterpiece for its kind."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"I'm not sure I'm supposed to do this but I'll anyway. This is the third time through this novel for me and after I finished my second reading, I posted my comments here (scroll down some).This reading, I was impressed by the relationship between the Ramsey's. Mr. Ramsey lives in the world of thought, rationality and verbal sword-play. But Mrs. Ramsey lives in the world of the heart; she is a nurturer, the caregiver, very intelligent, but not caught up in the territorial boundary lines that the men fight over with words. Yet Mr. Ramsey, and William Bankes, and Charles Tansley, they all find her beautiful, they admire her immensely. What strikes me is this: Mrs. Ramsey's beauty is an inner beauty of action, peace, harmony, and balance in her world. She brooks no false illusions about her place in the cosmos, she isn't vain, she's thoughtful and diligent. The men rely on her for this quality that they do not have in their own lives.In my last reveiw here, I thought this novel might fit into the emotional genre of fiction. Now I'm thinking that it might be the kind of literature used in marriage counselling.So, this is a novel that you can pick up and find something new in the reading. I need to let some time pass, but I'll tell you what I think on my next reading, too."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Woolf's sentence structure is entrancing, and her descriptions of the thoughts of the characters are vivid. I was intrigued at what goes on inside of Woolf's head because of profundities such as \\"the very stone one kicks with one's boot will outlast Shakespeare,\\" and \\"so much depends ... upon distance: whether people are near or far from us.\\"It is nice that a book this intense can be a quick read. Anyone can read it and feel that they have accomplished something, not just the erudite. However, to really appreciate To the Lighthouse, you will have to read it a few times.Woolf's writing style will be hard for many. She forms many complex sentences. The book is mostly about the internal struggles of her characters rather than a physical action book. Still, this is a very poignant book, and her prose is artistry with a purpose.Skip the forward by Eudora Welty if you don't want a summary of the action of the book."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"There is only one way to describe this book: the way one would describe the cistine chapel or the Mona Lisa or Notre Dame. This is simply a classic. It breaks the confines of ordinary books to deliver a work of art that truly delves into the lives of its characters. I will admit, when I first started to read it I didn't quite get it. However, once I reached a certain part in the book, everything started to make sense (though that was largely a result of the class discussions on hte book). Those who criticise the book are seldom the people who finish it. If you want a light beach book to take to Florida over vacation, I suggest finding something else. However, if you want a challanging literary masterpiece, you've come to the right place."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"This book is essentially divided into two parts: a day in the life of a British family and their guests at a seaside cottage, and ten years after the death of the matriarch, Mrs. Ramsay.

Although some paragraphs are incredibly long, in the Henry James style, there is clarity throughout. Peppered here and there are little essays which can stand on their own. The character of Mrs. Ramsay is central and is seen through her own thoughts and through the thoughts of the others on one day.

Last month our bookclub read &quot;The Divine Secrets of the YA YA Sisterhood&quot; which I thought was just drivel but is an absolute hit with the public. Fortunately our selection this month was &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot;. This is the anti &quot;YA YA&quot; book. It is very spiritual and existential. The symbolism is beautiful. I will never think of lighthouses the same again. I am just sorry that I waited until I was 40 years old to read this book. At least I found it! I will read it over and over. True there is no real plot, but Virginia Woolf is a genuis in her commentary on life. The whole novel is told from the inside out. Everything is told from someone's thoughts. I could not put the book down and was struck with a sense of Awe the entire time. To me this is a true work of art. I also admire her treatment of the theme of masculine and feminine in our society. It is a sad commentary on our society that there are over 300 comments under the book about the Ya Ya's and just a couple of comments on &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot;."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Stream of consciousness prose went in and out of style pretty fast, though some experimenters occasionally make use of it still no one used it to greater effect than Joyce and Woolf. Of course they had the advantage of using the style first and so it was new. In my opinion Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man was the best novel ever written in this style, but To the Lighthouse is the second best. Published in 1927 it deals with very large issues but in a very intimate setting. The Ramsay vacation home is visited every summer and every summer change and time itself makes its presence felt in varying ways on each of the consciousnesses that occuppy the house. The center consciousness is Mrs. Ramsay's whose quiet devotion to her family is compared to a freer kind of existence in the form of a female painter. Mrs. Ramsay is a kind of beacon to her family, she provides the safety and comfort that comes with order and ritual. Her husband is the head of the family and the one more connected to worldly awareness and concerns but her less obvious and less defineable role is really the one that allows all to function. But things happen that cannot be controlled. The war breaks the routine that had been established over the years and after the war things are no longer as they were, there is a desolate feel as post war life resumes because things that were once there no longer are. The interior monologues that capture each character in their moments of being support an overall view being that most of life is lived alone and to oneself and forces we cannot control really determine the demeanor of our days, our own decisions are important but in relation to the larger forces shaping them very small things. The books of the twenties are still the best. A quiet book that sends very deep and resonant waves through ones mind and body."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Here is a small point with a larger purpose: Virginia Woolf does not know Boeuf en Daube. Or at any rate, Mrs. Ramsay, the heroine of \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" does not, and there is no suggestion of any irony in her thought on the topic:\\"Everything depended upon things being served up to the precise moment they were ready. ... To keep it waiting was out of the question. Yet of course tonight, of all nights, out they went, and they came in late, and things had to be sent out, things had to be kept hot; the Boeuf en Daube would be entirely spoilt.\\"Well, if you know anything about the kitchen, you know that this is nonsense. Boeuf en Daube is probably the last thing that needs to be \\"served up to the precise moment ...\\" As Elizabeth David says in her \\"French Provincial Cooking:\\" \\"there must be scores of different recipes for daubes in Provence alone... essentially a country housewife's dish.\\" And more to the point, per Ms. David:\\"The daube is a useful dish for those who have to get a dinner party when they get home from the office. It can be cooked for 1 hours the previous evening and finished on the night itself. Provided they have not been overcooked to start with, these beef and wine stews are all the better for a second or even third heating up.\\"I wonder how many English majors from the 1950s sold their souls for a good Boeuf en Daube (did Sylvia Plath have the recipe?) - and how much better off they would have been if they'd seen through it: understood that Mrs. Ramsay did not get the point, because Ms. Woolf did not get the point. Indeed, strictly speaking, the creation is not Mrs. Ramsay's at all, but you'd have to be a sharp-eyed reader to catch on: it is the servant who does the work and delivers the finished product and she, I suspect, knows better than her mistress how flexible and compliant it may be. There is an irony here and it is lost, I suspect, on the mistress and on the mistress' creator.All of which leads to a larger point: Virginia Woolf does not know servants. Instance in particular her observation of Mrs. McNab, the old char who comes to reopen the summer house after long disuse. We get an elaborate set-piece description of Mrs. McNab, and it is not pretty: indeed, it is mean-spirited and dismissive in almost every way. Mrs. McNab \\"lurches\\" and \\"leers\\" She \\"was witless and she knew it;\\" she sings \\"like the voice of witlessness.\\" Now, if this is true, it is inexcusably rude: one may want, for some artistic purpose, to show her lurching and leering for, but here it serves no purpose, unless you count its actual function in throwing light on the author. Anyway, the chances are it is not true. My guess is that Mrs. McNab has operated under far more constraint in life than either Ms. Woolf or Mrs. Ramsay ever dreamed of. Witless people do not survive under the iron whim of a Mrs. Ramsay; poor chars who do learn to survive will find that it takes all the skill one can muster.I could go on, but I need to stay within Amazon's 1,000 word limit. The point is not that \\"To the Lighthouse\\" is a bad book. It's actually quite a good book; or at least it is a book full of good paragraphs, and Virginia Woolf seemingly cannot write a bad paragraph. It is as bad novel, because Virginia Woolf has little of the capacity for imaginative empathy that makes a really good novelist. They say that Shakespeare stands as a void at the center of his plays because he has poured every part of his being into his characters. Virginia Woolf takes almost all of her characters into herself. It is well done, but often we get to know more than we really want to know."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"To the Lighthouse, published in 1927, is a landmark Modernist novel.Written from multiple perspectives and shifting between time and characters, Woolf is not really concerned with plot. Instead, she paints a psychological portrait of the members of the Ramsay family and their friends, at their summerhouse in the Hebrides. To the Lighthouse is divided into three parts.In the first section, (The Window), the character of Mrs. Ramsay is the lens through which most of the perspectives are focused, and her son's (James) desire to go \\"to the Lighthouse\\" is the catalyst from which the chapter takes shape.In the next section, (Time Passes), told by an omniscient narrator, Woolf dramatises the decay of the summer house over a period of ten years, and the fate of various characters is divulged. This section has some powerful visual images that expound Woolf's skill as a writer.In the third and final section, (The Lighthouse), the remaining family and friends finally get to the Lighthouse, and the novel becomes a meditation on love, loss, time and creativity.To the Lighthouse is a difficult read. But if you can understand the nature of the stream-of-consciousness technique and Woolf's goal of representing the essence of experience, then you will be able to glean a better understanding of the narrative. To the Lighthouse creates internal landscapes, and the main technique is invoking memory and various associations on the thoughts and feelings of the characters.This book will take time and patience. But if you keep working at it and savour ever word, then you will be in for a rewarding literary experience."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"This is a more demanding read, really a literary event when it came out in the 1920s. It's about a British family on vacation and the family stresses and tension that arise. The narrative moves about with a shifting perspective, making it excellent for book clubs that want to push it. Good for discussion about the structure of thought and time."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Virginia Woolf's novel &quot;To The Lighthouse,&quot; is, as its title suggests, a multivoiced final journey from the 19th century into the 20th. What must be determined over the course of reading the novel and reflecting on it, is the function of the lighthouse. Are its probing, distant lights supposed to be a beacon of hope as its characters move from the repressive age of Victoria into the liberating age of technology? Does the lighthouse echo the arch of experience which Tennyson's Ulysses claims 'fades forever and forever when I move' toward it? Or is the lighthouse just a lighthouse?Mrs. Ramsay, the novel's main character and guiding principle, is herself a lighthouse, built on a foundation of tradition and stock 19th century notions of how people should interact in society and towards each other. Her matchmaking schemes are ever fainter echoes of the Victorian novel's marriage plots. Woolf undermines and qualifies Mrs. Ramsay's intentions by exploding the conventions of the 19th century novel - plot structure becomes amorphous, protean formlessness; narrative voice is shared between characters as narration becomes thought and smoothly passes from character to character, anticipating the stream of consciousness style.Woolf also questions Mrs. Ramsay's social priorities - is marriage really a vital or necessary condition for women? Through close examination of Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay's marriage, Lily Briscoe's determination to remain single, and the novel's myriad other relationships, Woolf severely problematizes any comfortable ideas about knowing other people. Another important issue is the social value of art - Frequent conversations involving the philosopher Mr. Ramsay, the doctoral student Charles Tansley, the poet Augustus Carmichael, and the painter Lily Briscoe, along with Woolf's own speculations on the permanence of human design in Part II ask us to consider the role of art in regard to humanity.In a novel where the boundaries of time and space are consistently challenged, and the family unit is exposed, one must also focus on the erotics of storytelling. Love, hatred, admiration, and disgust permeate &quot;To The Lighthouse.&quot; Our attempt as readers to understand the drive of the novel compels us to seek a reason for reading it among these four potential narrative scenarios. Does love, hate, or some combination of the two commit the characters to reveal their thoughts, and why do these thoughts involve us so that we feel a need to read to the end?&quot;To The Lighthouse&quot; is a fascinating book - coming on the heels of such anti-Victorian masterpieces as Edith Wharton's &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; and Samuel Butler's &quot;The Way of All Flesh,&quot; Woolf's novel through form and content seeks to put the 19th century to rest, while simultaneously dealing with the terrors of post-World War I existence. Concentrate and give Woolf your undivided attention. This novel deserves it."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"After reading some lighter fiction, I decided to delve into something deeper, a novel by Virginia Woolf. I located the tattered copy from my school days and took a deep breath. Here is another phenomenal book by Virginia Woolf. Published in 1927, To the Lighthouse broke new ground and Virginia Woolf emerged as the chief figure of modernism--and perhaps feminism--in England.The book begins as Mrs. Ramsay, mother to eight children, speaks to her youngest child, James, age six, about his wish to go to the Lighthouse on the following day:\\"Yes, of course, if it's fine tomorrow,\\" said Mrs. Ramsay. \\"But you'll have to be up with the lark\\", she added.To her son these words conveyed an extraordinary joy, as if it were settled, the expedition bound to take place, and the wonder to which he looked forward to, for years and years it seemed, was, after a night's darkness and a day's sail, within touch.~To the Lighthouse, Virginia WoolfHowever, Mr. Ramsay, as well as Charles Tansley, soon shatter the boy's hopes by saying that it will rain the next day, and that a trip to the Lighthouse is out of the question, which upsets both James and his devoted mother greatly. The setting for the story begins at the summer house at the Isle of the Skye during the summer, where the Ramsays entertain numerous friends in addition to their large family. Mrs. Ramsay tries to soothe the boy by saying that the weather may be fine, because she has a far greater understanding of her sensitive, gifted child than either her husband or his friend. Keenly aware of the beauty and brevity of childhood, she wants her children to be happy and hopeful, to be filled with light, in a world with ample darkness. The novel focuses on the intensity of childhood emotions, and highlights the impermanence of adult relationships and the transient nature of everything. The issue of the trip to the Lighthouse is brought up time and time again in the first section of To the Lighthouse, The Window, in which through repetition and stream-of-consciousness writing (Virginia Woolf's trademark style), the interior monologues of various characters are presented, seizing fleeting moods, feelings, thoughts, and insecurities, and the transient nature of things and relationships, giving permanence to these moments in the book, making them immortal--which seems to have been the author's goal. Like our own thoughts, which are often repetitious (and dare I say dull at times), the characters seem to tire of their own cyclical thoughts. At other times, their disjointed thoughts are featured. Virginia Woolf captures the dual reality of thought in To The Lighthouse, thought which is alternatively repetitive and disconnected. (Think about your own thinking--isn't it also this way?)Just as in the story the painter Lily Briscoe tries to capture beautiful Mrs. Ramsay in a painting (although Lily is scoffed at, and the male belief was that women could neither paint nor write) the book attempts to make the impermanent permanent, and portrays these fleeting moments brilliantly, especially those between husband and wife. This is Virginia's Woolf's most autobiographical novel, and her husband, Leonard Woolf, called it a masterpiece. Virginia Woolf broke from tradition in this three part book, a novel in which there's not much action or dialogue, but instead much thought, about the ordinary as well as about time and the fleeting nature of life. One of the book's main themes is the ubiquity of transience. Is there an antidote for this often disturbing transience? Virginia Woolf suggests to women that while family and human relationships are important (although difficult sometimes), creative work may hold the key--meaningful work that will engage and may even outlive us. In this way, transience may be transcended to some degree.(This review is from my blog about books, Suko's Notebook, suko95.blogspot.com.)"},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"It's been quite some time since I read this work, but it made a huge impression upon me. Written in the stream of consciousness style, it can at times take the reader (at least this reader ;-)) a moment or two to recognize and adjust one's self to the unannounced transition between the mind's eye of one character and that of the next. Like most stream of consciousness works, this is rich and subtle in it's psychological portrayals and observations, though I daresay it is more deft and profound than most. This author is one of the greats of literature.Some other unusual structural aspects are both time dialation and compression (the first third of the book describes the happenings of a single day, and then suddenly years pass by within a few pages in the next portion). In addition (caution - plot revelation ahead) there is the sudden loss of the book's central character midway through the book that takes one completely by surprise.I read this way back at University, and yet, it is still one of my all time favorites!"},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Virginia Woolf achieves her most sterling triumphs when she focuses, as she does in To the Lighthouse, on the relationships of men and women to the seemingly trivial events of everyday life.

I am asuming that it is being pushed because it is poilitically correct to have at least one female author in the great books list.

The back of the book reads &quot;The subject of this brilliant novel is the daily life of an English family in the Hebrides&quot;. And, well, that really is all it's about, and let me tell you, my daily life of lectures and math homework is about as exciting as what happens in this book, people talk, people grow old, time passes.

Not a book for action-lovers."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"It was a required read for my college english seminar class on modernity and modernism. This is because some of the themes and rhetorical devices correlate with modernism I guess, but I found it very boring to read. Nothing really happens in it. I don't care how well written it is, or how wel it portrays anything, there was nothing to keep my attention, and I found it hard to read without falling asleep mid page."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"I will begin with a comment on the audio book. This version was narrated by Virginia Leishman. The audio quality was excellent and the narrator had a pleasant voice that was easy to listen to. The only complaint that I have (and since the style is so unique it may not be valid) is that the narrator did not use different voices for the different characters. I find it easier and more enjoyable to follow a novel when the narrator gives a distinct voice to each person. In this case, since we are mostly hearing the thoughts of each character, it may be difficult to imagine them thinking with a distinctive accent or intonation. I still would have preferred it, since sometime I had a hard time remembering which character was thinking.The book itself was an interesting experience. This book consists mostly of the thoughts of various characters. I think she did a good job of capturing what thoughts could be like, but as such, sometimes they drift and this doesn't make for an easy to follow narrative. This is something that one needs to take as a whole. Fortunately it is a relatively short book and can be read rather quickly.The language is beautiful, and the concept is fascinating. This is not a book for everyone, but is worthwhile for those interested in looking at new approaches to literature. Overall I enjoyed the experience, but can see how it may be boring to some readers."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"A deceptively simple novel that explores the meaning of life. Written in a stream-of-consciousness poetic style, this is a book that should be read slowly, not at the pace of a traditional novel, or you will miss the slow-motion explosions of beautiful insights lurking about when least expected. Her characters move like spirits in the material world. And as the reader - the voyeur transported to this other dimension - you hear and feel them brush past you like ghosts - who will sometimes pass right through your heart. Unequivocally, this is my favorite novel."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Virginia Woolf is one of the modern writers who changed writing not just in degree, but in substance. She even said explicitly (in the Common Reader) what she does, only so very few pay attention: The sentence must (I paraphrase here) imitate the same order of sensations as they fall on the human brain. This is what Flaubert did without knowing how or why, and what Hemingway did consciously (though he never explained what he was doing), and what Conrad, even Waugh (Evelyn, that is), and many others did after. But Virginia Woolf was one of the originals. Her book mixes all sorts of sensations, from a woman's PoV, so we have description, and auditory and sight and thinking, all connected thematically, leading to the soft denouement. Yes, she still operates somewhat by instinct, unlike Conrad who (I think) knew more explicitly that suppression of all sensations save one give the impression of shock, and that the sense of smell should be used sparingly, since it is it the most potent (the olfactory nerve goes straight into the brain, without any pre-processing), or Joyce (who knew exactly what's what-- see the famous girl-at-the-shore from Artist as a Young Man). But Woolf did marvels with the smattering beginnings of the modern writing technique that she could see, and Lighthouse is a marvelous example of it. Later on would come others-- just see what Flannery O'Connor does with modern technique, let alone Nabokov (in Lolita), Laxness, and other modern masters. But Woolf was at the birth of modern writing, and no one should miss her work. Warmly and wholeheartedly recommended.AM"},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"\\"So much depends, she thought, upon distance; whether people are near to us or far from us\\". So writes Virginia Woolf of the forlorn, but independent Lily Briscoe in To the Lighthouse. There are so many adjectives one can use to describe how truly great this novel is. To sum the action up would be rather easy. It's about the Ramsay family vacationing at a Scottish beach house in the early nineteen hundreds. From the outside the action seems minimal, but Woolf constructs this novel from the inside. We glimpse the inner workings of the characters on this little island. We see their thoughts, weaknesses, loves, and losses. As Woolf writes so much of the novel deals with distance. Distance to time, to each other, and the perceptions we conjure in our minds. This book on the one hand is about perceptions and how we perceive each other in life. The whole novel is set as if it were in slow motion. Very few words are spoken, but the ones that are take on important meaning in the story. As I was reading I felt much the same way as Mr. Ramsay, James, and Cam thought as they journeyed to the lighthouse. I allowed Virginia Woolf's beautiful prose to wash over me. Her words moved much the same as a wave does; seemingly innocent at first, but packed with a punch that could knock you on your feet. There are so many beautiful characters in this story from the elegant and motherly Mrs. Ramsay to the conflicted and sexist Mr. Tansley. Perhaps my favorite part of the whole novel was the dinner scene. So many sorrowful and joyous things culminating at once. There were many times in this novel that I was almost moved to tears reading the descriptive sentences that Woolf weaves together. I will admit that this was no easy read. It may be only 200 pages, but each page lingers with the reader and begs to be slowed down; allowing the words to wash over them. A modernist classic To the Lighthouse implements Woolf's stream of consciousness technique that many may find difficult or confusing to read. My advice is to slow down. You may get confused trying to decipher who's mind you are in. but after a while it begins to flow. To the Lighthouse is true classic, and highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"The plot of this book on the surface does not seem necessarily like it would engender a classic: a family with a caustic father, a loving mother and a youngest son who despises his father and in this particular instance wants to visit a lighthouse out in the ocean, a desire his father opposes. However, Woolf infuses this story with her fabulous (I think) writing style and a breadth of insights and observations that leave one fascinated and thinking throughout. Her writing style includes long sentences and a flow consciousness that some might find too burdensome. Somehow her writing reminds me of Sylvia Plath, with that same brilliance of wordplay. Quite simply it is a great book."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"A beautifully and thoughtfully written novel examining and comparing life and art during the WWI era in Great Britain and contrasting those who experience life primarily through deeds and action (Mrs. Ramsay) and those who primarily experience life through thought and reflection (Mr. Carmichael)--and the underlying contempt and misunderstanding each has for the other."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Woolf's novel is more like a hundred page poem than anything else, yet she does not skimp on substance at all. Much to be gained from reading this book again and again."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"One of my favorite novels. It's dense and provocative and profound. So many passages say so much so well that I found myself constantly re-reading passages to get the meaning. At times Woolf lays it on a bit thick and it felt like reading through molasses. I kept longing for a letup that never came, like driving a winding road where you wait for a straightaway so you can recover. Demanding but worth the effort; disturbing and unsettling too. Not the best bedtime read.Overall, a beautifully-written and an intense search for meaning. Becomes even more poignant when you consider the tragic fate of Woolf herself."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"When I first began reading this book I did not realize that it was stream of consciousness book and was worried that it might turn out to be another &quot;The Sound and The Fury&quot; of which I could not get past the first section. How wrong I was. From the very begining, after the initial surprise, I was enthralled by this book. The wonderful point of this book is the characters and how the book flows. I was never bored reading the book and constantly found myself wanting to read to the next chapter. Also, I find myself liking it better now that I think about it more and really look forward to reading it again. Please get this book, you will not regret it."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Woolf's TTL is her most often read novel, but this in itself does not make it great. TTL has several layers of understanding which may not be apparent to those who don't know Woolf. Woolf prefers texture to plot/structure. The book occurs in three parts, two days separated by a 20-page interlude representing 10 years of separation. There is a biographical layer, as Woolf includes elements of her early life. There is a layer dealing with changes in art (thus literature) spanning pre-WW1 to post-WW1. Lily searches for balance. James wants his father's approval. Mrs. Ramsay is an artist of community. Mr. Ramsay worries about his legacy. And there's more.Events unfold in Woolf's interior monologue style. The novel is best appreciated in multiple readings, since Woolf's style often causes beginners or first-time readers to misinterpret her reliance upon other things than plot. An excellent work."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"\\"He would pick a flower for her, lend her his books. But could he believe that Minta read them? She dragged them about the garden, sticking in leaves to mark the place.\\"In my attempt to understand Virginia Woolf's life, it would seem appropriate to read more of her work and understand how she viewed life in its beauty and horror. In To the Lighthouse there are brief glimpses of beauty in regards to nature, feelings and experience. Yet, the underlying emotion in this book seems to be a subtle frustration. The frustration of the reader attempting to stay focused and connected with the main themes and the frustration of the young James Ramsay, who only wishes to visit a lighthouse.\\"Brooding, she changed the pool into the sea, and made the minnows into sharks and whales, and cast vast clouds over this tiny world by holding her hand against the sun, and so brought darkness and desolation, like God himself, to millions of ignorant and innocent creatures, and then took her hand away suddenly and let the sun stream down.\\"Virginia Woolf's descriptions can at times appear as vivid recollections and there is almost a tension at the start as if at any moment a scene of emotional instability will break and the characters will fall apart. Yet, they remain calm in their own insecurities, never really drawing on our sympathies. A child dreams, a mother hopes, a husband tries to dash both the dreams and hopes.Then Virginia seems to be stepping in an out of her characters lives, experiencing little nuances of their existence. This results in a swirling of temporary chaos as you try to find your way out of the emotional complexity and sometimes overwhelming lists of people she introduces briefly. Only a few characters remain until the end and many of the temporary characters fly in and out of the story so fast, we can't quite grasp the importance of their introduction.The most interesting part of the book seems to be when the house starts to fall apart and is then rescued from the encroaching decay, swollen sea-moistened woodwork and rusting hinges.Some movies are better when viewed the second and third time and it seems this book gains a new clarity on the second reading. In the end I was disappointed not to learn about James' impressions of the final destination and honestly wished she had spent more time on the main characters. In the end it feels like bits and pieces all connected in some jigsaw puzzle of experience.If you love the sea and lighthouses, there are short moments of pleasure and the descriptions cause you to lose track of reality for minutes at a time. I did love the description of a star sliding in the sky and then the entire sea lighting up in red and gold. In her writing she seems to have the ability to paint pictures of the inner world in memorable ways.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"... but that's okay. Actually, that's more than okay.The only complaints people seem to have about this book is that nothing physically happens in it.Duh.You can't critizice Beethoven's 5th because he only uses musical instruments and there's no actors up onstage. *To the Lighthouse* is a symphonic work, not an opera or a friggin' musical. If you're prepared to accept this, then definitely read the book. If not, go see *Rent* a few more times."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Considering all the labels and praise and criticism that have attached themselves to Virginia Woolf and TO THE LIGHTHOUSE, it can be difficult for the new reader to formulate a nonpartisan - though still subjective - opinion. The book is supposed to be this; it is supposed to be that; feminist literature and experimental stream-of-consciousness literature and ground-breaking modernist classic and member in-good-standing of the Western Cannon and so on - any one of which may wear like a loose, or very ill-fitting, garment, depending on the proclivities of the individual reader. But if one approaches the book looking to validate (or attack) any of the issues on which its reputation rests, then it seems to me that that is a separate thing from whether Woolf's writing impinges upon the reader in any non-ideological, personal way.I have always favored books that have struck me as startlingly apt in their representations of certain events, or people, as well as those works which bring about a sort of epiphany by framing familiar images in surprising ways. TO THE LIGHTHOUSE succeeds on both counts, at times, though at this point in my life, there are also many aspects of the book that fail to strike those chords. I say at this point, because TO THE LIGHTHOUSE is one of the few books I've read that seemed particularly well-suited to grow and evolve as the reader does. I like Mrs. Woolf's writing; I admire it intensely; yet at the same time I was often uninterested in the narrative. It wasn't till the final chapters of the first section and some of the third where I felt the pull of those qualities I mentioned before.In this annotated edition, editor Mark Hussey snips an excerpt from a letter from Woolf to her friend Robert Fry, in which she had this to say about symbolism: 'I meant _nothing_ by The Lighthouse. One has to have a central line...to hold the design together. I saw that all sorts of things would accrue to this, but I refused to think them out, and trusted that people would make it the deposit for their own emotions - which they have done...I can't imagine Symbolism except in this vague, generalized way.' I especially appreciate this - to restrict the elements one finds in a novel to exact dimensions chokes the life out of it. And I think it is precisely this unattached sort of symbolism that makes the book so malleable, so suited for multiple impressions. The idea I attach to The Lighthouse, because I am who I am, is that of a platonic ideal, a thing that is sensed but unattainable, much like the feeling of nostalgia for the past. And if by some effort one forces that ideal to submit to reality, then it loses all mystique, all power.When reading Leon Edel's introduction to Henry James'The Ambassadors, I came across this excellent statement that applies as well to Virginia Woolf as to James: 'There are readers for whom certain books will always remain closed; and others for whom the same books cannot be opened too often.' In this case, I believe a book like TO THE LIGHTHOUSE should be read again after a time - that it is like the proverbial river that cannot be stepped in twice. At this reading, it suggests connections and ideas that are relavant to me now, and will quite likely suggest entirely different things at a different time.Does it deserve its status as a classic? I think that is an unqualified yes, and I suspect it also fits all the other labels it has accumulated throughout the years, though I am not really in a position to comment on that. But rather than because of its reputation, TO THE LIGHTHOUSE deserves recommendation for revealing unexpected facets of familiar scenes through its unique style. Somewhat challenging (but much less so than a Faulkner, a James, or even Malcolm Lowry), TO THE LIGHTHOUSE is as adept today at underscoring the melancholy delights of human interaction as it was in the early part of the last century.This annotated edition contains a rather lengthy introduction by Mark Hussey that I might suggest one skip till the end if they haven't read the book before. Also included is a short biographical preface, a chronology of major events in Woolf's life, suggestions for further reading, and notes to the text which I thought was mostly unnecessary. While I enjoyed the introduction - which I read last - I found little value in the other sections."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"I must have read this novel at least five or six times, and every time I return to it I re-discover its greatness; I also discover things I haven't noticed before. I've read it on my own, and for class assignments, and for writing major papers about it, and it remains, for me, the best book written in the twentieth century. It's not about plot (it doesn't really have much of it), nor about any one specific topic or theme - it is about human relationships, and how, even in a small grouping of people, these relationships assume a depth that is above and beyond the pettiness of their actual concerns. It is, however, a rather difficult book to read, especially if you're expecting a plot-driven story, and requires patience. As you can obviously understand by my words so far, however, it is more than worth it."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"I had to read this book for school, but I'm very glad I did. It's exquistely constructed, and Woolf does a great job of really showing how people think. It takes some getting used to the shifting perspectives, but it's worth the effort. A great, intellectual read."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"After reading many of the other reviews, I am dismayed. I took to heart comments like &quot;typical American action movie goers&quot; disliking this book. I strongly disagree with this statement. I am 16 years old so some might say, I could find nothing of interest in this book, and I may not be as learned as the older audience reading it, but I would like to say that I have taken as much from it as any other. It doesn't have an exciting, action packed plot as much of the movies I watch do, but I thought that it's insight into male and female perspective was outstanding. Some parts of this book were slightly tiresome to read, but Virginia Woolf makes you think about life in ways that you haven't before. Although some books that I have read make you rush to finish to find out the exciting ending, Virginia Woolf encourages you to think about experiences, and beauty while reading. Many times I put this book down to contemplate ideas she was trying to portray. I would definetely recommend this book even to &quot;typical American action movie goers&quot;."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Virginia Woolf is a true artist and this, her masterpiece. This novel is motivated more by the sheer brilliance of her poetic prose than it is by the story itself--which is also very good. So, if you have the attention span of the typical American action movie goer, you will not be able to follow... Even so, this was not a slow read for me. The last line is one of the most memorable of any novel ever written in English. The way she uses water is remarkable. READ THIS!!! It might be a bit of work but worth it!!!"},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"&quot;To The Lighthouse&quot; doesn't tell a story--it allows the reader to experience it through the consciousness of its various characters. Woolf gets inside their heads and writes down what they're thinking from moment to moment, creating an intimacy between reader and character I've experienced with no other writer. The largest portion of the novel concerns a day at the Ramsay's summer house by the sea. Mr. Ramsay, a once-famous philosopher whose reputation is beginning to wane, entertains two or three of his students, while Mrs. Ramsay, the novel's central character, manages her family and the other guests. As Mr. Ramsay devotes his energy to philisophical obscurities, Mrs. Ramsay devotes hers to stroking her husband's ego when he needs it, consoling her youngest son James who wants to go to the lighthouse across the bay, and creating a serene, safe space for her guests. Gradually, a portrait of English family life emerges, and more importantly, an understanding of a woman's place within it--Mrs. Ramsay has essentially sacrificed herself for her family and husband, and has done so willingly. Woolf reveals these flawed but beautiful people to the reader in a work of art that seems less like reading prose than listening to music or experiencing a painting. To the Lighthouse is one of the masterpieces of 20th-century English literature"},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Published in 1927, \\"To the Lighthouse\\" is Virginia Woolf's elegy for her parents--her attempt to describe and understand them through the prism of fiction. Two years earlier, Woolf had written in her diary that the book would be \\"fairly short\\" (it is) and that it would have \\"father's character done complete in it; & mother's; & St. Ives [the family summer home]; & childhood.\\" It's impossible to overestimate the influence of Woolf's parents on the development of this book; a year after the book was published, she acknowledged that she \\"was obsessed by them both, unhealthily; & writing of them was a necessary act.\\" As Hermione Lee put it in her biography, the novel is set in a \\"haunted house.\\"The remarkable empathy (and, to some extent, sympathy) for the novel's characters is testimony to Woolf's success: in powerful stream-of-consciousness passages told from ever-shifting perspectives, she re-creates from her own biography three entirely believable protagonists. Woolf's mother becomes Mrs. Ramsay, whose domain is largely confined to her home, her children, and her guests; like Clarissa Dalloway planning a party in Woolf's previous novel, Mrs. Ramsay sees the highlight of her day as carrying off a successful dinner for her family and guests--\\"she wished the dinner to be particularly nice.\\" Her husband, a philosopher, remains aloof from his family and their social sphere; his abrasiveness is a source of occasional annoyance to Mrs. Ramsay, and his own obsession is nothing so fleeting as a dinner party but rather the legacy that will be left by his life's work.Lily Briscoe, a young painter who is one of the guests, observes the family dynamics and critically regards the relationship between Mrs. Ramsay and her husband: \\"What was this mania of hers for marriage?\\" Lily also serves as a fictional alter-ego for Virginia Woolf herself. While working on a painting of Mrs. Ramsay reading to her son, Lily's lack of confidence is exacerbated by the opinion of another houseguest: \\"Women can't paint, women can't write\\"--a declaration linking Lily's timidity as a painter with Virginia's own qualms about the novel (she was anxious that it would be criticized as \\"sentimental\\"). Worrying unduly about what others think is inhibiting their talents.It's become obligatory to mention the supposed lack of plot in this book--but that old saw ignores the transformation of the novel's characters and their pursuit for meaningfulness. Mr. Ramsay wants respect; Mrs. Ramsay wants to be happy in her marriage; their son James wants the approval of his father; Lily wants to be an artist--but all are thwarted in their search for happiness. One houseguest muses, \\"What does one live for?\\" Similarly, Mrs. Ramsay reflects as dinner starts, \\"What have I done with my life?\\" And Lily wonders while she works on her painting: \\"What is the meaning of life? That was all--a simple question; one that tended to close in on one with years.\\"The novel's \\"action,\\" then, is the quest to find the ever-elusive \\"meaning of life\\": both within a single day (during the first half of the novel) and then ten years later, after the first World War, when what remains of the shattered family returns to the summer home and finally makes a long-postponed boat-trip to the lighthouse. Not everyone finds what they are looking for, but at last Lily Briscoe, who remains behind at the cottage, understands that approval and contentment and artistic talent had been there all along--within herself. She never had to leave the shore."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"This is my first full-blown experience with Virginia Woolfe. I was always a bit too impatient, skimming over paragraphs of internal dialog to get to the plot. What a difference an amazing narrator makes! Yes, it is slow going at times, but the beauty of Woolfe's sentences make the focus on every word worthwhile. Leishman treats Woolfe's words as poetry, and I started thinking of them as that. For that reason, I disagree with the reviewer counseled against ten minute spurts -- at least in the audio version, the prose seemed so rich that it was hard to absorb more than a few minutes at a time. It was only when I began to savor each paragraph on its own that I could truly enjoy this work.This book is truly profound. It has caused me to become more aware of my own inner life, and has changed the way I think about what it means to \\"know\\" another person. Highly, highly recommended -- and this is from someone who spends a lot of time reading trashy chick lit and thrillers!"},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"If you are going to read only one of Virginia Woolf's many works, this is the one to read. She is the greatest novelist, but her novels cannot be equal, some being better or more universal than others. She really *arrives* in this one. I first read it twenty years ago in college, but I still think of phrases, thoughts, and concepts from this book. The novel's themes resonate the way poetry does. Worth the reputation. I hope no one ever tries to make a movie out of this one."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Virginia Woolf's lovely, poignant novel based on her own family is one of the great novels of the twentieth century. Basing the novel's central character of Mrs. Ramsay on her mother and Mr. Ramsay on her father, the well known philosopher Leslie Stephen, Virgnia Woolf strove to recreate artistically the mysteries and vagaries of time. The novel is divided unevenly into two sections, both of them dealing with possible or actual trips to the lighthouse in the vicinity of the Isle of Skye where the Ramsay family has a house that they use on summer holidays. Rarely in English fiction has the inner dynamics of a family been laid so completely bare as in this.One of the most enjoyable things about this book is the way Virginia Woolf so probingly explores the personalities of the individuals, though three stand out above all others, the aforementioned mother and father, and the unmarried amateur painter Lily Briscoe. By the end of the novel, we feel that we know all of these characters on the deepest possible level, and while the two women are sketched more lovingly, it is the father, Mr. Ramsay, who is etched in his essence. Brilliant, but with striking emotional and intellectual limitations, he is both the head of the family and its bane. It isn't that the author dislikes him, but she is acutely aware of his vices and virtues (in her own life, Virginia's father despaired over his wife's early death, creating an atmosphere of gloom over Virginia's teen-aged years). The two women are plumbed less deeply, but we come away from the novel having a sense of their worth.TO THE LIGHTHOUSE was revolutionary when it appeared as one of the first attempts to profit from many of the lessons to be taught English language fiction by the extraordinary work of Marcel Proust. Woolf had a love/hate relationship with Proust, on the one hand recognizing very early on that he was the great literary genius of the century (Joyce, on the other hand, the other titan of the century, she thought less highly of), but finding his work so brilliant as to paralyze her. She famously remarked that after reading Proust she felt incapable of writing anything. But the fact is that TO THE LIGHTHOUSE is in many ways a Proustian work. Like Proust and unlike almost no one prior in English literature (with the notable exception of Butler's THE WAY OF ALL FLESH), Woolf fictionalized her own life (she herself appears in the novel as the girl Cam) and produced a profound analysis of the nature of passed time. Also like Proust, she attempts to break down traditional narrative and present her story impressionistically rather than historically. While she may have felt that Proust kept her from writing, the fact is that she produced the first literary masterpiece following in the footsteps of Proust.But in the end, what makes this most remarkable is the rich detailing, the marvelous nuances, the lush delineations. This is a book to be read slowly and savored, much as one would read a long poem. Indeed, this comes very close to being at times prose poetry, such as the wonderful section \\"Time Passes,\\" that is sandwiched between the first section of the novel \\"The Window\\" and the final section \\"The Lighthouse.\\"After having confessed my love of this novel, I will add that I adore this book despite being less than overwhelmed by some of her other fiction. I love Woolf's nonfiction, but ORLANDO I sometimes regard as my least favorite work of fiction by a major writer. This novel, however, easily rates as one of my favorite twentieth century novels. I would urge anyone who has similarly found some of Woolf's other work unpalatable to give this one a try. I would be astounded if many will find it in any way less than brilliant."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"This book is about words -- the writing is breathtaking. Particularly the first section is an assault of waves of words washing over the reader. Mrs. Ramsey, though she thinks she's nothing special, inspires others to greatness and inspires them into action. She is the key to understanding this novel as she is the force behind all the words swirling around. The other pervasive force is that of Mr. Ramsey who serves as the negative force that stifles rather than promotes creation. Of all Woolf's books, I find this the most poignant and have read it over and over again. My more mature high school students loved it, while the immature ones (mostly boys in this case) didn't get it. It's a stirring novel that says mountains about the process of artistic creation. In fact, more than a feminist work, I would argue that To the Lighthouse is a meditation on the artistic process and what powers creation. Lily's all important &quot;last stroke&quot; of her painting becomes the emblem of artistic transcendance. Buy this edition for the excellent forward by Eudora Welty."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"'To the Lighthouse' explores the deepest workings of the human spirit and the world we live in, with such subtle power that defies the imagination for words to express it. To read it is not only to read a book, but to experience a revelation. The themes of human interaction are interwoven with the themes of mortality and destiny, questioning whether the decree of fate is arbitrary, or the workings of a higher plan. Are people motes of dust scattered here and there by wind, or is there some purpose to their sorrows beyond human understanding? Woolf offers no answers, rather she leads the reader a step beyond reality and allows them to judge for themselves.Every character is a world unto himself, with his own distinctive thought patterns and perspectives, and by showing how those worlds connect Woolf also investigates the glory and the tragedy of love and relationships, the connection and the inevitable isolation.There is very little plot, so those looking for a fast-paced storyline should look elsewhere. Woolf is more interested in the *internal* structure of her plot rather than the external; much of the highest points of drama occur within the characters. If you have any interest in the human soul, read it.Unfortunately, I can't claim to understand even a third of it, and will be sure to reread this book many times over the years. A revelation it is, but with the complexity of vision Woolf possessed, it is ultimately a mystery."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"This book is essentially divided into two parts: a day in the life of a British family and their guests at a seaside cottage, and ten years after the death of the matriarch, Mrs. Ramsay. The writing is an example of 20th century excellence. The narrator may change from page to page, but the reader always knows who is speaking. Although some paragraphs are incredibly long, in the Henry James style, there is clarity throughout. Little essays are peppered here and there which can stand on their own. The character of Mrs. Ramsay is central and is seen through her own thoughts and through the thoughts of the others on one day. In the second half of the book, most of the original characters return to the house sometime after Mrs. Ramsay's death and we feel their loss. What is this loss that they and we feel? She has held up the potential and promise of the destinies of the others, even though they may never reach it, a lighthouse beacon which survives her mortality."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"for a long time, i like many people, were trully afraid of verginia woolf, she is known as a stream of conciousness abscure and anigmatic writer, and since i don't have a litreture masters dgree i thought i would be lost in her writings. but then i saw \\"the hours\\" which led to reading \\"the hours\\" which led to reading \\"mrs. dalloway\\" and there i was - infront of one of the most notourious novels in modern litrature diving into the first page.it's not an easy book to read, it's very chalanging, and you have to keep stricked consentarion on who's mind you are listening to, but it's one of the most wonderful and magical books i've ever read.woolf's style jumps fromthe thought of one person to the other, exploring the inner soul, from high speritual notions about art and life, to the most mudmean experience of smelling a flower or taking care of the chidren, and she sees the same magic of life and living in everything. suddenly, as you get more obsorved in the thought of the ramzies, their childrens and guests, you realize so much about your own life and preseption, she makes you fall in love with her charecters, then hate them looking at them through another person's eyes. and more then that - she makes you switch between diffrent prespectives towared your own life.in a very short volum, verginia woolf manage ot deeply examin complex topics of relationship within the family, classes in england, death, growing up, war, art and philosophy.ithough deffenetly one of the more complicated books ever written, i have to say that even as a person that doesn't know that much about litrature, i enjoyed it deeply and i think it is a book anyone who loves readding and life in general, should read."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"After completing the incredible Woolf novel &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; I eagerly dived into &quot;To The Lighthouse&quot; expecting similar (if not greater) satisfaction. Unfortunately, from the very beginning I felt that the stream of consciousness narration betrayed itself with the excessive unrealistic &quot;deep&quot; thoughts and ponderings of the lesser characters. Sure, we all know Mr. Ramsay is a ponderous metaphysician and we expect such soul-searching from him - but from all the others as well, and at all times? Every character seems to be CONSTANTLY measuring their self worth and working out a personal philosophy while they go about their otherwise mundane daily existence. To be sure, we all have these &quot;moments of reflection&quot;, but Woolf overdoes it here. I suppose the critical eminence of the book and its assured position in the canon still make it a must-read, but I would advise first time readers to reduce any high expectations concerning the novel's psychological realism."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"I've discovered a little secret to reading Virginia Woolf -- it takes time.It is practically impossible to read this book in little ten-minute spots, while watching television or babysitting. Don't try it; you'll end up not liking it.It needs your time. Give it an hour with no interruptions. Get a bag of pistachios and read. Unplug the phone, turn off the TV. Read and don't stop. Then you'll discover the joy of Virginia Woolf -- for while her prose is tough, it is haunting, beautiful, and real.Once you've settled into it, you'll discover a wonderful book, a tale of everyday life lived. Both intensely personal and incredibly universal, this book is life itself.So, you want the real review. Alright, it's the story of a beach house, where reside the Ramseys and their various friends. Mrs. Ramsey is a goddess and nearly everyone worships her. This is more fun to read than it sounds. Lily Briscoe is a painter trying to figure out what she sees and what she loves.There is a brutal twist in the middle, and the rest of the book is coping with that. No, I won't tell you what it is. Go read the book. It's great.It's about beauty, about the incredible tragedy of time passing, about art and the world, about love and marriage, about people. It's not only a book about life, it is a book of life itself.So maybe it's not written for our 30 second commercial, read at the bus stop age."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Many critics, teachers and readers consider To the Lighthouse to be Virginia Woolf's masterpiece. To the Lighthouse was published in 1927 and its structure is unique, although it does contain elements of the Victorian. Woolf wrote this novel in only one year and did very little rewriting. Both subtle and sharp, the ease with which the book was written is apparent in the flow of both its narrative and its prose. The novel was written during one of the brief peaceful and happy times in Woolf's life. (In 1895, after her mother's death, Woolf became almost continuously depressed and suffered a series of nervous breakdowns, culminating in her suicide by drowning in 1941.)To the Lighthouse, like Woolf's previous novel, Jacob's Room, is a somewhat disjointed story, possessing numerous characters, points-of-view and conflicts. The overlapping and separation of the characters and their stories seems to result from both intention and oversight and is a product of what Woolf referred to as &quot;all characters boiled down,&quot; and the &quot;break of unity in my design.&quot;The story centers around the summer vacation to the Isle of Skye of the Ramsey family, a family Woolf admitted was very much like her own. In fact, Woolf said that writing To the Lighthouse helped her &quot;rub out&quot; the obsessive memory of her own mother. Mrs. Ramsey, like Woolf's own mother, is a woman of decidedly Victorian ideals, choosing to focus on her home, her marriage and her family.Interacting with Mrs. Ramsey is the character most representative of Woolf, herself, Lily Briscoe, a young girl who is staying in the same beachouse as the Ramseys. Unmarried, Lily draws both disapproval and sympathy from Mrs. Ramsey who firmly believes that &quot;an unmarried woman has missed the best of life.&quot;Mrs. Ramsey and Lily represent the conflict between the Victorian and the Edwardian eras, the age of the woman in the home and the advent of the woman in the workplace. An intelligent young woman, as well as a sensitive and talented artist, Lily is very aware of Mrs. Ramsey's disapproval.The role of art in the novel deals primarily with Post-Impressionism and the attempt to freeze reality, not on paper or on canvas, but in the mind, and then to paint the very equivalent of this reality. In many ways, To the Lighthouse resembles a painting because of its three distinct images of reality: the summer, the return and the seven years in between.Woolf was not the only writer to &quot;paint&quot; her novels. In Place in Fiction, Eudora Welty writes of &quot;painting and writing, always the closest two of the 'sister arts.'&quot; Throughout the novel, Lily works on one painting and cannot seem to &quot;connect the mass on the right hand with that on the left...But the danger was that by doing that the unity of the whole might be broken.&quot; The need for connection in the painting is much like the need for connection in the narrative. And Lily and Mrs. Ramsey both serve to fulfill the role as unifier.One of the most startling moments of unification occurs as Mrs. Ramsey is staring at a bowl of fruit she has placed in the middle of the table during a dinner party. Because of her extreme attention to detail, Mrs. Ramsey focuses on the bowl throughout the dinner. She particularly notices the perfection of the arrangement while also fearing its imminent destruction as she catches another guest looking at the fruit, no doubt desirous of it. Mrs. Ramsey thinks, &quot;That was his way of looking, different from her. But looking together united them.&quot;Even when not physically present in the story, Mrs. Ramsey continues to exert a strong influence. At the end of the novel, Mr. Ramsey finally takes his two youngest children, James and Cam, to the lighthouse. Both children have changed considerably from the time of their first vacation; Mrs. Ramsey's absence has required that they develop a new independence, yet she was their only tie to their father, the typically restrained and uninvolved Victorian husband.The children must, however, incorporate the influence of both of their parents on their journey to the lighthouse, a journey that is both literal and figurative. From shore, Lily watches them as she paints their journey, recalling Mrs. Ramsey with both annoyance and love. Lily, like Woolf, herself, has finally come to terms with the connection of all things, the completion of a painting as well as the completion of a journey.To the Lighthouse is a quiet, reflective and meditative novel and one of the first to display Woolf's unique Impressionistic stream-of-consciousness style."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"I haven't read To the Lighthouse since college, a time at which I understood very little about it, but was still greatly moved. Two things struck me about the experience of re-reading it. One is that while I can't claim full understanding, I no longer found myself struggling with the form in order to read the book. The second is how much more resonant the book became for me now that I'm older and can identify more with Mrs. Ramsey instead of seeing the book only through the character of Lily Briscoe.To the Lighthouse centers around the Ramsey family and the people they bring in their wake to their home on the Isle of Skye. Families in the world of this book are fragile things. The first half creates the Ramsey family group so well that when the second half is without it, the reader is constantly aware of the ghost images standing in the empty spaces. Meanwhile, Lily tries to understand the world she's in and make her painting by meditating about the Ramseys and how much has changed in the world around them.The book is tremendously beautiful and sad. I'll look forward to re-reading it again in another ten years."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Art of such consequence as this makes demands on its audience, but the return is colossal. This is an extraordinary book. It is at least as much poem as tale, as much music as prose. It will certainly change your idea about limitations of expression. For readers who require signposts of plot to trigger their perception of information, and who don't find it easy to appreciate the subtle flavours of words, be warned: you will need to depend very heavily on your inner ear, to allow some of the more exquisite sensations of language to wash in of their own accord. (Other reviewers have hinted here at the role of reading skills in our understanding.) It is possible though, by such openess, to develop a reliable method of perceiving and pulling ideas which is not at all the way we are so used to guzzling and then spitting them out, in our late 20th century consumerist addiction to news media sensation. A good book makes you want to write and speak, to learn how language can serve you. Woolf gently turns the relationship between events in time and the play of human feeling on its head in the search for universal truth. I read it the first go in two or three bites because it's flavours are so rich and I did not want to miss anything by failing to savour them properly. I'll always revisit it to learn and feel more and to be enriched further. This is not an Oprah book."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"This is quite simply, the most beautiful, illuminating, and period-defining book I have ever read. The prose is smooth and fluid, and if you let it carry you into the book, it will completely absorb you. I understand how stream-of-consciousness can be difficult, but rather than fighting the stream in an attempt to understand every sentence, I recommend 'going with the flow' for the first few pages and letting your visceral reactions to the emotions and ideas in the book guide you.This is a book about transitions; from childhood to adulthood, from an era of clearly defined roles to one of liberation; it is a book about the things people need from each other but have difficulty communicating; it is a book about the impossibility of communication and the other subtle ways we attempt to bridge the divide between ourselves and other people. I doubt these topics will ever be addressed as elegantly."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"--\\"The subject of this brilliant novel is the daily life of an English family in the Hebrides.\\" That's the copy description on the back cover of my edition of \\"To the Lighthouse.\\" I found it hilarious. I laughed for five minutes.--So it's an inadequate description of the novel?--Inadequate is an inadequate word to describe just how inadequate it is.--So what is \\"To the Lighthouse\\" about?--Well that's just the thing. To say it's about a family vacationing by the shore, about the delicate relationships between them and their friends, about how time changes them and their relationships between each other...is to miss the point entirely even if it is perfectly accurate.--As I understand it, this is a novel in which ten years passes in about fifteen pages, while the rest of the novel meticulously describes two days.--Yes, exactly. Like Proust, Woolf begins with a childhood incident that will echo down through the years. Like Joyce, she concentrates on the epiphanic moment. Reading \\"To the Lighthouse\\" is a bit like viewing a painting in which the characters move...but very slowly. Woolf passes from character to character, inhabiting each of their minds in turn, seeing the world through their eyes. Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay and their flawed but enduring marriage are the central bodies around which the rest orbit and Lily Briscoe, a spinsterish amateur painter, ostensibly stands in for Woolf herself, but it is hard to say that any of the characters are less or more important than any of the others--this is essentially the genius of Woolf's handling of psychological perspective. Everyone has a point of view and each point of view is essential to attain a vision of the whole.--But it is a novel essentially about family relationships?--And relationships between men and women, men and society, women and society, human beings and the inescapable fact of their mortality. Again and again, Woolf asks the question, \\"What does life mean? What is it for?\\"--Does she have an answer?--Yes. And no.--It's ambiguous.--It's provisional. But it's enough to help Lily make it through the dark storm of life to use a perfectly horrible metaphor. It's her lighthouse.--Woolf has a reputation as a difficult author to read.--And it's well-deserved. She is a difficult read for the majority of readers, who, let's face it, are awaiting Dan Brown's new novel as if it were a major event in world literary history. What happens in \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" when anything happens at all, isn't as important as how it affects each character internally. That is to say, Woolf's focus is on the fleeting but all-important impressions that the world leaves on us and that ultimately make us who we are. Her greatest gift is to capture these gossamer-thin states in a language of exquisite accuracy--capturing in words the flavor of fleeting emotions seldom if ever described before, even as they evaporate on the tongue.--You would have to love language, then, to fully appreciate her work.--Indeed. Her sentences don't move the story forward; they move the story deeper. She writes a poetic prose that many contemporary readers might mistake for unnecessarily flowery and overwrought--when, in fact, it is sharp as a surgeon's scalpel and cuts to the heart. And yet for all its surgical accuracy, it is the sensuous prose of a writer for whom language is like a box of brilliant colors is to a painter, for whom sentences are like caresses to a lover, except that in this case what is touched are the most potently orgasmic areas of our brains--needles to say, the ones most difficult areas to reach.--But Virginia Woolf reaches them?--You might say she's a master masseuse.--Ha ha. Does she provide a happy ending?--No, not exactly. But it's a deeply satisfying experience all the same."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Art of such consequence as this makes demands on its audience, but the return is colossal.

What's the point of this edition?? Buy a different version, reader!"},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"In what many call her most autobiographical novel, Virginia Woolf creates a warm and intimate portrait of a family which resembles her own-her parents, brothers and sisters-and the friends with whom they enjoy their summer vacation on the Isle of Skye in the Hebrides. Mrs. Ramsay, the mother of eight children, is the linchpin of the fictional family. She adores her husband, and though she often feels she fails him, she persists in smoothing his way so that he can work, managing the house and children, and inviting large groups of his students and friends to visit. Often strict and always right, Mr. Ramsay loves being the center of praise, but rarely praises others, and is often insensitive to the hopes and dreams of his children.In Part I, Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay, their children, several women and men (including philosophy students), for whom Mrs. Ramsay enjoys acting as a matchmaker, all contribute their thoughts as Virginia Woolf explores some of her favorite themes during the course of one day on the island. Mrs. Ramsay's running commentary on her everyday life emphasizes her vision of the role of women and opens the question of whether or not it is possible for women to find a meaningful role in life outside of marriage. The importance of the thinking life-with peripheral attention paid also to the artistically creative life-reflects the intellectual climate of England in the lead-up to the First World War, and the desire of many thinkers to create a significant intellectual legacy which will survive them.Part II, a brief bridge, ten years later, focuses on the changes which have taken place. The war has begun and ended. Many key characters have died, and Mr. Ramsay, devastated, also fears that all his writing will have been for naught. In Part Three, what's left of the family returns to the house on Skye for a visit after a ten year absence. Perhaps showing his personal growth and desire to atone for his previous insensitivity to James's desires, Mr. Ramsay now insists on making the trip to the lighthouse with teenagers James and his younger sister Cam, though James is no longer even interested in going. James commands the boat, however, and receives unaccustomed praise. Back on land, Lily Briscoe, a young woman artist for whom Mrs. Ramsay was hoping to be a matchmaker, decides to begin work again on an unfinished portrait of Mrs. Ramsay, and as she works, she also realizes a new kind of freedom for herself.Taking a modernist approach, Woolf has no primary narrator, instead slipping in and out of the minds of several characters as they think about life and observe life around them. Her modified stream-of-consciousness allows her to create a vibrant, free-flowing atmosphere which she peoples with unique characters who have revealed their innermost thoughts. The overall effect is powerful, and Woolf's often lyrical prose conveys the sights and sounds of life on the island at the same time that it also enlivens the highly philosophical but very personal portrait of family life. No unifying plot and no unifying voice tie the three sections of the novel together, and many of the early characters play little role in the ending, yet in her hands the novel \\"works.\\" Woolf captures not only the passage of time but also the effects of time on all of her characters as they continue their lives, however changed, following in the footsteps of experimental writers like James Joyce, and taking literary chances which place her work with the best of the twentieth century. Mary WhippleOrlando: A Biography"},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Yes, this is the best novel ever written using stream-of-consciousness narrative, Joyce not excepted, but it's unfair to introduce it that clinically. Simply put, if you want the privilege of living briefly inside the minds of some of the most ordinary and yet most compelling characters ever conceived--and such a paradox is a tribute to Woolf's genius--read this book. Well worth the delicious effort."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"If one reads this book as just a slew of events happening in the lives of the various main characters, they are missing much. Woolf uses the seemingly &quot;boring&quot; events of an everyday life to delve the depths of the human psyche. As I read this book and became more intricately involved with the characters, I found my eternal quest for meaning wrapped up in everything Woolf's characters thought. Some may see this as a duldrum account of characters' lives that they can't even begin to relate to; look deeper though and you'll see your own existence being challenged and pulled by the realities of life Woolf presents in this excellent novel."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"When I read this novel, I knew that Virginia Woolf must have had an incredible and vivid vision to have CREATED such an oustanding canvas of words. Though most people who read this think that the plot is slow moving, that is exactly what makes it unparallel. We actually come close to understanding characters not only in their concious states, but stripped of personality and exposed to the world."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"It is depressing to realise that the work of the twentieth century novelists has not filtered through to the reading practices of the modern public. I use the term novelists in its true form, not in the way it is bandied about to every pulp writer today who picks up a pen gives the public &quot;what it wants&quot; and is handed a six or more figure check in return. The Bloomsbury group was motivated to redefine writing by a despair over the reduction of writing to the production of an easily digested plot. Does this in the age of the blockbuster sound familiar? In case this sounds like the disgruntled ramblings of an old has been I must reveal that it is instead the bitter attack of a 22 year old. My only advice is for people who believe reading is an experience, rather than the chance to churn through the equivalent of pastoral gossip, you must read To the Lighthouse. For those &quot;readers&quot; out there who did and disdained then I suggest a magazine or current bestseller may be to your tastes. Otherwise there is always the television for those who cannot take the time to breathe."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Those of you interested in an engaging plot should, in general, shy away from Virginia Woolf. _Lighthouse_ is an exquisite novel that explores the minds of its characters. In fact, it is only through the thoughts of one character that the reader learns about another. The culmination of this can easily be seen during the dinner in the first section. Gorgeous, and as Welty says &quot;ethereal&quot; prose throughout. Techniques like the flow of time in the second section are what truly amaze me about Woolf's writing."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Though this is an incredibly difficult read, it's worth it if you have the time and patience. The story is in three parts, the first being a family planning a trip to a lighthouse, the second being a tragedy that occurs, and the third being the actual trip to the lighthouse. The story asks the questions, \\"Is man the sum of his experiences?\\" and \\"Is time the succession of a line of lampposts?\\" I won't tell you the answers that Woolf provides or that I agree with them (she was certifiable and reading this book gives a glimpse into that tragic mind), but I will tell you that in between the sometimes laborious but skillful symbolism there is often a passage of beautifully poetic stream-of-consciousness prose.As the masterpiece it is, 5 stars are not enough.J.

From the smallest happenings (a family gathered at a seaside house) seen in two brief glimpses (a long summer afternoon before the first world war, and a single morning ten years later), Virginia Woolf distils a profound meditation on love and loss, hope and disappointment, and human relationships, especially the precarious and limiting balance between men and women. But it is impossible to summarize in a sentence what Woolf achieves in two hundred pages, so let me just pick on three specifics: art, thought, and time.ART. The Harcourt Harvest Book paperback edition has a beautiful cover, apparently a tinted turn-of-the century photograph of a beach with the sea and a lighthouse beyond. It is a perfect evocation of the period and of lazy summers by the sea. Yet the credits say it is adapted from a photo by a much later artist, Herbert List; presumably the period air and the uncanny overtones of Seurat's \\"Grande Jatte\\" are the work of the designer, Liz Demeter. I mention this partly because a book's cover is like incidental music; it creates the context in which you start reading, and this is perfect. But also because visual art also plays an important part in the book. One of the guests of the owners of the house, the Ramsays, is Lily Briscoe, an unmarried woman in her thirties. We first see her as she is painting in the garden: \\"Lily's picture! Mrs. Ramsay smiled. With her little Chinese eyes and her puckered-up face, she would never marry; one could not take her painting very seriously.\\" So of course we take her for a mere amateur; and Lily similarly puts herself down, conditioned by a climate which denied creativity to women except as wives and mothers. But when we get to look closer at Lily's picture we see that it is extremely advanced for its time, and her thought processes are as rigorous as anything we hear from the paterfamilias Mr. Ramsay, a once-celebrated philosopher. Indeed in the glorious closing chapters of the book, it is Lily, struggling to express balance and feeling in paint, who comes closest to giving meaning and permanency to the whole family history. One recalls that one of Virginia Woolf's closest friends in the Bloomsbury Group was the art critic Roger Fry, who coined the term post-impressionism. Lily, far from being a minor character, stands as the alter ego of Woolf herself, achieving in touches of paint a very close analogy to what the author manages so marvelously in words.THOUGHT. But fine as Virginia Woolf's visual descriptions are, her main medium is not sight but thought. The two days at the seaside are described entirely through the minds of various individual members of the family and their guests. There is occasional dialogue, but no third-person narrator. A paragraph may start with the thoughts of one person about another, switch smoothly to the mind of that other person, and then return to the first again. And often the thoughts of the first character will change significantly between one moment and the next. Affection can switch suddenly to anger and back again; Woolf knows that most emotions, especially given the complex ties that bind families, can seldom be contained by a single label; through her apparent contradictions, she builds up a truth that is richer than could have been attained by consistency alone. Again, I think of the visual arts and the multiple viewpoints of cubism, but though a modern writer, Woolf is not a modern-ist; her technique is concealed, not flaunted; she is not a \\"difficult\\" writer in the sense that Joyce or even Faulkner are. As a results, her portraits come through with great warmth, especially that of Mrs. Ramsay, willingly adopting a supporting role to her curmudgeonly husband (or almost willingly -- with Woolf that is important), but blessed with a radiance of personality that illuminates the entire book, even when she is not at the center of it.TIME. Most novels tell a story that unfolds gradually over the course of time; this doesn't. The outer sections of the book take place virtually in real time; the action happens at about the same speed as it takes to read about it. But for all intents and purposes, these sections are static compared to the ten-year duration of the narrative as a whole. Only one thing happens in either of the outer sections that could really be called an event, and that involves two minor characters whose relationship to the Ramsays is never clearly specified. But that does not mean lack of movement. The rapidly shifting juxtapositions and viewpoints build up a dense texture of relationships and feelings that reach a certain stability at the close of the first (and longest) section, but leave you wanting more. In painting terms again, one might call this opening a still life -- except that the various figures in it are now linked by quasi-electrical charges, so that the balance between them is not static but dynamic, presently in equilibrium but capable of further motion. In effect, you could close the book at this moment and write your own narrative. Instead, Virginia Woolf does something quite extraordinary. In the ten short chapters of the twenty-page interlude entitled \\"Time Passes,\\" she takes on the role of narrator for the first time, and tells what happens in the next few minutes, the remainder of that night, the ensuing nights, the changing seasons, the course of the War, and the passage of years. She writes of impersonal things -- the house, the garden, the wind, the sea -- throwing in small nuggets of personal information almost as afterthoughts. When the Ramsays finally return, much has changed, and the former golden days seem tarnished. But by the end of this marvelous novel, Virginia Woolf has burnished them to a new shine, less brilliant perhaps, but deeper and more lasting."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"In To the Lighthouse, Virginia Woolf accomplishes a feat that every writer hopes to accomplish in his/her lifetime: she creates out of the ordinary humdrum of the daily life of an English family of Ramsay's characters and paragraphs that will ever be part of the best of English writing produced in last century. In my opinion, several paragraphs in this novel are like jewels of English prose, that must be prized, possessed and displayed likewise. Woolf settles for a very subtle narrative, though which she presents innermost thoughts of her characters, especially women, and in the brilliance of her words, romance and life are captured like snapshots labelled thoughtfully and carefully!The book is sort of divided into two parts, separated by decades. What was most intoxicating part of the book was the description of this change, as was the description of the nightfall. Be it secret thoughts of women or their admirers, or the doubts and uncertainities of a professor-father or the feelings of children (in both times separated by more than a decade) or the simple description of nature, Woolf shows a talent that must make her as important to twentieth century literature as Joyce and Lawrence. She is in my opinion one of the finest (if not the finest) female novelist to have ever existed! Maybe my hyperbole is uncalled for, but my admiration stems from the deep admiration of an exquisite piece of creative writing! Like every classic, this one must be savored with slow speed; deep thoughts, few pages at a time and remembered by the beauty of the sentences and emotions they capture or arouse; and not by the turn of events or unfolding of drama, which even though interesting, is incidental to this incredible piece of literature!"},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"..... but perhaps not the greatest story teller?This book is one of the hardest I've tried to rate. The ending with its multiple perspectives - those on the boat, and those on the shore - is wonderful, and with just the right mix of the visionary. It's almost a ghost story, but nothing like any other ghost story I've read.No matter where I picked the book up, and took up reading again, I was fascinated. I could feel the holiday the characters were experiencing as if I was there at the seaside even though I have only had one short holiday in Britain. But, then, I suspect that family life and the desultory holiday experience was very similar here in Australia. I don't really mean desultory, but the routine holiday venue with its hours of no-work, no-school often had a strange feeling of tedium mixed with the 'excitement' of something different from routine. Unfortunately, reading this book also resurrected the feeling in me - the book too well records the feeling - and I quickly found myself drifting off into my own private world and not regarding the words as well as I should - only to be fascinated again as my attention snapped back.The book is wonderful for its multiple perspectives. Here is an example of a change of view mid-paragraph (this sort of thing often had me re-reading as my attenton drifted).\\"What damned rot they talk, thought Charles Tansley, laying down his spoon precisely in the middle of his plate, which he had swept clean, as if Lily thought (he sat opposite her with his back to the window precisely in the middle of view), he were determined to make sure of his meals. Everything about him had that meagre fixity, that bare unloveliness. But nevertheless, the fact remained, it was almost impossible to dislike any one if one looked at them. She liked his eyes: they were blue, deep set, frightening.\\"The stream-of-consciousness writing style used by Woolf as closely as anything I have experienced imitates the greatest attribute of fine music - counterpoint - the ability of the mind to track and appreciate many strands of experience at the one time, to flick back and forth between many voices. With music you can listen to the same work many times and explore the multiple voices in different ways each time without compromising your appreciation of the whole. I suspect you could do this with several readings of 'To the Lighthouse' too. Unfortunately it takes a greater commitment to re-read a book than it does to, say, listen again to a Mozart symphony.Woolf does have a great ending to this novel - a really memorable mood piece. Unfortunately, to extend the musical analogy, I found her melodies not strong enough, the development of ideas at times pedestrian (detail got in the way), the orchestration inadquate and the harmony not strong enough (although there is one very strong moment in the novel)."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"V.W use and style of writing captivates the patient, and open minded person.

He worries about getting to &quot;X&quot; or even &quot;Y&quot;, as he believes other philosophers do, without realizing that he is fiddling with his chromosomes in a desperate attempt to reassure himself of his greatness.

There is a paragraph in &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; which describes the lord of the manor more clearly than a camera. This paragraph is one sentence long though not one long sentence.

I'm also aware that Woolf is someone who many respect, but whose style they may not necessarily like. I am one of those people. Woolf's experimental style--stream of consciousness--is revolutionary, coming at a time when most writers began to break free of Pre-WWI literary conventions.However, she remains, to this day, someone who is difficult to read and difficult to comprehend. Reading &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; was relatively easy. But understanding it was not. To be more vulgar, it was so boring, I lost any sense of awareness of the story and the characters. Some say Mrs. Ramsay's thoughts were complex and ahead of her time; I say they were small and meaningless. And the men were even smaller, even more base. The experiment with the text was successful, but the story's worth can easily be debated."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"An excellent read about a family who is completely dependant on their mother.

I find myself having to concentrate on almost every phrase, certainly every sentence. I also find that I cannot read more than one \\"chapter\\" at a time, except for some of the real short chapters.But if you take the time, shut out all other distractions, perhaps some soothing Norah Jones or Connie Rae in the background (at very low volume), and absorb each word, phrase, sentence, you should really enjoy \\"To The Lighthouse.\\"I am about a third of the way through. I don't even know if there's a plot. I doubt that there is. But the observations that Virginia Woolf makes of those around her is incredible. I can understand why she often recorded that she could only write for an hour or so each day.Her understanding of the relationship between a child and a mother is phenomenal. It heightens one's appreciation for all moms. Maybe this was the mother's day card Virginia was never able to give her own mom.(Incidentally, \\"To The Lighthouse\\" concerns a family with eight children, which sounds a bit far-fetched, but in fact Virginia was one of eight children growing up in London.)"},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"I struggled passed the cryptic, abstract narrative to really get to know the characters. I wanted to know their thoughts and feelings and kept hoping that at some point in time a full, rich character development would become clear to me. Although some under-the-surface insights into their psyches were excellent, they were no more earth-shattering than other 20th century literature that I have read. These solid character-defining excerpts that I enjoyed so much were also few and far between, and I felt annoyed that I had to wade through the &quot;filler&quot; to get to the real thing. Even with these excellently written insights, I still never had a powerful image in my mind about the characters, and I did not empathize with any of them. It was a very detached experience.In order to appreciate the book more for what it was I tried to take into consideration the timing of the book. Today our society is very self aware and we are able to articulate what we are thinking and feeling so much more than we did in the 20's. This book was written before Freud and Oprah were household names, and before we had access to TV and other forms of mass media. Perhaps the lack of clarity of the characters was symptomatic of the lack of self-understanding that people (or Virginia Woolf) experienced at that time. I am sure if I read it again and did not filter it through my late 20th century perspective on life, I would find it to be the masterpiece that it is revered to be. But I will not read it again - I would much rather read another book that grabs me the first time.Overall I am happy that I read it simply to have experienced a novel by Virginia Woolf and check off another book from the New York Times 100 best books of the 20th Century."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Virginia Wool's novel To the Lighthouse is a tour de force in the masterful use of English prose. In some instances, brilliantly skillful use of language seems to become an end in itself. without regard for the substance of the story being told. For one as talented as Virginia Woolf, this linguistic excess seems easy to forgive. She can, I think, be excused for doing -- even overdoing -- what she does best.To the Lighthouse manifests the themes and stylistic distinctiveness of early 20th Century modernism even more strikingly than Woolf's later novel Mrs. Dalloway. Even more than the latter, To the Lighthouse is a nonlinear overlay of things unspoken and undone, based almost entirely on accounts of conversations and feelings that one has within one's self, while betraying little of importance to conventional means of observation by others. This gives us a world that is often not even remotely connected with what seems to be its object. In truth, there exists a multiplicity of simultaneously occurring, overlapping worlds, each belonging to a character having his or her own place, inaccessible, for the most part, to others.Nevertheless effective, even compelling, communication occurs, bespeaking the power of a vague frown, smile, or barely discernible nod of approval, or a meeting of eyes with which one expresses approval of disapproval or even something a good deal more complex across a crowded dinner table fraught with inconsequential social conventions. Some of us are sufficiently alike that such unspoken communication can occur between two who know each other not well at all. Typically, however, the more familiar the interlocutors, the richer the wordless exchange.The interior worlds described by Woolf are complex and varied places, internally contradictory, and quite unstable. Though each of us is a creature of his or her own world, others are essential constituents. In them we discern youth, beauty, sadness, cruelty, surly self-importance, grace, need, intelligence, satisfaction, rage ... all the attributes and faculties that we use in constituting our own lived experience. Without saying so -- perhaps without recognition -- we rely on others to make our world understandable and livable. Should an other die, say one who seemed to have a way, just through her presence, of holding things together in an interpretable whole, we are bereft, filled with a sense of loss, perhaps even angry with her for leaving. After all, her passing has revealed the instability of our very self.Unwittingly, we search for anchorages. But we are faced with repeated discovery that, in the long run, everyone else is just as unreliably subject to unanticipated change as we are. None of us this has to do with character flaws, but is inherent in our nature. One of the characters in To the Lighthouse, reflecting on loss, aging, and uncertainty asks, \\"What does it all mean?\\" But Virginia Woolf is not interested in \\"What does it all mean?\\" or \\"What does it mean to be?\\"or similarly final metaphysical questions born in the hubris of professional philosophers. She asks and brilliantly answers a different question of more immediate importance: \\"What is it like to be?\\" A tentative and incomplete answer can be pieced together from the observations above.In his book After Theory, Terry Eagleton offers the judgment that post-modernism is best understood as an extension of early 20th Century modernism. Perhaps he was thinking of Virginia Woolf's novels when he reached this conclusion. I can't imagine a better statement as to the nature of our face-to-face social world and the lives of those who constitute it than To the Lighthouse. It is a challenging existentialist masterpiece."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"My youngest daughter - in college - seems very well pleased with this selection... like the professor gave her a choice, right?"},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"No wonder people study this in school, it's quite hard to follow with very little storyline to follow.

It is open and fresh and very easy to read.There is something beautiful, truthful and memorable on every page of To The Lighthouse. Here is an example:What is the meaning of life? That was all--a simple question; one that tended to close on on one with years. The great revelation had never come. The great revelation perhaps never did come.

The lights dimmed, three men stood on stage, a table behind them. Several days earlier, I attended a discussion by a set designer named Beowulf Boritt, who explained his \\"lighthouse\\" came together in three acts, the \\"lighthouse\\" being built on the stage. Woolf's text was divided into three parts. Made sense to me. The men began singing, the small orchestra played. I waited for Mrs. Ramsay and Lily Briscoe to appear . . . and finally figured out--the opera was not based Virginia Woolf's novel. I leaped from Peter Maxwell Davies' The Lighthouse to Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse. This lighthouse was about the murder of three lighthouse keepers.Virginia Woolf, the early feminist who wrote A Room of Her Own, ask for women to have a seat at the publishing table. She ended up in a sexless marriage to a man whom she loved, yet her husband, realizing his wife's creative genius, published her work: To the Lighthouse, Mrs. Dalloway, Orlando, Flush, and A Room of One's Own. Unable to live through a second world war, Virginia committed suicide, putting rocks in her pockets and \\"finding a room of her own.\\" She created a path for women writers to follow her powerful creative pen.Reading Lighthouse again, I was struck by how much my writing reflects Woolf's. Her three sections, the first with Mrs. Dalloway's knitting sock, her son James' cutting objects from a catalogue, Lily Brisco's painting a picture; flash forward to Mrs. Dalloway's death; and finally the present with James, his sister Cam, and their father rowing to the Lighthouse as Lily Brisco paints a scene begun years prior. My novel takes the protagonist to a flashback in college, to an incident after the husband's death; to the husband's death, a flashback to her living alone, forward to her entering a war zone. Editors continue to respond, The text is confusing to readers. Not so, say most readers.Other similarities include Woolf's interior monologues of Lily Brisco as she observes Mrs. Dalloway; text repetition, \\"some one had blundered\\" written five times; \\"We are in the hands of the Lord\\" written twice); \\"But I beneath a rougher sea/ Was whelmed in deep gulfs than he.\\" Written twice. My text is filled with blood, sex, money, CIA references repetitiously strewn throughout the novel. Her text separated and set off for emphasis\\"stormed at with shot and shell.\\"My \\"Straight Arrow\\" chapter sets off inner dialogue\\"MY HEARTARRHYTHMICASPIRATINGLIKE THE BLOOD IS LEAKINGLEAKING INTO MY MOUTHTHE FAADEBRITTLEA SCREAM SILENT\\"to demonstrate my horror at hearing a best friend had assassinated an entire family and their servants and nervously waited for a helicopter to retrieve him.Even Woolf's \\"subject/object\\" and the nature of reality, that is--\\"you think of a kitchen table when a kitchen table is not present in your vision\\" is similar. My epilogue in six sections, hermeneutics & T.S. Eliot's objective correlative--objects arranged to affect an epiphany--and students learning to read high-level conceptual thinking, through objects--a mother's breast to a kitchen table to love and empathy, models Woolf's \\"subject/object.\\" Woolf's colors--red, purple, grey, blue, lemon, white, violet--are written into my stories, red poinsettias, gold temples, grey uniforms, white smoke from a Buddhist cremation. Woolf's themes--\\"knitting, the journey is enough\\"; my spiraling journey begins and ends at the same point, the journey is the focus. Woolf's ideas: \\"half of one's notions of other people, after all, were grotesque. They served private notions of one's own.\\" We say (or write) the words we need to hear.And I guess we \\"write\\" what we need to read. Virginia filled her pockets with rocks and stepped into the stream that changed writing for women. We're all taking a journey \\"to\\" the lighthouse.\\""},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Virginia Woolf (1882 - 1941) was a well known writer, critic, feminist, and publisher. This was her fifth novel.As background information, I read her first novel \\"The Voyage Out\\" published in 1915, skipped her second novel - which is considered to be a flop, Night and Day from 1919 - and then read \\"Jacob's Room,\\" her third, then went on and read \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" her fourth, and next read \\"To The Lighthouse,\\" etc. Also, I read some of Woolf's non-fiction.\\"The Voyage Out\\" is simple and straightforward work and it might remind the reader of a Jane Austen novel, but it set on a ship and then at a remote location. It is over 400 pages long, and has an Austen theme. After her second novel - which did not do very well - Woolf decided to be more risky and creative with the next book. She changed her style and approach to the novel and Woolf uses the stream of consciousness technique to bring a sense of the chaos and shortness of a young man's life around the time of World War I, Jacob's life, i.e.: from the pandemonium of Jacob's life as portrayed by Woolf through the use of the stream of the consciousness technique, we eventually have clarity in the novel. She carries this writing style on into the similarly chaotic story in the novel \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\"This is her third novel using her stream of consciousness technique and she does it in a very dramatic fashion. The story is centered on the life of Mrs. Ramsay, a beautiful woman in her early fifties, and her older husband, and their eight children, plus other guests and neighbors and domestic help all at a beach house somewhere in Scotland on a warm summer day. Her husband is an academic and a bit remote. Mrs. Ramsay is more down to earth, and she is mostly loved and admired by all.As in the novel \\"Jacob's Room\\" the reader is left dangling as Woolf moves from character to character, giving the reader glimpses of their inner emotions. It is hard to determine what Woolf is doing and where she is going. But what she seems to be doing is celebrating a moment in a life. This is done very effectively with the stream of consciousness technique, and very dramatically as the story proceeds. The prose is brilliant and awe inspiring in some spots, and we see the genius of Woolf.To say a lot more would ruin the story for the reader, but most will appreciate the way the story unfolds, and it unfolds very dramatically after a seemingly slow and complex start. The change has an effect on the reader - or so I found. Some think that it is Woolf's finest work and it would be hard to find fault with that assessment. She takes her ideas from \\"Jacob's Room\\" and applies them to a more complicated and dramatic setting at a family get together at a beach house, and it works.This is a must read novel."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"This book would have been tolerable had it been more straightforward. Ms. Wolfe goes overboard with her stream of consiousness style. She goes out of her way to not say what needs to be said which is egotistical and makes for a very disappointing book."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"&quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; is a rambling monotony, a lifeless droning. No matter how loudly the literary lemmings scream, that will always be so. Woolf opens &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; with a very uninteresting sentence and a &quot;So what&quot; bit of exposition; both come to nothing, promising us little and failing to deliver even that. The story was rambling, incoherent and boring in the extreme. Woolf jumped from head to head, thought to thought, as if each threatened to bite off her foot as she landed. The &quot;story&quot; (and calling &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; a story is a huge generosity) is painfully slow. So slow, in fact, that you come to &quot;The End&quot; and still nothing has developed.The book is filled with poorly written exposition that not only stops the story dead, but takes us completely away from it time and again. Each sentence starts with a jerk, wanders around, twists back upon itself, spirals away from us, then trips its way back to the starting point. Woolf seemed to have no idea about what it was that she really wanted to say and no ability to state any of it succinctly or coherently. Continuing in this trend, Woolf keeps the dialogue brief in the extreme and does it for no other reason than for her to run on and on and on and . . . with her exposition, using those miles long sentences that the reader is PRAYING will end, but that just keep muddling along, belaboring point after senseless point. The poor woman had no talent at all when it came to simply telling a straightforward tale and making it interesting to anyone but herself.Little of the book has anything to do with the lighthouse, or with going there. It's more about the inner workings and complexities of a small group of people. Kind of like taking a series of snapshots of the group, then going one by one and telling what is in each of their heads. As we go through the various bits of these snapshots, now and then Woolf tosses out the seeds of something interesting, then immediately stamps the life out of them before they can sprout into something greater. Included in these are some tantalizing crumbs of internal monologue, but Woolf can't even stay focused on that. She wonders through each character's personal musings just the same way that she wonders through the main story, never allowing one thought to fully form before rambling away from it. This is the story's real tragedy, because she turns some marvelous phrases, but loses them in the tale's incoherence.The shrieking chant of &quot;but it's EXPERIMENTAL fiction!&quot; cannot excuse the many and severe shortcomings. Bad writing is bad writing, no matter what feeble attempts at justification are made to hide that fact."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"basically James Joyce did the one day of introspection thing and showed that a) he was a clever bugger, and b) this kind of book is not an enjoyable read. so then Vwoolf does the same thing with a second-rate bunch of tedious people. hmm.bet that will prove fascinating. it does. not.god knows why everyone runs around pretending this turgid nonsense is great literature -- maybe wanting to be pseudo-intellectual? bloomsbury is like the cancer of British literature, and as this year's Pultizer was won by a Woolfie-book, maybe its contagious.

Better to read Proust or Faulkner or Kathy Acker.(Waterily and Ghostlily are illustrative of Woolfe's horrible diction and mindset, as are these parentheses)."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Everything was like they said.

As another reviewer stated, Woolf does give us a few glances at some great phrasings and story possibilities, but then she stamps it all out and moves on to something, anything, else. Just so long as the story never becomes interesting. God forbid."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"This book is quite possibly the worst book I have ever read.If you ever took a literature class in college you will remember that there are a variety of ways to critique a book. Most classifications include basing your critique on how well the work teaches true principles, the form of the work, the background and ambience of the work and the author, and how well the work stands the test of time. This work fails abysmally in all of these areas.First of all this is a book about nothing and nothing happens. There is no plot and the author does not say anything worth thinking about or reading twice to get the meaning. Some critics claim that this is why the book is so good. Some even claim that Woolf is trying to say something about hum-drum life, family structure and even, absurdly, male and female roles. Don't believe it! Don't waste your time reading this.Secondly, this book has no form, no climax, no denouement, no nothing. I suppose you could say that this means the form is that literary word used to describe books that make you want to commit suicide when they are assigned in an English course taught by some spinster Lesbian - stream-of-consciousness. Well there's no stream and no character in the book is conscious. Obviously the author did carefully construct the inner and external dialogues so it is emphatically not stream-of-consciousness. Read Joyce and then this garbage and you will see the difference.Thirdly, there is no point looking into the life and ambience of the author and period of writing if this is the best book she wrote. (And it is generally considered the best book she wrote)Lastly, this book fails the test-of-time standard. It is becoming more and more irrelevant.Now you may ask why did I read this then? Because it was assigned reading. This book is the written equivalent of strychnine. Every page is so utterly bereft of anything of value that your mind and intellect writhe in agony as you force your abused eyes to read the next sentence.

Don't read this book.I hate Virginia Woolf."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"The time span in \\"To a Lighthouse\\" is from 1910 - 1920. And time is a critical element in this novel whose beginning paints a very insular setting, the small-scale world according toMrs. Ramsay. The season is summer and it is an annual event that she, her husband and eight children, a coterie of Mr. Ramsay's academic-type admirers and a spinster with a love of painting, adjourn to the Ramsay's seaside household.The story's unfolding is mirrored in the manner of Mrs. Ramsay's thinking...all internal: about her husband; her children; their family friends; an anticipated engagement; marriage in general and her own in particular; and her husband's preoccupation with his academic career. Without a doubt, Mrs. Ramsay is the glue that holds this little, private cocoon together.Mr. Ramsay, succinctly put, is self-centered. He's introspective; he's occupied with his achievements; and \\"reaching Z\\" is an all-absorbing goal! Contemplative walking and pacing seem to be among his favorite pastimes and his amblings provide him more space to contemplate \\"I, I, I\\" as aptly described by Lily Briscoe, an amateur artist. At times it seems as if being the father of eight, even though his wife shields him from much of the routine of family life... including household expenses...serves as a hindrance to his further achievements. He is a man of logic and will not even tolerate his youngest child's yearnings to go to the lighthouse because the weather on the following day will most assuredly not \\"be fine\\" as Mrs. Ramsay tries to assure the child it will be.There is an occasional sadness and distance about Mrs. Ramsay that manifests following her husband's frequent petulant scenes. Nonetheless she plays her roles to absolute perfection: mother, wife, and nurturer to all including their guests. She sees their shortcomings but accepts them and fosters each in her own way according to their perceived needs.Women are relegated to minor roles; it is the men who are the intelligent ones. And Mr. Ramsay conjectures that much of what his wife reads she may not understand. Yet the couple loves one another... each person according to his own capacity. Mrs. Ramsay is obviously her husband's fan, the one who bolsters him and protects and nurtures him...and the reader is privy to all her thoughts accordingly. There is a glimmer, too, of her disappointment in him, his self-centeredness and his sole reliance on logic.Age (a mechanism employed to show the passage of time) is also a theme in \\"To the Lighthouse\\". Mrs. Ramsay was a beauty, is yet considered a beauty despite her age. Her aging husband, however, is still considered handsome and attracts and welcomes female attention...female flattery. This is appropriate for a man; a woman may gain admiration for her skills and her looks but it would be inappropriate to call attention to herself.The world of children, weather, guests and their idiosyncrasies, Mrs. Ramsay's desire that things remain the same thus assuring her children never having to grow up to face life's problems, takes a huge leap and the reader is propelled from the previous protected cocoon into \\"real life\\".Mrs. Ramsay dies, son Andrew perishes in World War I, her daughter Prue is escorted down the aisle by her father, and one year later dies giving birth. Yet, the author is ingenious about holding fast to the internal world of the characters, with only an occasional external utterance.Everything has changed. Without the foundational piece, the cement that holds the household and extended household together, the summer place is abandoned, dusty, rotting, decrepit, unattended. No one has vacationed there for 10 years. Subsequently, orders are generated to a former household staff member to re-open the house for a smaller onslaught of visitors.Nothing is the same without Mrs. Ramsay. She is mourned, especially by Lily Briscoe. Only three of the Ramsay children have accompanied their father to the summer retreat. He is still the bully that he was in their childhood. Their world still operates according to his moods, whims and orders. James and Cam, now 16 and 17, are morose and it always seems as if they are waiting for the \\"other shoe to drop\\". Nothing must go awry or their aged father will be irritated and critical.Mr. Ramsay's preoccupation is still with himself and it is the guests' duty to pity him, fawn over him and focus their attention on the pain dealt him. Lily Briscoe refuses to do this (she is adamant that marriage, as espoused by Mrs. Ramsey as a must, is not necessarily so). She braces herself to deliberately focus her efforts on her art and its composition. She seeks balance in a painting that just doesn't seem to come together. This could be deemed symbolic of a search for balance in her own life and a challenge to attain some personal resolution to her grief overMrs. Ramsay's death.\\"To a Lighthouse\\" is a masterpiece; it succeeds as a group and character portrait While a difficult \\"read\\", the story, the plot, the character definition, and the passage of time...largely accomplished through internal dialogue... is ingenious!"},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"&quot;To The Lighthouse&quot; is a portrait of the Ramsey family; a portrait &quot;taken&quot; as they are vacationing at their summer home on the rugged coast of Scotland. This is a very interior portrait, though, the most interior I've ever stumble upon in any book to date. For me, at least, this book transcends the barrier of time, culture and all else and speaks straight from the soul, something few authors have been able to do.Two things struck me about the experience of reading it. One is that while I cant claim full understanding, I no longer found myself struggling with the form in order to read the book. The second is how much more booming the book became for me now that I'm older and can identify more with Mrs. Ramsey instead of seeing the book only through the character of Lily Briscoe.To the Lighthouse brings the Ramsey family and the people they bring their wake to their home on the Isle of Skye. Families in the world of this book are little things. The first half creates the Ramsey family group so well that when the second half is without it, the reader is always aware of the ghost images standing in the empty spaces. We found out what has happened to the missing members of the group by a reunion with the ghosts of the past. Meanwhile, lily tries to understand the world shes in and make her painting by meditating about the ramseys and how much has changed in the world around them.I beleive that Woolfs well known stream technique at its more poetic and influential than anyone else I have read. The boook is very beautiful and sad at the same time. I'll look forward re-reading it again in a couple more years. It's luminous, it's astonsishing, it's prizewinning. It's a book I think high school students should be made to read to really understand life at its fullest."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"&quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; reads like a dream. By that, I mean Woolf's writing has a dreamlike, impressionistic quality that uses little dialogue. The novel is about several English people who spend their summers in the Hebrides, islands northwest of Scotland. The lighthouse mentioned in the title is located on one of the islands and symbolizes a goal or an ideal to which several of the characters aspire in one way or another.The most prominent characters are the Ramsay family, whose internal conflicts form the basis for their existence, much like any other nuclear family. Mr. Ramsay is a philosophy professor, an imperious man who dreams of being remembered for his work and enjoys laying down the law with his children. Mrs. Ramsay's love for her husband has dwindled to the point of her not being sure why she ever fell in love with him in the first place, but she is enamored with the *idea* of being in love, always looking forward to her single friends getting married.The central character, however, is a woman named Lily Briscoe who paints canvases of an apparently abstract nature. Her conflict appears in the form of a character named Charles Tansley, an unsociable chauvinist who admonishes her that &quot;women can't paint, women can't write.&quot; Lily Briscoe's efforts to paint represent the difficult, introspective process of artistic creation.In combining the themes represented by Lily and the Ramsays, Woolf portrays the problems of being a woman artist in a society that discouraged women to be artistic or creative (the discouragement represented by the voice of Tansley) and therefore having to deal with the disappointment and frustration of conflicting with social mores (illustrated by Mrs. Ramsay's discontent in her marriage). However, Lily triumphs in completing her painting at the end, as Woolf triumphs in completing her novel."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"After &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; I never wanted to read stream of consciousness books again. And I was not overly happy when the teacher assigned this book. But after reading this, I saw that stream of consciousness could be beautiful (if it was handled correctly). The big difference here is that Woolf DOES offer a strong plot that enables her to use this technique. All of the characters are on some kind of journey to reach contentment. Obviously the desired contentment varies with the character, but nevertheless, they all have a common goal. The images of the lighthouse serves as a medium between the characters. Woolf also gives us interesting psychological insight into human nature. Now this book is not the drum I march to. But it was one of my teacher (Ms Worby's) favorites. And in all honesty, I can understand why. If this is a typical example of Virginia Woolf's work, she is an outstanding author."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"A modern classic, arguably in the top ten along with the likes of Gatsby, Ulysses, Heart of Darkness, In Search of Lost Time, etc. An absolutely flawless work in which every word contributes to the overall effect and the author demonstrates her gift for stretching the English language to its most beautiful and striking extreme. A must-read for those interested in modern literature."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"First of all, I understand the psychology of the book and that it attempted something quite different from the conventional novel of its day (or the conventional novel of any day, for that matter). However, who could honestly say that there is something going on here that wasn't done much better by writers such as Joyce or Faulkner -- who also, by the way, generally had the courtesy and ability to include characters worthy of your attention, and a plot worth following. &quot;To the Light-house&quot; comes off as a college-lit writing exercise by a very precocious and observant writer, but one that ultimately lacks some very important abilities necessary to create top-shelf fiction."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"I read this book in 8th grade because I heard of it while reading *Letters to Julia* by Barbara Ware Holmes. I had to get it through inter-library loan, but I am glad I did because it was one of the most wonderful books I have ever read. I am probably the only one in the 9th grade who has read it, but it gives me a sort of blessed feeling to have read it and I don't want to recommend it to any of my friends. I don't think they would get very much out of it, and to enjoy this book you have to get a lot out of it. While reading the book I felt like I was one with Lily, especially in the last paragraph. This is an thought-provoking book for readers who like &quot;thinking&quot; books."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"\\"'To the Lighthouse,'\\" he thought. \\"Yes. I shall read \`To the Lighthouse.'\\"The thought was not a new one to him, but this time, it had appeared in his mind almost before he realized that it had appeared. He did not know why it had appeared just now, but there it was. And it was a good thought, he decided, one that he would act upon, one he would make a success of. He was glad for his decision, for he was one of that class of people who find it difficult to distinguish between the thought and the actual practice of the thought, and so was endowed with a sense of satisfaction and bliss that he would soon be reading, once again, \\"To the Lighthouse.\\"But a second thought came to him, immediately following the first. It chided him, and said to him, you did not like the book before, when you tried to read it the first time, so why do you want to read it again now, and probably fail once more. The time is not right for you to read \\"To the Lighthouse.\\"As soon as he thought it, the new thought infuriated him and he felt that if he had a knife, or a hatchet, or a blade of some sort, and if the thought had been a person, and not just a random thought, that he would pierce its heart with the blade and kill it. He was that upset about not being able to finish \\"To the Lighthouse\\" when he had attempted to read it the first time.He recalled the time he had first tried to read \\"To the Lighthouse.\\" It was only a month or so ago. He could not recall the exact day, or the time, or even the month, but on one fine fall day, sitting in his office, Scot, sitting on the other side of the cubicle wall, had asked him, as he often asked such questions, if he had ever read Virginia Woolf. No, he had replied, he had not.He searched his memory, seeking to find a title by Virginia Woolf that he could remember. Almost at once, he realized, after thinking about it for only a moment, that he had not ever read anything by Virginia Woolf, and wondered directly why he had not read anything she had written. In point of fact, he thought to himself, he did not even know the title of a single book by Virginia Woolf. It was strange.Of course, he had heard of Virginia Woolf, as had anyone of his generation, for he could remember clearly the movie, what was it called, with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Oh, yes. \\"Who is Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" That was the title of the movie. But he could recall little about the movie itself, and, because it was so many years ago, he had almost forgotten its title, or even what it was about, except that it was about a college professor and his frustrated wife, and something about an imaginary child. Beyond that, he could remember nothing about the film, and had in fact wondered, even as he had watched it, first in the theater and then several years later on a television rerun, what, indeed the movie had to do with Virginia Woolf. And many years later, now, brooding about the novels of Virginia Woolf and the movie \\"Who is Afraid of Virginia Woolf,\\" he was still perplexed as to what this film had to do with Virginia Woolf, for he could think of nothing, nothing at all, beyond the title, of course. Except that the husband, as played by Richard Burton, was a college English professor.And as he often did with such thoughts, in this case, the thought that he should read a book by Virginia Woolf, he decided to follow up on it and find out more about Virginia Woolf and acquire one of her books to read. Online, he searched the catalog of the Dallas Public Library, and eventually, after discovering at last how to spell the name correctly, W-O-O-L-F and not W-O-L-F-E or some other such variation, he found the lengthy list of books written by Virginia Woolf, and was startled, for he usually knew such things, when he realized that he did not recognize even one of the titles.In dismay, he had called back across the cubicle wall to Scot, who was sitting there patiently, doing what Scot does, whatever it is, to pass the time of day at the office. Which book by Virginia Woolf should he read, he had asked, and directly came back the reply, across the cubicle wall: \\"To the Lighthouse.\\" Scot had said he should read \\"To the Lighthouse.\\"Upon arriving home from the office that day, he had discovered that he had no other pressing obligations for the evening, and so he had collected his various things to return to the library, books he had finished, records he had played, library things, collected them all together and carried them out to the car, and driven into town, directly to the library. Shortly thereafter, on the third floor of the library, in the fiction section, correctly but not predictably filed under W, for the library had recently been rearranged, and sometimes books were taken off the shelf to be part of a temporary display, or even taken downstairs to entice patrons randomly seeking an interesting book to read, he had found a copy of \\"To the Lighthouse.\\"Happily he checked it out, and took it home with him, with much anticipation of beginning it in the morning, for he planned to read it on the train while going to work.Unfortunately, when he started it, sitting in his usual seat on the train the next morning, riding to work, he found the book uninteresting. He simply could not grasp its meaning, or follow the flow of its words, or the complexity of its sentences, or the vague and fleeting thoughts that Virginia Woolf had so carefully crafted for its pages. After all the weak romance novels, and slick mystery novels, and cheap crime thrillers, and clumsy science fiction stories that he had recently been reading, all written in the usual, direct, post-Hemingway style of contemporary American fiction, heavily laced with terse dialogue and carefully constructed plot twists according to standard formulas, the ephemeral beauty of Virginia Woolf's luxurious writing and lush prose and sketchy plot was able to make scarcely a dent in his shallow American consciousness.So, after a few days of making little headway, even after what he considered to be an heroic effort, he snapped the book shut in confusion and frustration and put it aside. He did not like \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" he told Scot the next day, and said that he had found it boring, and had put it aside. Reluctantly, of course, he had said, he had put it aside, for it was his usual custom to finish a book he had started, especially if it was a significant one, as in this case, a classic, like \\"To the Lighthouse.\\"And Scot, rather unperturbed, as was his way, did not say anything much in response to his comment. He just said that he was reading it himself because of a school requirement and was happily deciphering its meaning. That is what Scot said he liked to do, in actual fact, to decipher meaning.And so it was now weeks later, and there it was, still sitting on the table in his house, the copy of \\"To the Lighthouse\\" he had not yet returned to the library. He saw it there sometimes, sitting on the table, and he felt that it was reproaching him, chiding him as it were, that he had not been able to finish it, scolding him because he had found it vague and frustrating and meaningless and finally, boring.And then, just a week or so prior to his Christmas vacation, the new thought had occurred to him, the thought that he should read \\"To the Lighthouse\\" again. Yes, he decided, he should read it again, and this time he would succeed, he was sure. He would try once again to read \\"To the Lighthouse.\\" This time, he thought, he would learn how to decipher its intricate text, parse its lush sentences, and find a way to penetrate to the very core of its meaning. But this time, he would not read the book, page by page, depending on his visual faculties, his eyes, to communicate the words to his brain. No. Instead, this time, he would use his ears, his auditory senses, the senses that he, as a trained musician, most favored. He would listen to someone read the text to him. Suddenly, he knew what he was going to do. He would listen to a recording of the book, read by an accomplished reader, in the car, on the trip he was about to take for his Christmas Holiday.By a fortunate chance, he found another copy of \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" an audio book on 7 CD's, eight hours long, narrated by a British actress called Virginia Leishman. And so he acquired it out and carried it with him in the car on his trip.Time passed.First, time passed in the car.And then, the time of the Christmas Holidays passed, as well.The long trip from Texas to South Carolina had taken two days, two long rainy days of bad restaurants and a cheap hotel room, and driving in the rain in heavy traffic trying to avoid an accident. And the music on the XM Radio he had just bought had managed to divert his attention away from the album of seven CD's carefully packed in the box on the back seat of his car, the audio book recording of \\"To the Lighthouse\\" that he had obtained with such anticipation to wile away the long hours on a road trip of many days, such as this one.When he had arrived at his destination, he still had not listened to his recording of \\"To the Lighthouse.\\" And while on vacation, the busy activities of the Christmas season occupied his time to such an extent that he had little time to read, much less listen to a book on tape for eight hours at a time, or even in one hour segments.The happy days of the Holidays sped by, those short days and long nights of fun and festivity and family warmth, passing by quickly in a whirlwind of parties and dinners and gatherings and church services, those family moments that are the happy custom of celebration during the Christmas season. Suddenly, almost in a flash, he realized that the holidays were over and the joyful family celebrations and parties and gatherings were finished and it was time for him to return home.With both a feeling of relief that the hectic holiday schedule was quickly drawing to a close, and yet with a tinge of regret that he would leave behind him once again the loving arms of his dear mother and the good-will of his family to return to his self sufficient life style, he began to make his plans for the long trek west, the journey of more than one thousand miles that he would make to return home.On the morning of his departure, as he carefully loaded his belongings back into the car, he saw the audio book recording of \\"To the Lighthouse\\" carefully packed in the box he had placed on the back seat. This time, on this leg of his journey, he thought, he really was going to read \\"To the Lighthouse.\\" At last, he was ready to listen attentively. And so he reached behind the seat and into the box to pull out the album that contained the collection of CD's that was the recording of \\"To the Lighthouse.\\" He carefully placed it on the front seat of the car, within arms reach, and then placed beside it the portable CD player that he had brought along just for that purpose. Yes. Today he would listen to \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" and began at once to feel a strong sense of anticipation for the reading.But the driving conditions were poor that morning, with clouds and wind and rain and generally bad weather threatening to make the driving difficult. For that reason, he feared that, if his attention were diverted from the recorded performance by the strain of driving, he would fail in his endeavor to make a success of the reading of \\"To the Lighthouse.\\" Furthermore, in case he became too involved in the story, he was somewhat frightened at the thought of having his attention averted from the road during a difficult traffic maneuver, thus putting himself in danger of an accident. For this reason, for both of these reasons, for all of these reasons, in fact, he decided to postpone his reading of \\"To the Lighthouse\\" until after he had passed over the mountains of South and North Carolina and had descended onto the plains of eastern Tennessee, where the road gradually wound down out of the mountains and gently stretched across nearly 400 miles of fertile farmland to the Mississippi River, and beyond. Making one last stop to say farewell to his mother, he carefully guided the car out onto the highway and began the difficult journey through the mountains.The drive was indeed difficult, and the pavement, wet because of the clouds and the wind and the rain and the generally bad weather, and the heavy traffic, and the condition of the highway, which wound slowly up the steep mountain sides and then plunged down quickly, deep into the valleys, where the road ran alongside rushing rivers swollen with newly fallen rain, impeded his progress and required that he concentrate fully on the road.On one occasion, he came upon the flashing lights of a police cruiser and an ambulance, and surreptitiously glanced at the accident and its victims as he crept by, his progress hampered by the traffic backup. Someone may have died here, he reflected, and wondered what his own fate would be if he failed to negotiate the mountain roads successfully. But no, he conceded, such a circumstance was unlikely, and he drove on. As he drove, he recalled from time to time the empty seat next to him, the seat empty of a passenger, but in which he had placed his audio book recording of \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" and anticipated in his mind the time when he would be able to listen to it and give it his full attention.Finally, after three intense hours of driving through the steep mountains in the rain and the wind and the generally bad weather, he crossed from North Carolina into Tennessee. A short time later, he stopped at the first rest stop which appeared alongside the highway. And after taking a moment to refresh himself, he was able to relax and feel the stress of driving through the mountains in bad weather begin to melt away. In a few moments, he was renewed and invigorated and climbed back into his car to continue his journey.He re-entered the highway and joined the swiftly flowing stream of traffic driving west along the Interstate. Gradually, just as he knew it would, the road left the mountains and descended onto the gently rolling plains of eastern Tennessee. With a sigh of relief, and knowing that the trip would quickly assume a familiar routine, he settled back for the long drive that would take him through Knoxville, and Nashville, and Memphis, and Little Rock, before turning south towards Shreveport, bringing him finally to his destination, Dallas.Now, he decided. Yes. Now is the time to read \\"To the Lighthouse.\\"Awkwardly, while keeping his eyes on the road, he reached over to the passenger seat, found the CD player, and clumsily hooked it up. Then, fumbling around again until he found the album that contained the audio book recording of \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" he opened it and extracted the first CD, which he placed, still somewhat awkwardly, for it is tricky to manage a CD player and drive at the same time, into the player. He punched the button on the machine, adjusted the volume, and the words floated out of the speakers and into the car.\\"'To the Lighthouse'\\" by Virginia Woolf. Disk One,\\" came the announcer's voice. Then the reader, Virginia Leishman, intoned: \\"Prologue. Chapter One.\\"He began to listen, and he listened for the next 800 miles, and, listening intently, he immersed himself in Virginia Woolf's story of the Ramsay family, their summer vacation on the Isle of Skye, and their son James' much anticipated and long delayed journey to the lighthouse.\\"Well done,\\" he thought, two days later, when it was finished. And he was pleased as he congratulated himself in his own private way, because he had listened to \\"To the Lighthouse\\" in its entirety, and found it enjoyable.Thus, he put the finishing touch on his trip, the trip that was his Christmas vacation.***A short time afterwards, only a few days, really, he reflected on his experience of reading \\"To the Lighthouse\\" as an audio book.The trick to reading Virginia Woolf, he decided, is in knowing where to break the sentences, where to pause, and where to separate the subordinate clauses, so that the sentences parse correctly. If one does this incorrectly, as often happens on first reading of the printed page, the effect can be jarring, when, for example, a noun is unfortunately connected with the wrong verb, causing the sentence to go in the wrong direction, or parts of the sentence are left dangling. If such a thing happens, and it is likely to happen often on a first reading, the only solution for the reader is to re-read the sentence until it parses correctly, and the proper meaning emerges. This makes for slow going at first, when reading printed text, but if one can get the knack of the Woolf style, and if the reader perseveres, and is willing to make the effort to do a second reading whenever necessary, the inherent beauty of the text will soon emerge.This unfortunate problem is nearly absent when one listens to the story read aloud as an audio book. On the recording, the reader, in this case Virginia Leishman, on the audio book version of \\"To the Lighthouse\\" published by Recorded Books, Inc., has of necessity, already analyzed the material, and the sentences as they are read have an ebb and flow of natural speech that is eminently satisfying. Also, the text takes on a transparent, poetic quality, as of carefully constructed blank verse, which allows the listener's imagination to free itself from the printed page, visualize in the mind's eye the situations and places described in the story, and immerse itself in the thoughts, emotions and utterances of Virginia Woolf's characters.Listing to Virginia Woolf's prose, when read aloud and properly delivered, is both soothing and exciting. Her story, with the most sketchy of plots, and carefully constructed out of the most mundane of events of daily life, the painting of a picture, sewing, shopping, a chance encounter on the road, the preparation of a meal, and the chit chat of diners sitting at table, becomes both engaging and exciting to the listener, who feels himself becoming involved as part of the inner being of the various characters as they engage themselves in the shifting scene around them and react to the situations they encounter. Even if the mind occasionally wanders while the reading continues, it does not matter much, for in such cases, the listener's inner voice will merely merge into the texture of the tale, while the subconscious mind will continue listening to the words being read aloud, and quickly pull one back into the story after only a short moment.The plot of \\"To the Lighthouse\\" is a simple one.The story begins in the year 1910. The Ramsay family is on vacation from London and living in a cottage they own in Scotland, on the Isle of Skye. There are eight children in the family. Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay have also invited several guests to join them for the summer.James, Mrs. Ramsay's youngest son, who is six, asks if they can go to the lighthouse the next day. Mrs. Ramsay agrees, but Mr. Ramsay contradicts his wife and tells his son the weather will be bad. James is very disappointed.That evening there is a dinner party, and the next morning, the weather is indeed wrong for a boat trip to the lighthouse.10 years pass. Mrs. Ramsay has died of unknown causes, Andrew, the oldest son, has been killed in World War I, and Prue, the oldest daughter, has died in childbirth after a short marriage. The Ramsay cottage on the Isle of Sky falls into ruin.The year is now 1920. Mr. Ramsay decides to come back to the cottage for the summer one more time. The cottage is quickly put in order, and Mr. Ramsay arrives with James and his sister Cam and a few guests.During this stay, Mr. Ramsay decides to take James to the lighthouse. James, who is now 16, guides the boat through the billowing waves, so that the group arrives safely. \\"Well done,\\" says Mr. Ramsey to James when they arrive safely at the lighthouse, and James is secretly pleased to receive this simple declaration of praise from his demanding father. Finally, James has had his visit to the lighthouse. It is a moment of intense satisfaction for the reader."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"I must say that I was amazed when I saw that a novel such as To the Lighthouse has averaged only four out of five stars. That a classic of literature wich has proven the test of time would score only four stars, when many poorly written contemporary novels receive five, is truly an irony of our age. As I looked over the reviews, I noted that there were some that gave the novel only one star! Usually these were from individuals that had a difficult time comprehending the book and could not make a distinction between that lack of comprehension and a piece of world class literature. Although one reviewer did acknowledge that she knew this was a fine twentieth century work, she still went on to give it one star. I think that this type of written review is necessary in order to let other readers know that it will be a difficult read; however, by giving it one star, the reviewer misleads by implying that the book is not worth reading, and this might discourage others from making the effort, and perhaps getting much more out of the novel than its one-star reviewers.To the Lighthouse is worth the struggle if one is willing to put in the time. My recommendation to serious readers is to go to outside sources - either through Amazon, online resources, or the library - that will help in understanding the book. In this way a profound novel will get its due and readers will have the beautiful experience that only this book can afford."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"To the Lighthouse, by Virginia Woolf, is about the internal states of its characters: their sensations, emotions, thoughts, and motivations. Events occur in the outside world, but the real action in the book takes place in interior worlds. Woolf mostly focuses on two women: Mrs. Ramsay, who finds happiness, of a sort, in marriage and Lily Briscoe, who finds happiness, of a sort, alone.The action in the first part of the book, \\"The Window,\\" takes place during part of a day and an evening as the Ramsay family and some of their friends and acquaintances gather for a dinner.In the second part of the book, \\"Time Passes,\\" the last light is turned out, ten years pass, and, parenthetically, the reader learns of some major developments: Mrs. Ramsay and two of her children die and a family friend becomes famous. In her extended rumination on time, Woolf compares time to a wheel that thoughtlessly crushes us. \\"Time Passes\\" features some of the most beautiful writing in the book:\\"So with the lamps all put out, the moon sunk, and a thin rain drumming on the roof a downpouring of immense darkness began. Nothing, it seemed, could survive the flood, the profusion of darkness which, creeping in at keyholes and crevices, stole round window blinds, came into bedrooms, swallowed up here a jug and basin, there a bowl of red and yellow dahlias, there the sharp edges and firm bulk of a chest of drawers. ... But what after all is one night? A short space, especially when the darkness dims so soon, and so soon a bird sings, a cock crows, or a faint green quickens, like a turning leaf, in the hollow of a wave. Night, however, succeeds to night. The winter holds a pack of them in store and deals them equally, evenly, with indefatigable fingers.\\"In the last part of the book, \\"The Lighthouse,\\" a few of the characters introduced in \\"The Window\\" gather again. Several of them undertake an expedition they planned, but did not take, ten years earlier: sailing to a lighthouse far offshore. Meanwhile, Lily Briscoe paints in the garden, amateurishly. Again, the real action takes place inside the characters, and this interior action has less to do with events in the outside world than with memories and associations from past events."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Virginia Woolf (1882 - 1941) was a well known writer, critic, feminist, and publisher. This was her fifth novel.As background information, I read her first novel \\"The Voyage Out\\" published in 1915, skipped her second novel - which is considered to be a flop, Night and Day from 1919 - and then read \\"Jacob's Room,\\" her third, then went on and read \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" her fourth, and next read \\"To The Lighthouse,\\" etc. Also, I read some of Woolf's non-fiction.\\"The Voyage Out\\" is simple and straightforward work and it might remind the reader of a Jane Austen novel, but it set on a ship and then at a remote location. It is over 400 pages long, and has an Austen theme. After her second novel - which did not do very well - Woolf decided to be more risky and creative with the next book. She changed her style and approach to the novel and Woolf uses the stream of consciousness technique to bring a sense of the chaos and shortness of a young man's life around the time of World War I, Jacob's life, i.e.: from the pandemonium of Jacob's life as portrayed by Woolf through the use of the stream of the consciousness technique, we eventually have clarity in the novel. She carries this writing style on into the similarly chaotic story in the novel \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\"This is her third novel using her stream of consciousness technique and she does it in a very dramatic fashion. The story is centered on the life of Mrs. Ramsay, a beautiful woman in her early fifties, and her older husband, and their eight children, plus other guests and neighbors and domestic help all at a beach house somewhere in Scotland on a warm summer day. Her husband is an academic and a bit remote. Mrs. Ramsay is more down to earth and mostly loved and admired by all.As in the novel \\"Jacob's Room\\" the reader is left dangling as Woolf moves from character to character, giving the reader glimpses of their inner emotions. It is hard to determine what Woolf is doing and where she is going. But what she seems to be doing is celebrating a moment in a life. This is done very effectively with the stream of consciousness technique, and very dramatically as the story proceeds. The prose is brilliant and awe inspiring in some spots, and we see the genius of Woolf.To say a lot more would ruin the story for the reader, but most will appreciate the way the story unfolds, and it unfolds very dramatically after a seemingly slow and complex start. The change has an effect on the reader - or so I found. Some think that it is Woolf's finest work and it would be hard to find fault with that assessment. She takes her ideas from \\"Jacob's Room\\" and applies them to a more complicated and dramatic setting at a family get together at a beach house, and it works.This is a must read novel."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Each sentence in To the Lighthouse is so alive that, like toys at night in a haunted room, they wake up, change into strange things and go still again. The illusion is part due to its layering and weave - dense as poetry, light as air, not a word accidental. And part due to the structure of the novel, its great invisible solidity fixed under imagery and detail moving over it like transparent veils. Its parts are elemental: water, air, sunlight, seaweed - frilled strips pinned to the attic walls, or later trailing around Cam's fingers in the water when the sails fill. Part of the pleasure in reading To the Lighthouse is the revelation of its interlocking structure, how the macro-structure of the novel is reflected everywhere on the micro-scale. An example: the three sections of the novel and their pace are seen again in the trajectory of the sailboat across the bay in the final section, where the wind takes it, then dies down, then moves again.The passages describing Lily Briscoe at work on her paintings seem to reflect a kind of rapture in which Woolf must have written this novel: \\"...with all her faculties in a trance, frozen over superficially but moving underneath with extreme speed.\\" \\"It was in that moment's flight between the picture and her canvas that the demons set on her who often brought her to tears...\\" And \\"She was not inventing; she was only trying to smooth out something she had been given years ago folded up; something she had seen.\\" But some of them describe the novel itself, which has all the feel of a ghost story: \\"It was to be a thing you could ruffle with your breath; and a thing you could not dislodge with a team of horses.\\"In fact, much of the novel - like the light and dark of the lighthouse beacon, or waves crashing in and back out - works in a balanced opposition: Crowdedness and the lack of privacy juxtaposed against the condition of utter aloneness. The bond between Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay counterbalanced with their awareness of what they've cost one another. The collusion of the children, their secretiveness and wildness, but then their docility and vulnerability. Trapped thoughts that can't be told, but are then understood without saying, as the same reflection - like quantum tunneling - might wind from one point of view to the mind of a different character.In part II the sound of bombs falling in the distance is described as \\"the measured blows of hammers on felt.\\" There are lines like that, which come in so lightly, but their impact on landing is powerful: the novel itself explodes in your heart like a silent H-bomb. One example is the last line in paragraph #3 in chapter XII of part 3, which I won't give away. (And don't sneak ahead: it won't mean anything unless you've arrived there in the right order!) And this one about James, belonging as he does to the unspecified \\"great clan\\" mentioned on page one: \\"He was so pleased that he was not going to let anyone share a grain of his pleasure. His father had praised him. They must think that he was perfectly indifferent. But you've got it now, Cam thought.\\" Many of the details in To the Lighthouse you might not even notice on first read, but when you go back they surprise you. This is part of the secret of the novel's geode-like quality, where you never guess what's contained inside it until you've seen the whole thing and it opens for you, then you see it. Another Amazon reviewer was right in saying this: you have to read it twice.Although a short novel, To the Lighthouse contains so many themes: vision and seeing, nature at odds with human life, time and its nonlinear movement, community and individual isolation. It's about what Mr. Ramsay knew: how \\"...our brightest hopes are extinguished, our frail barks founder in darkness\\" and what James knew: \\"That loneliness which for both of them was the truth about things.\\" It's about things you want, and do or do not get: whether you want to go to the lighthouse, or whether you don't want to go; whether anyone will get to Sorley, the lighthouse keeper, with tobacco and newspapers, or whether he'll remain isolated out there; whether Lily will capture what she sees on her canvas; whether Paul Rayley will find Minta's lost brooch. What Mrs. Ramsay wished for was the impossible. It was guessed by Lily Briscoe: \\"Life stand still here.\\""},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Wow...simply wow. Well, the first obvious thing to do is compare this to Ulysess. It is a 'day in the life of' subjectivist steam-of-consciousness novel, like Ulysess (though much, much easier to understand...more like Joyce in &quot;A Portriait&quot; really...), but it also has Proustian elements on the nature of time and man's place in time. It's a simple story, almost too simple. A family and some friends live on the Isle of Skye in the Hebrides. That's about it. But, oh the Characters! Everylast one of them can be analyzed for hours and hours, yet none of them ever become less then believable. It's a wonderful, moving experience to read this novel. And for those of you worrying about the difficulty, don't. This isn't Finnegans Wake. Yes, you do have to pay more attention to it then say, a Daniel Steele novel, and it is by no means escapist, but it isn't anything that a slightly intelligent person couldn't figure out. And every slightly intelligent person should read this novel."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"This is my second time through this rich, multi-layered novel. I read it first as a teenager and remember being confused over it. Now, many years later, the confusion has evaporated to leave behind solid respect for the artisitic merits achieved by Woolf.I am most struck by the layers contained herein. At once, it is a psychological novel, an emotional novel (yes, a new genre, don't you think?), a gender novel, and a novel on the artistic process. Woolf probes into the inner machinations of her characters and they move and breath as real as these words etched in Cyber.Her sentences flow; they are mellifluous; turning and twisting, reaching, they snake and snap with images; they turn over within themselves and then change again. She is a creator.Difficult? Yes. Rewarding? Yes, definitely."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Woolf, the &quot;Mother of Stream of Consciousness&quot; , is at her best in To the Lighthouse. It is simply the most beautifully written novel in the English language, period. While some may feel Woolf and the Bloomsbury crowd were insufferable snobs, there's no denying her triumph here. Required reading for anyone interested in great literature."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"I feel it's only fair to say I consider Virginia Woolf to be a visionary artist who transcends genre, time, gender, and nation. As to the &quot;idea&quot; that Faulkner and Joyce employed &quot;Stream of Consciousness&quot; to better effect than V Woolf I feel entirely the opposite. In the woman's work, good old V. Woolf, we find the &quot;Stream&quot; perfected.May I recommend another Virginia Woolf book &quot;A Room of One's Own&quot; as a companion piece. &quot;To The Lighthouse&quot; champions the feminine principle in a way that many women nowadays don't seem to recognize as important and yet the mild, internal workings of a book that has most obviously been written by a woman still seems to set men's teeth on edge and the women that haven't learned to recognize themselves in print appear reluctant to look at themselves in Virginia Woolf's mirror.TTL is a book for the yin/female principle on the planet which celebrates the yang/male principle as well. It's so sad that many readers fail to grasp the importance of this synthesis. I might even venture to call Virginia Woolf a mystic, although not in the conventional way. TTL is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"When I came to the end of To The Lighthouse, I turned it over and started reading it again. Virginia Woolf's prose is breathtaking, and the story she tells is moving and profound. Woolf is not concerned with a linear plot that moves from point A to point B; rather, she is interested in the life of the mind and the (often embattled) relationships between people learning to co-exist with one another. To The Lighthouse contains the realm of human experience from childhood yearnings to marital frustrations to the horrors of war that swiftly obliterate human lives. It's a book to be savored."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Woolf's style of writing (changing between several characters' thoughts) causes difficulty for one to follow this novel on audio. The paperback proved to be easier for me."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Those who come to Virginia Woolf for the first time do not know quite what to make of her style. Most authors structure their novels in the traditional rising action, climax, falling action manner. A linear line of plot is most often the key to their works. In Woolf's novels, she eschews such straight line plotting in favor of a weirdly blended kaleidoscopic view that makes relentless use of both a stream of consciousness narrator and interior monologues. In TO THE LIGHTHOUSE, Woolf tells the tale of a married couple, the Ramsays, who lived in England just before the First World War. The Ramsays are the prototypical Victorian family replete with servants, a summer beach house, eight children, and a keen awareness of the fragility of life. What happens to them is neither earth shaking nor memorable. What happens within them is of far greater consequence. As Woolf focuses on each character, she presents a highly subjective view of the internal thought processes of that character. Each thought is like a ripple caused by a stone thrown into a still pool. Woolf allows her character to meander not only spatially (from point to point) but also chronologically. Events are described as if they were occurring within the literal present, but most often the events are from the past merging into the future. Thus, the plot ripple pool is constantly crosscutting each other with events removed from each other both in space and in time. It is no wonder, then, that readers unfamiliar with such an expanding and contracting temporal flux are confused. Woolf challenges her readers to involve themselves in a manner that requires a dedication to reading not often found in more traditionally structured novels.As one reads from section to section (there are three: The Window, Time Passes, and The Lighthouse), one becomes aware that the novel's primary symbols--the lighthouse, Lily's painting, the sea, and the internalized thought processes of Mrs. Ramsay--function in a manner that does not become clear until after one has read considerably into this admittedly puzzling work. The initial clue lies within the title of the book: &quot;To the Lighthouse.&quot; Thus, the lighthouse is seen both as a starting point in a journey (its radiating beacon of light lies close to the Ramsay's summer home) and a destination in that the youngest of the Ramsays, James, wants to go there, but it takes him ten years to do so. Lily is Lily Briscoe, a close friend of the Ramsays who seems to have difficulty painting a portrait of Mrs. Ramsay, no great surprise there since that portrait points not so much to Mrs. Ramsay as it does to an abiding life-long interest of Virginia Woolf herself: the desire to impose order and form on a universe that is inherently chaotic. It is crucial to note that Lily succeeds only at the very end of the novel when Mrs. Ramsay has long been dead, thus emphasizing the ephemeral nature of her task. Mrs. Ramsay's personality also is a barometer of Woolf's belief that the post Great War society of England would forevermore be seen as formless as Mrs. Ramsay's meandering thoughts. The first section &quot;The Window&quot; forms the bulk of the book. It is here that Woolf depicts a rather ordinary family who collectively symbolizes the inability of individuals to leave an abiding footprint on the shifting sands of time. In the second part &quot;Time Passes,&quot; time does indeed pass, ten years worth. The home of the Ramsays falls into decay that requires the re-entry of the surviving family members to invigorate it and themselves in the final section &quot;The Lighthouse.&quot; Lily's painting of the now deceased Mrs. Ramsay allows Virginia Woolf to claim even a minor victory in the ultimately losing battle against cultural entropy.I suspect that the major reason that most readers have with this book lies in their immediate recognition that they have to pay a great deal of attention to psychological free associating. As the characters' thoughts bounce off each other both temporarily and spatially, so must those of the readers, a most imposing task. But for those with persistence and an eye for the nontraditional in plotting, the effort is usually worth it."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"When I read a poem I generally have to read it several times before I can fully (hopefully) absorb its meaning. To The Lighthouse (TTL) reads like a prose poem, a text that also needs more than one reading. You read it slowly, and intently, and then reread passages. This being the case it is somewhat gratifying that the book is only 200 pages long for if it went beyond that it could become a sizable reading project.The reader becomes a spirit flitting between the minds of the novel's characters. Their thoughts become the substance of the story. The plot is minimal; the action insignificant. In fact, the most physically active participants of TTL are the sun and the wind which prowl through a decaying house in the book's mid-section. Here Ms. Woolf becomes particularly poetic in describing the effects of the elements on a house that has been abandoned for ten years.Mrs. Ramsey is a strong woman who is married to a professor who is well grounded in Victorian views about women. Her role is to serve her family, and to praise and feel sympathy for her husband. A physically attractive woman with eight children she still has ways of wielding power over people. Lily, on the other hand, is a single woman who values her independence, but doesn't seem -to me- to be achieving anything. The male characters are generally weak men who compensate by being arrogant. And it is not what these characters say that matters as much as what they think, and that is something you are privy to throughout the book.The first 100 or so pages portray a one day scene in the lives of the Ramsey's and their guests in their seaside vacation home. Around thirty pages of the book are devoted to a dinner scene in which most everyone is bored. I must admit that the boredom was convincing as I began to be suffused with the same feeling. I am sure, however, that if I read this section one more time I will view it in a different light.This stream of consciousness novel should be read by everyone interested in reading their way through the literary canon. Although it is a 1920s experiment in form it is still highly accessible to the average reader."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Virginia Woolf has been the figure we are supposed to like because she killed herself and because she was a woman. However, Jane Austen was also a woman writer: one of the best writers ever to write in English, earning her place on the same shelf adjacent to Shakespeare in the English Canon (Mary Shelley, George Eliot, all the Brontes... all these women are superb). But the uncritical admiration for Woolf is emo-worship of her persona rather than her textual output. This is martyr-worship rather than critical reading.It becomes a moral issue for some, making it a categorical imperative to love Woolf (not her books). Her \\"stream-of-consciousness technique\\" is not true to consciousness in the manner of Joyce or Faulkner. Not everybody all the time thinks depressing ennui-istic thoughts and is as bored or fatalistic. Nor is the omniscient narration effective in that it all mashes together into a cloudy, muddied whole. To the Lighthouse has all the obvious motifs. The lightouse: phallic, symbol of order, of utopia, of heaven... surrounded by the chaos of the sea, etc.. Her text exhibits more her own neuroses as an author and lacks the range of her rival Joyce who can embody as well as disembody all types of characters with great depth. Her critique of Joyce was, obviously, based on jealousy and class prejudice.Yes Woolf was a woman, she could write a great sentence, and she was a part of the \\"in-crowd\\" of the Bloomsbury Group, which is significant. Her skill as a novelist is not up to par (writing well isn't writing novels well). Woolf was a tragic persona, who came from a privileged class and perhaps felt herself both guilty and entitled. She was intelligent, but sometimes she was blatantly just trying to demonstrate Freud. At other times she was imitating Henry James. Her prose is a mimicry of James'. Of course she wasn't interested in \\"action,\\" but instead consciousness and reaction (reflection, impressionism, muddiedness of subjectivity) yet she does not succeed in this: the narrator is too narrow.My argument is that the whole of the book is metaphorically trite. Thematically it embodies the \\"Age of anxiety\\" but it is also a very self-indulgent k&uuml;nstlerroman and its agenda is too overt. Impressionism here gives way to neurotic self-indulgence, and a boring, brooding narration that is less modernist but more in-line with Henry James' earlier Victorian-inflected mode of impressionism. In this sense Woolf was a reactionary to more authentic modes of modernity, reverting back to Pater and Henry James. Of course, most of your feminist English professors won't tell you this. What they will tell you is that you are obligated to like Woolf, if you don't you are immoral, and that her writing means so much. It doesn't. It is a symptom of an intelligent woman who suffered with depression, not that of a mature novelist experimenting with the form."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"This book is not for people who need lots of explicit flash-bang style action. Or for people who think they want deep concepts, but only if they are clearly spelled out so that the reader doesn't have to work to hard. There is no sex, but there is pleanty of romance, there is no killing, but there is death (on many levels). It is a book that deals with the inner workings of the mind and Virgina Woolf gives us a glimpse into some thoughts that come from people who are honest. Perhaps the best example of this is when Mrs. Ramsey, one of the main characters, struggles inwardly with her motivations and asks herself honestly why she helps people. She comes the remarkable conclusion that she helps people so that others will look at her and think about what a wonderful person she is. That may not seem so profound, but very few of us are able to be that honest with ourselves.It is difficult to get through, so if you want a candy book go read Tom Clancy. Her points are subtle but honest. She says more about human nature in her 200 pages than any other author I've read. I wouldn't classify myself as an intellectual, but this is still one of my all time favorite books."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Slow isn't necessarily bad, but in this book it was.

The Ramsays' house a number of guests at their home in Hebrides. Mr. Tansley is a present day &quot;understudy&quot; of Mr. Ramsay who is a metaphysical philosopher who doesn't think his profession is impacting anyone. Mr. Tansley worships Mr. Ramsay because anything he says, Mr. Tansley is always backing him up no matter whose business he's intruding upon.Lily Briscoe is also a guest at the home. She is a painter who like Mr. Ramsay feels her artistic abilities are getting her nowhere in life. She admires Mrs. Ramsay and starts a portrait of her, however never finishes it. Mrs. Ramsay introduced her to William Bankes who was a friend of the family. Her plan was to get them to marry one another but it did not work out that way. She did manage to arrange one wedding which was between Paul Rayley and Minta Doyle.During the next chapter, &quot;Time Passes&quot;, World War I spreads over Europe. The Ramsay's eldest son is killed in battle. Also one of their daughters, Prue died from a birth defect. During this chapter, Mrs. Ramsay passes away suddenly. James is left in a tough situation. He has to cope with the loss of his mother, but also come to the fact that his abusive father is the only one left. Through all of this misfortune, the summer house in the Hebrides is no longer visited.Ten years pass and Mr. Ramsay decides to take James and James' sister, Cam to the lighthouse.

There's a passage in the book where Mr. Ramsey is reading, and it explains my approach to the book rather well:\\"He read...as if he were guiding something, or wheedling a large flock of sheep, or pushing his way up and up a single narrow path; and sometimes he went fast and straight, and broke his way through the bramble, and sometimes it seemed a branch struck at him, a bramble blinded him, but he was not going to let himself be beaten by that; on he went, tossing over page after page.\\"Woolf's brier patch of words is thick and convoluted, but it was completely worthwhile picking it apart in spite of the slow start."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"I loved this book.

It's a simple story, but painfully beautiful in the telling.Written entirely in stream of conciousness, Woolf takes it one-step further than most and jumps from the thoughts of one person to the next with little to no warning. This can make it difficult to follow for many, but I only lost myself once and quickly figured it out. This is a storytelling device that has always greatly appealled to me and Woolf did not disappoint.

So much has been written about the work, and the woman, one can feel the groans. But to me - with this novel, Virginia Woolf had truly created a genre that never existed before: fiction as a prose poem; or to be more specific - using the format of prose in novel parameters but elevating it to poetic heights that no other author had ever accomplished. I don't think Shakespeare could have done it - even if he had a sister. Indeed, the last five words of the novel itself sum up exactly what I am trying to say. If you have not read this book, I respectfully urge you to do so. If you have read it, please pick up a copy of this particular edition so beautifully rendered in cover art, layout and design by HBJ Modern Classics especially as a Hardcover.

Once you reach her pitch, Woolf is a joy to read."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"\\"Lighthouse\\" is a unique novel which established Virginia Woolf's reputation as a great writer. The story focuses on 2 days in the life of a large middle class family, with a middle interlude where the family's house is the major character. The setting is the family's summer home, filled with house guests. The action, however, is all internal, the chronology hazy and the events--to the extent anything really \\"happens\\" at all--rather mundane.This all made for tough going until it \\"clicked\\" around p. 50. What Woolf does is create in real time not \\"real\\" events but what is going on within--that constant stream of thoughts and emotions that remains hidden from the world. Woolf spends a long time on a simple scene of Mrs. Ramsay reading a story to her 6 year old son. In the space of a few short minutes as she reads aloud Mrs. Ramsay considers whether an engagement she has been encouraging between two of her guests will occur, feels trapped between her son's desire to go to the lighthouse and her husband's cruel squelching of the idea, worries about the bill to repair the greenhouse, and underlying all senses impending doom just beyond the horizon. Another example is Woolf's description of the interior struggle of Lily as she paints in a style that happens not to be in fashion at the time. But Woolf shows us what Lily sees in her mind--a line here, a shadow there, a form.Virginia Woolf has a reputation of being \\"hard to read\\" and I was unsuccessful in trying to persuade my book club to try \\"Lighthouse.\\" But I'm glad I plowed ahead on my own--it's a rich and complex work, and totally unlike anything I've ever read.

It's a singular work that facilitates new understanding and insight, and makes the point effectively that the drama-rama of the human mind can supercede or at least equal the drama of the world around us.The Ramsay family is the center of the story, and it is at their home in the Hebrides that the first section takes place, &quot;The Window.&quot; In fact, this section, which covers only part of a day in time, comprises 125 pages of the 209-page book. In a way similar to that of MRS. DALLOWAY, Woolf switches the perspective among the Ramsay family and some of their guests, Lily, an indepedent single woman, the Ramsay children, and Charles Tansley, a student of Mr. Ramsay, a philosopher.There are threads of the issue of femininity in the book. What do the differing ways in which Mrs. Ramsay, mother of eight and supportive wife, and Lily, single woman, painter, enact their feminity mean? How do they deal with and understand and love each other? What forces do they unleash on each other?The book deals skillfully with the perception of the passage of time, as &quot;The Window&quot; deals with that short bit, focusing, I found, the book's most amazing and engaging section on the dinner party that night. The second section, &quot;Time Passes,&quot; is merely 20 pages, but covers ten years, and the final section, &quot;The Lighthouse&quot; is one morning. There are all kinds ofreminders of the fluidity of time in the text, a skull of an animal on the wall in the children's nursery that causes them to be unable to sleep, as well as Mrs. Ramsay's glance back into the dining room at the end of the party and her realization that the success of the evening, which was somewhat hard won, is ephemeral and over, already in the past.The second section has a different view of time, almost looking at the house from nature's point of view as time ravages the house through the war when the family isn't using it. It's very meditative. Major events in the lives of the people who attended the dinner are enclosed in brackets, as side notes, for the passage of time and the entropy that ensues is the major drama here. We see the lives and deaths of the characters as small things, part of a greater cycle that winds on and on in a more eternal, less fleeting, way.What Woolf begins in the first section, she deals with more strongly in the third, I think, and that is that the validity of each person's differing perception of the others is equal. Two of the Ramsay children, James and Cam, go with their father and a fisherman and his boy to the lighthouse in the sailboat. James despises his father, while Cam sees his weaknesses and loves him for his vulnerabilities. She knows how James feels and feels drawn to protect James, too, but she knows a different father than James does.I think that was what struck me the most about the book, the way the characters' combined perceptions assemble a greater truth and understanding than each of them singly has.Woolf has a great insight and beautifully descriptive and engaging way of writing about thought as dramatic and intimate. Woolf writes about such things, the pleasure of picking up a pleasant and soothing thought so elegantly, that it doesn't seem to be writing on a page, but access to another's mind, and the part of the truth he or she holds.And overall the writing is simply stunning.In the first section, one of the characters loses a brooch on the beach, and they discuss going back to look for it the next day. By the time the book ends, the lost brooch seems so far away, in some deep and distant memory. I think this one detail is a mark of the beauty and success of the book."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Virginia Woolf wrote this book in 1927. It must have been courageous for her do so at the time as it's all stream of consciousness and she lets the reader get a glimpse inside her thought processes. The very slight plot focuses on a vacationing British family and their guests and there's a constant interior monologue about every little thing.The first part, entitled &quot;The Window&quot; is by far the largest section of the book and the reader has to plow though a complex web of the author's thoughts as she focuses on one detail after another using all her senses. True, she's a gifted writer and deeply explores the relationships between men and women, focusing mainly on Mrs. Ramsay, the matriarch of the family. It's as if everything is in the background and the only thing in the foreground is what she has in her head.The second part, entitled &quot;Time Passes&quot; is perhaps the strongest part of the book. It focuses on an empty house and its details of decay over a ten year period. It is masterfully done.The third part, entitled &quot;The Lighthouse&quot; is about the remaining members of the family, who come back to the house in order to take a trip to the lighthouse which has been postponed for ten years. It's all very symbolic and the reader is left to draw his or her own conclusions about the meaning of it all.This is the only Virginia Woolf book I've ever read and although I can appreciate the skill of the author, I'm not interested in reading any more of her works and can recommend this book only for fans of hers as well as those with a curiosity about her writing."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"I thought that this book was incredibly well written, but while i thought that it was well done, and it was certainly reflective of the time in which it was supposed to represent, I thought that it was very difficult to understand. I found myself re-reading passages over and over again, just to get the meaning that Woolf was trying to convey. I thought that the author was trying to express a stoic look at the snobbishness of the Victorian era. While Mrs. Ramsay is the guiding light in the entire book, I thought that she was also the one that really made it difficult to understand. I also thought that Mrs. Ramsay was the one that referred to the lighthouse the most. I recognized the lighthouse as a symbol for the goals that everyone that was vacationing there had, but also for everyone that was visiting the Ramsays. Also, reflective of the era, is the way that Mrs. Ramsay looked at love. She liked the concept of being in love, but she didnt nessacarily love who she was married to. Or rather, she did, but she chose to question it. I am still not sure what the whole deal is with the Ramsay adults. The Ramsay children, however, are the idealistic symbols for the future--they symbolize the promise of what is possible to come for the family and the rest of the world.They thought taht the lighthouse was the answer to all of their problems--and in reality, it was the creator of most of them. And, of course, while the Ramsays were a huge part of the story, Lily Briscoe and Charles Tansley were the two characters that epitomized the entire theme of the novel. They are the abstract, just like Lily's paintings, and they are the ones that really understand the world and what is going on. They are the ones that will still survive when the society that everyone knows crumbles to the ground. All in all, I thought that this novel was well written, but I thought that Woolf could have explained things a little better."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"To The Lighthouse was an ambitious, brave experiment in literature, a bold venture into stream-of-consciousness techniques and profound themes relating to the fundamental differences between the sexes. It deserves to be recognized as an important contribution to 20th century fiction. Alas, that does not mean that it deserves to be read. It was far too tedious, and relied to a great extent on style and literary technique to drive it forward. And while I rarely go searching for \\"an easy read,\\" nor do I seek out plot-driven novels, this book was simply too far towards the opposite extremes to be enjoyable.The most highly regarded of Virginia Woolf's many books, To The Lighthouse focuses on the Ramseys, a British family in the 1910s and their interactions with family friends at their vacation home in Scotland. I wish I could say more about the plot, but frankly, not much happens. Oh, sorry, they keep talking about sailing out to the Lighthouse (and eventually they do, even). But this book is not about plot. It is about the emotional and philosophical ruminations of Woolf's characters, none of whom is particularly sympathetic or engrossing. Woolf juxtaposes the rational, abrasive Mr. Ramsay with the pleasant, introspective Mrs. Ramsay in an attempt to make profound statements about the differences between men and women. Woven into this central issue are the themes of love and art. Perhaps this book was revolutionary when it was first written, but can it appropriately be considered timeless? Given its limited appeal to even the most avid, intelligent readers of today, I think the answer is 'no.'"},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Stylistically midway between her more traditionally structured novels like The Voyage Out, and experimental, modernist works like The Waves, To the Lighthouse melds elements of both experiment and tradition, making a balanced, well-organized, richly textured novel. Woolf is very adept at re-creating the passage of time in bold, unexpected ways. The brilliant middle interlude in this novel, Time Passes, is perhaps a case study in this. The reader is treated to an omniscient overview of the weathering of the Ramsay House. All this takes place under the watchful light of the Lighthouse of the title, sending out its beam to a world which is destroying itself only to be reconstituted as something wholly different, completely other. In Woolf's body of work To the Light House captures the very best of her prose skills and conceptual genius in one novel."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"The Freudian take regarding To the Lighthouse has been almost beaten to death. I think that anyone who focuses too much on the phallic symbolism of the Lighthouse itself in this work does so to their own detriment. Why? Because To the Lighthouse could perhaps be Virginia Woolf's most finely crafted work.If one were to look too deeply into the symbolism they may miss the beautifully painted character portrait of Mrs. Ramsey as the stolid maternal who really holds the family, household, and social interactions of her husband together while he goes about dreaming and philosophizing, only to have to pick the pieces up later when she dies and he is left alone.To the Lighthouse is filled with wonderful and memorable characters. Not just Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey, but also Lila Briscoe the aritst, and Minta Doyle the carefree young almost self absorbed girl in a woman's body. Then there is Mr. Carmichael who appears kind of an old wizened sage who remains somewhat aloof but finally finds success as a poet at the end of the novel. There's Tansley the anti-social atheist intellectual who may still have a softer side somewhere beneath his cold exterior...the list goes on and on...and by now I'm probably rambling, but anyway, To the Lighthouse is Virgina's Woolf best and everyone who reads it should be able to find something they can appreciate about it."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"absolutely stunning literature, i've read some great books, by some great authors (nabokov, proust, fitzgerald, hemingway, dickens, faulkner, dreiser, thoreau, joyce) and this is definetly a standout among the pack. it definetly deserves its place in the canon and a place on your &quot;read books rack&quot; if you are any kind of serious literati or academic. It probes deeply human and profound topics; man's relation to nature and time, the meaning of life, gender issues, relationships. And most of all it is absolutly beautiful prose. the second section, time passes, is probably the most beautiful literature i have ever had the pleasure of. pick this one up!"},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Woolf has a canny ability to explore the secret hidden motives and interior monologues of all her characters, but in this book she chooses some pretty unnoteworthy subjects. I'm not sorry that I read this book, but I really wouldn't recommend it. Though it does have its share of beautiful and insightful passages, mostly it just rambles."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"This book came highly recommended from someone who shares the same affinity for the stream-of-consciousness style of writing as myself. However, I found that this book suffered from a lot of repetition and evantually that monotony just got under my skin.This book does have great moments but these are countered by the dull ones."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"There is only so much introspection and symbolism one can stand. Technically, interesting especially the treatment of passing time in the middle section (and the juxtaposition of its reality vs. perception), but these folks are more boring than my family. When something like this hits a 'Top 100' list, I just scratch my head."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"If you haven't read it already, well...shame on you! There is no way to describe in my measly little words what Woolf accomplished with TTLH. She was a writer of mind-boggling skill and imagination, and this novel is a tremendous stylistic triumph on her part. True, it can be difficult book for some and tends to fly right over the head of many readers (hence, I might suggest, the &quot;boring&quot; reactions) But, if you want a REAL book, one that engages both emotion and intellect, one that will keep your head spinning with the beauty and exactingness of its ideas, this book is for you. A truly incredible accomplishment."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Look, I hated this book. I hated reading it. I hate all stream of consciousness writing, or very nearly all. I hate what little I have read of Joyce, I hate most of what Faulkner I have read, and I find Proust nearly as unreadable.This work is the only work by Virginia Woolf I have ever read. It took me nearly forever to finish it. Reading it's long, winding, meandering sentences was like walking through molasses.Thank goodness I have finally, FINALLY finished it.I hope to never ever read anything else by Virginia Woolf.And I mean that.Keep her stuff away from me.It just does not interest me at all....Having said all that, I must hasten to add, however, that I do recognize this novel, this ability to string together random thoughts and make some semblance of sense out of them, to be a work of clear genius. It must've taken her a staggering amount of work, amount of thought. The woman clearly had a wealth of intellect and talent. Just keep anything else by her away from me, because it doesn't interest me in the slightest, this detailed, ultra-remonstrated British upper-crust mindset stuff."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"So, To The Lighthouse. It's a brilliant book, really. There are points when you're reading this book where you can step back and look at a paragraph or a passage or a chapter and say: THAT'S how a good book should be written, that's how brilliant authors do their thing.Which is why I feel guilty that I hated this book so much. It was a scant 200 pages, and it took me MONTHS to read; I hated all the characters, hated the writing style, hated everything about the book, which is weird because I completely recognize just how good of a book it was. It makes me shudder a little bit to think back on it. If I were forced to reread this book, I actually might start chewing on my wrists.So there it is. It's a great book, sure, but at the same time, it was horrible. Can't say I'd recommend it to anyone. Wish that weren't the case, but it is."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"I highly recommend the Oxford World's Classics edition of this deeply poignant book, which I think is one of the crowning achievements of 20th-century art. David Bradshaw, the scholar who edited this version, writes by far the best introductions I've ever read, and this one is wonderful. It's beautifully written and so compelling that I couldn't put it down. I can't imagine a better source of illumination: not only does it provide crucial historical and cultural context for understanding Woolf but it also directs reader attention to textual details that might otherwise be missed, especially in a first reading. You definitely owe it to yourself (and Woolf) to take care to order the right edition."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"this book is a classic and should be read by all. That being said, it's not particularly easy to read, but it's magical none the less."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"The annotation version is confusing, when I really only wanted the book itself on my Kindle, at first it appeared the book wasn't there, but it was but was under three different titles, so at least I got to reread it. The book is very good, I read it in college, but I just wanted to reread it again, for fun. The annotations were long and boring, not what I wanted, just to get to read the To The Lighthouse again. I skipped over most of the annotations."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"I bought this book for my partner, who was always referring to it. He couldn't find his book and thought he lost it when he moved 11 years go. I was on Amazon, saw this book, and thought it would be a nice surprise. When given the book, he was flabbergasted, saying \\"You found it! You found it!\\" Seems it was the exact same version he had purchased years ago, by the same publishing company.... go figure!Thanks to Amazon again, for having just what I need."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"As is so often true, I found that this novel was very autobiographical. The Woolf family spent every summer at the same rented house in Cornwall, looking out on Porthminster Bay. Woolf wrote in her diary that these stays at the summer house were some of the happiest times in her life and the novel was written to commemorate that. Like in the novel, there actually was a trip out to a lighthouse that Virginia's youngest brother was not permitted to go on, much to his dismay.The novel is not only a portrait of Woolf's mother, but also her father. Woolf's mother was a great beauty who actually was a model for the artists of her day. Like in the novel, she was loving, caring, authentic and direct, but she was spread too thin. Everyone in the family wanted more from her. Through two marriages, she had given birth to seven children, with Virginia being the youngest girl. Her second husband and Virginia's father, Stephen, was a very self involved and needy person. In her diaries, Virginia describes him as needing constantly to be soothed and attended to. If he did not receive the solace he believed he deserved, he would fly into a violent rage. In addition to these duties, Virginia's mother was something of a nurse and was often asked to care for dying family members in their final days. She did this quite well, but her frequent absences enraged her husband.Virginia's mother died when Virginia was thirteen. I think the cause of death was something like scarlet fever, but exhaustion was also listed. Her death marked a turning point in the life of Virginia. Virginia's half sister then attempted to step into her mother's shoes and try to run the household and also soothe the easily disrupted ego of the father. This proved to be quite a taxing task and sadly, this half sister then died two years later.When Virgina was 17, her father then appointed one of Virginia's half brothers, George, to escort her to parties and present her to society. It is so tragic to read that this half brother then began to sexually abuse Virginia. He was 30 years old and in a position of guardian for her. It is believed by scholars that George was also abusing Virginia's sister Vanessa. In her diaries, Virginia attributes her mental breakdowns to the sexual abuse she suffered. Two years later Virginia's father dies. Virginia, her sister and the two youngest brothers take this opportunity to sever contacts with the abusive half brother.In one of her diaries, Woolf wrote that from the ages of 13-44 she had been obsessed by thoughts of both of her parents. Woolf describes it as an unhealthy, debilitating obsession. In writing To The Lighthouse, Woolf wrote that she was able to give voice to some long held and deeply felt emotions about her parents. She said that by writing about it, she was thereby able to release these things and get on with her life. She said she had always before that point been a skeptic of psychoanalytic treatment, but after this experience, she saw the value in it. Vanessa Bell, Virginia's sister wrote that reading the novel was like seeing her mother \\"raised from the dead\\".It is now believed by scholars that Woolf suffered from bipolar disorder. In conceiving To The Lighthouse, Woolf said she went for a walk in Tavistock Square and the whole novel came to her in a big rush, and she instantly had all the images and feelings of it. During the writing, Woolf would be in the manic phase of the disorder, but she could feel the imaginative effort of it pushing her equilibrium to the breaking point. Once she finished a first draft of a novel, the depression would then descend upon her. The creative process and pursuing her art took a huge toll on the life of Virginia Woolf, but we are fortunate to have her many masterpieces of literature."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"I first read this great modern classic thirty years ago and I have to tell you, having just re-read it, that its as fresh as ever. Rich, complex, subtle and deeply moving - what more could anyone want from a book?"},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Virginia Woolf broke ground in To the Lighthouse, keeping the narrative of the story in the strong subjective. People reach out to each other in the book with internal expression of sensitive feelings, observations, perceptions so that knowledge of the characters grows for the reader through others' thoughts. There is not the usual spoken onversation or direct action as a character is revealed. Nonetheless, the characters are drawn beautifully and come alive for the reader. This book is a treasure."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"I don't like modernism as a general rule, my modernist class this year is trying to change that, but unless you're Conrad, you don't really stand much chance.However, there are passages in the novel which are truly stunning, especially in the third portion of the book. Woolf has a wonderful way with words about her. The thing about the book that clung to me the most is the idea of identity.Identity is what other people label our souls.Mrs. Ramsay, for instance, is labeled: wife, mother, hostess, daughter. None of these are labels which she has given herself. When she is in those moments of alone she faces this blackness which is really what we are without the identity which others have given us.I liked this one and if you are looking for a slower read (really emphasize \\"slower\\") which has some pretty deep currents this one will work perfectly."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"A seafaring beam casts a sliver of light through my curtains piercing the gloom and illuminating a volume on my bookshelf. As I look to see the title the light moves on leaving me in darkness. I sit musing in the murk and the sliver of light returns. I move quickly before the beam moves on and I glimpse the title of the book. It is To the Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf. Seeing this I am instantly transported to the Scottish isle of Skye to the vacation home of the Ramsay's and friends. Young James Ramsay wants to visit the lighthouse near their home on the morrow but the weather looks to be inclement so the trip doubtful. Thus begins the novel as Woolf with pitch perfect prose begins to describe interior and exterior life on the Isle of Skye. Mr. Ramsay and Mrs. Ramsay take completely different approaches to life: he relies on his reason, while she depends on her emotions. They share the knowledge that the world around them is transient. Mr. Ramsay's overly rational approach makes him inconsiderate of other people at times and he suffers from knowing his work in philosophy may not long outlast himself. Mrs. Ramsay deals with the transient nature of life by trying to make every moment beautiful and memorable. This elegiac novel is divided into three sections The Window, Time Passes, and The Lighthouse. The middle section Time Passes has some of the most sublime evocative descriptive prose I have read: \\"Night, however, succeeds to night. The winter holds a pack of them in store and deals them equally, they darken. Some of them hold aloft clear planets, plates of brightness.\\" - \\"while the sun so striped and barred the rooms and filled them with yellow haze that Mrs McNab, when she broke in and lurched about, dusting, sweeping, looked like a tropical fish oaring its way through sun-lanced waters.\\" - \\"Now and again some glass tinkled in the cupboard as if a giant voice had shrieked so loud in its agony that tumblers stood inside a cupboard vibrated too.\\" There is a boar's head skull tacked up on the wall of the children's room that serves as symbol in the novel of the ephemeral nature of life. Mrs Ramsay is an antithesis to this symbol as she tries to nourish life and beauty and make moments last by seeing them in utter stillness even saying at one point \\"Life stand still here.\\" Meanwhile the lighthouse beams light from it's great cyclopean eye over their lives on the Isle of Skye seeing beauty and it's passing with the same pale indifference."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"I have now read or listened (via audio tape) to this book five times. Each time, I have enjoyed it more, and have been enabled to look deeper into it.What I like most about this book are the interior dialogues that all the major characters - Mrs. Ramsey, Charles Ramsey, James Ramsey, Lily Briscoe, etc. - engage in. We learn about their thoughts, their reveries, their likes and dislikes, their fears and worries, their hopes, etc.In presenting these dialogues, each of these characters moves closer to all of us readers than would ever be possible if all we had were their external actions.Indeed, the external actions, which fall into two days separated by 10 years, while themselves totally engaging, become the vehicle for the even more engaging internal \\"events\\" which \\"deliver\\" all the major characters so satisfyingly.What can one say except that I join the chorus of those who believe that this might be the best modern novel ever written."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Since To the Lighthouse is the best book of the century, I thought it would be a spell-binding book, but after I read it, I found the book to be extremely pretentious."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"The February 19, 2001 issue of Time magazine's trend alert section asks actor Ed Harris what some of his favorite things are.

I first encountered this style reading James Joyce's \\"A Portrait of and Artist as a Young Man,\\" and later was amazed to see it perfected by William Faulkner in \\"The Sound and the Fury\\" I have to admit, this style of writing was starting to grow on me......that is until I read Woolfe's version of stream of conscious in \\"To the Lighthouse\\" which in my opinion is a failure of epic proportions. What makes it an even greater failure is the fact that some people consider this one of the greatest books ever written. To speak the honest truth, I can't remember I time when I have not enjoyed reading a book, as much as I didn't enjoy reading this one.According to \\"expert\\" analysis, To the Lighthouse is supposed to use a mixture of symbolism in random thinking to show a portrait of characters that are searching for the meaning of life. The actual Lighthouse is a different symbol to each individual character. To the Lighthouse is also supposedly a dead on accurate view of gender roles and differences between men and women, and every character represents a different piece of this gender puzzle. I have read what the \\"experts\\" say, but I will let you be the judge.The novel does have an original way of telling its story. It drifts from character to character without ever telling us when, and lets us know the thoughts they are thinking. These vague thoughts tell a story as they are strung along. I wish I could explain the plot, but there really isn't one. The story opens at the Ramsey's vacation home where we learn mainly about Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey, and their assortment of guests. Guests like the painter, Lily, and the sexist Charles, and the dignified Mr. Banks. The first half of the story brings us in and out of their minds. Your mind will wander more than the writing style as you desperately try to grasp what the hell is going on, and wondering if anybody really thinks like this in real life. The thoughts of these characters are borderline absurd, and the most amazing aspect of all is that by the end of the novel I didn't know a single thing more about these characters than I did when it started. All I know is the nonsense, abstract thoughts they think. I don't know a thing about their beliefs or character.The only one I felt I knew a thing about was Mr. Ramsey. He wants others praise, and his son James wants to kill him. What else? Lily likes to paint....and Mrs. Ramsey likes to go to the market. Oh, and at the end of the story Mr. Ramsey finally takes his son to the lighthouse, which never happened in part one. Oh, we also learn that a few of the Ramsey's have died, in the \\"Time passes\\" sequence. Not that we care, we didn't know any of them anyway. Is this review helpful to you? Does it make sense? Probably not, but neither does a word of this novel.This is without a doubt, the worst classic I have ever read. Even with all the explanations. I really want to meet the person who got something out of this mess and try to understand why in the world anyone would think it was great. I don't get it. I love stream of conscious books, but this one is a failure on a colossal scale.If you like books about nothing, characters that are lifeless, books without plot, which are all about style and have no substance, than I think this might be the book for you. I wish I could tell you more of what it was about, but it really isn't about anything. I can picture a conversation I might have later in life about this novel and I think it might go something like this:\\"So, did you ever read that book called To the Lighthouse?\\"\\"I think so, I can't really recall.\\" (Myself)\\"What was it about?\\"\\"You know, I don't really know, I don't think it was about anything really.\\" (Myself)It has been a day, and already these words ring true. This book will be forgotten faster than my dinner I am eating at the moment is digested.Grade: D+"},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Virginia Woolf's novel \\"To the Lighthouse\\" is about the inner psyche of the Ramsay family and friends as they progress over a ten year period. It is written in an stream-of-consciousness style except for an interlude between the two major time periods. I did not find this book very interesting. Although there is a lot of prose on the pages, I found that in the end I knew very little about the major characters. This book just wasn't worth the read for me.For those of you who don't like \\"spoilers\\" (there is one shocker at the end of the first time period), don't read the introduction by Eudora Welty found in this version. It reads like a book report and essentially summarizes the entire plot."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"This has no footnotes, so if you are after anything but the bare-bones, then look on.

But I should also make clear that I very much like Virginia's Woolf's essays, books like \\"A Room of One Own,\\" \\"Three Guineas,\\" and her other non-fiction."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"I know I shouldn't judge an author based on only one of her novels, no matter how boring it may be. If I were to recommend reading this novel, it would be only to someone like myself who is just trying to get a feel for why a &quot;classic&quot; is called a &quot;classic&quot; and then try another book by the same author. I am not too sure that this novel gives the author justice. And so, if you were to read this novel, and you are like me, and were not really sure what to make of it, I would recommend reading another of the author's novels in addition to this one. I will be reading Mrs. Dalloway to see if there really is something about Virginia Woolf worth noting. This book, however, was sorta interesting, but nothing to get excited about.. why is it a classic? I have really no idea."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Written nearly one hundred years ago, this book is more distant from today's reader than the great Lighthouse may have been to the inhabitant's of Woolf's village island.Centering on a large and dysfunctionally polite family, the book has three very different parts: first when the majority of the family is still young; second when certain life-changing events occur to members of the that family; and last a trek to the Lighthouse by a few members of the family - a trek which was the subject of disdain and scorn between father and son in the first part.Written with an almost ADHD style - where comments of the events are interwoven with the thoughts of characters, and at times the two interwoven with dialogue -- the book shifts and turns and rocks, much like the sailboats of the island's denizens. This makes the book unique, and I warn readers that it also makes the reading more difficult.This is deemed a classic - but it is not a classic for the story, but rather for the prose and narrative form. You read this to honor the writer, not to honor the story created by the writer.If you wish to read a great writer's greatest novel, try this. If you like this, follow withMrs. Dalloway. And, if you like each, read Cunningham'sThe Hours, which seeks to honor Woolf as a writer by copying much of her style while incorporating much of her life with her stories."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"This is not a book for everyone. It wasn't meant for me, and it is not one that I'll ever re-visit, but I can acknowledge that it is a minor classic.Much like the far superior Under the Volcano, this book focuses on how the thing is said, and not the thing itself. The plot is spare and banal, and what little action there is is tangential: what matters to Woolf is the inner psychology, the interpersonal dynamics, the thoughts, perceptions, emotions and feelings.The book has a calamitous exordium, populated with clunkers such as this:\\"Then, up behind the great black rock, almost every evening spurted irregularly, so that one had to watch for it and it was a delight when it came, a fountain of white water, and then, while one waited for that, one watched, on the pale semicircular beach, wave after wave shedding again and again smoothly, a film of mother of pearl.\\"But, gradually, the lyricism and prose pick up, and become almost sublime in many parts. Woolf does not have much to say, but she says it very beautifully, once she's found her sea-legs.To the Lighthouse is very overrated at #15 on the MLA 100...it should be ranked far beneath All the King's Men, Appointment in Samarra, and the incredibly brilliant Pale Fire. (Most English professors would doubtless disagree.) That said, it does deserve a spot on the list, and is not an aesthetically devoid waste of time like Wide Sargasso Sea."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"I and many friends tried to read the &quot;classic&quot; To the Lighthouse it is slow and monotonious."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"The book is a set of excerpts from private remembrances while at the Ramsays family beach house. The remembrances centre round Mrs Ramsay both while she is alive as well as after her death. There is s strong sense of melancholy about human transience set against the impassiveness of the house itself - and the lighthouse.Just as the book begins to envelope me within the small world of the Ramsays, the self-conscious cleverness disturbs the engagement. My mind receeds from the Ramsays and instead sees Virginia Woolf sitting and thinking of some phrase for readers more impressed by cleverness than simple sincerity.Nevertheless, I enjoyed the book for this cleverness of language, as well as the many short sections where I was transported, iluminated, impressed and intrigued."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"I have no complaints about the story only the product \\"Kindle Edition of To The Lighthouse.\\"The \\"table of contents\\" link in the \\"Go to\\" menu is disabled though there is a table of contents just before Ch1.I tried to solve this issue by bookmarking the beginning of each chapter.

At first, this makes for a very difficult read if you're not used to this stream of consciousness style (and I was not), but by the end of the book, you may wish every novel was written in this form. I have encountered few books that have so well invited me into the minds of its characters. Truly a journey to \\"the self,\\" the spotlight of consciousness."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Virginia Woolf's \\"To The Lighthouse\\" can be a difficult read, with its highly stylized stream-of-consciousness prose, but it is a rewarding one in the end, even if it seems that nothing much has happened over the course of the novel. Despite taking place within a set period of time, from 1910-1920, the conflicts and themes presented transcend far beyond the scope of the novel. \\"To The Lighthouse\\" is a unique standard bearer for early modern literature.To say that \\"To The Lighthouse\\" is a tale about the Ramsay family would be selling the book short. While this family and their experiences are the core of the novel, Woolf delves into some heavy examination of the roles that males and females are meant to play in society. Mrs. Ramsay is beloved by all for her extraordinary beauty, still evident in her fifties, but she is tied down by a demanding husband, eight very different children, and her own need to oversee every facet of people's lives. Mr. Ramsay, a selfish philosopher, depends upon his wife to build his ego, no matter the expense or the damage caused to his children. This examination of their lives takes place at their summer home on the Isle of Skye in Scotland with their various guests. Woolf begins by painting a loving and generous portrait of the Ramsays (modeled upon her own parents) before moving the action of the novel ten years into the future after the family has experienced a few catastrophes that they struggle to get over. The novel ends with the perspective of the outsiders, trying to make sense of what has been lost and what it means to life as a whole.Virgina Woolf was an exceptionally talented writer, able to make mundane details vivid and able to capture the intricacies of family life and marriage without seeming sentimental. Her prose is poetic, following tangential thoughts to complete her circuitous paragraphs. Woolf allows her readers insight into not only one family, but into situations that concern everyone; mortality, love, family, and one's legacy. \\"To The Lighthouse\\" is a wonderful testament to Woolf's legacy as one of the premier authors of modern literature."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"The idea of Virginia Woolf's fiction being read aloud effectively has struck me as an impossibility. The very interiority of Woolf's style seemed to suggest that readers hear the narrative voice within themselves. This reading proves me dead wrong. Virginia Leishman's reading--and interpretation--added much to my passion for a novel I have always loved. Readers--and listeners--new to Virigina Woolf need to be able to listen for long stretches of time in order to follow the stream of consciousness that propels the story. This commitment will be amply rewarded.I am glad I purchased this. I will listen to it many, many times."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"When I first started to read this book, I said oh no another stream of conciousness novel. I have plowed through James Joyce and William Faulkner in the past and felt like I was taking part in a laboratory experiment. But Lighthouse was very different. Only a great writer can make me take interest in a boring story, or care about characters in their day-to-day life. Excellent book, the description of the run-down house really hit me."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"My issue is not with Virginia Woolf -- it is with publisher, Classic House Books. Among this book's many problems:- It's riddled with typographical errors and plain old spelling mistakes (\\"furtile\\"???)- No section/chapter breaks (as in the much, much better Penguin edition) -- which, given the denseness of Woolf's writing, actively impairs reading comprehension- It's terribly designed: Random words in all caps (\\"BOEUF EN DAUBE\\"), awful typography: en dashes (-) rendered as double hyphens (--), dumb quotes (inch marks) instead of proper \\"educated\\" or \\"curly\\" quotation marks. I can't bring myself to look at the text closely, but it appears to be at least partially set in Times New Roman.- Cheap paper stock- Awful cover design and amateurish description on the back cover (\\"beautifully produced by Classic House Books\\" - Ha!)Don't waste your time with this edition and encourage the proliferation of such sloppy hack jobs. Look for the Penguin edition, which is professionally put together, and features both an enlightening introduction and helpful end notes. Shame on you, Classic House Books!"},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Virginia Woolf was a true literary genius, with a gift for capturing the emotional lives of her characters that isn't often seen in modern writing. That said, To the Lighthouse is one of her more difficult works; it follows the character's internal lives in a very Joyce-ian way, and like all true stream of consciousness writing, can be hard to fully comprehend. But the depth of feeling she manages to encapsulate with her deft turn of phrase is remarkable, and well worth reading. I don't recommend this novel for those who have never read Woolf before. Start with Mrs. Dalloway, and when you read To the Lighthouse later, you'll appreciate it more."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"I really enjoyed this one. Read the dinner table scene and you'll see why Woolf was admired for her fluid, realistic and breath-taking style. She makes everyone in the cast have internal dialogues while they're also talking out loud. Purely brilliant stuff. A great read, the language will jump into you and won't let go. It's like a poem within a poem within a poem..."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"I'm a senior in high school, and when I picked up To the Lighthouse for my summer reading this summer, I had no idea how much it would inspire me and change my perspective on life and writing. The book is not concerned with plot, but more with symbolism and human emotions and truths about life and the role of women in 20th century English society.For someone who had never encountered Modernist writing style, I found Woolf's stream of consciousness wrting style extremely refreshing. It switches between characters' thoughts and the story so fluently that although it is occasionally confusing, overall, it makes the book more of a cohesive whole.Of course, I can't deny that I used Sparknotes to fully understand the book. But that was because I had to comment on symbolism in my reading log, and some of Woolf's symbolism is hard to understand. However, you don't need to use Sparknotes to understand this book. I understood everything without them but still used them because I love this book so much that I wanted to know everything about it! (And I have never felt that way about summer reading before.)This book was really fascinating and was an interesting insight into the social heirarchy of the 20th century and the roles of women in that society. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about Lily Briscoe and Mrs. Ramsay, and I think that their struggles are those that any woman can relate to. Overall, I would say that To the Lighthouse is a masterpiece and is a must-read for any woman, especially women writers. I know that it has changed my perspective on being a woman writer and has inspired me to consider pursuing writing as a career."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Take my word for it--if you've not read Virginia Woolf before--you need to be in the mood to read her. I think her books can be unbearable otherwise. However, I was in the mood for &quot;To the Lighthouse,&quot; and I thought it was terrific.I've been much more intrigued by Virginia Woolf after Michael Cunningham's &quot;The Hours,&quot; (and the subsequent film) brought her back into the limelight. She was fascinated with the degree to which everyday, seemingly trivial details of life can seem to be matters upon which the state of the world hinge in the lives of those experiencing them. Therefore, in Virginia Woolf's world, the decision as to whether or not a vacationing family will visit a lighthouse on the following day becomes the focus of everyone's thoughts--to a little boy, it seems as if his world will end if he doesn't get to go; to the father, his ability to determine whether or not they will go gives him a sense of power and authority over his wife and children.And at the center of all this non-drama is Mrs. Ramsay, wife and mother, who is the foundation upon which the family is built. Woolf is expert in communicating the influence Mrs. Ramsay has on those around her. Everyone is struck by her beauty, her bearing, her very existence. It's this quality in her that makes so many wives and mothers the center of their respective families, which gives &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; a sort of universality that resonated very strongly with me.There has been a lot of literary study on the psychology of the novel (especially Freudian), which has become somewhat less interesting as Freud has become commonplace. I would instead appreciate it for the utter mastery of language exhibited by Woolf, and the insights she has into male/female relationships.&quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; is one of those books that left me feeling incredibly sad in a very satisfied way, and I can't even tell you why. I don't always enjoy such ethereal writing (I don't even enjoy other books by Woolf) but in this case I enjoyed every word."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"When I first began to read To The Lighthouse it seemed dull and monotonous but as I kept reading, I began to see how wrong my first impression was. She writes with a beautifully rhythmic pattern that entralls the reader and made me love the book. The book is centered around her characters' private introspections that I both agreed with and learned from. She pulls you into an entirely different world that you simply do not want to leave. I intend to re-read this book over and over again to better absorb its beauty, passion, and wisdom. Read this book! But keep an open mind for it takes patience to fall into this masterpiece that Woolf created."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"if you do you'll miss out on an incredible and poetic book. The genre of this book is stream of consciousness, which, when first reading, is very hard to focus on. Basically, stream of consciousness is writing as if one is reading a person's thoughts. Every thought, as disjointed as it may seem, is thrown in. I found it very confusing in the beginning and wanted to throw the book against the wall. I, however, ignored my inner feelings of frustration and kept reading. To my surprise I fell in love with this book. Woolf's analogies are not only beautifully exact and poetic, but in my opinion, pure genius. Without ever being a mother herself, she captured a mothers fears, various feelings, and love for her children. She also, quite eloquently and precisely, somehow manages to describe &quot;the dance&quot; known as marriage. The ebbs and flows of relationships, the frailty of life....it's all in this amazing piece of literature. Read it, don't give up on it, and you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Virginia Woolf writes using a stream of consciousness, which provides for an interesting read as she explores the psychological effects of same events on different characters and permits the reader to study the characters in the novel to a greater extent. She doesn't speak from the first-person point of view of each character, but uses the third-person instead, so that all characters, no matter what age, have similar intellectual capacity as it appears. You'll need to devote a great deal of attention to the novel; it is hardly a light book, and you would probably only enjoy it to the full extent if you like this type of writing. Personally, Woolf's style is not one that I prefer, and I had a hard time getting into the novel. I also think that I would enjoy it far better the second time around: I often re-read books and find many things that I had failed to notice the first time. If you've never read any of her works previously, it is a pretty good novel to begin with to determine whether this style is to your liking."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"If you are looking for an audio recording of Virginia Woolf's complete book, be cautious here. Neither the Amazon site nor the sellers necessarily tell you whether you are getting an abridged or unabridged version. I ordered what turned out to be an abridged version. The seller took it back, but without telling me I would end up paying the shipping both ways (which exceeded the price of the item) -- all for an error that was theirs, not mine. Neither Amazon nor the seller get any points for this kind of abuse of customers."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"Virginia Woolf's &quot;To The Lighthouse&quot; (pub. 1927) has some similarities to her previous work, &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; (pub. 1925). The latter covers just one day in the life of Mrs. Dalloway; in the former, the first 127 pages of 209 pages cover just one day in the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay. A dinner party at the end of the day has an important place in both of the novels as well as in the lives of Mrs. Dalloway and Mrs. Ramsay. Aside from those similarities, the overwhelming one is the stream of consciousness writing style that Woolf adopted in &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; and carried over into &quot;To the Lighthouse.&quot; I can't remember the applicable quote but the sense of it is &quot;There are certainly a lot of words there.&quot; Words fall on words as grains of sand in an hourglass fall on to the pile of sand at the bottom of the glass - words, words, words, etc. Impressions that might well have been only momentary feelings of a character are turned into paragraphs and even pages of words.That isn't all bad. If you like the sounds that words make (some of the passages really should be read aloud) or if you like the images that can be invoked, there are some enchanting passages in &quot;To the Lighthouse.&quot; At times, however, there seems to be just endless words - I had to force myself not to resort to skimming in order to get the story being told. Looking for the story is, to some degree, pointless because Woolf shows no interest in a definite beginning or ending - she ends the work without ending the story. Perhaps one should say that in this work it really is the journey and not the starting and ending points that is the reason for reading. At times, Woolf's words have a certain madness about them. Some say her own madness affected her writing, some say not. I tend to agree with the former - she herself indicated a certain fondness for the imagery which came to her during her &quot;mad&quot; periods. Even though she did not write during those periods, she may well have stored away images to evoke later in her writing just as one can store away vivid images received in dreams.Woolf succeeds in making her characters live in this book, perhaps because Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay are closely modeled on her own parents. One has to remember, though, that they are seen through the eyes of an impressionable daughter and that they died before Woolf developed an adult relationship with them - she was only 13 when her mother died and just 22 when her father died. Perhaps the ambivalent reactions of the character, Lily, in the story mirror Woolf's own impressions of her parents. Her characters have no constant viewpoint, just as real people grow cold and warm on different issues and on their relationships with other people in their lives. They can both detest and love some other person in the course of a day or even in the course of an hour or a minute, having both lovable and irksome, even maddening characteristics. One of the most interesting &quot;characters&quot; in the story is the house which they rent for each summer. The house is on a beach and has all the problems and frailties of beach houses of the early 1900's. The Woolfs were of the British intelligentsia and, although certainly not wealthy, could afford to have a cook and servants. One might think Woolf would ignore the presence of these menials, as is often the case for such writers, but she doesn't and her treatment of them adds some depth to the story of the house and the times.The most appealing character, to me, is Mrs. Ramsay. She is a compulsive caretaker who guards her husband's and children's tender feelings from hurt. Something like a female Don Quixote, she is a guardian of the lonely and shy, even when they don't want a guardian. Like most of the people who knew her, I came to have an affection for Mrs. Ramsay.If you like history and science writing and have not developed a fondness for writing such as that of Jane Austen, you may not have the patience to enjoy this work. If you do like Austen and/or if you like poetry, you may very well enjoy reading &quot;To the Lighthouse.&quot; Even better might be the audio version - just close your eyes and listen to the sound pictures as Woolf flits about the room."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"There's one point in the novel in which one of the characters reflects on the form of perceiving others. Looking at people from a distance, she thinks that this way of identifying and following others through their outlines is one workable approach. It can be taken, as I believe it's meant to be, as an analogy for the whole form of the book. In a way it's a book of intensely realized, complex, three dimensional characters each of whom encounters the other as if the outsider were a two dimensional sketch, lacking real substance. More than direct conflict, this aspect of the perception renders a deep insubstantiality in the social ties that people build, and the deep distance that they build more effectively. The isolation doesn't emerge just from self-absorption, rather it's a sense of lacking the language or real community for authentic relation. In this amazingly writen account that manifests not in the major dramatic disconnect we might expect but in quiet, subdued points of systemic, often unnoticed, rupture.It's a beautiful, heartfelt and deeply sophisticated novel. Says a lot about class, gender, family and the way such conditions shifted into the first world war, all in under two hundred pages. Deservedly classic, and indicates that Woolf applied a comparable level of talent to her fiction as to her essays."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"To the Lighthouse is a dazzling work of art that illustrates with great clarity the dynamic nature of human thought and perception. \\"How can an artist do that?\\", one might reasonably ask. Well,if that artist is Virginia Woolf, the answer is, \\"With unmistakeable genius\\". While Woolf's influence is seen everywhere in works of literature that would follow, one must keep in mind that the literary technique employed for most of the novel, stream of consciousness, was still very radical and experimental at the time it was written. Woolf's portrait of the thoughts that pass through the minds of family members and their houseguests at the seaside and her harnessing and transformation of the essence of time and into words is nothing short of awe-inspiring. That she also manages to tell a story and develop rich characters that the reader cares about while painting these portraits of thought and time is utterly amazing. Then, there are her words which connect it all; beautiful words that flow like the sea and color like a paintbrush. It is no accident that one of the main characters, Lily, is a painter, who with her strokes of the brush intermingling with her thoughts, tells this story.Although considered a modernist, as was James Joyce (who also employed stream of consciousness in his works), I found this novel more accessible than Ulysses. It was as if Woolf wanted to create a work that would touch as many people as possible, while Joyce had developed a private code that only a select few could crack. While (trying) to read Ulysses I felt intimidated, left behind; while immersed in To the Lighthouse, I felt invited and included. For a taste of modernist literature at it's most inviting and poetic, I recommend To the Lighthouse!"},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"This book is considered one of the greatetst books ever written, and a little background information is required to understand why.Woolf was one of the first Modernists in literature. The focus of her novels heads heavily on internal character development, growth and strife. These internal thoughts form he basis of the plot, no great adventures, no murder mysteries, the psyche of the hman mind takes center stage in \\"To the Lighthouse\\".Her characters take on real human emotions, James who stays a victim of the Oedipal Complex (of which came out only shortly before this novel), and most notably, the internal workings of a victorian-woman's mind.The strains of love are pushed as it's darker side is explored, no dreamy music, no immediate happily-ever-after, but the beauty with which Woolf captures the Ramsey's love would ring deep with most long-married couples.To the Lighthouse is a difficult read, and time must be taken to contemplate what is being read, but if care is given, the novel emerges as a beautiful testament to the internal worlings of the human psyche, a beautiful piece of work with a subdued, but very present sense of familiarity."},{"Title":"To the Lighthouse","review":"To The Lighthouse (and Woolf in general) is probably not going to be satisfying for a reader looking for a page-turning, pulse-pounding escape from sleep. For those interested in literary history, or more particularly, the emergence of Modernism, this book is a great place to start.The prose is lyrical, provocative, but dense. You might take a look at the plot summary on Sparknotes to check your interest level. Do you enjoy long depictions of dinner parties and inner monologue? If not, I would skip this. If you're not sure, the first chapter will either pull you right in or kick you right out.To The Lighthouse is not easy. I found it impossible to concentrate on it with any background noise, hunger...or anything else on my mind. If you decide to try it, give yourself a chance to enjoy it. Don't skim, don't read for less than 30 minutes at a time, and try to read every day until you're done.

He's a fully realized character with poetry and passion in his wounded soul.

It sears that experience onto a permanent sense of reflection seeking understanding which, we learn, is attainable this side of death. Deft time switching from the novel's \\"present,\\" 1914, back to a sickly boy's consideration of early Civil War 1862 and to his actual participation in the Chicamauga to Atlanta events of 1864. All this in the context of a 50-year survivor's ultimate chore--understanding it. Loss of loved ones on multiple levels, all genuine and honest. Objectivity and distance as a survival strategy, represented by Charlie's sharpshooting. This is in some ways a novel of \\"Compensation\\" (with a clever nod to Mr. Emerson). Not a line of drudgery. Though not comic, written with appropriate humor. The horror does not titillate. Nor does the romance in this anti-romance reflective of the 50 years of post Civil War American literary realism. In the end, it is not about the South, however: Charlie could have been from Goshen, Indiana, or a town in Michigan, just as well.This novel is its own screenplay. It has more to say and show than Cold Mountain and more about the soldier and the town in the war than Killer Angels even pretends to offer.Buy it. Read it. It is a modern story well told."},{"Title":"A Distant Flame","review":"While young Charlie Merrill can hit a target 2,000 yards away with a Whitlock rifle, he is an unlikely soldier. We see him before the war as a frail, sickly teenager who is well-schooled in poetry and classical literature, living in one of the many North Georgia towns that is not altogether convinced in the wisdom of secession, much less war. We see Charlie Merrill in 1914 as his home town prepares to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the battle of Atlanta, thinking back on the loss and the sacrifice and the love that tied them together. And those of us who have walked the old works of Kennesaw Mountain where hikers now commune with a quiet wood and families spread out blankets and picnics on the warm grass of summer afternoons, see Charlie Merrill in in the contrasting bloody hell of 1864 rendered here in graphic detail.

It is a well-deserved honor, for A Distant Flame stands very near the top of the 80,000 books published about the civil war."},{"Title":"A Distant Flame","review":"A literary Civil War novel that alternates between Charlie Merrill's grim existence as a sharpshooter in the Army of Tennessee, his sickly but love-touched boyhood and his old age.I have very mixed feelings about this novel and I note from the other blurbs and reviews it's gotten that my opinion is a somewhat contrarian one.I certainly have no issue with the research, which appears to have been painstaking. I found, though, that my engagement with the story wavered many times as I read. I honestly can't decide if this is a significant literary work told in a poetic style or if it's essentially sentimental in its themes and given to purple prose in its execution. I had trouble with the narrative's total humorlessness, with the saintly profundity of every character, with the endless repetition of variants on \\"Slavery was wrong.\\" Yeah, obviously slavery was wrong. Every modern reader, hopefully, realizes that. But I'm not really convinced that the nineteenth-century Georgian character Charlie Merrill would realistically feel so unequivocally about it, and, as ever, the statement would have worked better shown than told. The race relations shown in the novel are all actually idyllic.And along those same lines, I'm tired of reading about Confederate characters who don't believe in what they're fighting for. I think sophisticated modern readers can deal with protagonists who are fighting for a variety of reasons, some of which we do not consider today to be good. Merrill's lack of commitment to any aspect of his cause (whether resisting invasion or states' rights or his comrades, except for his single companion Duncan, or slavery) actually makes his battlefield actions more, not less, morally questionable for me. It severely undermines the quality of moral spokesmanship that I think the novel is trying to give him.I was more moved by the failed-romance aspect of the story than I was by the war aspect, which is unusual for me.I think this would probably appeal to readers who enjoyed books like Cold Mountain more than to readers who enjoy, say, David Poyer's Civil War novels. As for its overall quality, I'm just not sure."},{"Title":"A Distant Flame","review":"This work is fundamentally different from most historical novels of the Civil War.

This presents a varied chronological sequence (and commensurate changing perspective) as viewed through the long lens of fifty years.Without revealing too much detail, this story is told from pre-war, late-war, and long post-war perspectives of a Confederate soldier. Charles Frazier's \\"Cold Mountain\\" most aptly delved into long-sought hopes and dreams postponed, a theme that defined the life of many Confederate soldiers throughout and during the closing days of the War. Without taking anything from Mr. Frazier's book, \\"A Distant Flame\\" travels one step further. This work allows the final chapter to be written as it relates to an old Confederate soldier's life. It focuses on his struggles to find meaning in not only the events that surrounded his participation in the War, but also, with regard to a lifetime of hopes and the weight of disappointments relating to family and friends lost, and of love unwillingly deferred. From the perspective of this reader, in the end it tells a tale of hope and redemption.I highly recommend this work. It is a well written, high caliber book [appropriate to that most effective for a sharpshooter]. It is hoped that the author (Philip Lee Williams) will have much more in store for us fortunate readers in the future."},{"Title":"A Distant Flame","review":"I actually go to the University of Georgia where Phil Williams is faculty at and have attended many of his readings which are very interesting and entertaining. I am afraid that I am not as good at critiquing books as the following reveiws, however I just wanted to make sure everyone knew what a wonderful author Phil Williams truly is. The research that was put into this book, he told one group it took 10 years of research and writing for A Distant Flame. What a passionate writer!"},{"Title":"A Distant Flame","review":"A Distant Flame is one of the very best novels of The War, in my opinion. I have so many unread excellent war histories - hundreds - in my collection, that I normally can't spare the time for fiction, but seeing the recommendation of R.K. Krick, I took a chance, and I'm glad I did. (Krick is a real expert and author on The War.) A lot of history is learned in the book.The setting is Northwest Georgia in 1864, with Joe Johnston's army of around 60,000 Confederates facing \\"Cump\\" Sherman's army, twice as large and headed south. Charlie Merrill is a southern teenager, under General Pat Cleburne.Charlie is not really furious with the invaders he is fighting, so his assignment as an excellent sniper sits heavy on his conscience and wears away his resolve, eventually bringing his effectiveness to an end. He and his comrades become sympathetic to the reader, and you appreciate the terrain and battles of Sherman's campaign from Resaca, Georgia, to Atlanta. Even the love affair is sweet, if incomplete."},{"Title":"A Distant Flame","review":"The front of this book says it is, \\"A Superb Book\\" It does not lie. It further states this book should be considered \\"A Classic of Civil War fiction.\\" It is that. It ranks right up there with \\"The Black Flower\\" by Howard Bahr and Cold Mountain,\\" by Charles Frazier. A love story set amidst the ravages of war, it is a masterpiece of emotional reading. for the Civil War buff, a must read, for everyone else, an excellent book to spend some time with. A Hallmark card of 300 pages. Get yourself something to drink and set yourself down in a nice, comfortable chair."},{"Title":"A Distant Flame","review":"Philip Lee Williams' poignant Civil War novel about the beginning of the 1864 Atlanta campaign is a classic. Charlie Merrill, the central character, is everyman. He is the essence of THE Confederate soldier late in the Civil War when defeat was known to be inevitable yet duty, honor, and country demands to soldier on. Mr. Williams portrayal of the battles are historically accurate and well done, yet he uses his poetic license to examine the psyche of the common confederate soldier in the total context of those horrific times. Sad yes, but oh so glorious in a spiritual sort of way. The horrors that young Merrill sees and experiences are all too graphic yet he continues on wrapped in the friendship of his comrades.The story is really a 3 part examination of Charlie Merrill's life during those difficult days. Mr. Williams artfully weaves the younger Merrill's life with the horrendous fighting of the 1864 Atlanta campaign, and his older life 50 years later when he is to give a keynote address to his hometown about the Fall of Civil War Atlanta. Charlie Merrill is a complex character that is slowly developed by Mr. Williams. Charlie is everyman of those chaotic times. He loves, cries, grows, and eventually understands the meaning of it all. Times change but memories endure.Overall an amazing book. Outstanding character development in all respects. The complex relationships between Charlie and others in the book are well developed and although sad represent the circle of life in all its profoundness.No gratuitous sex, language, or violence. The battle scenes are well done and not too graphic but necessary to the story.Highly recommended, especially to those interested in the Civil War. A superb novel that anyone would enjoy. Good job Mr. Williams."},{"Title":"A Distant Flame","review":"Not my favorite book....I have been a student of the War Between the States for many years and while this book was OK, it was not my favorite"},{"Title":"A Distant Flame","review":"The other reviews are very accurate.

Emma tells of her father, a well-known actor, David Wheaton, whose life is oftentimes compared to the other famous David ~~ King David of the Biblical times. David Wheaton has as many if not less wives and 11 children. Emma narrates the stories as the one child who has always remained close to her father. It is also a wonderful and encompassing story about love and forgiveness as David nears the end of his life.Emma's husband struggles with writing a play for David Wheaton ~~ he would have played the great Hebrew king ~~ and interspersed throughout the narration are the stories of David's wives. Despite what some critics have said about this book, it is a rich read. I don't mind reading about Biblical times ~~ in fact, I love it. I find it fascinating. And L'Engle does a wonderful job giving King David's wives a voice throughout the ages and in a way the reader can understand. And reading about David Wheaton's wives, Emma's grandparents who have provided her with a heritage of rich spiritual lives, and the acceptance of life and death at the end.It is a book I highly recommend for daughters who enjoy a close relationship with their fathers ~~ as it does explore a man's regrets that he didn't live a better life for his children or make the time for them ~~ but Emma forgives him anyways because that is who he is.If you have a few days to spare, pick this book up. Go off into a quiet place and read it. You will fall in love with the lyrical writing style if not with the characters. It is definitely one of my top 100 favorite books to read. It's well worth the time reading."},{"Title":"Certain Women -","review":"_Certain Women_ and _A Severed Wasp_ are two of Ms. L'Engle's adult fiction books that capture the lives of born-artistic, talented souls... whether they are musicians, actors, writers, artists, etc. It helps me to understand that, even though I have some musical talent (more, perhaps than many), I do not have a musician's soul, because I do not have that hunger to create... to pursue this gift to its utmost. Ms. L'Engle's writing is wonderfully clear and descriptive... even the most horrific scenes were deftly, simply written, capturing the moment without yielding to the sordid. Also amazing is the retelling of the King David story, but from the women's point of view; I learned more about King David in this book than I *ever* learned in Sunday School!"},{"Title":"Certain Women -","review":"This book is as interesting as MLE's &quot;Wrinkle in Time&quot; series, only for adults. The book's unvarnished story of the life of David Wheaton, dying actor, told through the eyes of Emma, his actress daughter, kept me absorbed from beginning to end. It was for me, a great introduction to the larger body of the author's work. If read from the perspective of MLE as a writer of Christian non-fiction, it is an even better work of fiction. She acknowleges the world as it is, but treats her characters, with all of their flaws, gently."},{"Title":"Certain Women -","review":"C. S. Lewis and Tolkien would have loved to argue over this book. I will start by saying that I believe L'Engle to be the greatest female author of the 20th century in any language. That said, this is her worst book. So why am I reviewing it? I put the lack of quality in the writing...or more accurately in the plot...to the immense pressure put on L'Engle by the Spiritual/Christian community. This is not unlike what writers such as Anne Rice and Annie Lamott are facing these days. Once people discover that you share some of their belief system, they want to claim the rest of your writing as their own. So where do Lewis and Tolkien come into this? Lewis felt that a spiritual writer should be open about their beliefs in composing fiction. Tolkien felt that all beliefs should be underpinnings and never completely emerge into the story or affect the plot. They should always be able to be traced, but never delineated. I suspect that this book by L'Engle was her homage to the people who had heard she believed in God and wanted her to \\"out\\" herself. If you read the entire oeuvre of her work, you'll see her beliefs everywhere"},{"Title":"Certain Women -","review":"The author Madeleine L'Engle is probably most familiar to readers for her acclaimed Time Quartet of science fiction books for children, including the Newbery award-winning A Wrinkle in Time. However, if you haven't picked up a L'Engle novel since you had your braces removed, you're missing out. Her books for adults, including 1992's Certain Women, contain the same lyrical prose and incisive characterization, combined with mature spiritual sensitivity, and have the same ability to transport the reader into her imagined world.In this case, that world isn't a far-off planet, but the insular sphere of a dying man and his wives, children and friends. While L'Engle delves into this extended family's rich, tragic and messy history, she also sheds new light on another complex man and his \\"messy\\" family, this one familiar to readers of the Old Testament.The aging actor David Wheaton, spending his last days on his beloved boat the Portia with his ninth wife and Emma, his grown daughter, wishes to gather his far-flung family, including his five surviving children and a couple of his former wives, before he takes his final curtain call. While those on the Portia wait for the others' arrival, David and Emma discuss the one stage role he always coveted and never got to play: the Biblical King David. The parallels between the two Davids' lives and families are striking, and in some instances the Biblical story hits painfully close to home for Emma and her father.As Anita Diamant did in The Red Tent, in Certain Women L'Engle imagines the lives and personalities of characters barely mentioned in Scriptural accounts. Through Emma and David's discussions, as well as in the pages of an unfinished play based on King David's story, the children and especially the wives of the king spring vividly to life.The title is an allusion to Luke 24:22, \\"Certain women made us astonished,\\" and the insights L'Engle provides both into the fictional Wheaton family and the David saga are at times astonishing indeed. What is perhaps more astonishing are L'Engle's observations on the nature of sin, redemption, and the way God often chooses faulty, flawed and complicated human beings to do His greatest work. As L'Engle's characters put it, King David saw himself as an ordinary man who had sinned, and that's when he truly began to love God. Perhaps, they suggest, we have to sin, to know ourselves human, before there is any possibility of greatness.I recommend Certain Women for its compelling family drama as well as for its thought-provoking discussions of spirituality and the human condition, but don't be surprised if these faulty, flawed and astonishing characters--both Davids and their loved ones--linger in your mind for years afterward. They certainly have in mine."},{"Title":"Certain Women -","review":"if i had to choose my least favorite madeleine l'engle book, certain women would merit that title. neither the plot nor the characters connect with the reader the same way in which most of ms. l'engle's books have the power to do. nor does the book move the reader to any deeper questionings as her other books often do. if you're like me and want to read any madeleine l'engle you can get your hands on, this book, of course, will not be a waste of your time. however, i suggest that others become more familiar with some of ms l'engle's other and, in my opinion, better work before reading certain women."},{"Title":"Certain Women -","review":"Madeleine L'Engle was a remarkably gifted writer, having written novels for both adults and children that explored serious issues with intelligence and fearlessness. \\"Certain Women\\" is one of her novels for adults, and it is full of L'Engle's trademark ponderings on love and faith, and how our actions shape our existence. While it can be tedious at parts, it is overall a rich and fulfilling story.Emma Wheaton is a successful and talented stage actress, who inherited her acting skills from her father, the great actor David Wheaton. In the last summer of his life, Emma has taken time off from her career to be with him as he tries to make ammends with his past offenses and pass peacefully from this life. For David Wheaton was a vastly complicated man, who married and divorced ofen, spawning a brood of children as varied as they are talented. One of David's main regrets is that he never got to perform as the biblical King David upon the stage in a play that was never finished by Emma's husband. As father and daughter spend their summer together, they reread and rehash the play and the past, the father finally coming to understanding and forgiveness, and Emma finally coming to terms with the direction her life must take.At times, L'Engle seems to stretch too much to make the stories of the two Davids intersect, and sections of the novel that focus on the unfinished play can be a trifle tedious. However, when the similarities work between the two stories, they unfold and intertwine flawlessly and effortlessly. Although the novel is set between th 1930s and the 1960s, one of the beauties of L'Engle's prose is a sense of timelessness. The trials of the Wheaton clan are real and still exist in the world today. As always, the questions that are raised about love and faith apply to all time, especially the questions regarding warfare, whether it be biblical or WWII or the present day. \\"Certain Women\\" is a richly rewarding read and a true testament to the artistry that Madeleine L'Engle wove every time her pen touched paper."},{"Title":"Certain Women -","review":"The structure of this book, built on the parallellism of King David's and David Wheaton's lives is fascinating, as is David Wheaton himself. The central character Emma, and her husband Nick are complex but seem to be missing some pinch of salt."},{"Title":"Certain Women -","review":"In her novel, Certain Women, internationally acclaimed author Madeleine L'Engle masterfully blends the historical account of Israel's King David and his wives with the fictional account of retired actor David Wheaton and his wives. Although David Wheaton's acting dream to play the role of King David in his son-in-law's play is unfulfilled, his life has, in many painfully real ways, imitated that of the giant-slaying David. Both are conquerors, heroes, celebrities, victims of passion, sorrowing fathers, tender lovers, penitent wanderers, inspirational symbols, unfaithful spouses, and pitiably vulnerable humans. As the shepherd of a uniquely extended family, David Wheaton's pivotal role in forcing the interaction of his loves and their children culminates in the weeks preceding his death, particularly as his closest child, Emma, faces the reality of the man her father is and his impact on her and others he has loved. This book clearly defines for the reader the shaping influences in our lives"},{"Title":"Certain Women -","review":"A while back I set a goal to read Madeleine L'Engle's entire body of work. I intend to keep at that goal, but am so glad I didn't get to know L'Engle first through this novel, Certain Women. I liked the protagonist, Emma, well enough. She had the typical similarities to all of Ms. L'Engle's female leads -- intelligent, introverted, compassionate, slightly traumatized, artistic, introspective, and a little bit lonely. Really seems like each one is just a re-interpretation of Madeleine's own self and own life.Unlike some of L'Engle's other tight-knit fictional families, though, Emma Wheaton's family is highly dysfunctional. Her father, David, an American actor who has lived for 87 years -- modelling unhappy marriages, capricious affection toward his children and other selfish tendencies. Also unlike other plotlines, this novel includes more familial conflict than in others of her novels, more real-life trauma than I've read yet. And some of it rings true.What got me sidetracked was the complexity of all the names and relationships between the main character and her father's many wives and children (with the various wives). It kind of reminded me of when I was a little girl and dreamed of one day having twenty children mostly because I wanted desperately to name all twenty of the children and give them twenty horses so I could name all their horses. And then name their children and their children's horses, and so on. L'Engle tried to tell a story that paralleled the biblical King David and his dysfunctional household, but I couldn't ever quite climb into the narrative because I was too buy trying to keep track of who was who and whether or not I really cared.No worries: I still heart Madeleine. I just won't probably remember much from this story."},{"Title":"Certain Women -","review":"This was a beautiful, life-affirming tale centered around the days a daughter spends with her dying father, remembering the past and the missteps of their large family, but ultimately reconciling with mature realization to accept imperfection and embrace the hope and quest for joy and love. The father is a renowned and charismatic actor, and the daughter is one of his very many children by very many wives. The parallels to the live of King David -- the unplayed role at the center of an unfinished play -- are effective and provide a meaningful structure for the narrative and the characters' insights. The writing is gentle and soft, a bit anachronistic for an era of sharper insights and cynicism, but it makes for a comforting, pleasant and uplifting reading experience."},{"Title":"Certain Women -","review":"I'm not sure it counts as quality literature, and the editing could have been a little better. I actually noticed a couple of places where the wrong name was used. Maybe this was corrected in later editions. Nevertheless, this was an enjoyable read for me, and actually tossed up some new ideas for me about God and the evolution of his role in ancient Israel. The thing is, I appreciate the book for this, but I don't think that's what it was really meant to be about, and it certainly isn't the whole point of the novel. As a result, for the average reader, who probably won't appreciate the ideas in the same way I did, \\"Certain Women\\" would probably not be as enjoying or rewarding to read. It is heartwarming, to a certain extent, and touching in its way, but there's not really anything particularly new or revelatory about the story itself."},{"Title":"Certain Women -","review":"Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of L'Engle's adult fiction, but I was bored to tears by this book. The plot was interesting on a purely intellecual level, and I give her credit for coming up with something orginal, but to me it read more like a study of the many wives of King David than a novel that I could relate to in any way. I felt nothing for any of the characters, and ended up having to put the book down due to extreme apathy. Perhaps there was some kind of epiphany the was waiting for me in the last half of the book, but I wouldn't bet on it. Her two novels about the life of the young woman whose mother was a famous musician were excellent, if you haven't read any of L'Engle's older ficiton I would start there."},{"Title":"Mosby's 2000 Nursing Drug Cards","review":"As a nursing student required to purchase this set, I found the cards much easier than writing out med cards by hand.

Conciliation Commission for Palestine, 1949; and as Chairman, U.S. Advisory Commission on Information, 1948-50.As Dear Abby noted upon hearing of his death in 1981, Mark Ethridge was one of the first journalists to speak out boldly against racism in the deep South. In a full page article, The New York Times toasted his career and the legacy he created as a journalist and diplomat.This book, which I read several times some years ago is witty and full of incisive (and sometimes very funny) observations. Imagine a lighter prosed Jane Austen writing in the State of Georgia in the 1940s and 1950s.Willie Snow Ethridge (1900-1983, born in Georgia, lived in N.C. and Kentucky), the author of this book and Mark Ethridge's wife, authored fifteen books, including several popular novels, primarily in the 1940s and 1950s.Mark F.

In this case it's the Iron Cross; a German award that is possibly the most recognizable medal in the world (along with the Purple Heart and, perhaps, the Medal of Honor).Gordon Williamson has gone into great detail in researching the history and legacy of the Iron Cross. He relates well the history of the award, from it's inception in 1813, through 'the glory years' of 1914 and 1939. Included in the book are many pictures of awards and awardees along with information dealing with detecting fakes, and the traditons of the awarding of the Iron Cross.Although the book is not large at 5.5&quot; by 9&quot; and 176 pages it includes many clear (b&amp;w) pictures and a wealth of information that any militaria collector cannot do without.Those who have any interest in militaria, German military history, medals and ribbons or uniforms will be happy to aquire this book and the information contained within.Mr. Williamson, through the publication of this book, is recognized as one who has made the collecting of militaria in general, and Third Reich militaria in specific, a respectable, enjoyable and rewarding endeavor."},{"Title":"The Iron Cross: A History, 1813-1957","review":"A great book that tells the story of German Soldiers and Sailors who achieved the Iron Cross from the Napoleonic Era through the end of WWII and the forming of West Germany. The author did an excellent job of explaining the lives of these heroes of battle and how they earned the Iron Cross (Germany's Medal of Honor). From Von Buehler to Otto Skorzney all of the recipients had to face battle and overcome overwhelming odds.

The first two books for the first two albums (Sevendust, and Home) were incredibly accurate and had awesome transcriptions. Animosity does not live up to the standard unfortunately. One interesting thing to note is that the &quot;Sevendust&quot; and &quot;Home&quot; books were published by Cherry Lane/Hal Leonard, and Animosity was suddenly published by Warner Bros. I don't know how much experience you all have with tab books, but I own quite a few, and I have to say regrettably that overall, MOST Warner Bros' books are mediocre at best, as far as accuracy in the transcriptions go. I say most, b/c not all their books are bad... some are just as good as CL/HL's books. Let's just say I'm hoping that the book for Sevendust's latest album Seasons, gets published by Cherry Lane!Here's a breakdown by song to qualify my review:T.O.A.B - Stated tuning is correct. The verses for this song are hard, if not impossible to transcribe, so I give him (Danny Begelman, the transcriber) credit there. Overall, this song is ok.Praise - tuning is correct, but the transcription is missing a few obvious guitar parts.Trust - Correct tuning. The Chorus is HORRIBLY transcribed for this one. Seems like he was taking a stab in the dark for it on this one.Crucified - This one is a HUGE problem for me. There is so much missing in the Chorus on this one that I don't know where to start.Xmas Day - Another debacle. To give credit where it's due, he did his best on this one, but the tuning of this song is so unorthodox that it's hard to transcribe. This transcription is probably the least accurate of the whole book, unfortunately.Dead Set - This one is mostly accurate. He did a good job on this one.Shine - Here he claims the song is &quot;written in concert key.&quot; Does he even know what that means?!? The tuning here is simply WRONG. Since the tuning is screwed up, the entire transcription is too. This was a big disappointment, as this is probably my favorite song on the album.Follow - This has ALOT going on in the chorus and I have to give Mr. Begelman credit for nearly nailing all the guitar parts, but there are still several inaccuracies here.Damaged - Good transcription (not hard to pick up on your own though, either).Live Again - Probably the most accurate transcription in the book.Beautiful - Good job for the most part (thank god someone figured out the alternate tuning to prove that NATURAL HARMONICS are being played at the beginning, NOT high-positioned notes (sorry, I've just seen so many horiffic transcriptions of this online!!!), but the chorus is missing an essential guitar part.Redefine - Good transcription.Angel's Son - Good transcription (but he had help on this one!!! Sorry, not to sound negative here!)That's it from me. I would recommend that if you want a general guideline for their songs, this book is an ok purchase. If you're looking for a portal into the amazing artistry and creativity of Sevendust through extremely accurate transcriptions, pass this one by.Finally, whoever the reviewer from WA is... wow, I think the other guy already did justice by calling you an idiot."},{"Title":"Sevendust Animosity Authentic Guitar Tab Edition","review":"I haven't seen this book, but I thought I would help those who are being challenged by the tunings. If you are using standard gauge strings such as 9s or 10s you will be very discouraged. Sevendust uses a much heavier gauge, 15-60. Hope this helps!"},{"Title":"Sevendust Animosity Authentic Guitar Tab Edition","review":"First off, to respond to the reader from WA, you can't write a bad review for a book because you're not familiar with their tunings, well you can but it makes you look like an idiot. The strings are tuned down for the low, crunchy sound; and they are not floppy if you strum them the right way. Also, if you're just starting out, eventhough i know all you fans love and wanna play like Sevendust, their solos and progression are just too advanced for beginners, so you do need some guitar knowledge. Otherwise, this guitar book is like any other: musical notes, tabs underneath, lyrics placed for you, and all the notations. Best tracks: Shine, X-Mas Day, and Angel's Son."},{"Title":"Sevendust Animosity Authentic Guitar Tab Edition","review":"Great tab book easy to understand.Awesome to learn the riffs from my favorite band!This book is worth it if you wanna learn the whole album note for note."},{"Title":"Sevendust Animosity Authentic Guitar Tab Edition","review":"I bought this book after buying the cd Animosity. I have liked Sevendust's music a lot, and I wanted to learn how to play it. First off, there are no chord examples in the book, so one must have an adequate knowledge of guitar chords, which I lack. But beyond that, the worst aspect of this book is the horrible tuning Sevendust uses. For example, in a song, the tuning is explained as \\"guitars tuned 2 steps down from drop D tuning\\" This way, the first and sixth strings are tuned down three whole steps. Tuning this way 1)is a pain ...2)makes the strings loose and floppy. Another bad point of this book is that the music is incomplete, and the transcription is not matching the recording when played in standard tuning... or something. Anyway, this book is not good for someone who just wants to play the music and not do all the work."},{"Title":"Slate: A Daniel Valentine & Clarisse Lovelace Mystery (Alyson Classics Library)","review":"I first read these books back when they were first published, and still pick up extra copies whenever I chance upon them in used bookstores.

These books hold up well as nostalgia for the fun-loving days pre-HIV and play on the party-town atmosphere of Providence Town. Fun summer reading!"},{"Title":"Slate: A Daniel Valentine & Clarisse Lovelace Mystery (Alyson Classics Library)","review":"This is book three in the Clarisse Lovelace/Daniel Valentine series of mysteries set in Boston and environs, and it is easily the least of the bunch.Alydne (actually two writers under pseudonym) just coasts with this breezy story of the murder of a vituperative gossip columnist, featuring a cast of characters that includes a woman so entranced with American geography she makes sandwiches in the shapes of all fifty states and a pair of arguing, TV wrestling-obsessed lesbian lovers. As usual Clarisse steals the show from everyone else. She is funny and bitchy but in a very entertaining way, and in SLATE she settles in firmly in her ambition to be an attorney. Daniel is a bit more fleshed out in this third novel and he's given some very funny lines, but he still remains something of a shadow next to the fiery Clarisse.For my money COBALT is the best entry in the Aldyne cycle. It is a farce nearly epic in hilarity and wackiness, while at the same time delivering the goods as a mystery. SLATE is just a mildy amusing interlude, a practice pitch for the last book, CANARY."},{"Title":"Slate: A Daniel Valentine & Clarisse Lovelace Mystery (Alyson Classics Library)","review":"Things have changed for Valentine and Lovelace. She's stopped selling real estate and is going to law school. Valentine has decided to open his own bar called Slate with Lovelace as a co-owner. Evil Sweeney Drysdale II, a gossip columnist, is threatening to close Slate before it opens--but he's killed and the corpse is left on Lovelace's bed! Who did it? As in the previous books there are many suspects and they all have motives.This is the least of the series (meaning it's just very good and not excellent) and the shortest (188 pages). Also Lovelace's dog Veronica Lake is gone and never mentioned again. Having them open a bar was a good idea but the band of supporting characters this time around is sort of bland. Mr. Fred and America are one note jokes and Julia and Susie are two VERY annoying lesbian lovers. Only Linc Hamilton, Ashes and Apologetic Joe are any fun. Also the plot is confusing and needelessly convoluted and there's a sequence at a wrestling match which is totally out of place and not even remotely funny. It's still worth reading though with some classic bits--Ashes personal ad and Clarisse's description of the Eagle bar are uproarious! So it's worth reading--it's just not as good as the previous two."},{"Title":"The Gila, river of the Southwest (A Bison book)","review":"This book is fasinating. Follows the Gila River from New Mexico to the Colorado River. Tells a great story about Mexico, Arizona and New Mexico.

Those looking for a high-level security book will not really benefit from this title.The authors writing style is quite readable, especially about such a subject that can be quite dry at times. The book is not as deep and theoretical as Schneier'sApplied Cryptography' (and is also much shorter), but is clearly written to be much more practical.The book is made for those that have somewhat of a background in security and cryptography. The newbie will likely be overwhelmed with a lot of the concepts and implementation issues.Overall, Network Security: Private Communication in a Public World is an excellent reference and text for anyone needing to come up to speed in infosec. It is concise, to the point and very readable."},{"Title":"Network Security : Private Communication in a Public World (Prentice Hall Series in Computer Networking and Distributed Ser.)","review":"I had to use this book when I was in Graduate school and this was the course book. I still have the first edition and looking to purchase the latest version. It was very interesting information I didnt get anywhere before. I remember in my company some very Sr. developers were working to understand how to implement machine authentication, and they were using it. Having used it before and with my course notes I helped them out. What a name for me :). I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about the network security. At least it is not as ridiculously expensive as Tanenbaum books. Yes it is very mathematical but remember this is a computer science book meant for actual software engineers.

I'm using it as a learning stepping stone to competence in network security."},{"Title":"Network Security : Private Communication in a Public World (Prentice Hall Series in Computer Networking and Distributed Ser.)","review":"I'm using this book as a self-study reference. I've been an information security officer for a number of years and felt I needed to get a firmer grasp on the mathematics of cryptography and some areas that I've mentally glossed over.This is an excellent book. The authors have a great sense of humor that appeals to me (a computer science type). Topics are understandable though there are certain areas that I needed to read several times before fully digesting. Their coverage of the various encryption schemes, message digests/hashes, MACs, etc are all top-notch.This book is relatively old at this point (published in 2002). Thus, some recent things are missing: this book doesn't mention *anything* about wireless security. TLS is mentioned as \\"coming soon.\\" Kerberos 5 is battling for supremacy with Kerberos 4. You get the idea.My only other complaint: way too much ripping on IKE/ISAKMP. The workings of these protocols get lost in the authors' complaints. I've studied that chapter once (taking notes) and didn't get it. I'm about to do so a second time. Failing that, I'll need to find another source for information."},{"Title":"Network Security : Private Communication in a Public World (Prentice Hall Series in Computer Networking and Distributed Ser.)","review":"An elegant and detailed text on cryptography and network security.

The book gives good diagrams and descriptions for some algorithms but not all."},{"Title":"Network Security : Private Communication in a Public World (Prentice Hall Series in Computer Networking and Distributed Ser.)","review":"I worked for 10 years in computer and network security, including many years as a cryptanalyst and a couple of years at a startup company. I now teach at San Jose State University, where I'm using this book as the primary textbook for a graduate class in computer security. The strengths of the the book are its coverage of basic cryptography (chapters 2 thru 6), &quot;security handshake pitfalls&quot; (chapter 11) and &quot;security folklore&quot; (chapter 26).Chapter 11 alone is worth the (high) price of the book. It is absolutely the best introduction to the subtle issues that arise with network protocols you are likely to ever find. And Chapters 2 through 6 do a better job of covering cryptography (with particular emphasis on some of the not-so-obvious issues) than many books devoted solely to cryptography. And chapter 26 makes some nice points.One criticism I have is that---with few exceptions---the rest of the book does not come close to the standard achieved in the chapters mentioned above. The chapter on SSL/TLS is OK and the chapter on Kerberos is passable (if dull), but the remaining chapters are relatively weak. Another criticism is that the title of the book is misleading. Outside of the cryptography chapters, the book is very narrowly focused on networking protocols. In my opinion, there is far more to network security than cryptography and protocols. Take a look at Ross Anderson's book, Security Engineering, to get a nice broad overview of security. Finally, the chapters related to IPsec are really poor. The author(s) seems to be so peeved with the standards committee for doing some stupid things that he/she/they do more carping than describing.In summary, I highly recommend chapters 2 thru 6, 11 and 26. But you'll need to look elsewhere if you want to learn about more than protocols and cryptography."},{"Title":"Network Security : Private Communication in a Public World (Prentice Hall Series in Computer Networking and Distributed Ser.)","review":"Who would have thought that a detailed technical book on network security would be fun to read? I wouldn't have, but this one is highly technical and also lots of fun to read. As the fundamental tenet of cryptography, instead of some abstract mathematical theorem about something or other being NP complete we get &quot;If lots of smart people have failed to solve a problem, then it probably won't be solved (soon)&quot;. But don't get me wrong, this is not a content-free book for top management, it is highly technical, with long chapters on secret-key cryptography, hashes and message digests, public-key cryptography, number theory, authentication and much more. Unlike Bruce Schneier's book, Applied Cryptography, which is more like an encylopedia than a book, this one is enjoyable to read while still carefully explaining state-of-the-art cryptographic protocols--not an easy feat to pull off. For anyone with a university degree in engineering, the sciences, or mathematics who wants to learn a lot about network security and be entertained while doing so, this book can't be beat."},{"Title":"Network Security : Private Communication in a Public World (Prentice Hall Series in Computer Networking and Distributed Ser.)","review":"I took this book along on a business trip with the expectation that it would work better than chamomile tea before bed -- instead it kept me up well into the night.

Secret and public key algorithms and protocols, message hashes, authentication, Kerberos, PKI, IPsec, SSL/TLS, and e-mail security are all explained at length. Chapter 26 on security folklore is a real gem. In security, the devil is in the details. For anyone planning to design a security system that is actually supposed to work, this chapter is must reading. The book is aimed at readers with a university degree in the sciences, engineering, or mathematics. If you want to learn everything there is to know about network security, look no further."},{"Title":"Network Security : Private Communication in a Public World (Prentice Hall Series in Computer Networking and Distributed Ser.)","review":"Far and away the best book on network security and basic cryptography. This book is very well written and contains a number of simple examples to explain even the most complex theory.

Definitely add this book to your collection."},{"Title":"Network Security : Private Communication in a Public World (Prentice Hall Series in Computer Networking and Distributed Ser.)","review":"This book should appeal to both the beginner and the professional in network security. The book starts with very few assumptions about the existing security knowledge of the reader yet still manages to explain, in considerable depth, encryption and security protocols.Best of all, it's extremely well written, well illustrated and peppered with some good humour. A topic like this could be tedious to read, but this book isn't (although I have to admit, the chapter on Kerberos didn't quite spark me up the way the rest of it did!).The book has some excellent mathematical background for those who want to understand public key cryptography but aren't that familiar with modular exponentiation and the like. It also has detailed descriptions of a number of algorithms.In summary, an excellent all-rounder on this extremely important topic."},{"Title":"Network Security : Private Communication in a Public World (Prentice Hall Series in Computer Networking and Distributed Ser.)","review":"As electronic commerce, home banking, and similar network applications become commonplace, network security will be absolutely essential to ensuring the privacy of all the users. In this book the authors explain how network security works, starting with the basic ideas and working up to numerous state-of-the-art subjects. For readers who want to know all about the mathematical fundementals of cryptography, there is a chapter on mathematics, but it is not necessary to understand the book. Many protocols and real-world examples are given. The book is very well written and easy to read. I recommend it most highly."},{"Title":"Network Security : Private Communication in a Public World (Prentice Hall Series in Computer Networking and Distributed Ser.)","review":"Focused, Concise, Organized, Easy to read - - 5 StarsI found the second edition an excellent piece of work. The content is focused, consise, and easy to ready. This is the case, even though the complex subject matters could easily have been made more difficult and confusing. This was well organized.

It is heavy on the math and theory aspects, the book actually includes an interesting chapter on Number Theory. The last chapter entitled Folklore is a refreshing way to cap off the book. The one catch is that there is little to no pseudo-code included with the examples, so you code junkies will have to start from scratch. Overall the author's attempt at a light approach to dense material helps ease the fact that it really is dense material. It covers the bases and has some nice extra material."},{"Title":"Scarecrow","review":"From an adult viewpoint, I thought the book was &quot;very nice&quot;, but my child fell in love with this book.

The author sees scarecrows as neither scary nor effective in repelling crows. On the contrary, her scarecrow is a gentle and companionable creature who welcomes crows with, well, open arms.

Pick out any story in this wonderful collection and you'll be instantly gripped and intrigued by the characters. Being invited into the world of these characters is both a fascinating and unsettling experience. Enter a world ('Not a Chance')where the disappearance of a friend begins to have a far more powerful impact on your life than their presence could ever have. The masterly 'Honda' allows one to see the world with a fresh clarity through the distorted vision of a disturbed mind. Time after time these stories question superficial accounts of experience and enable one to see the world new. Treat expertly peels away the surface of things to reveal the complexity that lies, for instance, behind a man's sweater glimpsed in a clothes store.There is so much wisdom and refreshing insight in these stories that they are a joy and an education to read. Once Treat's characters get their hooks into you you won't be able to forget them."},{"Title":"Not a Chance: Fictions","review":"The collection of short stories in &quot;Not a Chance,&quot; by Jessica Treat seriously disappointed me. I picked up the book because the back cover told of characters that are like me-&quot;American, female, and single&quot; and the line &quot;cultural refugees given to obsession and passionate longing&quot; grabbed my attention. Unfortunantly that was the only line that grabbed my attention. The one story that made me laugh out loud and I enjoyed was 'Honda.' I at first found the character's mental instability funny but it soon turned obnoxious. The rest of the stories were too pessimistic for my tastes. Many of the characters seemed to be mentally unstable or at least they were going through tough times but there wasn't any humor in them as in 'Honda.' I found that none had a profound impact on me (something I look for when I read) or give me a new insight on life that I was missing prior to reading the book. I was not entertained. I was not enlightened. And I was not happy with this book. I felt dragged when reading stories that have no point to them. The biggest concern of mine was that none had a real ending! None of them tied up any strings and the stories were just left as is, and I hate that! I cannot agree with the person that states, &quot;There is so much wisdom and refreshing insight in these stories that they are a joy and an education to read. Once Treat's characters get their hooks into you, you won't be able to forget them.&quot; No, you won't be able to forget them, even if you wish you could. For a book that is short (only 169 pages) it took me close to two months to finish. I gave the book two stars. I'm sure that there are many people that would find the stories in this book fascinating and interesting, but I am not one of them."},{"Title":"Not a Chance: Fictions","review":"This is a great collection. There is always a little thrill when a reader is immediately grabbed by a story. Such is the case when we slide right from the title of the novella, &quot;Honda,&quot; to the first sentence, &quot;I liked the name,&quot; without so much as a breath in-between. Treat pulls us into the head of the narrator and main character with the same grace. Although the plot line is clever, the action itself is secondary; the heart of this story is a complex and penetrating character study of a person on the verge of insanity. Reality is a chaotic jumble in this character's mouth; &quot;woulds&quot; &quot;coulds&quot; and &quot;is's&quot; are mixed together without discrimination. It is clear that she cannot distinguish between them. Even her sentence structure subtly suggests aberrance. Her adverbs dangle precariously at the end of a sentence as though they don't have enough confidence to get in earlier. &quot;A lot of work surely,&quot; They nodded in sympathy, eventually,&quot; &quot;It could make a person very angry really&quot;. Their dubious position in the sentence reflects her uncertain position in life. They also serve to define and reinforce her personality and are evidence of a delicate authorial command of language. The character is likable, and her story is funny, at least at the beginning of the ride. She talks directly to the reader, her conversational tone and semi-rhetorical question, &quot;why did I imagine a he?&quot; plunks the reader right into the front seat beside her. We travel with her into the world she has created and into the world in which she must exist: two very different places. We feel sorry for this lonely observer of children and parents at the playground. Her fantasy about having a son named Honda is endearing, although the first hint of unease emerges as early as the first paragraph when she complains, &quot;He acted like he didn't hear me.&quot; Treat paints a bleak picture of a world that marginalizes people like the narrator of &quot;Honda.&quot; This character exists on the fringes both mentally and physically, working at a job, which provides enough money to keep her gas gauge slightly above empty but not enough for a place to sleep. Society is disgusted with the half-eaten dinners piling up in her beat-up Honda. We know, as does this character, that the world does not open its arms to such people, it only rebuffs and rejects. Alone and alienated, she knows enough to lie to cops and perhaps to readers. She craves the company of humanity as she looks for the magical &quot;Chestnut Hill,&quot; overhears mothers fall &quot;into easy conversation with one another,&quot; and tries to converse in her &quot;most polite&quot; with Mrs. Cornflower. Finally, she wonders, &quot;What do people do with so much sunniness?&quot; The future is not bright for this modern-day Ishmael. In other stories her characters teeter on a varying edges of reality, all skillfully conveyed by this author with a combination of dark humor and desolation. As readers we might begin with a laugh over their wackiness when a tiny gasp of self-identification erupts. This is the case in &quot;His Sweater,&quot; where the main character fills us in on the boyfriend she ran away from with the complaint &quot;I often gave him small tests and he never passed them.&quot; The point-of-view in &quot;Ants&quot; is quite extraordinary and the story itself is wonderful. I don't want to explain it except to say you must experience it for yourself. As I said in the beginning - this book is great -- we never know whether to laugh or cry but we know these characters live in a world we know."},{"Title":"Not a Chance: Fictions","review":"What I loved best about these stories was that they made me so uncomfortable at times. I often found myself laughing out loud one minute, and then widening my eyes in shock right after.I loved the feeling of being inside the heads of the female protagonists. Can't a lot of us relate to some of their thoughts and/or feelings? The difference is that we may not act on them, while these women do. This is just the type of collection I love. The women are deviant, perhaps not \\"all there\\". The list of road kill in \\"Honda\\" still makes me giggle when I think about it.Reading this collection helped me rediscover my love for the short story. I've been reading a lot of novels lately, and had forgotten how satisfying a good short story can be. Fortunately for me, Jessica Treat's book was full of them."},{"Title":"Not a Chance: Fictions","review":"Jessica Treat's \\"Not a Chance\\" is a wonderful collection of contemporary short, fiction stories. The collection has eight short stories and one novella. Treat's stories focus on women's personal and intimate trials and tribulations within diverse contemporary settings and diverse scenarios. In the story titled the same as the book, \\"Not a Chance,\\" one woman tries to piece together the mystery surrounding the disappearance of her friend in Mexico and during the process actually mentally and emotionally relives her friend's relationship with a young \\"gringo.\\" In \\"Radio Disturbance\\" Julia is transfixed by her ex-therapist's voice and is still as unsettled as ever. These stories speak about women, their inner conflicts, their attempts, or lack thereof, to solve them, their positions in particular moments in their lives and the details of those moments that encapsulate them. Treat's stories are done masterfully. Treat grabs your attention slowly with descriptions, and through her style of rendering action, makes you want to become more familiar, more intimate with each of her characters, and ultimately, she does just that, she gives you want you want. I would recommend this book to all readers."},{"Title":"Not a Chance: Fictions","review":"In Jessica Treat's book of short stories, Not A Chance, her two main stories concentrate on women who have inner conflicts.

At first the narrator revisits the places and relives the moments that the two had, but as the story continues the narrator is actually telling the story of the women's demise.In conclusion, both of the characters seem to lack excitement.

Treat's first person protagonist offers the reader a unique and sometimes oddly funny perspective on life. The voice and tone of the narrator remains constant through out the collection. The simplicity of the narrator's observations and reasoning allows the reader to sympathize and enjoy the journey the narrator takes from the first story 'Ants' to the last 'Radio Disturbance'.The perspective of Treat's narrator at times might lead the reader to question the reliability of what she observes. But Treat balances the question of reliability evenly by presenting the narrator in real life situations. In short, the narrator's decisions and reactions to normal situations allows for the reader to accept the collection of stories as fiction that is grounded not too far from reality. The narrator's logic draws the reader unwittingly deeper into the story. Treat is able to capture the reader's attention in the first several paragraphs of any of the stories and, although the narrator's actions and thoughts are very simple in nature, the reader is immediately able to identify with the narrator's situation that creates a suspense that creeps up on the reader.Treat's short stories seem explore the theme of feminine identity. Specifically, the maternal instincts that are intrinsic to female gender play an important role in most of the stories. This can be seen most prominently in the novella 'Honda', in which the narrator has a fictitious child. The narrator imagines herself having to care for her son Honda. I connected the maternal theme in 'Honda' to the story 'The Summer of Zubeyde'. In this story the narrator admits to having an abortion, yet she exhibits a maternal attitude toward a student that leaves her English class. In other words, Treat creates dramatic irony by showing that narrator still exhibits maternal instincts despite the fact that she had an abortion. This is seen through the narrator's preoccupation with the well being of Zubyede. Treat creates a narrator that seeks to explain or comment on specific qualities or instincts that are unique to female identity through out the collection of stories. (This feminine perspective does not inhibit or prohibit a male audience from identifying or enjoying the stories, much to the credit of Treat's universal and intriguing style of writing.)"},{"Title":"Not a Chance: Fictions","review":"The collection of short stories written by Jessica Treat and titled, Not a Chance is very fantastic and mysterious. The stories feel like you're in a dream state watching yourself as you move throughout the story. Treat stories are of discovery and the ability for her characters to see the world from inside out is absolutely good. Treat has very good details and descriptions. Treat also uses first person point-of-view very well.My favorite short story is the short story entitled His Sweater, which shows her great use of first person point-of-view. The story has great scenes that were very descriptive, vivid, and full of imagery. The character in the short story disappeared from a loveless relationship, but it is hinted that it was abusive relationship. The character then has numerous flashbacks about her relationship and the good and bad things in her life. The character is needy, wearing a sweater from an ex; well she thinks it's his sweater that she purchased. She is disillusion because she moved top another city from the travel books that are geared toward tourist.The unnamed character then moves into an apartment with a roommate that she has never known on formal or informal terms. As I was reading this story I started thinking about Single White Female. The story then takes a turn as the character finally finds a job after she is down to her last twenty bucks in a Swedish bakery. The story then takes another turn when the character faints from being either crazy or pregnant. But, as she in her dream state she wishes and hopes that her lover comes to rescue her, to show her he truly loves her, and she wants the life that she had before.It was a great collection of short stories. They weren't as long as I thought short stories were but the scenes were just full of explicit and precise details and descriptions. I really liked the author's use of first person point-of-view because it wasn't distracting at all. I followed the story very well and I just enjoyed reading a book of short stories rather than a story or a novel with twist of turning points."},{"Title":"Not a Chance: Fictions","review":"Treat's main preoccupation in this anthology is the subject of dwelling, and how dwelling manifests itself in marginalized characters, some teetering on the brink of emotional disaster.Most remarkable in this anthology is Treat's treatment of the various stages of dwelling, in the way obsession progresses - more or less in an ascending order - from one story to the next. Treat tells these stories of dwellers quite successfully by chronicling life's intricacies in an almost Proustian fashion.The anthology begins with Ants, an obsessive recollection by a girlfriend of a former boyfriend's gay life. This is followed by the novella Honda, about an obsessive character's imaginings, to the title story Not a Chance, in which Treat's narrator is an obsessive friend, obsessing over the love affair of her dweller friend, who herself has pondered this difficult love affair to exhaustion.One of the last stories in the novel is Dead End, in which dwelling moves away from an abstract idea and takes on a tangible form. Dead End is written in epistolary form - a letter by a stalker to a former boyfriend who is about to be killed by a hitman hired by the stalker. Hence, the reader gets a glimpse of the rising degrees of dwellings, as shown through personal and not-so-personal human relationships in the anthology, until the dwelling has taken such a strong hold on a character that the only way she can rid herself of more dwelling is by getting the source of that dwelling obliterated.But Treat's work not only highlights the stages of dwelling, but the causes behind all this dwelling, and in so doing it manages to draw sympathy for her off-the-wall characters.In Ants, Treat writes about the psychological toll of sexual confusion on a gay character who has switched back to being straight (or you wonder if he has become forcefully straight due to societal pressures). The story, narrated in the point of view of the gay character's current girlfriend, has little about their new life together, and more about the former boyfriend's gay life. Treat does her readers a great service by excluding details of the girlfriend's feelings towards the hurt her boyfriend has suffered as a result of his gay lifestyle. In so doing, Treat allows the reader, through the narrator, to paint an emotionally detailed picture of the boyfriend's state of mind.And in Honda, Treat manages to spark similarly deep emotions in the reader for the character-narrator in the story.Honda is from the point of view of a lonely, unreliable and crazy narrator, or one who is on the verge of insanity; a presumptuous person who craves the presence of warm bodies, and yet deliberately distances herself from people. Or is it that she has become so used to being rejected or mistreated that she conjures up ways to one up the strangers around her, strangers being the only people in her life. The tale's poignancy lies in the fact that all the silly, little inconveniences that the narrator causes the strangers (like driving around someone else's Honda instead of her own, or delivering a crazy letter to someone who has had her mail box vandalized, or trying to lead someone's dog astray), are the idea of revenge in the narrator's mind. Sadder still is the finality of these &quot;revenges&quot; as it becomes clearer that the character has gone crazy by the end of the novella. In Honda, thus, Treat succeeds in drawing sympathy for an unlikable character who is left to face her disturbed mental state all alone."},{"Title":"Not a Chance: Fictions","review":"Jessica Treat gives an intriguing glimpse at a distorted protagonist with her short story collection. Stylistically, Treat's meandering and uncomplicated prose makes each piece engaging and entertaining to read. Especially enjoyable is the collection of stories that comprise the novella 'Honda.' The character exposition had me enchanted from the beginning -- before I knew what was happening I found myself comfortably situated within the protagonist's world of fantasy, created from past experiences and brief encounters. Her descriptions are detailed and intriguing enough that I was unwittingly lost and sucked into her world.Another thing that's enjoyable is Treat's intermingling of humor and dementia. When the protagonist talks about her imaginary son, 'Honda,' for example, her shortcomings as a 'mother' are revealed in a way that is both bizarre and thoroughly entertaining. The only unsettling thing about this collection is how each vignette ends. Just as I found myself lost within the dream world of each piece, the story ended with an abrupt return to the protagonist's state of 'reality.'"},{"Title":"Not a Chance: Fictions","review":"For those who do not care for ordinary fiction short stories, Jessica Treat's 'Not a Chance' is the book to get. The protagonists take you on a long and surreal trip through their lives as well as the people that surround them. In 'Walking' and 'Honda', the reader is confonted with the line thin between reality and fiction. In every story, Treat perfectly executes the confusion and complexity of life through her somewhat deranged narrators. As unreliable as some of Treat's protagonists, 'Not a Chance' is simply a great read."},{"Title":"Not a Chance: Fictions","review":"The manner in which the protagonists in \\"Honda\\" and \\"Big Radio\\" are unreliable narrators and oddly trustworthy at the same time, is engaging. The way Julia moves us into her mind, showing the short distance between unreality (her dreams) and reality is done beautifully, and I really loved many small details, from her later understanding that the therapist has said \\"sons\\" not \\"son's\\" (adds a credibilty that perfectly suits her character) to the hilarious Goldilocks image that helps cement my sense of her real fear of diving too deeply into the therapist's life. Though, in fact she has already done so. More amazing and even spine tingling at times is \\"Honda\\" whose lead character steps deliciously over the edge of reality. I enjoyed the way characters overlap and morph into one another, revealing the author's subtle art of depicting human sensibility, and how we find out about the narrator's past that helped shape her (retreating to her own world as a child, hocus pocus, etc.), and I loved what I see as a truism that I have experienced myself, that awful feeling of giving away too much, \\"Once you do, there's no turning back; they expect you to just go further\\" and so on. Of course that was a specific example in the story of the character's paranoia at a store counter, but there are universal truths implicit in that line. The whole story is well pulled together and your ending is powerful, what with the ostensible description of Pie Man, who, after all is one more projection of our narrator. What is said about Pie Man just happens to define the slippery narrator as well: \\"mouth open and laughing, as he said whatever was needed to hold his small audience captive.\\"."},{"Title":"\\"Cool Stuff\\" They Should Teach in School: Cruise into the Real World...with styyyle (jobs/people skills/attitude/goals/money)","review":"Kent Healy and Kyle Healy are smart, savvy young men who are brothers.

I have reviewed this latter book earlier.The 'Cool Stuff' book is apparently targetted at high school students (& graduates). The 'Power of Focus' book is targetted at high school graduates & college students, even though the delineation is really not an issue. The earlier book is written by two brothers during their late teen years, in 2004. The latter book, which has been published one year later, is written by two university graduates in their early twenties. This book is also an extension of the earlier 'The Power of Focus' by Les Hewitt, Jack Canfield & Mark Victor Hansen, which is obviously targeted at adult professionals.Essentially, the 'Cool Stuff' book is designed to help students GET REAL...to help them face a multitude of challenges as they grow from teens to young adults & while they move into the real world. The abundant information in this book are packed into bite-sized nuggets, illustrated with zany graphics.Whereas, the 'Power of Focus' book is more sober of the two books, with abundant information, as well as inspiring stories, packed into nine focusing strategies. Tactically, it has been designed to help high school graduates & college freshmen in finding fulfilling career pathways.While the 'Cool Stuff'book has a more light-hearted approach, both books generally help to answer these critical questions:- why 70% of graduates are unhappy & disillusioned within five years of leaving college?- what 3% of Yale students do that lead them to become wealthier than the other 97% combined?One interesting point: The entrepreneurial flair of the authors of both books is exemplified by their own respective websites: namely ccolstuffmedia & focusedstudent, which continue to promote their books, seminars & workshops & other stuff.One last point: The 'Power of Focus' book has a seemingly subtle & yet direct slant towards 'GET RICH' partly because of its association with Donald Trump...so it's also designed to help you build the financial future you so desire.To sum up my review, both books are really great stuff! If you are a high school student or college freshman, I strongly urge you to go & get a copy to read & to learn how to maximise your high school - & college - experience & also how to deal with a rapdily changing world out there!"},{"Title":"\\"Cool Stuff\\" They Should Teach in School: Cruise into the Real World...with styyyle (jobs/people skills/attitude/goals/money)","review":"It is amazing what we as parents can learn from books written for our children by their peers.

How was I supposed to learn about it. Managing the green in this book is a great example of real world tactics for kids to become responsible young adults.I read a lot of business books, and I am happy when there are one or two key points that stick with me and become a part of the set of tools I use everyday, but to be honest this book is so full of them, I had to go through it with a highlighter!Do your kids a favor, buy this book for them, but read it first.

On the other, there are those Christians so desperate to justify their interest with a veneer of spirituality that they try to establish one to one correlations between these entertaining stories and Holy Scripture.\\"Faith Journey Through Fantasy Lands: A Christian Dialogue With Harry Potter, Star Wars & Lord Of The Rings\\" by Russell Dalton endeavors to provide a balance between these competing outlooks.While highlighting the parts of these works that appeal to enduring values, Dalton also admits that neither are these stories themselves Scripture. Rather, he writes, \\"This book takes an approach that goes beyond a \`thumbs up' or \`thumbs down' evaluation of fiction and film. It gives the reader a chance to reflect whether or not the behaviors and beliefs of the characters in today's fantasy stories are consistent with the Christian faith, but it also looks at the questions these stories demand of our faith by entering into a dialogue between these fantasy stories and the Christians story (7).\\"Rather than condemn The Lord Of The Rings, Star Wars, or even Harry Potter, \\"Faith Journey Through Fantasy Lands\\" prudently counsels that the problems that arise in reference to these stories often lie not so much in the stories themselves but in those that read them. For example, most that read Harry Potter are not going to end up sacrificing goats or taking oaths of unending allegiance to Satan. Thus, Dalton suggests, parents must decide for themselves how much exposure to Star Wars, Harry Potter, and The Lord Of The Rings their children should receive.Though for the most part balanced in his approach, the reader will no doubt detect a hint of political correctness seeping into Dalton's exposition. For example, he does not use the phrase \\"Kingdom of God\\" but rather \\"The Reign Of God.\\" Likewise, Dalton does not refer to Jesus as \\"the Son of Man\\" but rather as \\"the Son of Humanity\\".Dalton also gets all maudlin that the characters in these stories are primarily White. But since Middle Earth is said to correspond to some kind of pre-historic Europe and Hogwarts is a British alchemical school, what does he expect?If Aragorn had had such vacillating attitudes, Sauron would have still been ruling over Middle Earth by the end of the third film.Even if one disagrees with the conclusions drawn by \\"Faith Journey Through Fantasy Lands\\", one has to admit Dalton approaches the issue in an overall even handed manner carefully respecting the opinions on each side.by Frederick Meekins"},{"Title":"Faith Journey Through Fantasy Lands","review":"This is an excellent analysis of a most important modern &quot;miracle&quot; - the religious reasons behond the huge success of these epic tales of high romance in a culture that too often seems fixated on the squalid.

It is a lot better than the Barron's Book Notes, to say the least. First, The Hobbit summary is really good. Except for a few minor inaccuracies, this is a very good summary of the Hobbit, probably the best one out there. Even the LOTR one is okay, except for they use all kinds of politically correct terms (Black Riders are Dark Riders), and other miscillany (the Hardy dude does not even mention where Bilbo is going, until the Rivendell part). So, if you need help with the books, this will suffice. Also of note: the whole part in the back about the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Ages is really a summary of the Silmarillion. Go figure."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit (Cliffs Notes)","review":"While this Cliffs Notes is a fairly good synopsis of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, it is nonetheless full of minor inaccuracies. For instance, Dr. Hardy uses the plural 'Dunedain' as a name for Aragorn, when he should have used the singular Dunadan. He states that Faramir and his company engage the 'men of the east' in Ithilien, when they in fact engaged the Southrons. Little things like calling 'The Old Forest' simply Old Forest, or &quot;The Morannon&quot; simply Morannon are annoying to the Tolkien purist. So is his habit of calling the Black Riders 'Dark Riders', a term which I suspect was used in an effort at political correctness by Dr. Hardy, though Professor Tolkien didn't use it. Calling Galadriel's powers 'psychic', as Dr. Hardy does, may not be wholly untrue, but it is hardly a word that captures the essence of her Elven magic. And speaking of Saruman's staff as a 'magic wand' also misses the mark, I think. To folks who have not read the book (who are after all the target audience, I suppose), this Cliffs Notes is a pretty good summary. To Tolkien fans with an eye for detail, finding all Dr. Hardy's little mistakes will at least provide an evenings entertainment."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit (Cliffs Notes)","review":"Cliffs Notes is no substitute for reading any actual great work of literature. However, Cliffs Notes are indeed quite helpful to anyone who takes the reading of Great Books seriously; it can be especially helpful for the serious, first or many-time reader of a detailed and deeply meaningful work. Particularly when there are numerous names, events, and ideas to keep straight and thus, may act as a helpful memory trigger for the serious reader or student. It can not be stressed enough that Cliffs Notes is an absolutely poor substitute for actually reading a book carefully from cover to cover, especially a very great work of literature, like the Lord of the Rings (LOTR).It is well worth noting too, that the reader does himself a great disservice when skipping a thoughtful and careful reading of Tolkien's forward and introduction in all his books. An even bigger mistake, is to skip the Appendix, at the end of Return of the King (LOTR).While I'm on a soapbox, I will say that Cliffs Notes need to clean up a few very minor, yet annoying, errors in an otherwise excellent edition. Furthermore, it is a real shame that there aren't any Cliffs Notes for the Simarillion in particular, which can be a quite difficult read for both young and inexperienced Tolkien and Great Literature readers. Likewise, there should at least be Cliffs Notes for the Lost Tales, vols. 1 & 2, plus the recently released masterwork, The Children of Hurin."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit (Cliffs Notes)","review":"Absolute waste of money.

The show is beloved by fans and is one of the best family-friendly shows ever screened on television. I have all the DVDs and watch them every year.

Aunt Hetty is shocked to learn that her old classmate and rival is now Superintendent and is visiting Avonlea. Hetty believes Stacey wants to check on her, and gets her feathers all ruffled when Stacey makes comments about modernizing teaching methods.Hetty decides to prove her competence by getting Gus Pike, a former sailor and present cannery worker to enroll at the school as a student. Initially, Hetty's main motive is to show Stacey she is still a competent teacher, but later Hetty comes to genuinely care about Gus and finds a willing student in him.

I CAN UNDERSTANDING WHY IT WAS MADE INTO A MOVIE."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"John Grisham has written some good novels that fall into the &quot;bestseller potboiler&quot; category of fiction, but this is not one of his stronger works. The premise of a high-level coverup on behalf of a nitwit Reagan-esque chief executive is promising, and oil speculators are (now, more than ever) people that we love to hate, but Grisham's execution of his story line is simply overly cliched, contrived, and plodding. Once the basic dynamic of &quot;see Darby run, see Darby outwit her pursuers&quot; is established early on, the story bogs down for (literally!) a couple of hundred pages. We are beaten over the head with just how clever Darby is (especially for such a Babe), and with how nasty and Machiavellian the President's henchmen are. We go from one locale to another and another, always just one step ahead of the hapless bad guys. And--not to provide too much of a spoiler here-- it turns out that the *really* bad guy bears an eerie resemblance to the late Howard Hughes!Enough, already.Oh, one more thing: just how many references to we need to Darby's &quot;long legs?&quot; It actually might have been more refreshing and bold for Grisham to portray Darby as a plain, dumpy, but brilliant law student, but then, Julia Roberts sells more tickets at the box office, right?And there's the crux of the matter: I think Grisham wrote this story fully intending from the beginning that this would be turned into a movie, so in terms of characters, plot, pacing, and ending, the whole affair is unabashedly Hollywood-esque. In fact, the book was made into a pitiably bad 1993 movie starring Roberts and Sam Shepard. While I can't really recommend the flick, at least you'll be done with it in a couple of hours, tops."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"This is the best book John Grisham has written yet and I am a BIG fan.

That being said, I thought &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; was a very good book -- not quite at the level of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird,&quot; but still well-written. I wouldn't call &quot;The Firm&quot; a good book by any means, but it created an atmosphere of paranoia effectively.&quot;The Pelican Brief,&quot; however, began a downward slide for Grisham, the depths of which I stopped monitoring after &quot;The Client.&quot;First, &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot; is just too much to swallow. In &quot;The Firm,&quot; Mitch had the FBI helping him -- sort of -- so you can suspend some disbelief and think that he might survive his employment with the mob. But in &quot;The Pelican Brief,&quot; Darby is a second year law student with no help at all. It just strains credulity to believe that she could survive.But that's hardly the worst flaw in the book. The worst sin committed herein is that Grisham CHEATS. In an effort to generate suspense, he withholds from the reader the information that would explain why everyone wants to kill Darby Shaw. Why? Because of the contents of the Pelican Brief, which she wrote. So while Darby knows why everyone is after her, the reader doesn't find out until two thirds of the way in, when Grisham finally deigns to share the brief with us. This is a mark of a lazy or untalented writer."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"The premise of the plot is ridiculous. A law student writes a brief in which she theorizes who is behind the murder of two Supreme Court Justices. Suddenly all sorts of assassins are after her, and she manages to elude them all. It makes no sense--why would a whole cadre of assassins come down on a person, simply for expressing an opinion? After all, she had no evidence. And there was no evidence from any of the crime scenes. So why attempt to kill her? In real life, her theory would have been dismissed as just that, a theory. Attacking her would only validate her accusation. The characters are as flat as pancakes--they all have the same personality, a pithy, street-smart toughness. There is no feel for setting. The scenes in New Orleans, New York and DC are pretty much the same. The brief 2 and 3 page scenes are so undeveloped that they leave the reader with no impression at all. And Grisham's sense of language is pedestrian, there is not a single memorable line, phrase or description."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"The Pelican Brief is without a doubt the worst book I've ever finished. (I've dropped a few worse books midway through, but I was stuck on an airplane for 10 hours with only a copy of The Pelican Brief so I had no choice but to finish it.) The biggest problem with the book is that the plot makes absolutely no sense. Think about it. The Darby character has NO direct evidence with respect to her theory. Once she's passed the information on to the authorities, killing her does nothing but validate the theory. So if they had succeeded in killing her, it's highly likely that the authorities would eventually figure out that her theory was valid. As a result, Darby's fate is irrelevant. This book is one of the reasons that I never read anything on the best seller list (except for freakish exceptions like Pynchon and DeLillo). Oh, I just remembered one book I read that was even worse (Patriot Games, further support for my policy of avoiding best sellers)."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"I've read most of Grisham's novels, and have to say 'The Pelican Brief' is not one of his best. Actually, he's never been able to surpass his first novel 'A Time to Kill', for characters and plot.The main character, Darby Shaw, is a law student who stumbles upon the conspirators of the assassinations of two Supreme Court Justices. Once this information is leaked she becomes their next target. Of course, she's smart enough not to get killed, but rather is able to escape the bad guys, and find a newspaper reporter who will run the story and blow the conspirators out of the water.Trouble is the reader doesn't know why Darby's running until two thirds into the book when Grisham finally reveals the contents of the brief. It's evident that this work of fiction was really meant to be a movie script and not a novel.

In \\"The Pelican Brief,\\" two supreme court justices are murdered as the story begins. I found it interesting to compare the stories which were both well written and suspenseful and suggest that the reader read both novels.In \\"The Pelican Brief,\\" after the justices are murdered, the President feels that it is an opportunity for him to reshape the court. Eight of the justices will be republicans and their rulings could change the direction of the country for years to come.Government and media are attempting to analyze the murders to see why the killer picked these two justices. Darby Shaw is a bright law student at Tulane. She believes that she knows why the justices were murdered. She researches her opinions and publishs her findings in a document called \\"The Pelican Brief.\\"Darby is a student and lover of law school professor Thomas Callahan. She shows Callahan the document and he gives it to a friend in the FBI for his opinion. Not long after, Calahan is murdered and Darcy becomes hunted.Grisham is an excellent story teller and master of creating suspense. The reader can sympathise with Darcy who doesn't know where to turn and stays alive by her intelligence and quick wit. Even though she's unsure of who to trust, she continues her attempt to expose the guilty person, even at the risk of her life."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"A super-rich oil guy is behind killing 2 Supreme Court Justices because the Court will eventually, in about 4 or 5 years, decide if this guy can drill for oil in an environmentally protected area.A law student investigates the crime and finds out that the only thing the 2 dead Justices had in common was that they were pro-environment. She also finds out that the super-rich oil guy is a big supporter of the President, who is obviously oil-friendly and will now have to appoint 2 new Supreme Court Justices.The law student writes a paper with her theory that the super-rich oil guy is responsible for the murders and it quickly gets into the hands of the FBI and the President, who tells the FBI Director to back off from the investigation for a few weeks.A few people get killed and it ends with the super rich oil guy being indicted because a newspaper reporter who deals with the Supreme Court helps the law student expose her information in a news article. The President announces he will not seek reelection.The premise for this book is that the greatest investigative minds in the FBI did not have a clue concerning the murders, but a law student easily figured it out, which meant the super rich oil guy had to get rid of her.If 2 Supreme Court Justices are killed and the only thing they have in common is being pro-environment, all one has to do is find out who would make tons of money from a Supreme Court ruling against people who were pro-environment and who has the wealth to finance killing 2 Supreme Court Justices.Any FBI investigator and almost any detective on any police force could have easily solved this crime. Any investigative reporter could have easily determined the facts and put out a news story stating such, but according to this book, only this clever law student has the potential to expose the diabolical scheme with her simple theory, which is why she has to die.Stupid, dumb, and slow-moving.

Plenty of twists and turns to keep the reader guessing and the action keeps you turning pages well into the night."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Washington wakes up to the gruesome news that two members of the Supreme Court have been murdered overnight. The shocking part was in their diversity. The old, should have retired years ago, Democrat Justice Rosenberg and the younger Republican Justice Jensen. The fact that they were almost always on opposite sides of any issue left law enforcement with no clear political motive. The only clues left behind seemed to be ones of the killer's choosing. A nylon cord used to garrote Jensen as he sat in a movie house watching a porno film. The Rosenberg affair was messy - three people dead, three 22-caliber bullets to the head of each victim Rosenberg, a guard and an aid.Down in bayou country Tulane University law professor Thomas Callahan on hearing the news got roaring drunk to ease the pain. Rosenberg was one of his idols and he couldn't believe the end had come.While the whole country pondered the reason behind the killings Darby Shaw, a bright law student and bed partner of professor Callahan turns sleuth. Ms. Shaw pores over the current Supreme Court docket and eventually comes up with a promising case. And for the next four days she shuffles through pages of affidavits detailing lies and abuses by lawyers and their clients.In the end Darby Shaw writes an eight-page draft of what will later be called the Pelican Brief. Shaw is only half convinced that she is on to something, however, in spite of her skepticism she turns the pages over to Callahan.Callahan attends the Rosenberg funeral in Washington and passes the brief along to a colleague. And once copies of those pages get into the wrong hands Darby Shaw becomes the hunted.John Grisham takes us through a fast paced cat and mouse investigation, and in the end solves the puzzle to everyone's satisfaction.Tom Barnes author of: \`The Goring Collection,' \`Doc Holliday's Road to Tombstone'\`The Hurricane Hunters and Lost in the Bermuda Triangle'"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"The story of a young, second year Tulane University law student, Darby Shaw, getting in way over her head when she inadvertently writes a brief outlining the possible links to the murders of two Supreme Court Justices. Just as Darby feels her theory is ridiculous and tosses it aside, her lover as well as Professor of constitutional law, Thomas Callahan, picks it up to read and decides it merits the review by his friend who just happens to be general counsel for the FBI. As the brief, now known as the Pelican Brief (for reasons of protection of a rare breed of pelicans and the people who are out to steal the land they need to survive for greed's sake) makes its way all the way up to a connection with the President of the United States, people on all levels associated with either the workings of the brief or with Darby herself, begin to die. Darby finds herself running for her life, with not a soul she can trust. Grisham takes us through a nail-biting scenario of dirty lawyers, dirty politics and an innocent girl fighting for her life. I felt the characters became difficult to keep up with and I had to totally concentrate on each and every scenario.

Truly hard to put down, even when the digital clock says its 2 a.m. This novel contains every single Grisham quirk which readers delight, whilst deviating from Grisham's usual court-room sanctum.Tulane law student Darby Shaw has unknowingly stumbled upon an incredible discovery: the true identity of the man who orchestrated the heinous killings of two Supreme Court justices. Now the killer, an huge oil mogol, will stop at nothing to silence anyone who comes in contact with the highly incriminating evidence: the pelican brief. Already Shaw's professor and lover has been murdered, and the body count is yet to climb. Darby is on the run and has become increasingly paranoid. Only one person who holds a critical link to the crime is able to help her: Gray Grantham, a Washington Post writer. Darby must now choose between fleeing the country for her safety, or riding shotgun with Grantham who is dead-set on exposing the killer in what proves to be a wild and dangerous ride that eventually brings down the Presidency.The Pelican Brief is not a novel to ignore.

His date is only a few steps behind, yells at him to let her drive. \\"No!\\" the drunk man screams. \\"I won't get in the car with you!\\" she screams, tears streaming down her face. \\"Have fun walking home!\\" he shouts. \\"Your drunk!\\" she screams. \\"I can drive better drunk than you can sober!\\" he hollers back. He reaches the car, she pleads with him one last time to let her drive. He refuses. As he gets into the car, it explodes. The girl is fazed, who would do this? She decides that the bomb must have also been meant for her. Her date, Thomas Callahan and her constitutional law professor, never did anything to upset people to the point that they would kill him. She, Darby Shaw, had written a brief about why she thinks that two Supreme Court justices where murdered. Thomas had said that he had given the brief to his friend in the FBI. Darby goes into hiding, she makes contact with the FBI officer who Thomas gave the brief to. He is murdered the night before they were suppose to meet. Darby continues to hide, as she is being hunted by people who plan to kill her. Finally, she contacts The Washington Post reporter Gray Grisham with her information. Together they collect enough information to make the biggest news break since Watergate. The Pelican Brief by John Grishman is a complex and suspenseful novel which is a little confusing to read.This novel has many, many characters, it makes hard to keep track of the story line. There is a lot of characters that have no purpose or very small purposes, one is Eric Easton. He was mentioned maybe twice in the whole story. You get so confused that its possible to get K.O. Lewis, a FBI agent, and L. Matthew Barr, the person hired to oversee killing Darby, mixed up. Some characters are rarely mentioned and some seem to spontaneously appear.Readers do not find out what is in the Pelican Brief until you are about two-hundred pages into the story. This causes it to be suspenseful because you do not know why people are killing people. The many deaths also cause it to be suspenseful as well, it adds to the \\"why\\" factor. Other than the two Supreme Judges, Rosenburg and Jensen, a FBI agent, Gavin Verheek, is murdered and then the expert murder for hire who killed the last three people named, Khamel, is murdered.When this happens, Darby believes him to be Verheek. After they plan to meet, Verheek is murdered by Khamel. Then Khamel pretends to be Verheek and meets Darby. As they are walking together, Khamel is trying to find a spot to kill Darby then he is shot. Randomly shot, you don't know who shot him, how they recognized him or anything. It becomes very unclear. Another thing that might puzzle readers is that there isn't a clear path between how Darby and Grantham find out their information. It isn't easy to grasp how they get from one informant to another.This book is slightly confusing to read, and is complex and suspenseful. It has lots of characters, Grisham withholds vital information, and has some confusing incidents. Although, it does have a very engrossing plot and I would recommend it only for people who are very avid readers who enjoy complicated mysteries and thrillers.C.

Great book though some sexual content."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"I read this book in 1993. Even though it's been a long time since I read it, I still have the enjoyment I felt as I read it fresh in my memory. For that reason I've always wanted to publish a review on it. The most sincere coment I can say about this book is, &quot;It's the very best book I've read in my whole life&quot;. This book was so interesting and captivating to me, that when I first picked it up and read the first pages, I couldn't put it down. I stayed up one whole night, and through a day and half, I slowly read the whole book; absorving everything. I'm a 20 year old, third year pre-med student now. When I read this book I was about 15. Therefore, I think that my oppinion of this book can be easily shared with younger and more fresh minded people. Please do not listen to reviews done by people over 100 years old, they can't even see their noses. So all in all, if you like suspence and meet the criteria for this book(under the vegetable age) then you will agree with me 100%!!!"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"THIS BOOK WAS A GREAT BOOK TO KEEP YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT!

The suspense.."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Though not quite as good as A Time To Kill, in my opinion this is one of his best books. He manipulates people and situations in a believable manner that makes one keep reading until the dawn breaks. Truly a good read."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"I am 15 years old, and I have recently become obsessed with Grisham ever since I saw the movie A Time to Kill and The Rainmaker. I have read only three of Grisham's novels (A Time to Kill, The Pelican Brief, The Client, and I am in the middle of The Runaway Jury). So far, I have loved The Pelican Brief the best because I could understand the characters and their thoughts. The love story involved and suspense helped me to continue to flip the pages every night. I fell in love with the character Darby Shaw and her wit thoughout the book. I can't say enough about the book other than READ IT!!!"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"I like this kind of thing! You've got murders, a big business conspiracy and that southern texture and flavour that Grisham is known for. Result? One of the author's best novels. Okay, Okay, maybe it strains crediblity at times, but Grisham's story telling skill draws your attention away from such mundane matters and takes you into the world of an intricate and deadly conspiracy. I'll definitely be reading this again.!"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"This was such a cool book! (well, it's John Grisham, and of course it's cool!) See, I watched the movie, before I read the book, and I don't recommend that. always read the book first. But, the book was awesome! I'm a big John Grisham fan (who isn't?) and I loved this book! It's smart, funny-at times- suspenseful, and such a detailed &amp; awesome story!"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"I love most of Grisham's books and have several of them and this is one of my favorites. Another is THE CLIENT. Two Supreme Court justices are killed and the government is baffled as to who could have done it and a law student decides to figure out who was responsible and does, but then is on the run for her life. She can't trust anyone. It seems that everyone that reads the brief she has written is getting killed. There is a lot of manipulation in the government offices, from the White House, to the FBI, and to the CIA. The FBI gets hold of the brief, but doesn't really take it seriously and yet there is mention of the President in it, and since there is a personality clash between some of the FBI officials and the administration, decides to make the president think they are taking it seriously. Then events really get rolling. The book is fast paced and exciting all the way through."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"The thing that I admire about John Grisham is that he has a way of explaining legal procedure to the reader that does not condesend and actually makes you feel intellegent afterwards. He did a great job of doing it in \\"The Firm\\" and now Grisham fans will be pleased by this installment as the thrills take you not only to the south but also to the steps of the White House. At the risk of not rehashing the premise and plot, I found some of Grisham's most colorful characters are in this one, namely the President and his Chief of Staff. Also a minor character in \\"The Firm\\" plays a much larger role. Both Tom Clancy and Anne Rice do this trick and I love it. Also his use of dialogue is amazing and you wind up going through a surprizing amount of pages in a short amount of time.The only drawback is the while the premise is unique it is somewhat flimsy. And while there are plenty of nail biting chases, and varoius twists and turns, I did not find myself becoming emotionally drawn to the characters. I know Grisham is capable of doing it, just read \\"A Time to Kill.\\" However the payoff is at the end. It really packs a punch and it made me want to read the book again. I have reshelved this one to make sure I do just that some time next year. While far from a modern classic, the book does what it's supposed to: Entertains you and makes want to pick up another one of his books. Good reading."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"I found the novel &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot; quite interesting. It's about two Supreme Court judges who were killed. A law student named &quot;Darby Shaw&quot; studies some material about older lawsuits and suddenly she recognizes a lot of connections and creates a theoretic file which becomes known as the &quot;Pelican Brief&quot;. In this Brief she names the possible murdereres, but like in every thriller the wrong people get this file, too, and the killings go on. That means the beginning of a dangerous run for Darby's life. I think this book is really well-written, with a lot of action, love, crime and nevertheless much fear. I can only recommend this bestseller!!! @ Marcel Jast."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Yuck, this book was horrid. Every character was either bland or just jaggedly putrid or both.

A perky law school student and her overbeveraged professor solve the mystery of who knocked off a couple of Supreme Court Justices. They do this all the while outsmarting the CIA, terrorists, police, you name it.When they made this into a movie equally as shallow, it should have been &quot;shot before a live audience&quot;."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"It truly makes me sad that the American public has such little ability to make an independent, intelligent judgment about works of fiction that they cannot see how awful of a writer Grisham is. It further disturbs me that people actually liked this nimbwitted caricature of a legal thriller. Please America, wake up!First, while Grisham may have attended law school, I doubt that he retained more than 20% of the knowledge he may have acquired. As an experienced attorney with a knowledge of both civil and criminal law, I can assure you that if Grisham writes any actual legal content into his novels, his editors must be deleting it. If he has utilized any knowledge of law that cannot be gleemed by talking to a second year law student over lunch, I must have missed it.The biggest example of Grisham's lack of legal acumen is displayed by the main plot line in The Pelican Brief - that some law student could somehow read materials from an obscure Louisiana case and extrapolate their significance to include a presumption that the case would eventually be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court - is just ridiculous. The odds that an attorney with 40 years of appellate experience, let alone a mere law student, could tie the significance of the assasination of several Supreme Court justices to this remote case in Louisiana is about as likely to happen as being struck by an UFO on the top of the Empire State Building. The Supreme Court accepts so few cases a year that there is little likelihood of being able to predict which petitions the Court will grant. Accepting this premise would be about as easy as accepting a filmmaker's decision to cast Shaquille O'Neal for a role playing Tyra Banks.Grisham uses the same tired, cliched themes throughout his novels (at least through The Client, which I completed and then determined not to waste any further time reading Grisham's works). Aren't people getting just a bit tired of his omnipresent theme that one cannot trust law enforcement, particularly the FBI? Don't the all-encompassing powers of the evil businesses and their shareholders stretch boundaries of credibility too thin? Do people actually enjoy reading works of fiction containing subplots that have no satisfying conclusion?The Pelican Brief is simply an altogether inadequate piece of fiction that has been churned out on the heels of The Firm, rather than painstakingly crafted by a writer with appreciation for quality writing. Please people, set higher standards for yourselves than this slop."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"No thrills and a pointless plot marr what could have been a pretty decent story.The whole thing is based on who wants to kill Darby and why. And that is where it falls apart. The FBI or CIA could have easily investigated faster and easier then she could, and what is the point of trying to kill her?To bury what is already out in the open? The FBI, CIA and White House all had a copy. What are they trying to silence? Nothing at all. Perhaps if it were just for revenge the plot might not have collapsed on itself."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"&quot;The Pelican Brief&quot; is an interesting novel.

All together &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot; is a good story of John Grisham."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"The book itself is well written. But Grisham introduced far too many characters and it is difficult to keep track of who is who. Also it is impossible that a young law student could write a file about the corruption in the white house, the FBI and CIA and that she and the Washington Post reporter Gray Grantham could uncover these corruption. It was not the best of Grisham book I've read, but it is exciting and interesting in reading!"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"I think John Grisham's &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot; is an excellent, well-written book. The tension increases extremely, so that you keep on reading and consequently cannot stop. It is really a great book full of action with great plot. The author is undoubtfully an expert at crime novels. But if you want to understand the whole action you have to know something about the American system of governmant, FBI and CIA. I recommend this book to really everybody!!!!! ENJOY!!!!"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"A young law student proposes a theory on a supreme court's judge murder. When this theory proves to be too close to the thruth, her life is in danger.The thought that only a young law student, brilliant as she might be, would come up with the right theory for these assasinations makes me happy this is only a story... I'd still like to believe that the FBI, CIA and other bodies who are supposed to handle these situations are far more compentent than pictured in this book... Sadly enough, most of them believe they aren't, especially after watching 'The X Files'."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Fresh after finishing 'The Firm' I had my wife pick up a copy of 'The Pelican Brief' and began to devour it as quickly as I could. It didn't take long to be captured by the character of Darby and her innocent way of life. We find out that quite by accident, Darby writes a 'brief' that quickly catches the attention of someone--WHO exactly that 'someone' is, well it takes a while to find that one out. It also takes a little while to figure out exactly what is IN the 'brief' to begin with. Now I am NOT a lawyer and it was a little high on techno-babble from a legal standpoint, but basically Darby makes a total assumption about some land in Louisiana, and it turns out to be right on the money: a plausible explanation of the deaths of two members of the Supreme Court. More than plausible, she is 100% right, which is when she get's the attention of those who would rather see the author of this mysterious 'brief' silenced. Darby is suddenly on the run, wondering whether or not her next move will be her last. Paranoid and terrified beyond words, Darby makes a desperate move and contacts a Washington Post reporter in hopes of convincing him of her story. It takes some doing, but he eventually comes around to her side, and this is where life becomes really interesting for Darby and her journalist friend. I have to say one thing about the movie version, Julia Roberts really WAS THE perfect choice to play Darby. Other than that, don't bother with the movie (as usual), go straight to the bookstore and grab a copy of 'The Pelican Brief' and sit back and enjoy. Another winner from Grisham."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Excellent Grisham book, my favorite so far, excellent plot twist when Khamel was killed, lower level of predictability, but it was still there.

The plot was well planned, the style is distinctive and the story, as i said it, very eventful and convincing. No flaws as far as i could tell. READ IT. It's not a MUST READ, but READ IT and Grisham could easily fits as your favourite writer, especially if you are a first time reader of his book.One thing though, do not compare this book with the film.

Her boyfriend/professor is a good friend of someone in the FBI and the file gets distributed. The bad guys find out about Darby, who apparently has hit the suspects right on and the chase begins.This book is very entertaining with nonstop action. You'll be constantly turning the page to see how Darby and friends etc keep escaping and how the plot will unfold.The only problems with the book are as follows:1 - The book has so many characters that it gets confusing at times2 - The book is all action and adventure and little else. Once it's done you'll never go back and read it again. This would make a very poor book club book.3 - A little over the top on the implied sex etc between Darby and her professor etc...

When her stab in the dark turns out to be right, the people behind the conspiracy stop at nothing to try to stop the brief from hitting daylight. With the help of Gray Granthum, a reporter, Darby searches for the evidence she needs to prove the brief is true.Let me just say, the book was good. It had suspenseful moments, the characters were believeable, and the story-plot itself ingenious...but the movie did better. The movie took the book and added more suspense, while staying true to the book. The movie also had two great actors, Julia Roberts as Darby and Denzel Washington as Gray, they brought the characters alive even more then the book, excellent acting. I would encourage reading this book, especially if you like Grisham. But I would say to not see the movie until after the book.

At the beginning of the novel, what excitement is that? I'd rather read a biography on Little Red Riding Hood! I found the danger, and ducking behind the shadows to be absolutely inticing.I think the character's are exciting, especially well Darby, and Khamel I was quite intrigued with as well. When Grisham writes I see what he writes, and then I watch the movie to see how close I was for fun, im a visual person so I really enjoy Grishams writing style."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"This book is a non-stop, action-packed murder mystery filled with multiple layers of fascinating tangled political, business, and romantic intrigues. John Grisham is at his finest in creating a dynamic reading experience about highly attractive charasmatic people who stumble upon the truth ... during their hedonistic lifestyle in one of America's most colorful cities, New Orleans. Darby Shaw is a twenty-something law student at Tulane University in New Orleans when she learns of the murders of two Supreme Court Justices. One of the victims, Abraham Rosenberg, is the most admired and often quoted law scholar by Thomas Callahan, her constitutional law professor and ... also her lover. The speculation is that conservatives will be apppointed to replace the two Justices. The impact of these expected appointments on the future interpretation of the law will create thunderstorms in the Judicial system well into the future for at least 10 years ...Darby secluded herself for four days in a law library, digging through briefs, dissents, books, newspapers, essays, and law opinions ... trying to discover what the two murdered Justices had in common. By accident, she stumbles upon a subject of passionate interest to both: the environment. Her tenacity and persistence paid off, she wrote a paper on her discovery and speculated who had the most to gain by their elimination. She gave the paper to her law professor who shared the suppositions with lawyer friend from his law school days, who now works as an attorney for the F.B.I. The head of the F.B.I. discovered the suspect had donated money to the President's last re-election campaign, all of which was deemed legal. The accusations against the suspect were dismissed as mere speculation by the White House ... Yet, in some circles where the paper had circulated, the topic unleashed a wild tiger which hunted for its prey, in this case, Darby Shaw.One significant turning point in the book is when Thomas Callahan and Darby are out for dinner in the Big Easy. Thomas had too much to drink. Darby cautions him to let her drive, he denies his inebriated state. They have a big fight over this and she storms off, deciding to walk rather than ride with him. After Thomas turns the key in the ignition, a huge explosion occurs flipping the Porsche and knocking Darby face-down on the sidewalk. She arises from a daze ... nearly in shock. One must read the book to discover how she becomes a fugutive from a world famous assassin whom she manages to allude. After Thomas' death, she realizes *she* was the intended victim. This book is an un-put-downable, page-turning, suspense-filled murder mystery which is solved after Darby partners with a Washington Post reporter. Both of them help unravel the reasons for the two murders and help bring the perpetrator to justice. This is a superb novel.Erika Borsos (erikab93)"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"This was a good book. It was very suspenseful and fun for me to read. I have read some of John Grisham's other books and I think he has a knack for writing dialogue. I thought the dialogue in his later books was better than the Pelican Brief, but it was still good in this book. The story of the Pelican Brief was very well thought up and interesting. It was a fast-paced story about a law student who's written a brief on her theory about the deaths of two supreme court justices. After surviving a car bomb that killed her boyfriend and law professor, Thomas Callahan, she disappears in an effort to survive the spies and agents sent after her by the US government. When she meets reporter Gray Grantham, I was sort of relieved because starts associating with people in the book who end up dying. Gray Grantham didn't seem like he was going to die, at least until he'd done something very helpful for Darby Shaw, the main character. I admire Darby Shaw for her bravery and determination in completing the brief as well as staying alive. Her character was a good part of the book. She was smart, cunning, and, as it was written, very attractive at the same time. She's also vulnerable, but strong enough not to let it ruin herself. This book has inspired me to write and think nothing of what people might say, but what I will force them to think about afterwards. I though this book was good over all. There are some places where the writing in slightly awkward. The book also starts off fairly slow, but then speeds up and becomes hard to put downwhich is very impressive considering that I don't read much at all. I'd recommend this book to people who are interested in in politics and definitely those who are interested in law."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"I gave this book 2 stars not because I didn't like the book, but because of the seller. The book was not signed as stated in the description. I also paid more than an unsigned copy would have cost."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"I normally like Grisham's work, and I think his first two novels were first-rate. THE PELICAN BRIEF, however, suffers from a remarkably silly plot.You're supposed to believe that a 25-year old law student is able to figure out something that the CIA, FBI, Supreme Court, and national media cannot. I'm a lawyer, and I found the legal aspect of this book to be absolutely ridiculous. I realize THE PELICAN BRIEF is meant to be escapist entertainment, but I think a plot has to be half-way credible in order for me to enjoy it.It didn't help that the characterization was paper-thin and on the level of caricature. The heroine of this book is beautiful and smart, but has very little real personality. She spends most of her time running from place to place, dodging inept assassins. Her two love interests in this novel are lecherous and not the least bit likable.If you've never read Grisham before, my advice is to skip this book and read THE FIRM or A TIME TO KILL instead. Those novels are far superior to THE PELICAN BRIEF."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"This is the third book I have read by Grisham, and so far I have really enjoyed each one. Grisham really knows how to write a good legal thriller. This book does not have any courtroom/court-case scenes, which I really enjoy, but it still kept my attention very well. Grisham gives you just enough \\"inside details\\" to keep you guessing without actually telling you the answer. For example: at one point, the clues seemed to point to Fletcher Coal being involved in the killings, but that was way off the mark in the end. This characteristic of Grisham's writings makes for a very enjoyable read.One of my few complaints about this book is the sudden romance between Gray and Darby. They had hardly even met before they seemed to become attracted, then it VERY quickly blossomed into an open show of affection, even though at the same time, Darby was supposedly mourning for Thomas. Even so, that is probably the main thing that seems wrong about this book, and it does not detract from the overall quality very much at all.Overall, this is a very captivating, page-turner book that really holds your attention. I highly recommend it, as well as Grisham's other books. So far, I have found Grisham to be an awesome writer of legal thrillers. I promise that you will not be disappointed.

Sure wish we didn't have to wait so long between new books."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"This was my third John Grisham book that I have read in the last two weeks and It may be my favorite. It was a little slow in the beginning, but once I got to about the third or fourth chapter I was finished in no time. 436 pages but each one turns easily with the reader eager to find out what is next. Great story, great characterization. Grisham may be my new favorite writer."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Let me start off by saying this: The Pelican Brief is not necessarily a bad book. It is not necessarily a bad book until you bother trying to compare it with other Grisham books.Why, then, was it so disappointing? After \\"The Firm,\\" I was ecstatic about trying to read another book of John Grisham's. \\"The Pelican Brief\\" was there so I decided to give it a try.It was disappointing.While I felt Mitch was a decently realistic character (in fact, a pretty interesting one at that), Darby was not appealing to me. Nor were any of the characters in \\"The Pelican Brief.\\" Often, I felt that the story moved so quickly that it took too long to process. The plot was unrealistic at best--in real life, there was no way Darby would survive. Mitch I could believe, Darby I could not. At times, I felt bored with Grisham's writing. I also personally wondered--how long could a person hold up under that psychologically? Perhaps the same is true of Mitch, but I felt that Darby would've broken down long before the ending.I also felt extremely discouraged by how the criminals chose to attack Darby for a brief that had little to no evidence. These people were people that knew how to make their way around the business world and knew that murders would only add weight to Darby's argument. They would most likely have waited in the shadows for solid evidence--and as there was originally none, the brief would've been tossed aside as a theory without any weight.I was highly disappointed by the ending. I didn't love the teacher-student relationship in the beginning but ok. People will love who they choose to love. I, however, felt extremely disappointed by how quickly Darby decided that she cared for Gray instead.The characters were a disappointment in the start. They never managed to redeem themselves in the finish.Overall, I was disappointed. Grisham should've thought this through a little more."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"This story of a girl on the run from a crazed industrialist is well done. If it seems there are a lot of clichees, remember that this book was so well done that it actually started the whole genre of person on the run from shady corporate? government? people. The protagonist is a law student who accidentally stumbles upon the solution to a crime (assassination of supreme court judges). Someone is trying to silence her. The entire story is her running, the people who are trying to help her, and the people who are trying to kill her. Not bad."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"... watch the movie instead.This book revolves around law student Darby Shaw and the brief she wrote which turns out to explain precisely why two Supreme Court justices were murdered. Once the brief has been read by the wrong (right?) people, she then must run for her life, helped by Washington Post reporter Gray Grantham.If you like reading John Grisham novels, you'll most likely enjoy this book. His style is very well established, and you can almost feel like you are reading a movie script due to the pace he injects into his stories. But personally, this is a case where the movie seemed to me more compelling than the book.A decent book, a better movie."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"All I can say is read this book. I had to read it for a project in school and was rather reluctant to. The length intimidated me and it seemed to be another law mystery novel. Then I started to read it and was instantly hooked. Darby Shaw, a law school student, and a reporter named Gray slowly unwravel the Pelican Brief, the murderer, and the motive in this suspenceful novel!"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"This is an alright book.It is no five star book but it is good.The plot is not that good but the way he sweeps you up in this girl and you just want to know what happens to her is a very good read.If you are looking for Grisham's best this is not it.But if you are looking for a good read then I recomened this book."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"This is the first Grisham book I have read and I am in the middle of it. I find the plot enjoyable, but the writing is stale, the charachters are poorly developed and the description, what little there is, leaves quite a bit to be desired. The story line is enjoyable and if this was writen by someone else with more skill for writiing, I would think it should be a wonderfull book. I like the aspect of espionage, but find the parts about the governmet layers boring. When the setting changes and Callahan enters the plot again, I don't mind reading. These chapters at least have a few semi-well developed characters and it is not a whole bunch of boring lawyer drible. In fact I rather like Callahan's character, but he plays a bit of a minor role in the plot so far. Well I won't bore you any more, you'll have to make your own call on this one, if you like a strong plot and don't mind bad writing, you would probably like this book"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"This book is good because it combines wit and action. Grisham uses his lawyer language perfectly to make it seem real. He also shows it through Darby Shaw. She is a law student at Tulane who knows what it is like in the real world. Her travels trying to elude the guys sent by the oil company bring her near to tears constantly. She figures out that no matter what, you need to tell someone about things that could be harmful. Grisham gets two thumbs up from me."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"_The Pelican Brief_ is an excellent, well written book. Grisham creates a masterful, enthralling yet realistic plot. It plays on several of my interests: government, the environment, and law. If you look closely, you can even find a good theme."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"I actually enjoyed &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot; more than I did &quot;The Firm.&quot; I realize I'm probably among the minority here; I just found &quot;Pelican&quot; to be a more gripping story and the endings of chapters to leave me wanting to read on. Perhaps this is because I avoided the movie version, which was a disappointment with &quot;The Firm.&quot; I'm not sure -- but I would recommend &quot;Pelican&quot; for those who already like Grisham."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Yeah Baby - go baby - yeah bab"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Best-seller? yeah. But it's BORING! I had to force myself to finish it. Cuz I'm not used to giving up in the middle. But I found this book totally boring."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Grisham writes suspense stories, and this one certainly qualifies. The plot involves a 24-year old girl who figures out a shocking double-murder and as a result is being threatened by Bad Guys. That certainly does lead to suspense! Of course, much of what happens in the story is illogical, but that's okay as long as the book works on its own terms.And the book often does work on its own terms. For example, at one point our Heroine witnesses an explosion. Shortly thereafter, a person identifying himself as a policeman comes over to her. But he's not really a policeman! That's clever, it's imaginative, it's masterful, and it increases the suspense.On the other hand, Grisham simply omits the part where the Heroine figures out who is behind the murders. That detracts only mildly from the suspense, but it displays quite a bit of laziness on the author's part, and it contributes significantly to the overall shallowness of the entire work.More surprising to me was the mishandling of a typical suspenseful situation. At one point, Our Heroine thinks she's doing okay. But she isn't: a Bad Guy is trying to kill her and a Good Guy is trying to save her. Well, what do most folks do with this sort of situation? They write about the race between these two people and that adds enormously to the suspense. Or, they could write about it from the Heroine's point of view, which is almost as good an option. Grisham, to his discredit, tells about the Heroine and the Bad Guy and omits the Good Guy. In theory, I guess this could work sometimes, but it sure doesn't in this case.This book is plenty of fun for the two or three hours it takes to read it. And it makes me wonder just how long Grisham took to write it."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"John Grisham, who has written many best-sellers, authored The Pelican Brief. The book is about a legal brief written by the main character, Darby Shaw, who is a law student. Darby's document is her theory about who committed the double assassination of two Supreme Court justices. The book is fiction, set in present day Washington D.C. and New Orleans, Louisiana. Another main character is Gray Grantham, a news reporter for the Washington Post.During the course of the book, Darby Shaw witnesses a murder. She is the intended victim. Luckily, she survives by not being in the car when it explodes. At this point, she realizes that she is being followed. While she tries to get away from the killers, she desperately searches for someone she can trust. The person she turns to is Gray Grantham, who helps her find out who is trying to kill her and why. John Grisham weaves an intricate story as Shaw and Grantham attempt to solve the mystery. If I were to give this novel a rating from one to ten, it would be a seven. The book is very intriguing but lacks action. For those who like law stories, this would be a great book to read. For ones like me who like action books, I would recommend it, but not highly. There is a movie based on this novel which I think is more exciting than the book. I say that because the movie is easier to understand and it doesn't have statements meaningless to the story. The novel is written in the third person. I prefer a book written in the third person because it gives a broader perspective."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"If there was a catgory for 0 stars, I would have selected that. It's depressing to realize that truly great modern literature is not being read by people today. Instead they read this boring trash and think they are reading a book by a great author. As a high school teacher, I am disturbed that great books are not being published any longer and that movies are actually being made using the garbage that is being published. I couldn't finish this book. About 2/3's of the way through when I had figured out the end, I asked my husband (who had read the entire book), if there wasn't really a surprise ending. He said &quot;no&quot;, and that I had figured it out. All I could think of was what was all the hoopla about. I didn't waste anymore time reading &quot;Pelican Brief&quot; and I guarantee you, I will never read another of his books. It's definately 8th grade mentality."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"The subject matter of THE PELICAN BRIEF was several years ahead of its time (seems to be the norm for John Grisham). Within the past few years, conspiracy theories have taken control of the spotlight in movies and books and I feel THE PELICAN BRIEF was a front runner to these other ideas.Tulane law student, Darby Shaw, has an idea that she didn't realize could mean her death. She came up with a theory that explained the assassinations of two Supreme Court justices, which occurred in one day. Darby writes a brief about this theory whose conspirator is an enemy of pelicans and other animals. Her boyfriend, and law professor, Thomas, gets killed by a car bomb meant for Darby, and she's on the run. While on the run, she meets Washington Post reporter, Gray Grantham, who is determined to get to the bottom of the assassinations and is willing to help her escape.As is Grisham's habit, he develops the characters so well that the reader can relate to every aspect of them. As Darby is running and hiding in New Orleans, I felt as if I was there, scared, smelling the scents that only New Orleans has, wondering if I'm being watched, panicked, etc.If I had to choose one of Grisham's strongest qualities of his writing it would have to be his character development. His characters emit emotions to the depth where the reader has empathy and actually lives that part in the story.THE PELICAN BRIEF is another excellent story and I highly recommend that if you haven't already read this book, you should definitely pick up a copy. It's enticing and action paced. The time will fly by when you're involved with this one!"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"John Grisham fans will not need to worry about being disappointed with this fast-paced thriller. The Pelican Brief, like many other novels that he has written is based on law. It has a thrilling plot and is suspenseful from the moment you lay your eyes on the first page. It will keep you reading into the small hours of the morning.Most of Grisham's characters are related to law or to the government. Thomas Callahan is a professor at law, while Darby Shaw is a student of law. The rest of the characters are government officials and such.The story begins with the murders of two supreme court justices. Supreme Court Justice Abe Rosenberg and Justice Glenn Jensen are both murdered on the same night by the same guy. Both murders where perfectly executed crimes. The murderer left no evidence and nothing for the government to pick up on.After hearing about the murders, Darby Shaw gets quite interested decides to do some investigating of her own. After a few days of skipping classes and thorough research Darby put together a theory on what she found. She discarded it later on facts she thought proved it false. Thomas Callahan, a professor at Tulane, is having an affair with Darby. He takes her theory to an old friend in D.C. thinking it was ingenious. His friend, Gavin, thought it was amazing and sent it to the White house. It got to the president and eventually made its way outside of the White house.When Thomas returned to Tulane, him and Darby went out to eat at a restaurant. Thomas got so drunk that Darby refused to ride with him. Thomas , being stubborn as he is, wouldn't let Darby drive and got in the car and when he started the engine a bomb went off. Darby hit her head on a bumper and got knocked out. While she was regaining consciousness a man dressed in a police uniform took her to a car asked her what her name was and then left her in the car. The police arrived soon after and found her lying there. The police deny that the man was part of the law enforcement.The police took Darby to a nearby hospital and told her to wait there for help. She leaves when they are out of sight and gets a room at a hotel. She calls the only person she can think of at the moment, Gavin. She then finds out that she is a suspect at the murder of Thomas and the only person she can trust is his best friend.This novel will take you through many twists and turns. It is gripping and will have you reading through to the very last word. Darby's theory has made someone very upset and they will go at all costs to have her executed. All Darby did was write down her best guess at the murders and now she is running for her life."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Don't expect anything and you will be blown away. Even though Grisham partially relies on obscuring knowledge his characters already have to keep the suspense, there are enough (unknown) parties in the plot to keep you turning the pages. Read it like a movie, it should go really well with popcorn."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"It is rare for a book to be equally as brilliant as the one that preceded it, but that is exactly what happens with John Grisham's latest thriller about a law student running for her life. The Pelican Brief refers to the title of a legal brief written by a law student named Darby Shaw who writes a brief explaining who she thinks may have assassinated two Supreme Court justices. When her mentor / lover gets a hold of it the wrong people learn of it's existence and now they must have Darby killed because her brief is dead on perfect. Turning to a reporter named Gray Grantham Darby must go on the run and expose the truth. Darby is a well-written and developed character and so is Gray who is smartly written and not just a stereotypical black man. Full of action and intrigue the Pelican Brief is a fantastic read."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Pelican Brief isn't one of Grisham's strongest novels but it's certainly a page-turner, it moves with amazing speed, and it's a heck of a lot better than some of his later stuff, like The Street Lawyer or A Painted House. Many of Grisham's novels rely upon courtroom drama - on one lawyer versus another, with some clever legal or psychological trick thrown in for good measure. Pelican Brief relies almost totally on action. Two Supreme Court justices die on the same day. Darby Shaw, a law student comes up with an ingenious theory - they were shot and strangled by an international terrorist so that the conservative president would appoint new, conservative justices who will help out a case involving an industrialist who's no friend of the tree-huggers. Darby's boyfriend, Thomas, gets dissected by a car bomb meant for Darby. She uses her 'get out of hospital free' card and hooks up with a Washington Post reporter, Gray Grantham. But bad guy terrorist is after her and everyone starts dying...Pelican Brief's a fun story - not to be taken too seriously - and will provide an entertaining few hours while the dinner's cooking. But don't expect too much else."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"If you are looking for a book with pelicans, you've come to the wrong place. The title is decieving - pelicans don't even make a &quot;brief&quot; appearance. Nonetheless, this and other Grisham novels provide the kind of predictable fodder that middle Americans seem to sop up like gravy with white bread. There is no literary merit, but no one cares because that isn't the point."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"John Grisham's \\"The Pelican Brief\\" is a thriller that takes a young Tulane University law student named Darby Shaw from a life focused on her studies and a love affair with a professor to a life threatened by death at every corner brought on by the assassinations of two Supreme Court justices. The plot unfolds after the release of a legal brief written by Darby that exposes suspects and a motive behind the slayings of the justicesThe story begins in Washington D.C. with the assassination of the liberal Justice Rosenberg in his home by a lone shooter. The same assassin strangles the conservative Justice Jensen the same night in a nearby gay porn cinema. The media immediately jumps all over the assassinations and begins spreading conspiracy theories. These assassinations are the basis of the story's plot.The story shifts focus to Darby Shaw and her lover and professor, Thomas Callahan, in New Orleans. Darby is a dedicated law student at Tulane who decides to research and write a legal brief, \\"The Pelican Brief,\\" exposing who assassinated the justices and what their motive was. Little did Darby know, her brief accurately identified the conspiracy behind the assassinations and set in motion the crisis of \\"The Pelican Brief.\\"Darby shows the report to her lover Thomas. He is intrigued by the theory and sends a copy to his friend Gavin Verbeek, a lawyer for the FBI. Gavin in-turn shows the brief to other friends and soon enough the brief is being read by several government agencies throughout Washington, to include the White House.After a night out drinking in New Orleans, Darby fails to convince a very drunk Thomas not to drive home. Thomas is killed when his car explodes. Thomas's death turns Darby's life upside down. She is now a target of the same assassin that killed the justices and now her lover. Darby turns to one of Thomas' friends for help but he is quickly killed by the assassin. She becomes even more suspicious of everything and everyone. She is afraid that anyone she turns to will end up dead. She seems almost accepting that her fate is sealed. She is convinced that she will stay on the run hiding in alleys but eventually she will be found and killed.She uses disguises and frequently changes hotels trying to stay one step ahead of the assassin \\"Patience will get me (Darby) killed. They're after me\\" (Grisham, 1992, p. 146). Eventually Darby relents and realizes that her running cannot continue she will soon run out of places to hide. Darby seems defeated and reluctantly reaches out to a reporter for help. Darby leaves New Orleans and travels to New York and eventually meets Gray Grantham, the Washington Post reporter. She remains very cautious keeping her disguises and moving covertly and only meeting Gray on her terms to maintain a low profile.Darby frequently reminisces about life before she wrote the brief. She thinks often about Thomas and how much she loved him and misses him \\"but after her eyes open...her first thought was always of Thomas\\" (Grisham, 1992, p. 197). Yet she sees no future for herself, as if her life ended with Thomas. Darby seems to be on a mission to survive not for the sake of saving her life but to not let the assassin win.Grisham shifts occasionally from Darby's struggle for survival to the actions taking place at the White House and other government agencies. The White House receives information that the brief might describe the President receiving campaign contributions from the assassin. The White House is feverishly trying to determine who wrote the brief, what it says about the president and who else has read the brief. The CIA and other agencies are searching frantically for clues and developing contingency plans in case the president is implicated.Darby is getting tired of running and is getting desperate to find safety. Gray convinces her that they must find evidence to support the brief and go public with the story. After several meetings with Gray, Darby slowly lets down her guard and begins to trust him \\"His face said \`Trust me' And why not\\" (Grisham, 1992, p. 247). She even begins to gain hope that Gray will be able to help.Darby and Gray travel to Washington and go on the offensive. Her mission has changed from surviving to pursuing the assassin \\"I'm just trying to nail the man\\" (Grisham, 1992, p. 322). She is after the evidence to get justice for Thomas. The tension ratchets up when Darby and Gray finally track down the tapes that prove the brief. Although she is still in danger, Darby gains the upper-hand when she and Thomas arrive at the Washington Post office with the tape and brief in hand. She lays out her demands to the editor and staff. Darby gets vindication when the newspaper editor calls the White House and the lawyer for the assassin to break the news. Darby knows that now the story will be published exposing the conspiracy and giving Thomas justice.Darby has come to trust Gray, but she still does not trust anybody else. To ensure that she is not followed, she demands a getaway that includes several detours to avoid being followed. She will never fully trust everybody but she has found peace on an island in St Thomas and a friend in Gray.Grisham's \\"The Pelican Brief\\" is an exciting thriller that follows a law student as she narrowly escapes death in her pursuit to get justice for her lover. Darby Shaw goes from New Orleans to New York and onto Washington to expose an assassination conspiracy that reaches up to the White House.Grisham, J. (1992). The Pelican Brief. New York: Doubleday."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"The novel, The Pelican Brief, by John Grisham, proved to be extremely enjoyable. The Pelican Brief is an extremely suspenseful novel. Grisham provides this suspense and mystery by withholding the outcomes of important events and by keeping secret identities. Because of these tactics, the reader becomes more anxious to discover the outcome of the novel, making this a book that is impossible to put down. The plot of the novel is also complex. Many different stories are occurring simultaneously. These subplots are then connected to form the greater overall plot. Because of the many events occurring, it is necessary that the reader pay attention at all times. The final positive aspect of this novel is the detail with which Grisham describes his characters. Grisham goes to great lengths to describe both the protagonist and the antagonist, giving the reader a sense that he or she is in the story. Some aspects of the book, however, could turn away some potential readers. One such aspect is the sometimes gratuitous violence and gore that is used in the novel. People in the story are strangled to death and run over with cars. More squeamish people would not find this book appealing. Another negative point of the novel is the sexual references that appear throughout the book. There is much talk of pornographic theaters and some references to sexual acts. The final aspect of the book that could be offensive to some people is the constant reference to homosexuals and the homosexual community. Much of the conflict starts over a closet homosexual who is killed when visiting a gay pornography theater. As a result, many events throughout the story focus on the aforementioned subject, which could prove to be uncomfortable to some people. Overall, the novel, The Pelican Brief, was enjoyable to read. It was extremely fast-paced and hard to put down, although the references to sex and pornography do grow tiresome. As with several other Grisham novels, this book would be best recommended to people with an interest in law. People who feel at least moderately comfortable with sexual references and violence would probably also enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"A quick, enjoyable read that tells us almost nothing about anything in the book. It is a plot (a discovery of a motive for the death of two supreme court justices) that Grisham struggled to find characters for.Oh well... I wish I wrote enough books to have a few panned by the critics..."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Much can be said about John Grisham, but I will always defend for being one of the best suspense writers ever.'The Pelican Brief' is another example for that. It's hard to ignore the awesome movie and not to think of Roberts and Washington, but when doing it, you have a lot of fun. The book is much more provocative and has a lot of suspense. It's the typical page-turner, a book hard to put away.This is not his best book, but it's one his real good ones."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"My husband cannot understand why I prefer to read a book before I see the movie because it's such fun to see what they leave in, what they take out, how they cast the characters, etc. But I didn't have the opportunity to do so with this book. It was the wonderful movie with Denzell Washington and Julia Roberts which sent me looking for Grisham's books. I've been reading them in the order in which he wrote them and have found them all wonderful. The Pelican Brief exhibits very well something I often find in Grisham's work - the expert unfolding of the story and of the details about the characters' lives. This book, in particular, has a complex plot and a secret long-held within the pages of the book (and as well in the movie) that keeps you spell-bound. I found both main characters to be interesting and I kept wanting to know more about how they thought and how they ticked as they tried to save their lives. Read the book first and then see the movie!"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Pelican Brief, like the other Grisham that I have read, is a stop everything else and read-til-the- end book.

Plot twists(of course) and a sexy female lead character make it a good addition to the bookshelf. For me, however, it went by like a piece of juicy fruit gum-it tasted good but there was not much to remember after I spit it out. It's clear Grisham harkened back to his college days as the book has a lot of law school type memories. I'd like to see grisham write about a topic other than law and clancy something other than the military. but, buy pelican brief, at this price how can you resist?"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"It was a great book filled with a lot of suspense and action.

Number one, part of it deals with politics which I don't necessarily like in a fiction book. And number two it had a few elements which were similar to the Firm such as the FBI and the goons following the main character. However, as I kept on reading, it turned out to be a pleasant surprise. A good plot surfaced complete with smart characters. I ended up liking the book. It isn't the best I've ever read, but good nonetheless."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"This book has one of the qualities that make a story particulary interesting, Suspense. Not only has Grisham set the stage for a truly exciting adventure early in the book, but the fact that the name of the person who hired to kill the two Supreme Court justices was witheld until later in the book is excellent. Grisham's writing in The Pelican Brief is clever and witty. He follows the same lines in writing as could be seen in The Firm and The Client. Grisham is a truly fabulous writer who, hopefully has many more books to come."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Very cool book, even though I read it purely because I was told to."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"I don't really know why this book got so acclaimed as it did.

Grisham is simply the best!"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"In The Pelican Brief by John Grisham, suspense is used to keep the reader's attention. Darby Shaw is an innocent student of law who comes up with a theory as to who committed murders, and she calls this the Pelican Brief. Unbenownced to her, she has uncovered the true murderers. When they get a hold of her brief, her world changes drastically. Grisham uses a tactic where he leads the reader in one direction and then suddenly the story goes a different direction. We come to realize that this type of device used by Grisham often makes us keep reading because we want to find out what is going to happen to the character in the next scene.At the beginning of the novel, Grisham lacks the use of suspension. This makes it hard for us to read when we have no real drastic change that quickly changes our point of view. As soon as Thomas Callahan dies from a car explosion we come to realize that Darby's life is at stake. When she is scared and is living in hotels where anyone can find her, we are left in suspense where we don't know what is going to happen to her. Later on in the novel, we follow Darby and Gray Grantham through the underground just waiting for them to be caught.In the end the device of suspense is what keeps the reader interested throughout the novel. It keeps us waiting to find out if the good or the evil of the world will win the battle. Any part of a novel without suspense, which we discover in the beginning, is not keeping our attention. Once our opinions keep changing we keep wanting to read more and more about how the character ends up. Suspension helps make us more open to new opinions and quick changes in our own world; although, Grisham uses this to make us more attentive to his story."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"This book was my first introduction to the amazing writing style of John Grisham. His legal expertise is obvious in any of his writings and it really comes through in this particular tale.Darby Shaw is the classic \\"all-American girl next door.\\" (Fittingly depicted by Julia Roberts in the ensuing movie) Working on a legal brief at Tulane, Shaw stumbles upon \\"the brief.\\"\\"The Brief\\" is the classic tale of power and corruption, placed, interestingly enough, in New Orleans. After her realization that possession of the brief, or the knowledge of the contents, is a stamp to certain death, Shaw looks to escape and get her story out.Her professor is killed in a tragic car bomb just minutes after Shaw left his side, and she knows she has to flee.At the same time, Gray Grantham (aptly portrayed by Denzel Washington) is a DC reporter who has been alerted to \\"the brief\\" by a mysterious Garcia.Eventually, Grantham and Shaw hook up, discover who Garcia was and how he was killed, and eventually uncover the mysteries of \\"the brief\\"--a web that streches to the very top of the Washington power structure.In the end, good always wins, and Grisham does a great job of pulling us through this one with style, suspense, and wholesome reading."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"When one thinks of the name John Grisham, the image of an author of legal thrillers more than likely comes to mind. John Grisham has been knocking off about a book a year for the past decade, and all of them in some way have been related to the law.The Pelican Brief is no exception. While it has to do more with the Supreme Court and law students than with practicing lawyers, law is a major topic in the book. Joining law are the topics of assassination, cover-ups, and brilliant theories.The PlotDarby Shaw is a second-year law student at Tulane. She is a brilliant student, and enjoys a relationship with Thomas Callahan, her Constitutional Law professor. Thomas has a particular liking for Supreme Court Justice Abe Rosenberg. Rosenberg is one of the most hated men in the country, so it is not much of a surprise when Rosenberg is murdered-any number of people and groups could be suspects.What is a surprise is when another Supreme Court Justice, Glenn Jensen, is murdered on the same night. The two judges have almost no viewpoints in common and seem like an unlikely pair. Soon, every FBI agent is on the case, and hundreds of eager-beaver law students are scouring the court dockets, looking for a case that might disclose a possible motive.Among these student researchers is Darby Shaw. She comes up with a unique theory of her own, and even goes so far as to write up a brief about it. It becomes known as \\"The Pelican Brief.\\" Darby gives her writing to Callahan, who passes it off to Gavin Verheek, a high-ranking friend of his at the FBI. From there, Darby forgets about it.A week later, Darby and Callahan go out to dinner, and Callahan becomes drunk. Darby refuses to ride home with him, which means that she sees Callahan's car explode. Callahan is dead-and she was supposed to be with him. Suddenly, it appears to Darby that her brief was right on target. I'll let your imagination take it from there.So, what'd I think of it?Why did I like this one? First of all, It is a mystery involving death. That always means a few points on the scorecard. Second, enough details were given that I could follow each of the main characters' trains of thought. Third, I liked the inclusion of the newspaper reporter (didn't mention that, did I?) once Darby's other sources are, um, no longer available. I learned a lot about the process of law through Grisham's books, and in this one, I got to learn some about the process of news writing in this book as well.So should someone read it?Sure, why not? Seriously, if you're into lawyer stories or stories of bringing down the bad guy, it's a fun book. It's also a decently simple read. The pages go quickly. The Pelican Brief, book and movie, is a fun story that's worth the time invested."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"When I got into this Story I couldn't put it down! This book was interesting and engaging. Although at times the plot seemed to drag, overall it was a good quick read. Anyone who enjoys a good suspense thriller will like this book. Grisham's detail of the main character Darby Shaw, makes you actually feel empathy for her and you find yourself pulling for her throughout the book.This novel draws you in and keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. It is an engaging book loaded with excitement!"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"I must admit that I enjoyed this book very much. It moves quickly, spurred by an action - based plot. Though it lacks the human compassion and empathy Grisham displays in THE CHAMBER, the characterisation is still passable, with Darby emerging from the print with strength and vividness. The story itself is interesting and somewhat unique, though not greatly so. Some surprising plot twists. Unlike most of Grisham's other works, THE PELICAN BRIEF dwells more on politics that on law. I would recommend this book as a decent read."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"This book wasn't bad,and it wasn't that great. The book was streched way too long. But the plot was good. These two supreme judges were killed by the same person, and this woman wrote a brief on who she thought did it. She gives it to her lab professor, who hands it over to a FBI lawyer. When the professor later is killed by a car bomb, the woman, whose name is Darby, flees. When the same FBI Lawyer chases after her to protect her, he is killed also. Then Darby calls a reporter, and they team up to unmask the killer. This was a pretty decent book, better than some of John's other books. I recommend you read this book."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Once again Grisham follows a familiar recipe for suspense: Innocent good guys + mean bad guys + happy ending. The half star comes from the fact that there is a little mystery involved, however, once again Grisham ends his novel in a hokey, hero flies away with new life, happy ending.If you are a fan of Grisham, read this book. If not, skip it or rent the movie."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"I enjoyed this book. Grisham wants to capture the attention of the reader. And it works although there are a few unbelievable elements in the book. But these unrealistic elements are necessary. I wish the government would react to the opinion of students more often.

You learn about the American system of law, the work in the Oval Office and the Supreme Court. There is always tension in this well written book. When I started it, I could not stop reading. The book is a bestseller, which does not always show something of its quality, but here it does. I think it was a good idea that the truth appears almost in the end of the book, that makes it so exciting. The book is not only a book about crime, it is also a love story between Gray and Darby and a thriller. A very commendable book!"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Annotation: The Supreme Court justices are assinated with no know infomation, a Tulane law student finds an unlikley suspect. She has to run and hide because they want her dead, because she exposed the Pelican Brief.Author Bio: The Pelican Brisf was written by John Grisham. Before he became an author he worked 60-70 hours a week at a law practice. His first hit was the firm and it was huge. john also writes law books. some other books that he has written was A Time to Kill and the Chamber.Evaluation: The book the Pelican Brief was one of the best books i have ever read. I thought the book made you think, and try to figure out the next twist in the book. i never got lost durring the book which i normaly do, so the author did a great job to catch my attention. My favorite part of the book was the part when Thomas is blown up in his car and Darby was with the killer taht said he was a cop. that forces her to go on the run knowing that someone is out to kill her. the book was put together great and i would give it a 5 on a scale of 1 to 5. That is my evaluation of the Pelican Brief."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"The Pelican Brief, by John Grisham, is a thriller guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat. This book is about Darby Shaw, a Tulane law student, who uncovered a massive conspiracy involving a prestigious law firm and of all things, pelicans. Darby Shaw gets caught up in whirlwind of adventure because she wrote a brief that linked, Victor Mattiece, an important contributor to the President, to the murders of two Supreme Justices. The result was her being the subject of a manhunt and many left dead in her wake, including her lover and professor.The story's action includes the rush to gather evidence for the biggest \\"newspaper story since Watergate.\\" It leads to Gary Grantham meeting up with Darby Shaw and the two teaming up to bring down the White House. The subplots include a romance between the two protagonists. Another is Gray Grantham's own quest to gather evidence to get a big news story and to revive his career. The book is very exciting and makes you keep the book until you finish it.The book is very suspenseful and leaves the reader wanting to learn more at the end of every chapter. The book starts out a little slowly with the exceptions of the assassinations, but it gradually picks up speed. The first part of the book describes the characters and sets up the rest of the book, but after that there is a good deal of action. This is also a romantic novel in which the main character deals with the loss of her lover to the romance of her with another. Another strength of the book is that there is a lot of detailed description of the characters. For example, when we are introduced to Victor Mattiece, we see him as \\"his skin was leathery and dark bronze. His bare feet were lined with ugly veins. His toenails were long and yellow.\\" This provides a very vivid picture.Although the book is suspenseful, the book's \\"puzzle pieces\\" do not fall together until the end. The book is very tricky and misleading. For example, at the beginning, the book makes you think that a certain person is a bad guy only to learn in the end that that he was working undercover for the CIA. Another weakness is that this book does not mention the main antagonist many times, and the ending leaves you hanging. The ending shows Darby Shaw and Gray Grantham, a reporter, getting together, but nothing about Victor Mattiece getting captured or anything.The other main weakness is mostly the lack of development of the characters, especially the main character. What we know about Darby Shaw is mostly at a surface level. For example, we know that she feels sad for the death of her lover. However, we do not see it greatly or she does not make other people think that way. Another weakness is actually its strength. Although the book has a lot of details, the book focuses too much on them and does not really go deeply into the action. For example, when the car bomb killed her lover, we see a lot of Darby's emotion and shock, but we do not see description of how the car looked.The book is a good read for people who like adventure with a little bit of law mixed in. I will give it 7 out of 10 stars, because it was very exciting with only a few minor weaknesses. The book has some very exciting scenes. I recommend this book for people who like thrillers, but do not mind a show start."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"This was one of the ones that I couldn't put down. It's way more suspenseful than the movie!"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"The Pelican Brief, by John Grisham, is an excellent book that I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a book full of suspense and action. Grisham uses foreshadowing, and suspense in The Pelican Brief, to keep the reader's attention. This book is hard to put down once you have begun reading because of all the action and the anticipation of what will happen next. Grisham uses foreshadowing to clue the reader as what to expect to come, but he does not give away what will happen. The little clues here and there, are vague enough that you do not know what exactly will happen or when it will happen which makes the book even more suspenseful. For example, before Justice Rosenberg and Justice Jensen are murdered Grisham keeps the dialogue focused on how Rosenberg and Jensen refuse to let the FBI follow them to the extent the FBI would like to. In this quote, the narrator is talking about how Justice Rosenberg dislikes the FBI or cops near him. Therefore, he does not allow them in certain areas. \\"The Justice allowed no FBI agents near him. They could follow in their car, and they could watch his townhouse from the street, and they were lucky to get that close.\\" Statements like that keep the book interesting and suspenseful and gradually clue the reader that a big event is about to occur. Grisham alludes to the danger they are in by continually repeating that they are the only two Justices that do not allow the FBI to cover all areas of their life. The setting of this book is in present day Washington D.C. and New Orleans, Louisiana. This book is an excellent book that I would recommend to any reader who enjoys reading suspense books. This book is almost impossible to put down once you begin reading it."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Another Great Grisham Novel! I personally loved this novel. Even if you're a person who doesn't like to read much, once you start reading this, you'll be at the edge of your seat, reading for hours. The novel had a great plot line and good characters too. Whenever you suspect someone in the novel, you suddenly find out you were wrong the whole time. Grisham used a lot of creativity and suspense to make the novel an enjoyable one.The reason I liked the novel is because I enjoy reading suspense-building novels and even law-firm stories. Although it didn't have as much to do with lawyers as most of his other books, it's still enjoyable. I also liked it because of the characters. Another thing that made it great is the story.(Textual evidence- pg. 291)\\"...She left and Gray turned to Darby. He pointed to a set of doors that appeared to lead to the only hallway.

And should definantly be read."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"I loved the way the book kept me on the edge of my seat trying to figure out what the heck was going on. The suspense level was high, the story great, and the character fun to read about. Highest reccomendation"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Grisham has been quoted as saying that he created the character Darby Shaw with actress Julia Roberts in mind. This girl is just too darn perfect-looking to be real. And, oh how convenient that she has a trust fund and doesn't have to work for a living. Now I realize Grisham's novels aren't necessarily about &quot;everyday&quot; life--but when the characters are believable and true to life, then in my opinion it's easier to suspend your disbelief and go along for the ride. I'm sorry, but I just can't work up any sympathy for this woman. I actually rooted for the bad guys in this one. By the end of the book, when she's out of the country in her little tropical paradise playing coy with her hero, I'm thinking, &quot;what took you so long, you dingbat?&quot; This book just felt too mass-produced--as though Grisham were starting to write with an eye on what would make a good movie rather than a good book. (The two aren't always related, you know) Still, as mindless escape fare, this one's not bad. Judging by how well it sold and how many people were reading it in Florida when I was there in 1994, it fills that bill pretty well. But that's about it. It's certainly not &quot;must reading&quot; in my book. Grisham's done better. ."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"I enjoyed reading almost the whole novel. I skipped a few irrelevant dialogues and it didn't affect my understanding. However, the novel does have some obscure parts as some other American reviewers stated. For example, John Grisham interrupts sometimes the readers with his personal commentaries. He must've wanted to express what many readers would be thinking or feeling, however it can be annoying sometimes.Back to the good points: the characters are very human, one reviewer from TN said he could relate to the novel's characters. John did a superb job in describing the tense working situation that arouse many times between bosses and subordinates (especially between the president and Voyles, the FBI director) and all the political games involved, especially the media and public manipulation. Sometimes it seems that there are only two good guys in the novel: the Washington Post's reported Gary Grantham (and even he himself is a bit tricky) and Darby Shaw (who finds the real bad guy). All other don't care much about justice being done:-One of the assassinated Supreme Cout memebers, Abraham Rosenberg, was one of those judges who are lenient with criminals. For example, he supported a guy (Nash) who was found to posses an AK-47 assault rifle and he had charges of drug trafficking. It is so wimpy to try to justify AR.-Voyles negotiates with the president to stop investigating some murder suspects if the president stops blaming the FBI for mistakes in protecting the two Supreme Courts judges assassinated (who didn't want to be protected in first place). The president himself starts the negotiation. The president's top assistant, Coal Fletcher, is merciless with all the employees.-The heroine's professor, Tom Callahan is only interested in pleasures, especially sex and if it wasn't enough he admires Rosenberg. His friend at the FBi is much like him (otherwise they wouldn't be friends). I never liked that character, Tom, and I actually liked when he's bombed when he was about to drive a Porsche while drunk; thanks for that part John.-Even the heroine is a hypocrite. On one hand she wants to make a living out of suing chemival companies and on the other hand she invests on those very same companies. This seems to be takes out of the anti-liberal book \\"Do as I say (not as I do) where they say this is what Michael Moore does.-The bad guys are....bay guys. Some of them were not clearly identified as other reviewer said, but it's well understood those ones were small fishes. It looks unbelievable that a normal student -Darby- could run away from experienced murders, but you'll find who was helping her almost at the end of the book. This was right what Agatha Christie and many other writers used to do. You can found this action (explanations at the story's end) even in Scooby-Doo cartoons and movies!Perhaps John strained the readers from knowing who the one behind all the murders was, but that's a standard tool of writers. It wasn't so bad of him, except for the fact that Fletcher Coal becomes the bad guy for most of the book when it was him who advised the president not to interfere with FBI's investigations. Meanwhile, the real murder does whatever he wants...which is what happens in real life all too often. Meanwhile John shows us how authorities behave. This novel was not so much about the typical cat-after-the-mouse chase, but how people behave in their jobs in the government and the media. It was also interesting to read how John described the way Gray, Darby and the Washington Post's staff (all imaginary of course) organized the publication of the final article where they denounced the murderers. Of course all of these descriptions are only clues about how things work in real world.Yes, give this novel a chance and read it with all your imagination."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Good character development and a good story give it 2 stars. What I didn't like: too political: right wing conspiracy big oil vs environment. Then the ending: had to escape...CIA/FBI helped her, but no detail as to HOW SHE ACTUALLY ESCAPED!

The Pelican Brief starts out with the deaths of two Supreme Court judges, who get assassinated by a mysterious assassin named Khamel. Now law student Darby Shaw takes a shot in the dark and writes a brief on who killed the two Supreme Court judges. Now once she finishes it, she then gives it to her lover and professor to read it, then the FBI get their hands on it, and also the President who is intrigued by this little brief.Now as the brief gets around, Darby's professor is killed by a car bomb which was intended for him and her! But she escapes thanks to his drunken state. Now she is on the run, and the killers want her dead at any cost. Then she runs into a Washington Post writer, and they get into contact. She tells him about the brief and joins the hunt for a mysterious man named &quot;Garcia&quot; who works for this huge firm in D.C.Now escaping death many times, Darby then finds out who &quot;Garcia&quot; really is, they then discover the whole thing, and they report it in print, and now everyone is going down; including some of the President's men. Why did the huge firm want the Supreme Court judges dead? Simple. It was a case that involved a case involving the marshlands, and oil, the firm wanted to win the case, but they knew that they were going to lose if it went to the Supreme Court, so they hired a trained assassin to kill the two judges so if they can be replaced with two new judges. Interesting? I thought so."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"I think that an average customer rating of 3 1/2 stars is good for this book. It may not have been the best book I have ever read (thrid grade writing) or the worst I have ever read (try The Secret History or A Map of the World). I thought that the Pelican Brief was an enjoying, fast paced, and occasionally scary read. On a dark night in Washington D.C., a man disgusied as a jogger sneaks into an invalid's house and kills him, his nurse, and the cop guarding him. On the same night, within a porno house, another man is strangled to death. The next day America awakens to find that two key Supreme Court Justices have been assasinated. And in Harvard Law School, a beautiful young woman writes a legal brief...Darby Shaw was only guessing. She never meant what she wrote. Her guess at the murder was completely a joke. But all of a sudden she is witness to a car bomb and her boyfriend is dead- which was meant for her. This sends Darby into hiding from numerous assisins and she may only be saved by Gray Grantham, an aspiring newsreporter looking for his story. I did like The Pelican Brief, but I felt it was too easy to read. I also would have liked it more if Grisham had delved into Gray's character a little more. But it was much better than the pitiful The Firm, which restored my faith in John Grisham."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"As several other reviewers here have noted, the plot of this novel is based on numerous implausibilities. The biggest, to me, were- that somebody could predict years in advance that a court case would reach the Supreme Court.- that the bad guys would try to kill people connected to the brief when precisely that would only reinforce the credibility of an otherwise rather far-fetched theory.- that the protagonist is so reluctant about sharing her brief with the world, when disseminating it would be the easiest way of ensuring that killing her had no further value for the bad guys (and indeed, they run as soon as the story is finally published).To compound these issues, the novel ends with essentially the same escapist ending as _The Firm_, the Grisham novel I'd read prior to this one.However, despite all these weaknesses, this was an entertaining book that made for a fun 2 days of reading. As a further redeeming merit, Grisham had a surprising flash of brilliance when he equipped this novel (written in the early 1990s) with a dimwitted, hands-off, U.S. president, run by his handlers, whose interests were mainly playing golf, packing the Supreme Court with rabid right wingers, and doing favors to his cronies."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"This is my favorite book by Grisham.

The character development is good throughout the novel, but the plot remains pretty much the same. it was the typical struggle between government and the people.Personally, I thought the novel was pretty good. I do believe he has done better. I also think that if you've ever seen the movie, and didn't especially like the ending, you should read the book."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"The Pelican Brief could have been better, but nonetheless was another example of author John Grisham's ability to write suspenseful, gripping novels about lawyers and other law-involved figures. I am a Republican and conservative, and contrary to another opinion I read I enjoyed it immensly. However, if you have yet to read his book such as The Runaway Jury, The Firm, or The Partner, then you may wish to read these first. Grisham is undoubtedly one of the best authors of today, and this book is another example of his fine work."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"&quot;The Pelican Brief&quot; by John Grisham is an exciting novel with an amazing plot. It begins by introducing the character Khamel, a crazed killer who is paid to murder two Supreme Court Justices, named Rosenberg and Jensen, both who have received many death threats but refuse to let the FBI protect them.In New Orleans at Tulane University, Darby Shaw, an attractive second year law student, was trying to sove the mystery behing the killings. Darby had a thirteen page brief on who she thought killed the justices. The brief was passed on to many people and it finally came to the President, who after reading the report became very scared. The FBI wanted to pursue the lead, but after a phone call from the President that told them to back off it, they decided to look at other suspects.In the meantime, reporter Gray Grantham received a call in the middle of the night from &quot;Garcia&quot; who said that he might know something about the case.Darby was on a date with her lover/professor when he got a little too drunk to drive. Darby insisted that she drive or walk, and to her surprise, he told her to walk. When the professor got into his car and started the engine, the car exploded, killing him on the spot. Darby called a friend of the professor, Gavin, and told him what happened because he was the first to see the brief which was later named &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot;.Through all of this chaos, Darby managed to stay alive and found time to meet Gray Grantham in Washington D.C. He learned her entire story and in order to confirm it all, they had to find &quot;Garcia&quot;. They knew that he was a lwyer at a small firm in Washington D.C., so they asked the many interns there if they recognized a picture of him. One out of seven did, so they go to meet him. To their surprise, &quot;Garcia&quot; was mugged and killed on the streets.&quot;The Pelican Brief&quot; is a wonderful book that contains a variety of charaters and twists that I think everyone should read. This book has just about every element that makes up a good book; suspense, mystery, murder, law, and love all put together in a perfect mixture that will make your head spin. John Grisham is an awesome writer and I look forward to reading more of his fantastic novels."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"I enjoyed this book. While I don't put it on the same level as Steinbeck, Tolstoy, or Shakespeare, it lived up to my expectations: It was an enjoyable read all around. I enjoyed &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot; more than &quot;The Firm,&quot; despite the fact that the latter is probably the more popular of the two. Perhaps that is because I chose to avoid the movie version of &quot;Pelican,&quot; while I was thoroughly disappointed with the movie version of &quot;The Firm.&quot; I don't know. While I would recommend either book, however, I would probably recommend &quot;Pelican&quot; slightly more emphatically."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"The pelican brief is a slow but exiting book which is the base of the book for the movie: The Pelican Brief.

That was never in doubt.So, not so scary.What was interesting was Grisham's description of the law firms, and the lawyers, in Washington, D.C. This was eye-opening, the numbers, the morals, and the career ladder that such people follow.What was interesting, but stupid, was the President. It's hard to imagine a President this stupid, but I wonder was the model Mr. Ron? And this golfer President turns the real business of running the nation over to a young smoothy by the name of Fletcher Coal, who is one of the \\"bad guys,\\" in a way, but he has some good traits, too: He can work incessantly and seems to be pretty intelligent. He just lacks, what, heart?I've read better books by Grisham. There is a story here, but not a page-turning story. Just kind of, \\"Okay, who's going to fail to assassinate Darby this time?\\"I didn't see the movie, but the book seemed to be tailor-made for Hollywood, also, another down-side (compare Grisham's Bleachers, a more recent effort, which does not seem to be targeted so prominently toward a movie script).Diximus."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"I read this book a few years ago. Girl's boyfriend is blown up in a car, mouring period lasts about an hour. Half the book is spent trying to find out what department the lawyer who they're looking for works in. Wow gas and oil dept! It would take a second grader about ten seconds to figure that one out. What is it with Grisham novels? Or should I say McNovels?"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"John Grisham's 1991 novel THE FIRM drew unprecedented praise from reviewers, booksellers and readers across America, and it quickly became the top bestseller of the year. Now Grisham is back with The Pelican Brief, an irresistible story that begins with the simultaneous assassinations of two Supreme Court Justices...Late one October night Justice Abe Rosenberg, at ninety - one the Supreme Court's liberal legend, is shot in the head while sleeping in his Georgetown home. Two hours later Glenn Jensen, the Court's youngest and most conservative justice, is strangled, possibly by the same assassin. The country is stunned and baffled; the FBI has no clues.But Darby Shaw, a brilliant law student at Tulane, thinks she has the answer. Days of digging in the law libray's computers have led her to an obscure connection between the two justices. She fleshes out her beliefs in a meticulous though wildly speculative brief that builds a strong case against a most unlikely suspect.Her suspect has powerful friends. one evening, outside a New Orleans restaurant, she narrowly escapes an assassin's car bomb. Someone has read her brief. Someone who wants her dead. Alone and frightened, Darby disappears into the anonymous shadows of the French Quarter. After reading an alarming story about the assassinations in the Washington Post, she contacts investigative reporter Gray Grantham and convinces him that Washington's position the killings amounts to the biggest cover - up since Watergate. Together they go underground, on the run, trying to stay alive long enough to expose the real truth in The Pelican Brief.Featuring the unique mix of legal intrigue and page - turning suspense that drove The Firm to the top of the bestseller lists, The Pelican Brief is sure to be one of the most popular and satisfying novels of the year."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Not my favorite Grisham novel but still a pretty decent book and definately a page turner.I get a good chuckle reading some of these reviews that state, &quot;I am a lawyer and Grisham doesn't know what he is talking about!&quot; or &quot;A story like this could never happen!&quot;. Those folks probably zigged when they should have zagged to get to the NON-FICTION section. I read Grisham's novels because they are enjoyable and are pretty easy to follow. I can't wait for these same people to ridicule Steven King. &quot;There is NO WAY a person can start fires with their mind!&quot; or &quot;I am a mechanic and I know for sure that Cars don't have minds of their own!&quot;Give the guy a break....sheesh"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Well its another McBook from the burn and turn factory know as Grisham Inc. I am convinced he has a group of Santa's elf's slaving away in some South Carolina sweat shop turning these screen plays - sorry, I mean books out. If you have read some of the authors books in the past you have a good idea of what you are going to get. An easy to read and understandable book that is as light as cotton candy. I actually think the movie was better. Why do I read his books, for the same reason I eat junk food, it is easy to get, fast and not complicated. Sometimes you just need a little light reading to take the stress from the day and his books fit that bill."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Definitely a page turner, keeps you hooked for most of the book.

I kind of groaned, because I find Grisham very uneven in the quality department. But, you know, for 2/3 of Pelican, I was actively engaged, even though I had to suspend belief at some of the ridiculous coincidences. And even though toward the end, I felt impatient for it to get wrapped up, I'm still left with an overall feeling of being entertained.I do think it would have been a stronger book if Grisham would have just let Darby do her thing without injecting a lackluster romance between her and Grantham. Zero spark there, and it added nothing to the story.Also, Grisham seems to have this foggy sort of 1970s mind-set when it comes to his treatment of people of color. In this book, for example, the only two black characters are a janitor and a cop. Then there's \\"Khamel,\\" the middle-eastern assassin. Khamel? Jeez.This review reads like a 2, but as the book did keep me entertained for much of its course, I'm giving it a 3."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Opinion:Good writing. Good suspense.

However, it does not live up to its promise and peters out at the end. Grisham's difficulty is that he is so good and so adept at catching the audience, that more is expected of him.

It has a rich plot and it is really well written. I loved it."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Grisham is a great writer and started great with his first three novels with this being his third. I give a five star rating when I can't stop turning the pages and do not want to put the book down. The story has backgrounds in New Orleans. Washington, D.C., and New York City.This story was non-stop action and suspense with rivetting excitment. It has a heroine, Darby Shaw, who is beautiful and smart. She is a law student who does a Brief on the murder of two Supreme Court Justices. This causes a lot of people to be murdered and puts Darby on a run for her life. This all started with an injunction to stop oil drilling in the marshes of Louisiana and try to save the home of the Brown Pelicans."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"If you are thinking about going to law school, this wouldn't be a bad novel to read to get a sense of what the profession is all about before you commit yourself to three expensive (and potentially boring) years of education. I don't recall a book that displays so many of the corrupt sides of legal practice and education in a single fictional tale. If that weren't enough, the book also delves deeply into the international assassination genre and creates a modern-day fictional version of investigating a government cover-up at the highest levels, a la Watergate.But a pure heart among all the jaded ones can make a difference . . . that's the morale of this story as beautiful, dedicated, and brilliant law student Darby Shaw speculates on what motive might tie the assassination of two Supreme Court justices back to a pending legal case. Improbably (the weakest part of the story), she sniffs out the potential that no one else does -- that this is an attempt to fix an appeal.The Pelican Brief as a title is a misnomer. Darby writes her thoughts (a crude essay, not a brief) about what might be going on and shares them with her professor lover who passes them along to a counsel for the FBI. Pretty soon someone is taking her ideas seriously, and the pages will fly through your fingers as fast as you can read until you get to the end.John Grisham doesn't quite have his genres down in this book, and apparently the success of The Firm meant that his editors were more interested in getting The Pelican Brief published than making it better. You could fix this novel into a five-star effort with about two hours of editing to reduce the improbabilities and speed up the slow parts.But if you don't mind having unlikely events pull a riveting story together, you'll have a lot of fun with The Pelican Brief. I listened to the reading by Alexander Adams and felt that the story worked better listened to than it would be if read silently.I admire John Grisham for the imagination to conceive of such a wild story. He kept surprising me with his plot developments, and the trip was almost all fun."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"\\"Four-thirty A.M. He listened to the voice, jumped to his feet, and eight minutes later was in the oval office. . . \\"They're both dead.\\"' Not only was the president in shock, but all of America was stunned to know that two of their Supreme Court justices were murdered in the same night. Darby Shaw, an innocent law student, guessed who the criminal master mind behind this evil trick was. Once the FBI got a hold of the brief her world was instantly turned upside down. Darby was scared to death, only trusting one ambitious reporter and constantly watching her back.The Pelican Brief is an action filled, legal thriller and kept me turning the pages. \\"The explosion knocked her to the sidewalk. She landed on all fours, facedown. . . She gaped in horror at the parking lot.\\" (pg.127) this event really picked up and started the story. Though the plot line can get slow at times within a chapter you will be reading as fast as you can to find out what happens next. I would recommend this book for all mature readers, since this novel has a complex plot line and some language not suitable for children. Don't miss this gripping novel."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"In this early novel by Grisham, he dives into the intrigue and secrets of Washington insiders, the murder of 2 supreme court justices, and the conspiracy behind it. A law student at Tulane University writes a brief nicknamed the Pelican Brief in which she proposes one of the president's financial supporter's link to the murders. This happens to fall into the hands of the FBI then makes its way to the President and CIA. They launch an all out investigation but apparently whomever ordered the original murders doesn't like this and begins knocking off more people. The law student connects with a reporter from the Washington Post and they go on a wild chase to prove the veracity of the brief while running from the killers.Written in his classic legal thriller style, The Pelican Brief is quality Grisham fiction and will keep you turning the pages to the end."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Yes, it's a page turner, and yes, there is some action, but this book is basically written in the same mold as The Firm. The main character is not very likeable and the story line is predictable and weak. And the ending is terrible. I enjoyed parts of the book and there were sufficient surprises. The author is undoubtedly an expert at crime novels but the problem is that the book offers nothing new.

Pelican Brief is another winner. Interesting plot, believable characters and non-stop action. One of his better ones."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"When two Supreme Court justices are assassinated on the same night, there is plenty of speculation as to who the assassin or assassins are and why the judges were murdered. Like many others, law student Darby Shaw thinks she knows the motive. She writes a brief, soon to be known as The Pelican Brief, and shows it to her law professor/lover, Thomas Callahan. Unfortunately, he shows it to a friend of his who works for the FBI, who passes it along, and it falls into the wrong hands. When Callahan is killed by a car bomb, Darby realizes someone wants her dead and she goes on the run. She hooks up with Washington Post reporter Gray Grantham and the two of them try to stay alive long enough to expose the truth.This was an exciting but implausible thriller. Darby is a well-written character and it's nice to read a book with a strong, intelligent heroine. Unfortunately, it's not clear until well into the book what Darby's feelings for Callahan really were, it should have been clear earlier that she loved him and was not a student having an affair with a professor in order to get an A. She conveniently has plenty of money, so she can use cash on the run, rather than leave a trail by using plastic. And it strains readers credibility that a law student can outwit trained assassins. Some of the other characters in the book blend into each other and I wasn't always clear as to who some of them were. Grisham does clear up some loose ends, but at the last minute, as if he suddenly remembered them.Despite these flaws, the story is exciting enough to keep the reader turning pages and worth reading as long as you don't think too much about it."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"I would appreciate it that, if you know me personally, you do not mention in conversation that you know I read a John Grisham novel. His text is garbage, his scenes are blockheaded, his characters are muddled and really, \\"The Firm\\" is the best thing he did because he maintained such a sense of corporate terror that it was all too realistic for most of us. This book fails at the same kind of suspense, in part because he gets too literal in having his characters evade a conspiracy that is not made concrete enough, visually, for the average reader. I like the environmental awareness he sneaks into the middle of this book, however, sauntering up to us like a surly drunk and pointing out the obvious, then asking if we want to fight over it. Trust me when I say we don't; he knows what he's talking about, even if most of this book could anesthesize us. The characters are cartoonish, the prose as always inefficient and tedious, and the mystery is thin. If you read it, read it for the pelicans."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"This is a good author; in this story he lingers too long to let you uncover the theme of the plot; perils of the pelicans in the Mississippi Delta by pestizides swamped into the wetlands, killing avians like the pelicans to the brink of extintion. It is the greed of a few who want the oil, as greed is always the human tragedey and malady. Way too many new names of insignificant characters are introduces out of nowhere and spoil the story. I was surprised this story fascinated the movie industry. The heroine is not believable in this plot, the corruption of the White House is."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"The best John Grisham book I have read. Thriller with government and lawyer coverups. The book is much better than the movie. Grisham does a great job of getting you into Darby's situation and feelings. I enjoy his style of writing, not too heavy and not so predictable and simplistic as other writers."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Mysterious, eccentric and gripping are the words that could be used to describe the complicated plot that is hidden within this 436 pg long novel. It starts off with an intriguing beginning in which an elder Supreme Court Judge gets murdered in his own apartment building. The incognito assassin moves swiftly into the building and kills the Supreme Judge and leaves undetected by any of the FBI&iexcl;s forces that&iexcl;s planted there as protection. Not long after, the assassin strikes again and kills a second Supreme Court Judge in a Gay porn movie theater by strangling him to death, once again leaving no traces. The White House has no specific suspect and the investigation comes to a halt until a brief writer by a student comes along.In the mean time, Darby Shaw is just living her life as a normal college student. Studying law, she is naturally attracted to the politics that are going on in the government, so it wasn&iexcl;t long before she heard about the murdering of the two Supreme Court judges. Driven by pure curiosity she took a long duration of time to write out a brief that pin point&iexcl;s possible suspect that would have benefited the most with these two judges dead. She shows her brief to her professor/ lover, Thomas Callahan who passes it to many other politicians that are investigating the very case. She has no clue of what devastation this action was about to inflict to her life.Gray Grantham a reporter that worked for Washington post, also tires to single handedly figure out who is behind the murders of the Supreme Court Judges. He one day gets a phone call from a man that claims to be, &iexcl;Garcia&iexcl; saying he has some information about the case. Yet, he soon loses this lead and finds himself cornered into a dead end until one day Darby Shaw calls him and informs him about some details in the brief she wrote. Soon after they both meet up in Washington to have a little talk. Shortly both of them decide to work as a team to try and solve the mystery, and their first step was to find this mystery man called, &iexcl;Garcia.&iexcl;&iexcl;The Pelican Brief&iexcl; is an interesting book that I would recommend highly to other readers that enjoy a good twist in plots and realistically built characters. The story is very much plausible and everything is well explained down to the very last detail. I plan on reading more books by John Grisham, and I believe that all his books will have his own unique type of humor that I enjoyed so very much."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Grisham's books have been progressively less good after A Time to Kill, The Firm and The Pelican Brief. The Pelican Brief, particularly as read by Anthony Heald, is quite good. Once the reader accepts that Grisham's plots are absurd, these early books are well written with clever characterizations and very enjoyable. Heald's work is especialy good. The book is better by far than the movie version."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"This one is definately my favorite. It starts off with grip as an elderly supreme court justice is murdered in his own home along with the kindly nurse that watches him and the two guards that watch the house. Another man is strangled to death in a movie theater showing gay porn. Anyway, a bright young student by the name of Darby Shaw writes a report on this for her law class. Her teacher/boyfriend, Thomas Callahan, reads it and a day later is blown up in his car. She contacts an FBI agent who reads it and when planning to meet her in a park, is bludgened to death in his own hotel room. She then contacts a Washington Post reporter by the name of Grey Grantham and he follows her story eventually running into some exciting situations.

The main character and all the \\"law\\" really blends into the story and is explained so that you can not only understand but enjoy it. It is really amazing the politics--it never ceases to amaze me how decisions can be made not on the basis of what is right or whether it might help someone but on the basis of someone's career--namely a political career. This book really illustrates it and how they get caught in their own web because of it. Very thrilling. I bought it for a friend too. You will definitely not regret getting hold of this one and reading it!"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"I can't believe everyone did not give this five stars. This book was fantastic.

The Pelican Brief delights the senses for a reader. Impossible to stop reading. Every page is a new dire situation.

This Author has what it takes to draw in his fans."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Grisham's style is plain and that's not a bad thing. It means we can focus on the plot, and he's similarly excellent when it comes to pacing. However, his use of stock characters and clich&eacute;s begins to grate on you (is it really necessary to go on about Darby Shaw's hot bod beneath her baggy clothing?). There are also times you want a bit more richness in his writing.That said, The Pelican Brief is an easy and engrossing read perfect for a warm summer's day and a sweet pi&ntilde;a colada. 4/5."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"This was a SERIOUS law thriller. And I'm not to much of a huge person with law. I enjoyed being chased down the New Orleans streets with Darby.

Without her as a character this book may not have suriviedrather watch the movie..."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Mr Grisham is a master of twisted plots and wickedly sarcastic dialog. This book is packed full of it, and this is what keeps the rather dense prose moving along at a swift pace. Not all characters are given the same attention, the secondary ones are rather flimsy, but the main one, Darby, is interesting. She starts out as an ambitious law student, and develops into a street-smart yet scared fugitive, who struggles to stay alive.The crime motives and the perpetrator's identity are revealed rather early on, but the link between the crime and the perpetrator are cleverly kept to the last few pages, and helps explain the audacity of the criminal, who believed that he can never be linked to the crime. This is what makes the plot work, and the story hinges on it. However, this is not a mystery in a traditional sense.The other interesting character, who comes in around the middle of the book, and is critical to the plot, code-named Garcia, is a conflicted individual. He is torn between the need to reveal what he knows about the crime, and his fear for himself and his family. A very well-realized character, in my opinion.The writing style is a bit flat, if we don't count the sizzling dialogue, and is not as strong as in the other Grisham novels I have read. This is why I am giving the book a 4 rather than 5. Still, a highly enjoyable read, and a potential candidate for a re-read.By the way, if you plan to watch the film based on the book, be warned that it's not nearly as good as the book, so perhaps it should be watched before reading. The book will help clarify the plot, which is very hard to follow in the movie. Julia Roberts does a great job as Darby."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"\`Never have I read such a bad thriller like &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot;.

We like to look for clues in what we've read to help us unravel the plot, and find out who did it and why the crime was done.John Grisham cheats us out of that fun. The villian of this book isn't introduced until there less than 75 pages left, which means that when you get that far, you realize that everything you read before then wasn't valid. To have some red herrings in a thriller is fine, but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings? That's bad.Read another thriller instead of this one, one that plays by the rules."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"I doubt the editorial comment that Grisham wrote Pelican Brief for the movie. The book allows the white Gray Grantham to end up in Darby Shaw's sack. The misogamist movie downplays any final romance between the interracial couple. Such is life in America in the \`90's.In this story Grisham provides a primer for using the omniscient point of view. Out of a hundred scenes he gives Darby Shaw or Gray Grantham half of them and spreads the other fifty scenes rather equally amongst the minor characters. I think he had the reader hooked well enough that he could have thrown in more exposition. He drove along that fine line between keeping the reader in suspense and keeping them in the dark. He avoided the opportunity to educate so he could entertain."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"I've read two-and-a-half John Grisham books. He is the hack of hacks. Not only are his books filled with many hole, his characters are flat and plot lines totally STINK. I've read more interesting stuff on cereal boxes.He's as bad as Tom Clancy."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"This novel makes no sense. A law student does some research and looks up some information in the public records and writes a summary of her findings. OK now this information is , through a lot of contrivance, turned over the FBI. Conveniently, the head of the FBI wants to hang the President out to dry. I can live with all of the contrivance up to this point in the story; but, once the brief is turned over to the FBI, they have all of the information the law student had and stronger motivation to hang the President, so why kill the student? And why write a whole novel about attempts to kill her?"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"I read this book on vacation and found it disappointing. Much of the suspense involved stuff that the main character, Darby Shaw, actually knew but that Grisham just wasn't telling the reader even as he was revealing a lot about what she thought and felt. You spend most of the book, as she tries to figure out who's trying to kill her because of what she knows, realizing that you'd have the key to the whole thing if you just could find out what Darby already knows about her own situation. Then after he's run you around enough (couple hundred pages) Grisham just opens up and tells you what's going on.Basically the book just teases and manipulates the reader. It's also a pretty long and goes on quite a bit after the cat is out of the bag- resolving the situation of characters who I just couldn't care that much about. I got the feeling that the book was mostly just a framework to publicize certain environmental issues that the author was interested in.I've also read Grisham's THE FIRM and while I didn't care for everything that happened in that book, it was a had much better suspense, pacing and characters- really hard to put down even if the main character wasn't always likeable. Grisham definitely can do much better than this."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"This was my first Grisham book and I hated it. It began with a bang only to have Chapter Two issue nothing more than a whimper. From there it was all downhill. Grisham introduced far too many characters with nothing to do but attempt to keep the suspense high--I needed a scorecard just to keep track of who was who and there are a few I never figured out. Finally, I gave up trying..it wasn't worth the effort. The characters were cliches and too unbelievable for words. When we finally do find out the contents of the infamous Pelican Brief, it's a supreme letdown. My first reaction was--that's IT? Grisham should also get his facts straight. He has the beauteous (and stupid) Darby changing her hair color from black to pale blonde to red. If Grisham would have consulted his wife he might have known that it is impossible--you can't lighten the dark colors! Grisham's writing also sounds belaboured, he tries to hard--in one sentence a character says he would have continued talking if another hadn't showed him his palms. Showed him his palms! It took me three months to figure that one out. People say Grisham's books are good so everyone else runs out to buy a copy. This being the case, why should Grisham even try?"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Two Supreme Court Justices have been murdered. Many people suspect that the acts were by multiple assassains, and can't find any reason for the crimes, but out of nowhere comes a theory that shakes up the White House and a demented millionaire. Darby Shaw's theory, which is called the Pelican Brief, says that Victor Mattiece, a businessman who contributed heavily to the campaign of the current president, conspired to have the men killed so that he could drill for oil, even though it would kill the brown pelicans that inhabit that area. This book simply can't be put down once you start to read it. This is in the style of Grisham's masterful suspense thrillers, like The Firm, and is a very enjoyable reading experience. Its political plotting and pacing are immaculate, and if you liked any of Grisham's other novels, you will love this book."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Having read most of Grisham's books, I've saved a few of his \\"best\\" for last. While it wasn't a 5 star book like I'd hoped, it certainly was one of his better books with a lot of detail and of course the plot was an interesting one.Having saw the movie years ago, I had a good idea of what the book was about: Two Supreme Court Justices are killed, a law school student, along with many other people become curious and try to figure out \\"who dun it\\"...only, she writes a brief and hits the nail on the head, and when the wrong people find out, she's on the run for her life!I enjoyed the book mostly because it was fast-paced, and had a lot of detail. So much detail and characters, I had a bit of a struggle to keep up! Of course it was suspenseful and the characters, especially of Darby, the law school student and the reporter who starts to help her uncover the truth. Good read!"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Two Supreme Court justices are murdered and the police are getting nowhere. A law student, Darby Shaw, writes a brief, decides it can't be true, and discards it, but not before her lover Thomas Callahan sees it and shows it to his friend in the FBI. From there it gets to the CIA, the Washington Post, and even the White House. Everyone involved with the brief starts dying and Darby is running for her life. The first ten or eleven chapters of this book are kind of exciting but it begins introducing too many new characters, which makes it hard to understand. A few of the main characters are Gray Grantham, a reporter for the Washington Post, Fletcher Coal, the presidents' assistant, and F. Denton Voyles, the FBI Director. Also, some chapters will end in cliffhangers but it will be six or seven chapters later before they're concluded. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you like Grisham's other books."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"An excellent book. Much better than the Street Lawyer and The Rainmaker. I have read all of Grisham's books, and found all to be highly enjoyable. This, however, is the class act.

A law student can't possibly be so witty as to escape the chase of the FBI and practically the entire federal government.

I recommend A Time to Kill, possibly John Grisham's first and best"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"I have read all of Grisham's books and this one ranks right upthere. This is a brilliant novel because it is different, in fact,very different from normal storylines in most books. It is also interesting because it shows how one ordinary-- well Darby Shaw is not very ordinary-- person can intelligently come up with a solution that all the experts could not think of. It shows how one person can really make a difference. The book is thrilling when Darby is being chased, and just escaping death, time and time again. Grisham, also, does a masterful job of incorporating Gray Grantham from the Washington Post into the story, and creates a connection between him and Darby.For the critics who say that Darby Shaw coming up with the solution was implausible and the book is far-fetched, I personally think that Grisham does a masterful job."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"IT GETS NO BETTER THAN THIS!

All was well, and so what if some of the marshlands suffered.&quot;Years ago I would read every Grisham book that came out. John Grisham is a fellow southerner, born and raised in Mississippi, schooled at Ole Miss. His characters remind me so much of the people I grew up with, remind me of my home. The Firm is my least favorite of his books which is surprising since the setting for that story is in my hometown of Memphis, TN; the movie was even worse since whoever directed or produced it totally botched the ending.I read this book in one day in my backyard. I lay motionless in a lounge chair only moving the muscles in my thumb and forefinger; I've never read a book like that in my entire life!"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"okay..so i am a big fan of john grisham. He is very slow, but his books are good in the end and they capture your attention.

The synopsis is extremely exciting, but in reality, it is awful. do yourself a favor and skip this one."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"After reading the first three novels by John Grisham, I can confirm that he belongs to the Pablum Club of American writers. He joins Vince Flynn, David Baldacci, and Brad Thor, but the club is sure to grow as I discover new authors.Contrast this with the Caviar Club, whose members include James Lee Burke, Michael Connelly, Neal Stephenson, Robert Ludlum, and Alan Furst, among others, as far as American authors go.

His date is only a few steps behind, yells at him to let her drive. \\"No!\\" the drunk man screams. \\"I won't get in the car with you!\\" she screams, tears streaming down her face. \\"Have fun walking home!\\" he shouts. \\"Your drunk!\\" she screams. \\"I can drive better drunk than you can sober!\\" he hollers back. He reaches the car, she pleads with him one last time to let her drive. He refuses. As he gets into the car, it explodes. The girl is fazed, who would do this? She decides that the bomb must have also been meant for her. Her date, Thomas Callahan and her constitutional law professor, never did anything to upset people to the point that they would kill him. She, Darby Shaw, had written a brief about why she thinks that two Supreme Court justices where murdered. Thomas had said that he had given the brief to his friend in the FBI. Darby goes into hiding, she makes contact with the FBI officer who Thomas gave the brief to. He is murdered the night before they were suppose to meet. Darby continues to hide, as she is being hunted by people who plan to kill her. Finally, she contacts The Washington Post reporter Gray Grisham and with her information they collect enough evidence to make the biggest news break since Watergate. The Pelican Brief by John Grishman is a complex and suspenseful novel which is a little confusing to read.This novel has many, many characters, it makes hard to keep track of the story line. There is a lot of characters that have no purpose or very small purposes, one is Eric Easton. He was mentioned maybe twice in the whole story. You get so confused that its possible to get K.O. Lewis, a FBI agent, and L. Matthew Barr, the person hired to oversee killing Darby, mixed up. Some characters are rarely mentioned and some seem to spontaneously appear.Readers do not find out what is in the Pelican Brief until you are about two-hundred pages into the story. This causes it to be suspenseful because you do not know why people are killing people. The many deaths also cause it to be suspenseful as well, it adds to the \\"why\\" factor. Other than the two Supreme Judges, Rosenburg and Jensen, a FBI agent, Gavin Verheek, is murdered and then the expert murder for hire who killed the last three people named, Khamel, is murdered.When this happens, Darby believes him to be Verheek. After they plan to meet, Verheek is murdered by Khamel. Then Khamel pretends to be Verheek and meets Darby. As they are walking together, Khamel is trying to find a spot to kill Darby then he is shot. Randomly shot, you don't know who shot him, how they recognized him or anything. It becomes very unclear. Another thing that might puzzle readers is that there isn't a clear path between how Darby and Grantham find out their information. It isn't easy to grasp how they get from one informant to another.This book is slightly confusing to read, and is complex and suspenseful. It has lots of characters, Grisham withholds vital information, and has some confusing incidents. Although, it does have a very engrossing plot and I would recommend it only for people who are very avid readers who enjoy complicated mysteries and thrillers.C. Shipman"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"The Pelican Brief is about how two Supreme Court justices who get murdered on the same night, and why they were murdered. A law student named Darby writes a brief explaining why the two judges were killed. Darby's brief which started out as just a crazy idea ends up hitting it spot on. So now she's on the run for her life. The book gets a little confusing with all the characters and all the information it sometimes hard to keep up. Overall it was a good read. If you like fast pace books with plenty of information the Pelican Brief is the book for you!"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"I first saw the movie for this book a few years ago while I was in Romania. After moving to the US I badly wanted to have a copy of the book and I'm very happy I did that. This book taught me many things ranging from life in Washington DC, to the structure of the CIA and FBI, and some underground facts about the political world as we know it. Does it worth spending7-8$ to broaden your horizons in this ever changing world? For me it did, and hopefully it will be the same for you."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"In The Pelican Brief by John Grisham, suspense is used to keep the reader's attention. Darby Shaw is an innocent student of law who comes up with a theory as to who committed murders, and she calls this the Pelican Brief. Unbenownced to her, she has uncovered the true murderers. When they get a hold of her brief, her world changes drastically. Grisham uses a tactic where he leads the reader in one direction and then suddenly the story goes a different direction. We come to realize that this type of device used by Grisham often makes us keep reading because we want to find out what is going to happen to the character in the next scene.At the beginning of the novel, Grisham lacks the use of suspension. This makes it hard for us to read when we have no real drastic change that quickly changes our point of view. As soon as Thomas Callahan dies from a car explosion we come to realize that Darby's life is at stake. When she is scared and is living in hotels where anyone can find her, we are left in suspense where we don't know what is going to happen to her. Later on in the novel, we follow Darby and Gray Grantham through the underground just waiting for them to be caught.In the end the device of suspense is what keeps the reader interested throughout the novel. It keeps us waiting to find out if the good or the evil of the world will win the battle. Any part of a novel without suspense, which we discover in the beginning, is not keeping our attention. Once our opinions keep changing we keep wanting to read more and more about how the character ends up. Suspension helps make us more open to new opinions and quick changes in our own world; although, Grisham uses this to make us more attentive to his story."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"The Pelican Brief is a trilling novel by John Grisham. It follows a suspenseful chase after an attractive female law student. She is hunted for knowing just a little too much then the government can handle. I was not her fault that she was seeking the truth about the resent murders of the chief justices. But, it was her fault that her lover, who was also her professor was killed in a hot wired car bomb accident that was actually intended for her as well. The book follows her insane escape out of the country to escape death that she was well overdue for.I do not major in law nor am I a fan of lawyers. However, I found this book interesting because of its continues changing plot that keeps the reader under a slight suspense. The chase after the female law student had more twists and close encounters then the affair of Monica Lewinsky and President Clinton.The book is recommended both individuals with or without legal background as well. And anyone that is interested in a different perspective on the United States Government and their ultimate domination of power over people."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"This book is by far the worse John Grisham book I have read (maybe tied with The Street Lawyer). It is such a hand wringing liberal exercise that it almost becomes a farce. All the Republicans are evil men who are in bed with big business. All the lawyers are noble men/women full of ideas (except for the Republican law firm of course, they are scum). The character of the president is such an aloof man that it is hard to see how such an idiot would be elected. Of course, he must of had his wicked henchmen win the election for him.All the characters in this book take on such cartoon qualities that it ruins the plot. The man behind all the killings in the book becomes a James Bond type villian who starts killing everyone that gets in the way. Does he think he would never get caught?In summary: all the unbelievable characters destroy the plot which is not that good to begin with. The only thing good about this book is that it is short. I am beginning to think that John Grisham may be the most overrated author around. Don't read the Pelican Brief, stick to The Firm or The Rainmaker."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"I like Grisham but this book did not have as much to offer as other Grisham books. It started off with a bang (literally) and I thought I was in for a great read, however, the pace quickly slowed. There were just too many good guys and bad guys (call me stupid but I never have figured out Verheek) and Darby Shaw was the most incredibly stupid person on the face of the earth. I would recommend Grisham's other books over this one. The Firm, The Jury, The Client, The Chamber, The Partner all have a lot more to offer."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"Let's see for 3/4's of the book our characters search feverishly to determine what department of the law firm did the dead lawyer work for? Eureka! It's the oil and exploration department. How this author has become so famous is beyond me. They use to say the NY Times was written at an eighth grade reading level. Grisham's books are closer to the kindergarten levels."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"I found this book to be highly enjoyable. It starts off with two Supreme Court Justices being murdered right before election day. The two men had received many death threats so there were a lot of groups as to who could have killed them. One of the men who died was the oldest Supreme Court Justice and was also the most hated. Many suspect the two murders are connected but no one has any proof because the murders were very clean and seemingly no evidence was left behind. The two men were murdered by a infamous terrorist named Khamel. He murdered Justice Rosenberg in his home and Justice Jensen in a gay movie house. There were no witnesses to either crime. Darby Shaw, a law student at Tulane University, spends days in the college library trying to crack this case. She writes a long brief about what she thinks happened and gives it to her boyfriend, who happens to be her professor. Because he found the brief to be very interesting, he gave it to one of his friends in the CIA. The brief gets passed around until the President reads it. That's when Darby nearly escapes a bomb and is forced to go on the run. Her only contact as she tries to save her life is her boyfriend's friend, the man who first read the brief."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"After reading &quot;The Firm,&quot; I thought that John Grisham could not possible outdo himself, that is until I read &quot;The Pelican Brief.&quot; After having witnessed a murder, Darby Shaw seeks the help of an ambitious reporter. After putting all the pieces together, Shaw discovers that the murder was intended for her. And that's when the fun really begins. I haven't seen the movie version of this book. Is it better than the book? Nah, I doubt it. This is an intense thriller that should be read in one sitting. John Grisham rules, and if you agree with me, say &quot;I.&quot;"},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"After the massive success of The Firm, anticipation was high for John Grisham's follow up, The Pelican Brief. Unfortunately, The Pelican Brief doesn't come close to matching the high quality of The Firm. The plot revolves around the assassination of two Supreme Court justices that no one can figure out the motives behind. A young law student, Darby Shaw, comes up with a theory about it and writes a paper detailing her thoughts. It turns out to be more accurate than anyone thinks. Her boyfriend is one of her professors and he is killed in a car bombing. She fears for her live and ends up with a Washington Post reporter, Gray Grantham. They set out to prove Darby's theory. The book is a fast read, but the plot is so far fetched and unbelievable that you find yourself shaking your head at it instead of being taken in by it. Mr. Grisham was obviously trying to capitalize on The Firm's success, but The Pelican Brief has the feel of being too forced and knocked off without much thought."},{"Title":"The pelican brief","review":"The book, The Pelican Brief, by John Grisham, arrived in a timely manner.

It is the Beatix Potter book with the very fewest words per page. Children are introduced to Ms. Potter's wonderful use of the English language at an age in which their attention span is SHORT! The pages turn quickly for earliest listening experiences for toddlers. Some may object to the hunter and gun references in the story, but all is well in the end, and the little ones in my experience have loved this beautiful book."},{"Title":"The Story of a Fierce Bad Rabbit","review":"Love this very short book!

The story is seriously funny - almost deadpan at some points - and I love the illustrations of the fierce bad rabbit.

Most kids would love this book, but personally when I was one, I love a bit more longer of a story than this one."},{"Title":"The Story of a Fierce Bad Rabbit","review":"My sons love this book, and they think it is quite funny -- precisely because the Fierce Bad Rabbit gets his comeuppance from a hunter. It's an old-fashioned approach, in that, the rabbit pays the consequences for his bad behavior: he loses his tail, his whiskers, and the carrot he swiped. The illustrations are great. A note on content, since another reviewer mentioned the Roly-Poly Pudding Tale of Samuel Whiskers. My 5-year-old found Samuel Whiskers MUCH more disturbing than this straightforward story. Beatrix Potter's world, from another era, is interesting and entertaining."},{"Title":"The Story of a Fierce Bad Rabbit","review":"This is a very cute story about how being good and being bad has different outcomes. This would teach a very important lesson for young children to learn. The illustrations are also very cute, showing exactly what you'd picture the story being. The good, innocent rabbit is just sitting there with his little carrot, happy to have it to eat. A bad, fierce rabbit is hiding in the bushes, just waiting to pounce on the sweet, little rabbit. All of a sudden, he pounced! That poor sweet one had to go running and hide in a cave. Seeing what happens to the fierce, bad rabbit is very Beatrix Potter like. It is so sweet how it ends, how being good always works out and being bad isn't always going to go your way, no matter what you think.~Camille"},{"Title":"The Story of a Fierce Bad Rabbit","review":"i am a big fan of the fierce bad rabbit, as well as all of beatrix potters works.

Still, one must wonder what social allagorie does &quot;the man with the gun afford&quot;. Buy this book, get the whole series, they really are very nice to read, and if you think it would be detrimental to your maturity, buy it for a younger sibling, nephew, niece, cousin, etc. and see if you can bring yourself to give it away.

A warning to parents: gun violence is depicted in this tale."},{"Title":"Salazar's Dictatorship and European Fascism","review":"This book is expensive, rather short, and at times not well-translated. Considering, though, that it is one of the only works that can be purchased on Portugal and Salazar, I must recommend it. It is a decent introduction to the 20th century Portuguese nation, its various governmental phases, and the political movements and ideologies which existed. The overthrow of the Parliamentary Republic and the subsequent &quot;28th of May&quot; Military Dictatorship, which would go on to rule for an astonishing 48 years, are briefly covered. The policies, characteristics, and origins of the Salazar regime are compared with its European counterparts. The study finds that the Salazarist state, with its national emphasis on &quot;God, Fatherland, Family&quot;, is more in line with the regimes of Franco and Dollfuss than with those of Il Duce or Der Fuhrer. It is shown how the seminarian-turned-academic civilian Dr. Salazar is strongly anti-fascist, although ultraright nationalism would sometimes be displayed for different purposes early on. The traditonalist and conservative nature of the state, in its rejection of fascism and in its reliance on elite institutions such as the Church and the subordinated military, are closely examined and make for a quick, fascinating read. With all its faults, the book nonetheless gives a very interesting history of Salazarism - an ideology of common sense that toppled the pagan and liberal order and saved Portugal."},{"Title":"Salazar's Dictatorship and European Fascism","review":"Ant&oacute;nio Costa Pinto is Portugal's leading authority on contemporary Portuguese political history, and this book is about as good an introduction to this theme as you are likely to get, at least in English.Costa Pinto's belief is that Portuguese authoritarianism has less in common with Italian fascism (to which is is usually compared) than it has to do with social-catholicism and the clerico-fascism that was to be found in pre-Nazi Austria. He takes great care to justify his opinion. This book is not intended to be a history book.That said, however, he does provide an overview of Portuguese authoritarianism - mainly as a means of illustration. If you are looking for a narrative (even an academic narrative) of the Military Dictatorship or the New State, then this is most definitely not the book for you. If, on the other had, you are seeking a coherent and competent application of political scientific and sociological theories of authoritarianism to the Portuguese, and you are not too keen on yet another 'structural' analysis, then you should read this book. Caution is urged, however, for those who are not au fait with the story of inter-war Portugal, as this book has not been written for you. It does assume that the reader has at least a basic knowledge of who did what to whom and when. As for the why...? Well this book will provide you with some plausible and convincing suggestions."},{"Title":"Salazar's Dictatorship and European Fascism","review":"In 1926 Portugal became a military dictatorship. Soon after European fascism took over the country as fascism swept europe replacing the governments of Italy(1922), Germany(1933), Spain(1939) and Hungary(1944). Yet this history of portugal remains largelyunderstudied and no other volume exits in English describing Portugals dictatorship.Unfortunatly this book explores more the philosophy of fascism and the interworkings of the government of Salazr rather then looking at the foriegn policy and politics of fascism in Portugal.Portugal, upon the end of Fascist rule, wuickly gave up its colonies in Africa, where Cubans were quickly dispatched to Angola and Mozambique.THis is an interesting book, mostly because it is one of the few on the subject. An interestign time and an interesting country that is frequently overlooked."},{"Title":"Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology","review":"This book may be the single most incredible work of genius of the modern ages.

Angelic, long suffering mothers of 19th Century literature were unveiled so often by so many writers as to always be tripwire for suspicion by readers. The more angelic a woman is portrayed, the more devious and profound the flaws before the final chapter. So it is with Coming of Rain.A young man, dominated by a strong mother wielding the romantic Old South and a barely remembered Confederate father, discovers the past as it really was. He also discovers himself as he must be in the future. The Coming of Rain is a flood of story beginning in drought, of a prediction by a madman about to be hanged, of many kinds of slavery of the mind long after the ownership of other humans was abolished.This book isn't heavy reading, but it's enjoyable for those who like historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Coming of Rain","review":"Richard Marius was a wonderfull writer. \\"The Coming of Rain\\" is one of those tales that you can go to and let the cares and woes of the world pass on by, because you are in \\"Bourbonville\\" for a while. This is the third Richard Marius book I have read, in that I came on board in the middle with \\"After the War\\", then mannaged to get \\"An Affair of Honor\\" and now, \\"The Coming of Rain\\" I am ordering \\"Bound for the Promise Land\\" today.If you like beautiful, descriptive writing, tongue in cheek observation and believable, interesting characters, read some Richard Marius."},{"Title":"The Coming of Rain","review":"Undoubtedly one of the best books I've ever read. Great story with well developed characters. Comparing it to Bound for the Promised Land, the writing is as good or better. Overall, there's more a more optimistic spirit. As another reviewer mentioned, the story contains many familiar themes: the strong, proud southern mother, the revelation of family secrets, love triangle, etc. However, Marius' writing is better than any other Southern writer I've encountered.You have to wonder if the lack of great commercial success was the reason Marius did not write fiction full time. My only explanation for why Coming of Rain never resonated with the public like Prince of Tides is the somber, existential struggles that Marius gives to many of his primary characters. I doubt that southerners living in the 19th century American south were constantly wondering 'what is the purpose of human existence' the way Marius' characters do.The loss of this great writer in 1999 was very unfortunate, but we have this and several other great works to enjoy. There is also a Coming of Rain play, which was still being performed as recently as 2010. Let's hope a film will follow."},{"Title":"The Coming of Rain","review":"Having read Richard Marius' biography of Martin Luther, a masterpiece of accuracy and interpretation, I became interested in the novels of this now deceased author. Jumping into The Coming of Rain, having acquired the book in North Carolina, I was pulled into the writing style and the world being portrayed. In a small town outside of Knoxville which suffers from the effects of a long-term drought, a complex story of love, betrayal, prejudice, murder, fear, and insanity come together, forming a brilliant literary work difficult to put down.A man is hanged for the murder of his wife and prophecy's the coming of rain just before his own death. In the process the local preacher, verging on the edge of insanity, begins shouting accusations at various townspeople. A rather cavalier beating of two black men ensues demonstrating the racial climate of the time. A darkness seems to envelope the area as past histories related to the Civil War become integral to the story, a story filled with questions, fears, anger, and hints of joy. The sad life of a lawyer who lost his wife and son, the budding but broken love of a young couple, the destruction of the soul of a former slave, and finally the powerful revelation of a murder from the past create a beautifully written book with enough anguish, sorrow, and hope to keep the pages turning.The symbolism of the rain provides an umbrella of tone to the lavish story, and the religious overtones cannot be ignored. Marius' work is moving, with moments of tears, fright, and great sorrow. Yet in spite of the darkness that pervades many of the pages, there is also an undercurrent of optimism for the future. Wonderful read and recommended for Reconstruction historians, Southern history, or anyone interested in how the events of life shape the reactions and philosophies of the people. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Coming of Rain","review":"This book was recommended to me by a co-worker.

PENDENNIS, perhaps his second-best book, is certainly no slouch itself: a funny, rollicking Bildungsroman, PENDENNIS chronicles the adventures of a loveable young man who almost always manages to get himself into trouble, and his tribulations with the several attractive women in his life (including his young mother). There are some definite slow patches to the work, but for the most part it moves almnost at a rip-roaring pace, and it has none of the overseriousness that mars Thackeray's later works (such as the fascinating, but slowpaced THE NEWCOMES). This is Victorian reading at its most pleasurable, if not its most intellectually challenging."},{"Title":"The History of Pendennis: His Fortunes and Misfortunes, His Friends and His Greatest Enemy: Two Volumes","review":"Although this **would** be a good edition of the novel, PLEASE NOTE THAT THE BOOK CONTAINS ONLY VOLUME 2 (THE SECOND HALF OF THE NOVEL). VOLUME 1 IS NOT AVAILABLE. I have no explanation for this except that the publisher made a ridiculous error, and I cannot believe that no one has called them out on it. I and the rest of my graduate class have tried to contact the publisher to complain, but you cannot even get a hold of them. DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT TO READ THE WHOLE BOOK!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The History of Pendennis: His Fortunes and Misfortunes, His Friends and His Greatest Enemy: Two Volumes","review":"Sure, times were different, but the amount of racism, stereotypes, obsession with &#34;good&#34; vs, &#34;bad&#34; women, is very hard to put aside, as they are so much a part of his tales. This novel does not really have a character worth caring about. The main fellow, young Pendenis, is shallow, vain, silly, self-important, mostly thanks to the two ridiculous women in his life, a neurotic, almost clinically obsessed mother and a sort of foster sister, so perfect, virginal,and unerring to be completely sickening and a total bore. But of course to the author, these women are &#34;perfection&#34; and sainted in every way. He really had the Victorian &#34;Angel in the House&#34; complex, this guy did. And he is such a snob. His views come in loud and clear over the narration of the story.I don't mind the story in itself but again, you really have to plough threw a lot of garbage to get to it."},{"Title":"The History of Pendennis: His Fortunes and Misfortunes, His Friends and His Greatest Enemy: Two Volumes","review":"Pendennis is a right-of-passage about a young man of limited means who fancies otherwise. This is a good novel to read if you enjoyed the more widely read Vanity Fair. Thackeray brings back some familiar names and characters. This Kindle edition has a few spelling mistakes and occasionally a few pronoun mistakes but otherwise is sufficient."},{"Title":"The History of Pendennis: His Fortunes and Misfortunes, His Friends and His Greatest Enemy: Two Volumes","review":"This is without a doubt one of the funniest and enjoyable novels I have ever read! Do not let the length of the book scare you, Thackeray's brilliant and unique style makes it an easy joy to read. I admit there are some lulls but overall PENDENNIS will earn an honored place on any bookshelf."},{"Title":"What Have I Ever Lost by Dying?","review":"I enjoy Bly's translations and anthologies; therefore, I try his poetry ... this time, only to be disappointed. And from his introduction to the early poems, I suspect he detects the same flaw as I. He says &quot;When I composed the first of these poems, ... I hoped that a writer could describe and object or a creature without claiming it, without immersing it like a negative in his developing tank of disappointment and desire. I no longer think that is possible&quot;. He later mentions that the style of the object poems is usually spare - that he is unusual in accepting the human fantasy that closes many of his poems.Despite the warnings, Bly's style in this poems appears inconsistent - he begins in the concrete but quickly dissolves into intellectual images i.e. images that display a highly creative, broadly educated intellect that has gone into itself rather than staying in the concrete moment that began the poem. The result is a poem in which the poet seems centered neither in the poem nor the object of the poem but rather in his own mind.There are some wonderful images, some superb turns of phrase, some excellent reinterpretations of unlikely topics (see his take on hockey) but the poems as a whole remain unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Speaking Our Minds: Conversations With the People Behind Landmark First Amendment Cases (Routledge Communication Series)","review":"This book is great! Not only do you get vital information on momentous First Amendment cases, but you also get to 'hear' the people involved discuss their motives for and feelings while standing up for their (and our) rights.The book is a compilation of interviews with lawyers, plaintiffs and defendants from 10 key First Amendment law cases that deal with topics such as freedom of expression, libel, privacy, the use of anonymous sources, free press vs. fair trial, commercial speech, broadcast and cable regulation, and new media regulation.While Russomanno probably intended this book to be used in a Mass Communication Law class, it is also a fascinating read for anyone interested in our right to &quot;speak our minds.&quot; The book is well written (especially the Nebraska Press chapter), well researched and interesting on many levels.

I found it very eye-opening and to the point."},{"Title":"The Anger Trap: Free Yourself from the Frustrations that Sabotage Your Life","review":"Dr. Les Carter has done it again! No wonder he is called &quot;America's Anger Expert.&quot; With The Anger Trap he has put together his years of experience and wisdom on this important subject to provide us with a way out of this insidious trap called anger. Years ago I read his first book on the subject, Good 'N Angry (now out of print, I believe), and more recently completed his very practical best-seller, The Anger Workbook. Both exercises helped me deal with issues that subtly yet surely were negatively affecting my life and relationships.Now comes, I believe, Dr. Carter's &quot;magnum opus.&quot; One of the values of The Anger Trap is that Carter not only identifies anger and it's nature, but deals with the root causes (such as fear, loneliness, rejection, insecurity, and especially pain.) &quot;Angry people are hurting, fragile people,&quot; Carter points out. And, &quot;At the heart of anger is a cry for respect.&quot; But, to me, one of the most insightful observations Carter makes is, &quot;As illogical as it may be, it can seem to outside observers that chronically angry people have a strong commitment to keeping distasteful emotions alive.&quot; Carter encourages us to deal with these underlying causes if we are to have any kind of meaningful victory over anger.The chapter on dependency and hidden insecurity (Chapter 6: &quot;Insecurity's Hold on Angry People&quot;) is especially interesting and illuminating. In this chapter Carter discusses how angry people are so busy trying to make others take responsibility for their own emotional stability that they stay stuck in the anger they want to be free of. But, my favorite chapter is called &quot;Higher Priorities,&quot; (Chapter 14) where Carter leads us down the path to deliverance from the destructive aspects of anger. He points out the need to make a commitment to traits like kindness, patience, and forgiveness. It shows what life can be like outside the anger trap.Over the years I have found Dr. Carter's books to be right on target--insightful, easy-to-read, and filled with practical wisdom and application. The Anger Trap is no exception ... and a welcome addition to his valuable contributions. Everyone with any kind of anger issues should buy this book and digest it deliberately and carefully. As Dr. Carter reminds us, we all have choices. We can choose to face the ugly dimensions of our anger and be freed from this trap forever!"},{"Title":"The Anger Trap: Free Yourself from the Frustrations that Sabotage Your Life","review":"I've dealt with anger issues for years and have heard plenty of advice and couselling, but this is by far the most practical guide I've encountered. Les's writing style makes his concepts easy to understand, even though the concepts themselves are not simplistic. Les has distilled his 30 years of counseling experience into very useable advice on how to overcome the negative consequences of mishandled anger. While many other authors and counselors major primarily on the causes of anger, they mostly grow frustratingly silent on how to change the negative behavior that stems from anger. While Les doesn't offer a promise that you'll never be angry again if you apply his suggestions, his insights are very helpful in minimizing the harm to others and yourself when that inevitable angry moment comes.This book has been life-changing for me. I heartily recommend it to anyone trying to come to grips with their destructive anger-related behaviors."},{"Title":"The Anger Trap: Free Yourself from the Frustrations that Sabotage Your Life","review":"I was first attracted to this book after realizing I am frustrated or angry most of the time. After 5 chapters, I can say that this is what no one ever tells you. Read this book even if you do not consider yourself an angry person. And order one for everyone you care about. A+++++ Many thanks to the authors for this easy to read epiphany. I have been in the dark tooo long. It is time to live to my full potential. With this information I can end the cycle of generation after generation of poor emotional/coping skills."},{"Title":"The Anger Trap: Free Yourself from the Frustrations that Sabotage Your Life","review":"There are some VERY positive reviews for this book on this site so I purchased it. But after having read it myself I now regard these reviews as suspect, especially the first glowing one, which smells of a shill.Let me tell you why: The book is pretty much a collection of mundane stories about \\"real\\" clients of the author with insight into their troubled childhoods, past fears, etc. and how those past traumas have left them with anger issues. It is classic blame-it-on-your-unfortunate-past psycho-babble with very little advice on how to deal with anger in the here and now, regardless of what the causes may be.If you suffer from anger issues and really want to deal with them, the last thing you want to do is waste time reading cliche' stories of other individuals' bad relationships with their parents or spouses. Instead, I recommend an approach like that of Anger Busting 101 by Newton Hightower because it provides immediate steps to take to begin resolving the problem, without all the needless delving into the \\"root\\" of anger. And no, I am not a shill for Hightower, just a consumer trying to prevent others from making the same mistake I did."},{"Title":"The Anger Trap: Free Yourself from the Frustrations that Sabotage Your Life","review":"Dr. Les Carter definitely knows his subject and he is an excellent writer. As I read The Anger Trap I felt he was talking directly to me. Instead of giving superficial tips on communicating anger differently, the book prompts the reader to examine patterns of thinking that lay beneath the emotion. I found the chapters on control and pride to be especially enlightening. I strongly recommend this book to anyone trying to get a handle on long-standing problems with anger."},{"Title":"The Anger Trap: Free Yourself from the Frustrations that Sabotage Your Life","review":"You'll be suprised by this thought provoking depiction of anger and how your life has been effected by your anger and the anger of the people in your life. I didn't think that my emotional wellness was so effected by anger. There is more to anger then active aggression, loud outburst, or fighting. Everyone experiences anger. You'll relate to the case studies more than you would like to think."},{"Title":"The Anger Trap: Free Yourself from the Frustrations that Sabotage Your Life","review":"I would highly recommend this book for anyone who struggles with anger, from open aggression to constant irritability. If you are on the fence about what anger book to buy, you won't regret buying this one.I've had \\"The Anger Trap\\" for a year now and haven't stopped reading it. It is so full of insight that I can only digest & internalize a few pages of information at a time. This book isn't just for the explosively angry person; it's for the passive-aggressive person and/or the criticizer and/or the usually frustrated and unhappy person. Anger comes in many more forms than I realized, and anger keeps us from being the loving, relational, content, patient, joyful individuals we were created to be. Buying this book has to be the best $15 I ever spent. I sense that I will be working through this book over and over.Even though the author takes you through all the reasons that are foundational to the emotion of anger and all the ways that anger is mismanaged, he never leaves you feeling hopeless. You'll see how screwed up you are, but that there is redemption and hope. There are some legitimate reasons we feel anger, and there are healthy uses of anger. For those of us that feel that anger has become who we are almost all the time, the insight in this book is a powerful tool of truth as one undergoes the process of being free from that (and it takes honest soul-searching on the part of the reader for this tool to be fully appreciated). If you can be honest with yourself as you read this book, I guarantee you'll see what is actually triggering your anger (and it's not outward circumstances like your annoying family member), and you'll see that you don't have to be trapped by anger. Anger doesn't have to have a hold on your personality. This book has practical, do-able, life-changing advice to help you."},{"Title":"The Anger Trap: Free Yourself from the Frustrations that Sabotage Your Life","review":"I thought the Anger Trap was very insightful and as I read through it I recognized my typical anger-generating habits of thinking. I also learned ways to retrain my thinking - slowly but surely - in order the respond to things less emotionally. I also learned that when I am \\"angry\\" I am probably really something else - disappointed, afraid, frustrated, feeling rejected or dismissed. When I start to get mad now I pause and ask myself, \\"what is really going on here?\\" and that alone has enabled me to explore other sides to my personality that I have tried to ignore for the last 30 yrs. I can get through situations that used to make me blow my top as a sane, calm person now. It helps to dialogue with myself (silently, of course, lest they get the net!) by using techniques from the book.My only beef with the premise (it's always something...) is that the author goes with the idea that anger comes from past problems. Grow up with a dad who yells or hits and you'll yell or hit. However, there are many studies that show that a violent home does not necessarily beget a violent child, a calm home does not beget a calm child. Just as anxiety can run in families or depression, might not problems such as overreaction to stimulus? If the dad is a yeller, perhaps it is his genes that pass on the anger and not his yelling. Otherwise, why don't all people from certain types of parents exhibit the behavior? I bring this up, because it is easier to face the problem sometimes when there is no one to blame (except perhaps God, if you lean that way). Rather than bemoan the mess a parent has made of one, it might be better to treat it as a limp that runs in the family but was not bequeathed with any malice. You have the limp, now figure out how to walk with it. You have the temper, now figure out how to respond to life as a decent human being with it."},{"Title":"The Anger Trap: Free Yourself from the Frustrations that Sabotage Your Life","review":"This reference is one of the best self-help books out there. The author has obviously spent a great deal of time in this field, and he has a knack for imparting his accumulated knowledge so that anyone can understand it. He uses stories about real people to illustrate various problems that can arise, and then shows how they can be resolved. Very easy to read. Also very easy to use, as the author gives concrete methods to handle many common situations. I very much appreciate the time and effort Dr. Carter has taken to put this together, and believe it will help many to deal not only with their own anger, but with the anger of people expressed around them. Excellent work!"},{"Title":"The Anger Trap: Free Yourself from the Frustrations that Sabotage Your Life","review":"Before I read this book, I was blowing up at my kids at least once a day. Just a few weeks later, that no longer happens. I'm able to monitor when I'm getting frustrated and keep in control so I don't start yelling out of the blue.This book really made me feel understood by the author. I recognized myself and the people I know in the descriptions of angry people. The biggest thing for me was that he understood how profoundly being yelled at as a child can affect you. He explains that people get angry because their needs aren't being met. So now, I check in with myself regularly to see whether I'm hungry, or tired, or frustrated, and then I try to take steps to meet those needs before I blow up.The main flaw in the book is that it doesn't provide enough detail about how to be assertive. I would have liked to see specific examples and guidelines for how to talk to other people about your needs in an effective, assertive way rather than being aggressive or too passive."},{"Title":"The Anger Trap: Free Yourself from the Frustrations that Sabotage Your Life","review":"my husband and i went thur this 13wk anger workbook w/our ss teacher's it has been very freeing for both of us....so much so that we have purchased more of the books to pass on to friends we have who we know need to work out some anger issues in their lives :)if you have angry issues in your life and need some direction on how to dispose it, this is the book for you :) never give up,god is faithful, he has promised us abundant life, keep pressing.... thank you dr les carter and dr frank minirth :)"},{"Title":"The Anger Trap: Free Yourself from the Frustrations that Sabotage Your Life","review":"This has great practical and Biblical ways to overcome the anger in a person that will stop them from being successful.

This could be written only by someone who is so disconnected that he does not understand the concept of unconditional love, because he has never felt it. Merit is an irrelevant concept. A loving parent loves a child unconditionally, automatically.On page 12 he writes of \\"the message of unconditional love ...\\". But unconditional love is not a message - it is a feeling. And if you can't feel it, you are emotionally crippled, and completely unqualified to offer advice to anyone about anything.The only way to deal successfully with anger is to deal with the feelings behind it. And the only place to start on that journey is to read \\"The Biology Of Love\\" by Arthur Janov."},{"Title":"The Anger Trap: Free Yourself from the Frustrations that Sabotage Your Life","review":"I bought this for my husband, who was willing & interested in dealing with his anger issues.

I bought it because my spouse suffers from chronic anger, and it really enlightened me as to the causes of my spouse's constant anger and frustration.I wish the author would write a book specifically from the point of view of those who suffer from living with angry spouses and parents, with tips on how to help the angry person realize their issues and find peace. This is particularly important for angry parents, as their angry outlook is often taken out on their kids, who have no skills to figure out why this it's happening and end up with their own personality disorders.An important topic and a very clear and easy-to-read book."},{"Title":"The Anger Trap: Free Yourself from the Frustrations that Sabotage Your Life","review":"As the first book I've read in a long time to work over my anger issues I thought this book was a great starter. I didn't really agree with the chapter about forgiveness, as the lady basically said if the person is so unreasonable just keep turning your cheek by choosing the option not to be mad, as it seemed a bit passive agressive. However, using the work from the other chapters, I think this book has done wonders for me in terms of giving me a better mindset especially whe arguing fairly, or why I do things I know I will regret later. A must read."},{"Title":"The Anger Trap: Free Yourself from the Frustrations that Sabotage Your Life","review":"I haven't completely finished this book yet but so far it has been very helpful. I have read numerous self help books over the years and find that most are not very useful. This one, however, is very insightful and certainly gives the reader a lot to think about. I think most people could truly benefit from this book. I am recommending it to friends and family."},{"Title":"The Anger Trap: Free Yourself from the Frustrations that Sabotage Your Life","review":"I found The Anger Trap to be rather dry, and was quite disappointed after reading the other positive ratings. First off, you should understand that the anger covered in this book solely has to do with relationship interactions between humans and doesn't cover many other forms of anger. Personally I find myself getting angry at situational problems, like losing a game, being made to do something pointless or people driving.If you want to learn better ways to interact with other people, Dale Carnegie's book, \\" How to Win Friends & Influence People\\" is a MUCH MUCH better guide. Dale's book discusses the roots of the way people like to be treated and reasoned with, which in my opinion gets a lot closer to the roots of these kind of problems than this book does.Overall, this book is a dry long read, and occasionally confusing as you try to link all of Dr. Carter's patients together through their stories."},{"Title":"The Anger Trap: Free Yourself from the Frustrations that Sabotage Your Life","review":"The book content itself is informative. Much information one already knows. From a therapist's point of view, much more could have been touched on in regards to effective ways to evaluate why we let ourselves become angry. There are ALWAYS underlying causes and many times our current anger or outburst of anger is not due to what is right in front of us at that moment but unresolved issues from our past. That was not expounded on in the book. It is a book for those individuals who have not really researched or read about anger. A good beginner's book on anger. It is easy to read.I wished I had a clue that there would be so much highligting and underlining in the book or I would not have purchased that particular one. Sender was not honest about how much he/she wrote in the book."},{"Title":"The Anger Trap: Free Yourself from the Frustrations that Sabotage Your Life","review":"Great info in this book.

If you're already here looking for a book on anger management, then you've taken the first step in recognizing that there is something you want to do about it. The second step would be buying this book. I think that in the last month since I got it, I've learned more about myself than my entire 28 years of age...and yes, it's scary, but it's also great at the same time. I never looked at myself like this, but it's definitely made me open my eyes about what I need to do in order to control, suppress and more importantly, express my feelings without losing control. Excellent read in plain English, easy to understand and follow."},{"Title":"The Anger Trap: Free Yourself from the Frustrations that Sabotage Your Life","review":"Use to teach others but if you do that sort of thing you understand it can be so helpful for you. Plus this book was as close to being new, more than I expected."},{"Title":"The Anger Trap: Free Yourself from the Frustrations that Sabotage Your Life","review":"If you were born into a really dysfunctional family and never received basic people skills training then this book is for you. However, if you have over time realized that the world around you had made you forget the lessons you learned as a child and caused you to be less than the person you now want to be then look for another book. The book is filled with interviews of people who never were given the chance to learn how to cope. I was looking for a simple refresher on the psychology of what makes us angry and how to rethink those issues. The book does provide that but it does it in hundreds of pages instead of the 40-50 pages that it needed to use. If your time is valuable look for another book."},{"Title":"The Anger Trap: Free Yourself from the Frustrations that Sabotage Your Life","review":"This book was well written and contained a plethora of background information. The descriptions of the real life Interactions was very illuminating and made the author's premises easy to follow. I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Anger Trap: Free Yourself from the Frustrations that Sabotage Your Life","review":"I have quite a few books on cognitive psychology. However, I had no idea what a big component anger was to my emotional health. By now, everybody has been given the opportunity to learn that mental health is a very complex issue. However, many of us(I'm guilty of it) seem to deal with our emotions with the same thought processes, over and over. If you're like me, you end up kidding yourself that one day you're going to finally relax.. and not be so angry.I found a lot of books kind of boring... re-stating the obvious, or talking about things in a very \\"clinical\\" way. I have to say, Les Carter put together a very good book. I used to think that I was aware of the many destructive thought processes that we can possess. Chapter after chapter, however, I was impressed with the new insight into such an old problem.I have heard that some people will make the point that Les Carter is coming from a religious perspective. I'm an atheist and did not know of his religious background before getting halfway into the book. I can say that he does a great job of leaving religion out of the book to keep its information universally acceptable.When buying this book, I thought it was just going to cover a small facet of my emotional well being. I, now, think that this is one of the more useful books in my collection.When I read a book on depression, it often exposes profound insights into my own thought processes. However, this book provided a different way of interpreting the behaviors of my parents, teachers, bosses, co-workers, girlfriends, etc. I, definitely, was not expecting to get this much out of this book."},{"Title":"The Anger Trap: Free Yourself from the Frustrations that Sabotage Your Life","review":"Great book, it has changed my life (no bull). Anger is as debilitating as cancer. You may not even be aware of how angry you are, or how you're expressing it.

Its also helpful in understand and being empathetic with others and their anger."},{"Title":"The Anger Trap: Free Yourself from the Frustrations that Sabotage Your Life","review":"This is a great book on anger, and differs from many of the other anger books because it explains that many angry (or constantly irritable) people are fragile. Unfortunately, all anger books - even the best ones - are inadequate.I have read many books on the so-called \\"negative\\" emotions and most helpful for me were \\"To Love is to be Happy With\\" by Barry Kaufman, who founded the wonderful Options Institute in the U.S. and \\"Nonviolent Communication: a Language of Life\\" by Marshall B. Rosenberg (his Center for Nonviolent Communication trains in North America, Europe & UK, Malaysia and India and Rosenberg has a great book called \\"The Surprising Purpose of Anger\\").Also I have done a huge amount of \\"work\\" on myself for well over 2 decades yet all this wholehearted work did not result in much success with anger. Eventually - after more than TWO decades of wasted time and money (lots of time, lots of money), I discovered uncontrollable anger is very strongly linked to health. ALL anger-advice books overlook insufficient adrenals, yet one of the MAJOR symptoms is constant irritation. (That's why this book gets it more right than most - adrenal fatigue definitely makes you fragile as well as a lot of other things, like trouble sleeping and/or difficulty getting to sleep, overreacting/defensive, fatigue and/or jittery, lightheaded getting out of bed, and much more.)Finally, after decades of mis-diagnoses (very common, I have learned) serious low thyroid AND low adrenal function was identified, but only because I was finally lucky enough to come across \\"Stop the Thyroid Madness\\" (both website and book are excellent on both thyroid and adrenal issues). I had to arrange and pay for my own lab tests (the so-called \\"gold standard\\" tests are wrong!) and then (because most doctors, including endos, really do not understand) find a truly knowledgeable physician through patient recommendations on the \\"Stop the Thyroid Madness\\" website.After a few months of PROPER treatment my anger/irritability simply melted away! (slowly)The more stress you have had in your lifetime, the more likely you are to have adrenal issues (I had a high-powered job for 20 years but then had to limp through the last ten years before I was able to retire by going part-time - which of course meant low quality work at much lower pay). So, here are some FREE home/self tests for identifying struggling adrenals:TEST ONE:Take and compare two blood pressure readings--one while lying down and one while standing. Rest for five minutes while sitting before taking the first reading. Stand up and immediately take the blood pressure again. If either blood pressure reading is lower after standing, suspect adrenal gland problems, and more specifically, an aldosterone issue-another adrenal hormone. The degree to which the blood pressure drops while standing is often proportionate to the degree of hypoadrenalism. (Normal adrenal function will raise your BP on the standing reading in order to push blood to the brain.) It can be wise to do this test both in the morning and in the evening, since you can appear normal one time, and not another. (BP monitors are available cheaply on Amazon)TEST TWO:Let someone shine a bright light your way. Do you find yourself very sensitive and uncomfortable with the bright light (similarly with bright summer sunshine)? That could be a sign of adrenal fatigue. And this can also be true if you have searing headaches along with the sensitivity.TEST THREE:This is called the Pupil test and primarily tests your levels of aldosterone, another adrenal hormone. You need to be in a darkened room with a mirror and a flashlight/ torch/ penlight. Do this later in the day as results are more reliable then. From the side (not the front), shine a bright light towards your pupils and hold it for about a minute. Carefully observe the pupil. With healthy adrenals (and specifically, healthy levels of aldosterone), your pupils will constrict, and will stay small the entire time you shine the light from the side. In adrenal fatigue, the pupil will get small, but within 30 seconds, it will soon enlarge again or obviously flutter in its attempt to stay constricted.Why? Because adrenal insufficiency can also result in low aldosterone, which causes a lack of proper amounts of sodium and an abundance of potassium. This imbalance causes the sphincter muscles of your eye to be weak and to dilate in response to light. (Note: there are over 50 sphincters in the body and stress incontinence caused by adrenal fatigue is difficult to fix just with pelvic floor exercises.)TEST FOUR:Take your temp 3 times a day, starting three hours after you wake up, and every three hours after that, to equal three temps. (If you have eaten or exercised right before it's time to take your temp, wait 20 more minutes.) Then average them for that day. Do this for AT LEAST 5 days. If your averaged temp is fluctuating from day to day more than .2 to .3 (with a lean towards .2), you need adrenal support. Again, your daily average temps should lean towards the .2 when on enough cortisol for your needs.If your temps are fluctuating but overall low, you need both adrenal and thyroid support. If your temps are fluctuating but averaging 98.6, you just need adrenal support. If it is steady but low, you need thyroid support and adrenals are likely fine.(mercury thermometers are the most accurate but very difficult to buy nowadays, next best are liquid thermometers, then digital thermometers - which can be wrong by up to 1degreeF. Do NOT use ear thermometers.)TEST FIVE:This is the easiest home test for adrenal deficiency, from Wilson's excellent 2001 book (still a classic) called \\"Adrenal Fatigue\\": all you need for this test is a ball point pen. Drag the dull end of a pen across your abdomen for about six inches (my guess would be about 2 fingers' width above or below your belly button) but don't press overly hard or scratch the skin. If your adrenals are functioning normally or are only mildly affected, the mark will turn from white to red within about 10 seconds. If your adrenals are fatigued, however, the line will widen and stay white for about 2 minutes. This test isn't terribly accurate as it only shows up on about 40 per cent of people with low adrenal function. It generally tests positive only if the adrenal fatigue is fairly severe.The outer cortex of our adrenal glands produces the hormones cortisol, aldosterone, testosterone, DHEA, DHEAS, androstenedione and estrogens. Dysfunctional adrenals equates first to combined highs and lows of cortisol that are not normal, then to low cortisol (and sometimes low aldosterone as well as imbalances in other hormones). The Stop the Thyroid Madness website has much free practical information on adrenal issues as well as low thyroid. If you want a lab test to confirm any self-test results, the most useful - and most accurate - is the 24-hour saliva test which is not very expensive (don't let your doctor insist on the unreliable blood test or urine test)."},{"Title":"The Anger Trap: Free Yourself from the Frustrations that Sabotage Your Life","review":"Getting to the bottom of your anger issues is possible with this book's information. Presented in a straight-forward, readable manner, the book's contents move the reader from understanding that anger is a natural human emotion and one that is acceptable to have and express to an understanding of how we can change our anger \\"habits.\\" Many of us \\"anger junkies\\" were never taught HOW to manage our anger, nor were we told that anger is an acceptable feeling, so we tend to express it in all the wrong ways--by either turning on ourselves, our loved-ones, or others. Most often we express anger in the ways it was expressed or levied upon us at vulnerable times of our development when we didn't have a choice but to endure.The author presents scenarios from his own practice (with names changed) to help the reader to comprehend how he has helped others and the ways we manage anger is a choice. He also emphasizes that old patterns of anger-related behavior that are destructive to self, family, and friends, can indeed be changed with practice once the desire to change is present. Know that changing behavior and attitudes is a constant choice and a process that will take some time and concentrated effort.Surprising to me was the section concerning how I must just \\"let go\\" of some anger knowing that it is destructive largely to me if I don't and secondarily to my family, friends, and co-workers. This \\"offended\\" my personal sense of justice at first, but rereading this section helped me to see letting go is possible and gives me a new sense of healthy \\"control.\\" According to Dr. Carter, \\"By accepting the freedom to manage emotions...angry people can recognize that 'If I\\"m going to have stability, it's my decision and no one else's.' That is when anger has less and less a grip on their lives\\" (70).Best wishes to all who read Dr. Carter's book. It has certainly helped me to understand where my anger came from (a highly-dysfunctional home with two addicted parents whom I parented and made excuses for many years as a child) and that I can take the control I've levied on others and use it to manage my emotions in more healthy ways."},{"Title":"The Anger Trap: Free Yourself from the Frustrations that Sabotage Your Life","review":"\\"Anger: The Emotion of Self-Preservation\\"Please check out this book; send it to fathers, mother, sons, daughters, priests, pastors and counselors of all faiths or non-faiths.I have been looking for this kind of information all my life.

It assures us that anger does not go away because there will always be people and situations that make us angry. It is impossible to create some zen state where nothing bothers us.

Of the latter, there are two possibilities, (i) people whose anger can be disarmed through patience and by not reflecting a second anger back to them and (ii) people who cannot be disarmed, they are too upset and angry to be disarmed no matter how mollifying you may be (i.e. someone drunk and belligerent). Thus it covers both possible directions of anger, your own and other's anger.One can read a book and wonder what benefit is actually accruing to your subconscious as you go along. About 2/3 ''s of the way through the book, I was confronted by a person, spoiling for an argument (happily, because it tested me). One indelicate word in response from myself would have put it over the top for this person.While I did not feel especially provoked, my attitude before reading the book may well have been to put in a contrary word or two, to partially balance the scale, possibly to show I wasn't about to be pushed around.Happily taking the book to heart, I was sensitive to the reality this person was upset and by responding in a non inflammatory way, something that could have escalated in silly ways, was defused. The book addresses why this is a superior and thoughtful method.It is easy to read a book and months later forget the lessons taught. That would not be the author's fault, so I made bookmarks for future reference. The book covers about every imaginable variation on the subject of anger. As well it is a reasonably engaging book to read."},{"Title":"Common Sense Dressage: An Illustrated Guide","review":"I found some of the information in this book to be very helpful.

It also does not give Ms. O'Connor the right to tell people to use words like &quot;brav&quot; when working with a horse (especially if they don't know what it means).

This text, 'Leaps and Boundaries: The Prayer Book in the 21st Century', is one of many books from the past decade devoted to exploring issues that have been identified in the history of liturgy and liturgical reform, particularly in light of the most recent prayer book revision (1979, for the American church) and the continuing change in society that calls for new expressions of worship. There are currently no particular plans for a full-scale revision of the American Book of Common Prayer; however, given the general pace at which these things happen, discussion now will set the stage for when the next revision is to take place. There were roughly 50 years between the last Books of Common Prayer (1928 to 1979); half that time has already passed with the current Book of Common Prayer, and the official process of adoption being realistically at least a decade long, it makes sense that now would be the time to begin looking for 'the next big thing'.While Anglican liturgy has a strong historical tradition of support, and most Anglicans hearten to the idea of keeping faith with the past, it is also true, as editors Marshall and Northrup point out in the preface, 'Liturgy never reamins static, nor should it.' As we change, so should it, and it should change us, as we are changing it. Yet it remains firmly grounded in the three-fold foundation of Anglicanism, that being of scripture, tradition and reason.This collection looks at various issues in three broad sections: The Big Picture; Rites and Wrongs; and Leaping Beyond the Bonds of Boundaries. In the section entitled 'The Big Picture', the first essay by Marion Hatchet looks at unfinished business from the last major reform, the 1979 book, and what can be done as corrective prior to the next major reform. This goes through the BCP section by section, highlighting important for consideration. Carol Doran looks at musical issues related to liturgy (something not generally addressed directly in the BCP save with minor rubrics about when music can be used). Finally, Leigh Axton Williams discusses the canonical procedures for changing the liturgical, and how to make this process more relevant and central to the task of the church as a community of worship.In the section 'Rites and Wrongs', four authors look at particular issues. Paul Marshall (one of the editors of the volume) looks particularly at specific 'bad habits' that have collected around the liturgy in different pieces, and Linda Moeller takes a similar task, concentrating particularly on the practice of and results of the Baptismal rite. Rounding out this section are two essays concerning the ordained - Richard Leggett looks at the bishop's ordiantion/consecration rites, and Ormonde Platter looks at the role of deacons in the liturgy, an often misunderstood and misused order, particularly in liturgical rites.The final section, 'Leaping Beyond the Bonds of Boundaries', is the section of experimentation and speculation. Philip Pfatteicher author of commentaries on the Lutheran Book of Worship, discusses the idea of a truly common Book of Common Prayer that could be utilised in the liturgies of both the Lutheran (ELCA) church and the Episcopal church, in light of the recent intercommunion agreements. Paul Marshall contributes another essay looking at the problem of lifelessness in some liturgical expressions, and how some protestants have lost an earlier sense of ecstasy and spiritual joy associated with earlier catholic and orthodox worship. Leslie Northrup, the other editor of this volume, looks at some of the cutting-edge issues surrounding liturgical thinking, particularly with regard to women's issues. J. Neil Alexander asks broad foundational questions for the future, including the radical idea of multiple Books of Common Prayer (to a certain extent, already a reality with alternative service guides) and other questions to which the answer would seem, to most Anglicans, no question.I would have welcomed a concluding synopsis of ideas, or input from the editors about further directions and study, but sadly that is not present here. Unfortunately, there is no index or bibliography, nor a list of selected/recommended readings, that might make this volume very much more useful. As it is, this is a very interesting collection of essays by leaders in the field of Anglican liturgy, and worthy of a place in the library of any Anglican, particularly Episcopalians."},{"Title":"Irish Babies Names (Collins Gem)","review":"Good name selection and historical info but I don't like the fact that the pronunciations are all in the back of the book instead of with the name listings throughout the book."},{"Title":"Scrambles amongst the Alps in the years 1860-69,","review":"Since I first read this little classic, Edward Whymper's book on scrambling in the Alps has always been my favorite mountaineering book. Something about his style of writing makes one feel they have not only read a delightful tale, they have actually incorporated it into their own memory. His pencil etchings are so evocative, you can almost smell the brisk air of Zermatt and feel the weathered texture of the Swiss dwelling. You can once again experience the thoughts of trepidation and anticipation which accompany a good outing in the mountains. This is Victorian mountain writing at its very best, in an age before high technology and polarfleece added safety and comfort but put some palpable distance between you and the experience and blunted the directness of your perceptions and observations. I've spent many of my own happy hours scrambling in the Alps, but somehow Whymper makes it seem like I'm doing it anew. Sure, it's always interesting to read of the difficulties of Everest or the tales of hardship on Half Dome, but Whymper was among the first, and high technology and modern photography have not allowed us to better put you into the heart of the experience."},{"Title":"Scrambles amongst the Alps in the years 1860-69,","review":"This is a great book whether you are an armchair mountaineer or an avid climber.

There's a lot of first-we-did-this and then-we-did-that, but when Whymper moves away from chronological reporting, he shows himself to be one hell of a good writer.

The ghost of John Matthew Smith roams uneasily as the book opens, for the 6th generation struggles with both economic insecurity and psychological turmoil. This wise but chastened family patriarch has cherished his descendents since the Civil War, so how can two out-of-state kids from the 20th century save the family from its self destructive path? Two of the three promised Treasure Houses have reluctantly yielded up their secrets but No. Two South remains a dangerous enigma.At thirteen Ellsworth (Zee) Smith receives a letter from a sweet,elderly relative whom he has never met urging him to visit to Smith Mills, NY, for the rest of the summer. But his father is adamant that the boy not return to the decaying homestead which he himself has shunned for decades--too many painful memories. Zee senses the urgency in the letter and decides to confront his father with his intention to return anyway. After receiving grudging consent Zee boards a bus, on which he loses his father's detailed letter of explanation. Surprised at the large square (the green Sward) with its pond and identical houses on all four sides, he realizes that many of the structures--like the complex inter family relations--are in a state of arrested decay. Zee's mostly Quaker relatives greet his arrival with various emotions, from joy and relief to indifference and even hostility. Tension mounts and the sweltering heat increases, which explodes in a terrific electrical storm. Clearly there is no hint of John Matthew's beloved Smith Family unity for Zee to experience.Once he comes to trust his cousin Jess, also newly arrived at Smith Square, Zee quickly obsesses about their mutual need to find the final hidden treasure: not just to help the general financial situation, but to prove that these two young teens were the right pair--that they were Supposed to be there that summer to help save the family. But treasure comes in many forms, so Zee and Jess are confronted with puzzle boxes, secret springs, carved initials and an old diary in their mutual quest to decipher the patriarch's plan.Anderson's style is exquisite, as literary tension increases with each successive chapter. She even provides two flashbacks so readers share in the elation of discovering the first two treasures: diamonds and a deed to rich land. What else could John Matthew have hidden to provide for his progeny? And what about the tantalyzing visual clues in Grandma Betsy's folkartsy painting: a family of 13 dancing--with their feet firmly planted on the ground--around a pond? It should have been so obvious...Somehow Zee knows that to sell the now valuable painting would prove disastrous to the patriarch's wise goals. Just one more mystery waiting for the agile minds of Zee and Jess to solve. Who else could rescue thedeclining family fortune? An immensely enjoyable read for kids of all ages!"},{"Title":"The Last Treasure","review":"I know it may seem like the price is high, but this book is a serious treasure.

It's time to get a few answers about his family and why they are alone like this.

But he finds his relationship with his dad is strained. He winds up with more questions that ever, and presented with a treasure hunt. It seems his great-great grandfather has hidden a treasure and the family are counting on Ellsworth and his new found cousin Jess to figure it out.I really enjoyed this book. I hadn't heard anything about it or the author, but it was a very nice surprise. I read about half last night and couldn't wait to finish it today. I think it would appeal to teens or older kids who like a bit of a mystery."},{"Title":"The Last Treasure","review":"The Last Treasure was a great book, it is one of the few books I have reread. I loved the mystery, and the way the family comes together in the end to discover the last treasure. I also really liked the treasure in the end . . . it is very unexpected."},{"Title":"The Last Treasure","review":"Let me start by saying I really enjoyed this book so much so that as the end approached, I started reading slower so that it wouldn't be over as quickly.This book has layers like a story about many generations of family should have. It has mystery, it has treasure hunting, it has tradition, it has a bit of a mystical aspect to it that sometimes bothers me but not too much here and it has pie! It is a story about human beings, about family and much more.Ellsworth is summoned by his cousin Elizabeth to join the family and help find the last treasure. When he comes to Smith's Mills, he meets his cousin Jess and many of the family members that he is just learning about. His father left years ago after a disagreement with the family.I enjoyed the book most for the story of the third (and last) treasure. I liked the mystery and the puzzle solving of it. What elevated the book from just a good mystery to something much more was the many layers of family. There were so many generations and each one was addressed. There were feuds, family secrets and misunderstandings. The author brought the remaining family together to form an ending that was touching without being too overly neat. This conclusion was quite satisfying - so many books are good and then just don't miss the mark right at the end. This one hit the bull's eye.The only drawback I can see is the grand nature of the mystery. The building of so many houses and the connection between the paintings seems a bit fantastical for the down-to-earth nature of the story.I recommend this book to people who like stories with lots of characters to keep in mind. Puzzle lovers and treasure hunters will enjoy it as well. It takes a stretch of the imagination to fully enjoy the book. But there are no car chases or snake-filled rooms so action seekers may not enjoy this book very much. People who want a mystery that is very grounded to reality will not enjoy this either.For its good writing, likable characters, great storytelling and wonderful conclusion, this book teetered between 4 and 5 stars for me. I went with 4 because I know that there are books that I've enjoyed more. This one is still a must-read though."},{"Title":"The Last Treasure","review":"This book was realy interesting.

Anderson, is a mystery about the Smith family. The Smith family has been in Smith Mills, New York for 150 years. This exciting adventure is Janet S. Anderson's third book for kids, and was a good candidate for the 2004 Newbery Award.Ellsworth Smith is thirteen and lives with his father. On Ellsworth's birthday, he gets a letter from a distant cousin inviting him to stay with her for the summer. He really wants to go, but he isn't sure why. When he goes to the square with ten houses built by his great, great, great, great grandfather, Ellsworth learns a lot about the Smith family members, both living and dead. He and Jess, his cousin, have to solve the puzzle of the last treasure house on the square in order to keep the family together.The author uses journal entries to tell the story of the Smith family from long ago. She also uses flashbacks in time. It is a little confusing to follow, but still really exciting. And the ending makes you feel good about the Smith family and your own. I think you will like this book and the message it has about families."},{"Title":"The Last Treasure","review":"The ghost of John Smith, was a wealthy patriarch, has been taking a yearly walk around the Square of homes he built for his large family. He had hidden three treasures, two of which were found by the family when desperately needed. Now it is time for the youngest relatives to find the third. Sending dreams to two Smith teens who have never met, he promises their return to Smiths Mills. Facing a counterpane of mystery, mechanically minded Ellsworth and angry Jess must join forces to figure out the family dynamics and the meaning of the treasure clues. In Ellsworth, she has created a fully rounded and appealing character that has never been told why his father cut off all ties with his relatives years earlier. With a touch of the family's happiness of The Monkey Tree and a bit of the fake Going through the Gate Anderson has made up an awesome book for puzzle lovers.This book was great, it took the book to get intrusting but well worth it! Ellsworth is the brains behind the adventure and was just waiting for a opportunity like this, Jess on the other hand was my favorite character, because Jess was a tough kid who was just pushy and a never say never type of person.For all the mystery lovers out there, this is the book for you. I ratted it 5 out of 5 stars and I'm not much of a reader. I mean, I read only for and when I HAVE TO for school. Now, if you're like me this for shore won't make you read but it is a good book and if you're willing enjoy its twists and turns! What are you still doing here go get this book, come on get out of here! :)"},{"Title":"The Last Treasure","review":"This is Janet Anderson's third children's novel, and it contains the same sort of thought-provoking depth as her first two (GOING THROUGH THE GATE and THE MONKEY TREE). On the surface, this is a fast-paced, suspenseful read about the Smith family and the \\"treasure\\" that is hidden inside an old brick house. Intriguing flashbacks serve to hold our interest as we venture into this house and try to find the treasure.However, this book is more than just a treasure hunt, and buried along with the treasure is the story of one boy and his outlook on the world. Ellsworth Smith is one of the most convincing characters I have read in a long time, but he's not the only one - all of Anderson's characters are brought to life with a unique and interesting style of dialogue. In the end, this story delivers a message about family, especially through the relationship between Ellsworth, his father, and his grandfather - the message, however, is never heavy-handed. Anderson's prose is amazingly vivid and poetic, and the story is one of her best yet. The book itself is a hidden treasure waiting to be found."},{"Title":"The Last Treasure","review":"I loved this book because it reminded me how much I love my family. It made me think that in ups or downs a family stays together.This book is about a teenager named Ellsworth. His dad moved away from the square so since then he and Ellsworth have lived in a motel. Now Ellsworth for his 13th birthday got a card from Elizabeth his aunt saying she wanted him to move in with her at the square. The square is a place that John Sullivan made about 100 years ago for his 13 kids. Since then members of the family have moved in and out of the square.John Sullivan's family is falling apart and Ellsworth has to find the last treasure to save the family. A long time ago they found two treasures buried in two of three houses. One was 13 diamonds, the second was steel mines and the last treasure was . . . . . . You need to read the book to find out for yourself.My favorite part in this book is when Ellsworth and his cousin Jessica meet for the first time in life. She thought they were twins!!!!I would recommend this book to anybody ages 11+ years old. Someone who loves a book that it takes the book to get what's happening. An overall awesome book! A thumbs up from me."},{"Title":"The Last Treasure","review":"This book is good but some parts are hard to understand because it is poetry. The poetry is the clue to the mystery of the last treasure house. If you read the clues over you will understand what they mean. It is so good, I would probably read it again.

The book itself is kind of long, but I promise you'll love it. This book is about the Smith family and it goes very far back in their generation to explain things about their family. Back in the 1800's the Smith family had thirteen children so the father, John Matthew, built ten houses on a square in New York. Before he died he hid three priceless treasures in three of the ten houses to be found by members of the Smith family when times were bad. Your probably wondering how anyone could find them, or even know about them. Well the mother, Betsy Sullivan,painted three pictures each had separate clues in them so their Smith decendents would be able to find the treasures one day. One of the treasures was found in 1910 and the other in 1932. This book takes place in 2003 and the last treasure still hasn't been found. Something that is odd is adults cannot seem to find the treasure, it is always a child who ends up finding it because they look at things adults don't. The most recent Smith children are Jess and Ellsworth. They come to Smith square in New York because they are determined to find the last treasure in house No. 2 South. Will they find it or will it be lost forever?"},{"Title":"The Last Treasure","review":"Since his death, the ghost of John Smith, once a wealthy patriarch, has been taking a yearly walk around the Square of homes he built for his large family.

Like \\"Chasing Vermeer,\\" the book is about a puzzle that must be solved, in this case there is a treasure to be found.Thirteen year old Ellsworth lives a nomad life with his father and his fish, Hugo. He receives a birthday card from \\"some kind of cousin\\" named Elizabeth who invites him to visit for the summer. All that he knows about his father's family is that his dad does not want anything to do with them. Never the less, he is intrigued by her reference to the puzzle of the \\"last\\" treasure and despite his father's misgivings leaves for the Square in Smith Mills, NY.As Ellsworth gets to know more about his family he also learns more about his parents and especially his mother. With a distant girl cousin his age named Jess he tries to solve the puzzle of the last treasure house. My favorite part of the story is where Ellsworth and Jess read the journal of their great grand-relative and get to know him by hearing his story in his own words.I was overwhelmed by the number of names and relationships. There is a family tree and a map of the Square in the front of the book; I should have referred to it more often. I think it is a bad sign when you have to work extra hard to keep all the characters straight.An ok read but I cannot see how it made the Bluebonnet list.

When Garrison insists on repaying the debt he feels he owes to the doctor, the doctor refers him to an older relative who happens to need something accomplished for which Garrison has the right skills.The deed? Bring the relative's granddaughter out of Russia (this is during the height of the Cold War) to the United States. To accomplish this, Garrison forms a team of his military buddies, all with different but necessary skills, and then he comes up with his plan: kidnap a high-ranking Russian official, and then &quot;swap&quot; the official for the girl. The game's afoot!While Wager's writing style is not literary, it is good enough to lift his books above the vast collection of dredge that one often finds in the thriller market. A number of Wager's books (though not this one) have been made into decent movies: &quot;Viper Three&quot; (as &quot;Twilight's Last Gleaming&quot;), &quot;Telefon,&quot; and &quot;58 Minutes&quot; (as &quot;Die Hard 2,&quot; with significant modifications, of course). At his best, which I think &quot;Swap&quot; represents, Wager is pretty close to Alistair MacLean -- and for a thriller writer, that's pretty good."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"There are a lot of people who dislike Ayn Rand. Whether for the rather didactic and lengthy sermons that populate most of the plots of her novels, or her own theories which tend to be underdeveloped and difficult to understand, she is not the most popular author or person in the philosophical realm. We the Living, however, is a book that one must read in order to change the perception of Rand doing what she does best: writing fiction.The novel is a harsh look at communism in the post-Red revolution of Russia, following three people: Kira, a young, idealistic, woman who bourgeois family was left poverty-stricken following the revolt; Leo, an indifferent young man haunted by the Communists due his late father's war glory; and Andrei, a Communist questioning his own beliefs in the system he has risen up in so quickly. Despite the fact that this novel is set in a far-away time and place to most of its readers, it is a book which I felt an extremely strong connection with. Everybody knows a Leo: flippant, handsome, could get any girl he wants -- but he has serious character flaws, and tends to be abusive of Kira's love for him. And Kira, the novel's protagonist, is very similar to any youth of today: she does not understand the ideals of the Communist party, but she does know what she believes and is wholeheartedly committed to fulfilling the promise she had at birth.The entire novel is beautifully written in moving prose that reflects both the harsh conditions for the people of Russia and the emotions felt between Kira, Andrei, Leo, and others as they attempt to make life better for themselves in a regime that denies them anything good without punishment. The climax of the novel is breathtaking -- by the time the final words have been read, the reader is totally attached to the characters.As with any other great novel of its time, We the Living not only characterizes the time period it is based in, but its characters live on as people of today's world, in today's capitalistic society. It questions the principles of freedom and what people will do for that freedom. This is Rand's greatest work: the philosophy is subtle, with more emphasis on the plot and the characters, but is there. Whatever you may think of Ayn Rand, you must read this novel -- it is a moving portrait of human life."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Ayn Rand said that \\"We the Living\\" was the closest she would ever come to writing an autobiography. Maybe that's why when I was reading WTL I got the impression that I was witnessing real scenes from Ayn's past life under the Soviet system. The uncompromising and highly principled behavior of the main character, Kira is inspiring and horrible to witness when you realize what she was up against(communist rule).Kira is not the superhero type Rand would create so well in The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, but she was as close as you could expect to find in Soviet Russia. And unlike Rand's later fiction, WTL has a sad ending... an ending which really drives home the point of how collectivism's ultimate result is death -- death of the mind, death of the individual, and eventually death of everything good in society.It kept me up nights reading and many more nights pondering what it all meant. A great read!"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"\\"We the living\\" is the lesser known of Ayn Rand's novels, yet my favorite.I'd say without doubt or hesitation that there is no novel which I have loved as much as this one(and I don't think I'll ever love any other as much as this one, too).Yes, \\"The Fountainhead\\" and \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" certainly are greater, but this novel had an emotional impact on me which the others did not - at least not of the same degree.Though Rand had not fully defined her unique, ground-breaking philosophy of Objectivism at the time she wrote this novel - it proffers her image of life and man which is fully consistent with her more refined novels.The theme of this novel,strictly speaking,is : \\"The evil of totalitarianism\\".Going deeper, the theme emerges to be : \\"The sanctity of human life.\\"Ultimately, this novel dramatizes how totalitarianism violates the sanctity of human life.But I'd say the fundamental abstraction is : \\"MAN'S LOVE FOR LIFE, FREEDOM AND HAPPINESS\\"And this is what reaches out to every person who reads this emotionally intense novel about a love-triangle involving a woman, an ex-aristocrat and a communist whose lives are destroyed by the system in which they live (in Communist Russia) - for I don't think there is any person in this world,except the most depraved,who doesn't value life,joy and liberty (at least his/her own).\\"We The Living\\" is about the human spirit struggling to preserve its dignity, honor and benevolence - in circumstances which break and pulverize, embitter and malign it.It is about both,the vulnerability,and the indestructibility of the human spirit.It is about man being driven by despair, hopelessness and pain to resort to incorrect means so as to achieve good ends.It is about man's struggle to preserve his values.It is about love - the kind of love which, unfortunately, I think, is found only in some novels.It is Kira's love for Leo and Andrei's love for Kira which makes WTL my best-loved novel...\\"YOU ARE MY HIGHEST REVERENCE\\"...no other writer and no other novel has given such a profound, beautiful expression to the phenomena of love.THIS is poetry, passion and man-worship - which makes love sacred, sex an act of worship and man an object worthy of the devotion which is directed at God.If you want to know what passionate love is, what does one mean by a value-oriented sense of life, what is hero-worship, read \\"We The Living\\".Though this novel lacks the explicit philosophic content of the Rand's other novels & one may think that Kira's actions, strictly speaking, are morally wrong - \\"We The Living\\" performs its objective with superb effectiveness : it makes you hate totalitarianism - whether Nazism, Fascism, Communism or the Medieval Church, the broader abstraction remains - that totalitarianism is anti-life - because it takes away man's freedom to think, to choose, to act, to pursue his/ her happiness - on his/her on terms."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This was the first of Rand's novels to sell fairly well commercially. Initially it did well in Europe and less so in the USA. When the first printing was sold out in the USA, the plates were destroyed and it went out of print for close to 20 years before the combined success of THE FOUNTAINHEAD and ATLAS SHRUGGED cried out for its re-publication in the United States.There is much truth in other reviewers comments here that this book seems to be written so differently than Rand's later novels. I will not disagree with anyone on that. Along with ANTHEM and a play titled THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 16th, Rand used WTL as a laboratory to express her anti-totalitarian ideas in English and in novel form. It should be remembered that Rand came here as a penniless Russian immigrant. She initially lived with relatives in Chicago and then made her way to Los Angeles where she earned her way (and began to write).Rand herself said that this book was the closest she would ever come to writing an autobiography. Obviously, Kira is an idealized fictional symbol of all that Rand held to be virtuous and worth aspiring to. She conflicts good and evil and in the process, we see that even though Kira idolizes freedom (both political and economic), she cannot accept contradictions in the man she has chosen to love.This novel portrays the impact of the Bolshevik Revolution on the lives of three people. Three people who meant very little to the totalitarian Soviet state and the Communist Party but as individual Russians, living through that dark midnight that almost extinguished hope in the hearts of the Russian people, Kira, Leo and Andrei are as alive as any of the classic characters found elsewhere in important literature.Kira comes to the story as part of an affluent Russian family that loses everything after the Bolsheviks seize power during &quot;kraznaya Oktobriana.&quot; After the Bolsheviks expropriate all of their property for the &quot;good of the proletariat,&quot; their lives change dramatically. Kira, who wanted to be a builder loses her chance for continued education and position because she will not conform to the new &quot;Soviet ideal.&quot;Eventually, she meets Leo Kovalensky, a Russian aristocrat who stands unbowed before the altar of Soviet justice. He refuses to recognize the hegemony of the new system over any aspect of his life. Kira, admiring this fierce individuality, falls for Leo and comes to stand by his side. She knows that she has met her &quot;Viking god.&quot;Andrei Taganov is the ultimate instrument of the Soviet state. He wears a leather jacket and carries all the authority of the new dictatorship. In ages past, he would have worn the helmet of a Roman Centurion or the armor of a crusading knight. But always, he would have been the symbol of some governmental oppression. He is a born secret policeman in a system that required men all too willing to torture and imprison their fellow men.As Rand writes about the early Soviet system, it is obvious that this novel could have been set in any system that denied individual freedom. Rand chose to write about Soviet Russia because it was what she knew. Similar stories could have come out of Fascist Italy or Nazi Germany. Rand chose Russia.This is a story of what happens to people when all freedom is lost. It is a marvelous tale of people who struggle valiantly against insurmountable odds to maintain their individuality, dignity and freedom. It is a moral allegory of just what happens to the human spirit when the individual is subjugated to the mind-numbing and degrading indignities imposed from above by second-handers who created nothing but only denied everything.This is one of the finest novels of its type that you will ever read. It is worth reading, especially if the reader has already read THE FOUNTAINHEAD and ATLAS SHRUGGED if for no other reason than to discover Rand's starting point. If you have not read any of Rand's other works then, this is a great place to start. WTL is where she began to formulate her ideas on the ultimate value of the individual and the worth of the reasoning human intellect.To be sure, this is an indictment on the danger to mankind everywhere on the depredations of any collective system. This is an unapologetic damnation of Communism as it was then and what it eventually became. Rand has no mercy and shows no compassion or willingness to understand why men and women would give up themselves to be part of a system that denies basic rights and degrades the individual.Read this book and you will come to understand why Communism was ultimately destined to fail. It failed because it collapsed under the weight of its own inherent internal contradictions. We are all the more fortunate that Rand saw all of this so clearly early on. We are even more fortunate that her predictions for the ultimate demise of Communist tyranny came true and that individual ploitical and economic freedom have taken root throughout countries that once denied even the slightest scintilla of personal liberty.Read WE THE LIVING and discover one of the most original minds in the 20th Century."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I was not surprised at all to find reviews that only attacked Ayn Rand's vivid account on Soviet Russia. As a 14 year old, I read The Fountainhead and taking into consideration the disgust of society on Gail Wynand makes me perfectly understand why I could only find bad reviews on We the Living. I similarly noticed that reviewers did not enjoy the novel because it was &quot;too depressing.&quot; Well I would believe that Soviet Russia in the early 20th century was not exactly roses and sunshine. We the Living was one of the most realistic novels I have ever read. This was actually my very first introduction to Ayn Rand and made me admire Ayn Rand as my favorite author. The vivid descriptions of how communism destroyed Russia were amazingly intense, and her portrayal of the protagonists and antagonists elevated this level of intensity and intrigue.Many people despise Andrei for being a communist, Kira for devoting her life to an empty man, and Leo for being that empty man. I am almost positively sure that Ayn Rand already had all this in mind for her readers. Such conclusions on these characters are superficial. Andrei is labeled as a communist, but the reader must grasp the value behind this label. He is an individualist at heart, and commits suicide because he realized the waste of his life as a supporter of communism. Kira is a bold young woman pillared by ambition. What makes her a heroic character is that she never sacrifices her morals or values for her surrounding etiquette that plagued man. Leo is the complexity of the novel because he leads readers to despise both Andrei and Kira, but in the name of individualism, Andrei and Kira must be recognized as individuals and not because of an empty man.I have never cried at any movie or any book before We the Living. The intellectual intensity collapsed at the end, and I could not help myself from sobbing because of my deep appreciation for Kira's character.I challenge every person who detests We the Living to read it once more and think deeper of the wider meaning of this powerful message to man."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I found this to be an interesting read and a good plot, however, I didn't think any of the main characters were admirable at all. Not that likable main characters are essential to a book/plot, but I am surprised by the other reviewers who really admire Kira and others who find that Andrei is the only &quot;real man&quot; in the book; a man who never betrays his values. First, on the Andrei front, while he does display the most virtue regarding his loyalty and stoicism, let's not forget that his loyalty led him to gun down peasants and farmers whom the communists felt were &quot;cheating&quot; them out of their share of crops. While the reader only sees Taganov when he's being an upstanding, passionate man who has strength of character and loves Kira honestly, Andrei's monologues allow us a glimpse into what he does on the job with the GPU. He seems comfortable with the killing and torture that made the USSR such a fun place to live under the communists.Regarding Kira, her determination to live as an individual is admirable, however, her devotion to the empty Leo seems out of character. It's as though she's really only attracted to him physically. That makes her interesting, but not someone to model your life after, as so many other readers seem to suggest.I thought the description of life in Soviet Russia was particulary well done. It's hard to believe that people (communists) actually talked like that, but Rand grew up in this period and has indicated that this aspect is accurate.This is an excellent story, but it's thoroughly depressing."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"That so many people find this their favorite of Ayn Rand's work is not surprising; of all of her novels, this is the most straightforward. The narrative carries the story forward, rather than the philosophy, and a great narrative it is. Rand manages to encompass almost all of the dreariness and paranoia of Stalinist Russia by following the lives of three young people involved in a love triangle of sorts. We the Living explains why Rand took such &quot;harsh&quot; stances in favor of capitalism - she lived the alternative, and found it repugnant in the extreme. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"One thing always there but often not noticed in Ayn Rand's other works is an amazing sense of the environment. One really feels like one is living in the worlds Rand creates. This is particularly noticeable in this book, and it gives the reader a great awareness of what it is like to live under communism. Not only are the results of communism evident, but so are clear links to the cause (the absence of human rights). On top of all this, We the Living has great characters whom we get to observe as they change (or not, in Kira's case) under the brutal regime."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I have read virtually all of Rand's works; studied them, in fact and written reviews on most of them (favorably, always). But this book, We The Living, by Ayn Rand, I suggest reading AFTER you have read one of her popular (very popular) fictional works such as Atlas Shrugged or The Fountainhead. My reason for this suggestion of time-ordering your selection of reading is this: Please read all of the reviews in this section and take them as fact (believe them, quite literally), then consider how different this work has been described as compared to Rand's popular fiction and also the fact that &quot;We the Living&quot; was rand's first attempt at making it big (in the sense of getting her message across, which she acomplished Quite well). You will see that she changed her format: We the living was described by Rand &quot;as being the closest she had come to an auto biography.&quot;This is the most powerful, moving book that you will experience (period). If you know of another which forms an exception to my statement, please email me. But,THIS, her early life, in Soviet Communist Russia, a hellish (to say the least) existence is what motivated Rand to speak out, to write about philosophy... When you read The Fountainhead, you will have fun, no doubt, and that is why it sold... but we the living is for Lover's of existence, un-coerced existence, which brings me to my final point on this book:NOBODY can disagree with this book; note that no no one has, in the reviews above. In itself, the omission of negative reviews is amazing. If you read this book and are passionately moved (motivated) by it, then then you owe it to yourself to OBJECTIVELY (with an &quot;open/active-mind,&quot; ) pick up and study another of Rand's non-fictional works such as &quot;the Virtue of Selfishness,&quot; or &quot;Capitalism the Unknown Ideal,&quot; or &quot;The New Left: the Return of the Primitive&quot;. Don't get me wrong: There are plenty of people who will disagree, on first reading her non-fiction (possibly her fiction too), but there are essentially NONE who disagree, upon reading &quot;We the Living,&quot;. My point is: They are ALL the same! Only presented in different formats.You won't find anyone, today, who will even attempt to tell you that communist or socialist systems are better than capitalism. 1989, in Russia, was a clear demonstration, and stands as a refutation to any such suggestion. Rand was and is correct. Read her work. This one will bring tears to your eyes, enlightenment to your soul AND will, once and for all... if you have the discipline to think about it long enough, concretize (to use Rand's terminology) exactly why tax-and-spend-big-government is a threat to the best within us: INDIVIDUALITY. A quote from Rand &quot;thinking is not a collective activity.&quot; Think about it, PLease."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Sometimes the living end up dead, killed by systems that refuse to allow independent thought or life. In a land inspired by the words \\"Give me Liberty or Give me Death\\" we might think Rand's story only pertains to the communist Soviet Union. Howevever, 'We the Living' is for anyone in any time or place who wants to transform their lives from existence to life or, as the Greek philosopher's would say, from bios to zoe.I hate the ending, not in the literary sense but because I revolt against the idea that a choice to live should bring anything other than its own rewards. Yet this was reality in the Soviet system. The concept of individual destiny was anathema to communist control. Proponents of independant thinking were treated as dangerous terrorists.We fail to grasp Rand's message if we believe the moral of the story is unnecessary after the fall of the Soviet Union or only applies in countries such as Rwanda, Somalia and North Korea. Rand deftly demonstates throughout the book that we who choose to live in the way she describes will face opposition; from our families or friends, from organized religions which teach that such personal freedom can only be found through the tenets of their faith, and from government systems which consistently push for more control of every thread weaving through our culture.Who are the real identity thieves of our time? Someone stealing our credit card and social security number which lowers our FICA score? Or is it just as dangerous if we are not allowed our own lives so that mass merchandising, global consumerism and partisan politics can prevail? I challenge you to read this book and join the living no matter what the cost."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I'm saddened to see the relevance of this book about communism, and the path our wonderful country is on today, being steered toward socialism. The collectivism, indoctrination, lies, corruption, and propaganda can easily be seen in our government today, as it was in Russia during the time of this book which was the 1920's. All who believe in our Constitution, and way of life, should read and heed before it is to late. Wake-up America."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"First, above all else, do not read Leonard Peikoff's introduction. It spoils every major event in the plot before you've read the first chapter. I have never in my life read a forward that did this... the publisher on this book really needs to track down this Peikoff guy and slap him around. You just do NOT do that in a forward!As to the book itself, I was not impressed. I liked Ayn Rand's two major novels. In those, she's very good at keeping the plot going, and keeping it interesting, now matter how big things get. And of course, Rand is very philosophical, and is always making points that, whether you like them are not, are at least food for thought. Reading her two major novels is far from boring.I've said all that, because chances are anyone interested in this book has read Rand's major works already, and knows where I'm coming from. I found this book very disappointing. And I was prepared for some disappointment anyway; I knew this novel was going to be shorter, simpler, and not as polished. I didn't know it would be so plain. I just can't think of anything special, or interesting, in it at all. It's just another love story, with the misery of Soviet Russia as a backdrop."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Although the brevity of this work may make it appear attractive to someone looking for an introduction to Ayn Rand, I would save this book only for readers who can't get enough of Rand's fiction. I would recommend Atlas Shrugged or The Fountainhead or even Rand's nonfiction before this work; personally I think The Anti-Industrial Revolution would be the best introduction to her nonfiction.The book was not without its merits, however. This book was interesting in that it seemed to me to be the least preachy of Rand's fiction. It also had characters who were far more complex than usual for Rand. This work contained capitalists to be hated and communists to be admired, forcing Rand into relying on ideals of characters instead of personalities to get her views across. Rand claimed this book to be as close to an autobiography as she ever would write."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Even though we almost never hear about this book because it is dwarfed by the popularity of Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, I think this book is great reading in its own right. In fact, I might even suggest that readers who are curious about Ayn Rand start off with this book because it is not so long and daunting as FH and AS, yet it is still \\"totally Rand\\". She has a penchant for creating absolutist characters, many of them who go through some type of meaningful transformation for better or for worse, and she creates the perfection of characters that she wants man to be or become. Whether or not you agree with her politics (I actually don't), one can still enjoy and appreciate the points Rand is trying to make. She never just writes to tell a story - she writes to make a statement - yet she still manages to weave a great story .....and that is the beauty of Rand. Hope you read this book - and please don't neglect the afterward which I found fascinating."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"To those who say Rand's ideologies weren't developed when she wrote this book, and that you have to read The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged to really understand Objectivism...well, you guys are really mistaken.\\"Kira had never been in love. The only hero she had known was a Viking whose story she had read as a child; a Viking whose eyes never looked farther than the point of his sword, but there was no boundary for the point of his sword; a Viking who walked through life, breaking barriers and reaping victories, who walked through ruins while the sun made a crown over his head, but he walked, light and straight, without noticing it's weight; a Viking who laughed at kings, who laughed at priests, who looked at heaven only when he bent for a drink over a mountain brook and there, over-shadowing the sky, he saw his own picture; a Viking who lived but for the joy and the wonder and the glory of the god that was himself.. through the years that followed, Kira remembered the end of the legend: when the Viking stood on a tower over a city he had conquered. The Viking smiled as men smile when they look up at heaven; but he was looking down. His right arm was one straight line with his lowered sword; his left arm, straight as the sword, raised a goblet of wine to the sky. The first rays of a coming sun, still unseen to the earth, struck the crystal goblet. It sparkled like a white torch. Its rays lighted the faces of those below. 'To life,' said the Viking, 'which is a reason unto itself.'\\"Many people get caught up in the politics of Rand's philosophy, but the message is clear: Every man should strive to become the best possible person he can be. Men shouldn't allow themselves to be forced to sacrifice their happiness, or to live empty lives. Rand's philosophy is clear: do what you love, and do it well. Make yourself better each day, enjoy yourself, and live your life to the fullest."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Ayn Rand is a controversial author, whose Objectivist philosophy has ardent followers and a significant number of haters. This book is not a push for Objectivism. It does not denounce religion. It does not glorify an industrialist or a banker. It simply shows that all that most of us want is to just live our lives, enjoy them, and not have the will of majorities, minorities, ideologies, religions, dogmas, individuals, established truths, scientific agreements or any other BS forced upon us.\\"I don't want to fight for the people, I don't want to fight against the people, I don't want to hear of the people. I want to be left alone--to live.\\" says Kira Argounova, the heroine of the book. Kira's character is based loosely on Ayn Rand herself. Ayn (Alisa Rosenbaum) came of age in Soviet Union during Bolshevik revolution. While the world proclaimed the greatness of Soviets and how all the people are free and equal, Ayn was forced to experience the freedom and equality of communism, and escaped to US as soon as possible. Millions were not so lucky. This book is a tribute to those millions, to people who braved cold Russian winters and armed guards to escape in snow storms, across mountain paths, through rivers out of the Worker's Paradise.Read this book if you want to know what life is under communism. Read it to learn about Russia of 1920's. Read it to see what human spirit is capable of.Some will draw parallels between today's political climate in US and Soviet Russia. We should not look for them even if they are easy to spot: whether it's public worker's unions in Wisconsin or crony capitalism of \\"stimulus\\\\bail-out\\". Much more relevant is to listen to ideologues of 1917 and of today.They sound the same. The method of communication may have changed (tweeter and facebook rather than speeches from atop of a tank), but the message is the same as it has been for ages: \\"Equality\\". Yet it is today same as it was always - Equality comes at a price.Andrei Taganov starts out as a villain in \\"We The Living\\". He ends his life as a villain who saw the error of his way, committing suicide to help the woman he loves and unable to deal with the hell he helped create.Andrei wanted to bring everyone up to his level, make everyone equal. He killed for that idea. And he found that you can't bring people up. You can only achieve equality down in the mud, by removing the best and brightest among us.We the Living is very different from Atlas Shrugged and Fountainhead. It's a book that can hold it's own. I've read it many times and I still feel with the characters, experience their emotions. Read it so that ideologues shouting for Equality can never again create the hell that was worker's paradise."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"We the Living is one of the most engaging books that I have ever read.Set in Soviet Russia, it is a story about those who want to live in a society that forbids living. We the Living is a story of romance, struggle, and most of all, of the sanctity of life.The main characters are admirable and heroic. We the Living is a beautifully developed story, with every word and dialogue advancing the plot and character development. Each character serves a very distinct purpose, and represents a very distinct idea.This story also serves as a cautionary tale. As the author has stated, it is not a story merely against the evils of Soviet Russia. More broadly, it warns against the evils of totalitarianism and exposes the ideas that make it possible.This novel can be enjoyed by itself; the writing is enjoyable, and the plot and characters are engaging and fascinating. However, if one wishes to think, there are philosophical implications in every character and every scene. This book is for anyone who understands the importance of human life."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"The first Ayn Rand book I read was \\"We the Living\\", approximately 40 years ago. I then read many of her books, she remains my favorite author. I recently recommended my son read her book. He was confused by all the different last names, so I picked it up again. I was amazed at how I had actually forgotten about much of the plot of the book. I could not put it down. This was her first novel. Her husband and close friends advised her to write about her experience in Russia. This book was written in the early 1930's and finally published approximately 6 years later. There had been no first hand knowledge of the difficult life under the new United Socialists of Soviet Union. The living conditions for anyone other than the Party elites was very difficult. Reading about the living conditions, lack of food and corruption within the Red Party was most interesting. She actually wrote the book with her intent to awake Americans to the horrors and warnings of a Socialist America. What was most astounding was theloss of hope by citizens living under the communist rule. The Party members lived liked Kings, however, everyone else starved, many in the streets. If you appreciate \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" and \\"The Fountainhead\\", read \\"We the Living\\". You will be alarmed by the parallels to the changes that have occurred within our Republic. I could not put the book down, the ending was gripping and eye opening as to the end result of the Collectivism. You will appreciate the forward looking vision of Ayn Rand and be alarmed by the conclusion!"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This is an important read because it provides a story that goes untold in our society becuase so many of the intelligentsia are sympathetic to communism.The tragedy of the the communist revolutions and the 100 million murdered in them is a story largely untold. The movie \\"The Killing Fields\\" does deal with the communist genocide in Cambodia, but generally the subject is unloved by western intellectuals. For that reason this book is a must for anyone who wants to get a glimpse of the most glossed over story in history...the tragedy of the communist revolutions."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Ayn Rand is an excellent writer. But I didn't need this book to prove it to me since The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged have already made that obvious. It did take this book, though, to open my eyes to what living in 1920s Communist Russia was really like...and let me tell you, it was not walk in the park. Ayn Rand is one of those writers who will have so much an effect on you after you have read just a chapter of her book that you will begin to think in the way that she writes. You'll see. She makes you so much a part of the story that you are a poor Russian girl trying to find something worth holding onto...worth living for...in a world where everything is fleeting and nothing seems to matter. I highly recommend this novel to anyone interested in Communist Russia and/or anyone who wants to read a good romance that isn't the stereotypical cookie-cutter type. This is an overlooked gem. It is just as good, if not better than the works Ayn Rand is best known for."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Describing what life was really like in the early days of Soviet Russia, this little novel speaks with a powerful voice against the tyrrany of collectivism. Ayn Rand demonstrates in this work her remarkable gift for rational philosophy and skillful storytelling. Many lines in the novel have passed repeatedly through my mind since reading them, and many characters and scenes live in my memory. Everyone should read this compelling story of the struggle for human freedom."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":". . . it still shows the keen intellect behind her writing. The character development seen in Atlas Shrugged and Fountainhead is there as well. Yet the book doesn't quite move as well as her later novels. Nevertheless, ten times better than the typical novel. Ayn Rand makes a searing indictment of communism, a system she grew up with and knew only too well."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"If you want to know what life was like in communist Russia in the 20's, this is a great read. If you're interested learning why communism failed and why America is headed in a terrifying direction today, read this.If you're interested in Rand's philosophy on capitalism and a better story line, try Atlas Shrugged instead. Personally, I would skip this for either Atlas Shrugged or The Fountainhead."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"\\"We the Living\\" is an autobiographical historic novel of Ayn Rand's life in the Soviet Union during her youth from age 12 to 21, when she was able to escape to America.Every American should read this book in order to understand what the Soviet Union was all about and what totalitarian governments do to people. It is an extraordinarily cautionary tale, which is essentially a true story in essence.Of all Ayn Rand's writings, this is the one which appears to me to have the greatest literary value - and this is the one subject that Ayn Rand actually knew and lived first hand.This book gives readers great insight in why anti-communism swept the world, and why fascists, Mussolini, Hitler and Japan's Tojo was able to use anti-communism, the legitimate fear of communism, to grasp control in their own countries, and to almost rule the world.In fact for American to really understand anti-communism in America, and to understand WWII and the 20th century, they need to read \\"We The Living\\", a true horror story of idealistic communism in Russia.It should be used extensively in our public schools to teach civics, history, current events, and English literature.Sadly, this book is not nearly as widely read as it needs to be."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"In this book, Ayn Rand provides the reader with the expereince at looking at how important each individual human life is, how it is detstroyed under communism (or any dictatorship), and how man needs freedom in order to live. She should know. She was born and lived in Russia under communism, until she moved permanently to America at the age of 21. Thank you Ayn Rand for having the courage to leave the hellhole you grew up in, which only got worse later, and for coming to America and writing novels like this one, to warn people of the evils of totalitarianism. You will NEVER be forgotten."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I read WE THE LIVING some time ago after reading several works by Ayn Rand. I tried to re-read it again, and just couldn't do it. Rand's characters are typically very strong and draw you into the story. Many times, Rand uses extreme settings which are typically unrealistic requiring the reader to image a world outside of anything they have seen. This book, however, is more autobiographical depicting Rand's personal experience fictionalized thru Kira's tale of a young woman's desire to escape her communist world.This book, I found to be a difficult read. Not only because of the tragedies, sad state of suffering under communism, or broken hearts, but simply because it just doesn't compare to Rand's other novels (ATLAS SHRUGGED is my favorite). Rand's other novels are easy reads (even though they are lengthier) with developing characters that pull you into the story. She incorporates different views of philosophy, society and more in each of the characters she establishes. Her characters typically either stay the same or change as a result of a realization of who they are. But that is not the case in this book.Andrei, is introduced as the seemingly heartless communist but then evolves into a character the reader sympathizes with through several events in the story. Kira and Leo begin as realistic characters and, contrary to Rand's other character developments, they become cold-hearted resulting in a loss of sympathy from the reader. Kira's behavior creates a mixture of emotions from the reader. Sometimes you want to help her, and sometimes you just want to close the book especially when she destroys the true hero of the novel - yet, the reader is expected to understand that all is simply in search of freedom. Although the ending is a bit disappointing, it is appropriate considering the story Rand is attempting to tell. Any other ending would have conflicted with other areas of the novel and what Kira represents.Personally, this book is nowhere near as strong as ATLAS SHRUGGED or THE FOUNTAINHEAD but some may find it to be a good read."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I picked up a musty old copy from the 1959 recently..being in a glow about Atlas. This book moved me beyond belief with the struggles and harsh realities presented. I probably am one of the few Rand readers that like her clumsy style but in this story, her words flowed well and the American reader did not get all mixed up with long names and places that we could not reference. To quote Ayn: &quot;..is not a novel about Soviet Russia. It is a novel about Man against the State. Its basic theme is the sanctity of human life...&quot; To those who associate Ayn with the defenders of big companies and nazism...remember her semi autobiographical outlet in Kira. People that were Ayn's protagonists were those with life premises, to live and exist for themselves. Be it Dagny or Andrei, Ayn Rand's message was true and bittersweet."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"You don't have to buy into the Objectivist philosophy to enjoy this novel. I certainly don't. But I marval at Rand the dramatist. The woman knew how to write good books. However, if you identify yourself as a socialist/collectivist/liberal democrat, you probably will find much here at which to take offense."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This is a must read. Especially with the current political battles going on, the dangers of communism and socialism to the human spirit are explicitly laid out in this virtual autobiography. (The author uses real life experience to form the story.) Even her preface warns Americans not to slip into the \\"comforts\\" of a state-run police, government, etc... I think the 75th Anniversary is out too, either one a brilliant read, but the Preface AND Forward are enlightening in this version too. Also, even though it is a political thriller/ drama, there's plenty of romance and feeling to engage anyone with a soul really. The main character, Kira, is a character of such depth and quality... Wow."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"The theme of this novel is the individual against the state or, more specifically, how the totalitarian government of Russia in the few years following the 1917 Communist revolution destroys a girl, Kira, the man she loves who also loves her, Leo, and a man who loves her who she does not love, Andrei. It is also the story of the conflict between quite a few people, especially these three. A significant event is when Kira agrees to sleep with Andrei and have a lasting relationship with him in order to save Leo's life. Andrei knows nothing about Leo's problems and is convinced that Kira loves him. Kira continues to live with Leo who also knows nothing about her relationship with Andrei.What mars this otherwise well-written and engrossing novel is Ayn Rand's attempt to portray her characters as the embodiment of her philosophy. Despite her attempt, the characters do not reflect Rand's idea of \\"rational self interest.\\" Kira is portrayed at the outset of the novel as self-assured and totally independent, interested only in becoming an engineer. However, as soon as she meets Leo, she falls head over heels in love with him and obeys his every command as a slave. True, the revolution destroys her. But, so, too, does love. Leo, the man she loves, also starts life with Kira self assured and interested in his goals, but he, unlike Kira, never loses these Ayn Rand attributes. However, although he clearly loves Kira, he treats her badly because of his self-interest. The word \\"ordered\\" is associated with him frequently. His \\"rational self interest\\" destroys the caring that love demands of one who loves. Only, Andrei, who Rand calls \\"the villain\\" in her The Art of Fiction, acts with reasonable \\"rational self interest.\\" He is also interested in his own development. However, he treats Kira with sensitivity."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Of course it's Russian. Of course it would be a train wreck of tragedies. I knew that going in. Still, the story and characters are so compelling that I hoped until the very last page it would throw on a cheesy American happy ending. But that it didn't speaks more highly of the author than me. Bravo!"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I don't love this book because of the author, or because I agree with its conjectural premises, but because it gave me an incredibly insightful view into why Rand hated socialism. It contains everything you need to know if you have ever wondered how the hell altruism and compassion could possibly be construed as an evil endeavor.The Kindle transcript and page layout was great, which isn't always the case on the original Kindle."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This book will leave an everlasting impression upon you. Amazingly, this was Ayn Rand's first book and is much overlooked, being dwarfed by her supposed masterpieces Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead. Amazingly, she had a lot of trouble publishing this book in 1936 with the original title being Airtight indicating in post revolution Soviet Russia it was nearly impossible to survive. A librarian had warned her that there were a lot of people who sympathized with communist ideals in America as you will find explained in the Afterward by Leonard Peikoff, the founder of the Ayn Rand Institute, also described as the philosophical heir of Ayn Rand on the back cover. She wrote this as a warning to prevent a socialist America.The communist ideals are attractive. Everyone is supposedly upon the same level. People live, share, contribute to society. But in reality, having this unfeeling, godless, concrete being, representing the state, to answer to results in the emergence of another class of people that have to impose their ideals upon others to ensure the survival of this entity which is not classless at all.The protagonist Irina sleeps underneath a picture of a towering engineering wonder of a skyscraper and dreams of going to engineering school. She's fiercely independent and incredibly cerebral and not surprisingly butts head with the reigning authorities. If you don't belong to the communist party, good luck. You'll stand in long lines for flour and oil for which you'll have to live on months on end. You'll have to spout the party line to avoid the inevitable frequent purges to purify the party of unseemly elements. The black market quickly emerges in such an atmosphere as well as black mail. The title of this review comes from a conversation in the book from a disgruntled citizen asking the philosophical question what did we create and argues that we started trying to build a temple but didn't even end with an outhouse. Comrade citizens were merely little puny things that wiggle, mindless, spineless beings that had to sway in the hurricane force winds in order to survive.If this is not her finest work, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged must be beyond phenomenal."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This novel has by far been one of my favorites. I have read all of Ayn's fiction novels, I dont care so much for her philosophical books. But I truly love the way she is able to tell a story, detailed, and fully in depth depiction of soviet Russia and the hard times that the people went through. I could not put this book down until I had finished it, and now having long since lent my copy to a friend to never see it again, I am purchasing the kindle edition because I feel the need to re-read this wonderful piece of literature. And would like to share it with my family. I highly recommend this book to anyone that even remotely enjoyed \\"The Fountainhead\\" Or any of Ayns others works."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"As reading enjoyment goes, We the Living is Ayn Rand at her best. This is semi-autobiographical fiction recounting the earliest days of the Soviet Union. This story is more heartfelt, less preachy (okay, a little bit preachy), and more personal than The Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged. Those later works were really more like platforms for Rand to develop and espouse her philosophy of Objectivism, so the plot and characters were subservient to those aims. She has a tendency to turn her characters into flat icons representing various elements of society, but not so much in We the Living, where the characters feel more real- like they might be people Ayn knew who endured the rise of Bolshevism and all its attendant grotesque injustices."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Everyone is affected by political culture. Every level of regulation, from anarchy to fascist dictatorships, is comparatively some amount of government. Ayn Rand shows the dismal struggles surrounding Kira Argounov in her communist environment. Through maginificent language, _We the Living_ forces empathy for starving masses; in a way that no news article can. As the book progresses, an awareness is awakened that every aspect of each person's life is painful, yet each person fights to keep on living. Ayn Rand presents a dieing city, and develops human characters who force themselves to live through it. Although, what these characters go through on a daily basis is not quite the same as living. Their USSR regulates the distribution of food, clothing, and shelter; a corrupt hierarchy with ambiguous goals and morals regulates every physical human necessity. The suffering is deadly, but the struggles for life are sifting through the propaganda and government denials, staking out some form of existence.Ayn Rand analyzes a multitude of varied relationships, between deluges of personalities. Throughout the story, people grow and change as they try with all human strength to adapt to their new world. This novel is about character development in an environment created by Soviet mismanagement. It shows how people cope with the stresses of staying alive, when that in itself becomes the primary concern. Things taken for granted by the rest of the world are denied to a population of millions. A home, a job, and even one's own free time are all the concerns of an ever present government. Human nature is captured in the interactions of characters, and sometimes it can be a terrible thing. Power struggles created by the voids left by a revolution have to be settled, and some people will go to far to fill those voids. This is a fast read about politics and humanity that will leaves questions about all governments, and if this could ever happen again."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This book is a genuine portrayal of humanity and is beautifully written. I was worried at certain points that real humanity would be betrayed by the reaction of a character, but it never was.I have an idea in my imagination of what it might mean to the human character to live in times like these and the novel followed this --but, even when the story took an unexpected turn, it still made sense that a character could react in the way he/she did to the situation at hand.Although this review is quite vague, the basic idea is give this novel a whole-hearted chance - it is a fascinating backdrop of an historic, traditional Russia shattered by political idealism taken to the extreme and an amazingly realistic and addictive character study in reaction to it."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This was the first Ayn Rand book that I ever read. She is a brilliant author, writing beautiful poetic prose (clever similes) at times and always getting her message across with vigor.I subtract one star for a muddled plot. The middle of the book feels like a series of meaningless short stories with no bearing on what turns out to be the climax. The conflict does not rise steadily, which causes the reader's interest to sway. This is particularly surprising since Rand is a self-proclaim \\"Romanticist.\\" The Romantic school focuses heavily on classic plot formation (Introduction, Rising Action, Climax, Falling Action, Conclusion) and rejects the Post-modernist fragmentation of story. (Catch-22 by Joseph Heller is a good example.)That being said, the book is otherwise outstanding. Rand had first-hand experience with the evils of communism growing up in Russia, and the medium of fiction serves as a brilliant means to explain what she saw. The incredibly enormous bueracracy (sp?) of the U.S.S.R. is fascinating to look at. The governmental intrusion into every tiny aspect of human life is horrifying.As I said above, the prose is very good. Perhaps what's so surprising about this is that this is Rand's first book! I am amazed at how mature the narrative style is and how well the political criticism is developed. Albeit, the full philosophy of Objectivism is absent, but it does not detract from the force of the message.I highly recommend this book, especially for those who are curious about what life was REALLY like under the Leninist autocracy. In our age, Lenin seems to be getting a reputation for being \\"the good one\\" and Stalin as \\"the bad one.\\" The truth is that they were both evil and they both killed enormous unknown amounts of innocent people, and tortured incredibly high numbers of others.I am sure I will go on to read The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Some people seem to come away a little disappointed from this novel. I would guess that this is because this is one of Rand's lesser known works. The people who read this seem to have already made an acquaintance of Rand through The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. Expecting the same tenor of philosophical writing, they are disappointed that this book contains little more than the emotional core of individualism. There is hardly any concrete philosophy, beyond a depiction of collectivism as it really is, in this book.In truth, this book is Rand's best writing. We the Living is a true-to-life depiction of life under totalitarian rule. It's not philosophical. It's not journalistic writing - it applies to life under totalitarianism anywhere. We the Living shows the essential battle between the individual and the collective.We the Living has a certain raw, emotional quality (which may be due to the fact that much of it is drawn directly from the author's experience. The closing scene of this novel has a depth of feeling rarely found in any literature.I would recommend this as the first Rand novel one should read, followed by The Fountainhead. I would particularly recommend these two books to teenagers, as there is a great deal in both that resonates with the spirit of youth. Atlas Shrugged is a more philosophical novel, which is still important, even essential reading, but only after We the Living and The Fountainhead."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This is another incredible book by Ayn Rand. Every character is well thought out and the setting follows well with the history of the times. I have read her book Anthem and was very impressed and thought I'd try this out as well and I'm glad I did. I hate to read but this is a book I could read over and over. Each character has some agaonizing trouble but Kira is a ray of hope for each of them. Read this book..."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This novel is written at a very different age of fictional writing... in a tumultuous timeframe. Remember the fear and intensity of the climate as you turn the pages. Star Wars, Cuba, Berlin...This is a freshman work on her themes that later evolve into a political party and almost cult. In her later works, she can be accused of belaboring points ad nausea... (John Gault's speech). This work seemed lighter to me. Yet, still thought provoking.But if you return to the story itself... there is symbolism weaving its way throughout. Reform, incentives, human nature, corruption, education...The fundamental flaws of communism and socialism are brought to life...MOVING, GRIPPING...Her later works touch on a free market economy and the joys of capitalism."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"For somebody who came from Russia this book is a vivid reminder of the horror, that people like Kira experienced after revolution. Is the book about love? Yes, of course. Is it about human spirit and ego? You bet. Does it show us that love may be blind? Unfortunately. But in addition to all that, it is a testimony against the kingdom of ignorance. They the living were turned into the mass of toilers. They still remember days when they were humans, and now one by one they surrender to the power of pigs. From the very first page you feel that it is not just fiction, but almost a documentary. May be that is why it is the best book by Rand. It was the story that she lived."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I first saw this book in bookstores when I was in junior college, not more than 16 years old. I looked at its last page (as was my habit) and decided I could not digest the book.But the book persisted. It was there in bookstores even when I became 30 years old and I said there must be something to it. I have to read it. And so I read.I read it after a tiring journey in which I had not slept for 36 hours and it was so interesting I forgot my tiredness and read it with the customary tears that I shed every time I read a touching Readers Digest story. It must be in my nature to cry.The plot is clearly absorbing and not an ideal one . As close to reality as mundane life, with its crushed expectations gets to be. But I do not know why Kira is the heroine in the story. It should have been Andrei - the only man who is a man in the entire story. The only man who never betrays his values, the only man with a heart and decency. What does Kira see in Leo? Is Rand trying to portray that women can have no sense of seeing things for what they are? Is Rand saying that women need to doll up and let men love their bodies and not their souls?True love may be rare, but it better be well deserved! Love may be a religion but it should have a sense of values which allow it to be given to the deserving person. The lover Kira and love itself become some slavish fetter which is loved as a drug addict may love his drug. If this is love and if imagination of love is greater than achieving it in reality as the last passages show then it is a monumental acceptance of the fact that humans are capable of fooling themselves. Kira may have been a good soldier but she did not see the direction she was headed in. That is not anytime the mark of a good soldier at all. Real love should be one which improves one's values and not one which destroys them. Kira did not know the preciousness of love - the immunity it gives to any true love - though Rand imagines and shows that Kira achieves just that! It is the only novel by her I read, so I cannot comment more on this."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I read Anthem in High School, Atlas Shrugged recently and today I just finished We the Living. I consider myself an Ayn Rand fan tho I'm no cult follower. I love her views on individualism and capitalism tho we part ways when it comes to belief in God. As a Christian and a capitalist I appreciate the rights of the individual and I think most Christians can agree with her on that. She feels that sacrificing herself for a deity is foolish where I feel that you sacrificing for others can be an end in itself and further one's own life positively. I don't believe that I should sacrifice for another at the point of a gun, i.e. the government telling me that my money really belongs to someone else and I think Christians and objectivists can agree on that point.So for Christians out there, I think you can take away from this book ideas that are beneficial without endorsing her anti-God beliefs. Also I think the story is fantastic and easier to get through than say Atlas Shrugged. I highly recommend both books by the way.

Not recommended."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This book might reward a long attention span but dull is really all I can say about it. The writing is typically cryptic, leaving it up to the reader to fill in the blanks, but generic banal detail fills up most of the space on the pages.The characters lifestyles are inactive, the environment never changes, and the relationships between the characters never get very complex although the relative lack of detail about the characters natures and motives always seems to want to keep you guessing. With every character in the book I was consistently thinking maybe there's more to them but there never was. Edited down to a quarter of it's length this book could have been a more engaging narrative and still maintained the value in it's depictions of everyday living in oppressive USSR society, but even then Kira's tragic romances, which were romantic for about ten seconds before they lost their lustre, would still seem pointless."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This book does not compare with 1) Atlas Shrugged, or 2) The Fountainhead.

I got sick of the stupid relationship. I guess I got about 1/4th the way through. Maybe my tastes are changing."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"First things first. Totalitarian governments are very bad. Soviet Russia was among the worst. Anyone with any doubt of this proposition should take the time to peruse Harvest of Sorrow by Robert Conquest.That said, this book, while adding something to our understanding of the evils experienced by those suffering under Soviet Russia's domination, is quite bad and, in my opinion, not worth the time and excruciating effort to read.Kira Argounova and her family return to St. Petersburg following the Soviet Revolution. Conditions are, as one might expect, quite poor. Kira finds her ambitions checked. There is a symbolic love triangle. Simply stated, this book is a historical romance with pretensions to literary fiction. The underlying message of the story, however, is no deeper or more convincing than one would expect from a Nicholas Sparks novel.Laying aside, though, the merits of the \\"We the Living\\" philosophy, my biggest problem with this book is the, quite frankly, poor writing. My four most serious complaints follow.1. This book is overflowing with pointless verbosity - descriptions that, while wordy, convey no meaning. For example: \\"The girl looked straight at him, softly, defiantly. He answered with a glance that was an invitation, and a mocking insult, and almost a promise. Then he turned and walked to the counter, as she went out slowly.\\" The tone of the book is undermined by this absurd wordplay. I found myself, on many occasions, chuckling at Ms. Rand's pretentious languange. The subject matter of the novel is not given much to chuckling.2. Many words and phrases are repeated so often as to make this book seem like a parody. Are there really so many mocking, insolent, arrogant and defiant smiles in Soviet Russia.3. There are a number of scenes in the book that seem absurdly unrealistic. Most striking is the scene in which Kira and Leo meet. Not only do they fall in love seemingly instantaneously in a rather unusual circumstance, but they also engage in dialogue artificial enough to make Mickey Spillane blush.4. Finally, the coup de grace for me was chapter X of part 2, the preposterous meeting between Morozov and Timoshenko. The scene appears to have been lifted nearly intact from a below average episode of Three's Company. Indeed, Ms. Rand's contribution appears to be merely the lengthening of the scene from merely uncomfortably overlong to absolutely intolerable.On the positive side, the book I read featured a cool illustration by artist Nick Gaetano."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Please note that this comment is primarily about Mary Woods' unabridged reading of Ayn Rand's \\"We the Living\\" and not about any of the print editions. People mulling a 27 dollar disbursement on an audio book might be deceived about the quality of their overpriced purchase by the experience of someone who just read the book.Well - We the Randy must, must admit that the arduous amount of tedium Ayn Rand inflicts on her readership is part of her allure; any of her magna opera embark us on an intellectual endurance test of sorts and the flaws of her best and worst, \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" (meaning its first two parts on the one and the third part on the other hand) are fairly balanced by the mere achievement of finishing 1084 pages of very small print without a single joke thrown in to keep you going. In fact, \\"The Fountainhead\\" might merely claim second spot in her body of work for the fact that it is less imperfect and less long than \\"Atlas\\" - this said, \\"We the Living\\" is consistent with her other novels in two major peculiarities of her writing: 1. too long for both the lack of character development and the scope of ground covered (after being introduced as a misfit simply by reason of her desiring to become an engineer, the heroine Kira disappears from her own story and spends the final 400 pages pining for an unsympathetic and undeserving lover and that's what it is); 2. a propensity to delve in speeches no matter on what on mostly the same again and again and even once more in roughly the same terms - and here, this being an early work, the speeches are but 1:1 copied from contemporary soviet propaganda, benumbing reader and protagonists alike, where craftsmanship would have condensed the message and should have provided a criticism rather than a sense of weariness that must mean Communism is bad.Luckily, for a reader trained in Ayn Rand, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn proffers approachable, but more in-depth and literarily accomplished further reading, and you might as well turn to Yevgeny Zamyatin's \\"We\\" for an idea of what \\"We the Living\\" could have been in the hands of a more distinguished writer.However. Mary Woods' audio-rendition does add quite a taxing extra edge of difficulty to the usual challenges of getting through a book by Ayn Rand. Where Christopher Hurt managed to develop a marvelously even, crisp and always laconic matter-of-fact tone of voice perfectly suited to Ayn Rands all-pervading indignation, Mary Woods never seems to find into the story and struggles helplessly with the diction of Russian men - and there are endless discussions among Russian men in this - snarling, growling, huffing and croaking in voices many pitches below what the range of her voice has in stock, almost like children when they imitate the language of adults or tell a ghost story during a sleepover.This is a stupendously amateurish and ill-advised read that soon distracted even from the more enjoyable passages of the novel - in retrospect I think there was not a single moment of proper atmosphere in her almost 20 hours of performance.Maybe this is due to the source material - Mary Woods obviously has a long backlist of children's fables and -classics to her credit and surely the audience for \\"The Wind in The Willows\\" will be perfectly served by some of her vocal antics, but Toad running a black market racket should have been placed as a cameo in \\"the Muppets take Petrograd\\" where it might have had intended chuckles whereas here I just constantly dropped my earphones from shaking my head in disbelief..."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"this book as many have said is one of the worst books to ever be thought up as ayn rand was a terrible philosepher this book is a terrible read"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I'll keep this review short. Although one can be very sympathetic for anyone living under communist rule, it's hard feel anything beyond a very generalized kind of sympathy for Kira. Yes, she's living under an oppressive, totalitarian regime, and so I must acknowledge she has, as anyone would have, every right to be profoundly angry about that. However, Kira herself is in no way, shape, or form an admirable human being.Why do I say this? Because Kira is, quite simply put, selfish, and not much more.Ayn Rand says that she essentially used herself as a basis for Kira. This is not surprising, because Miss Rand herself was no great humanitarian. Yes, Miss Rand was quite correct in her assessment that communism was profoundly oppressive and could never work as a viable economic system. Having said that, perhaps Miss Rand would have done well to read the greatest book focusing on man's relationship with money ever written, this book being \\"A Christmas Carol\\" by Charles Dickens. \\"Who is Jacob Marley?\\" seems to me a much more important question than \\"Who is John Galt?\\". \\"Mankind was my business!\\" said Mr. Marley, even as he was enduring the punishment his own selfishness had bestowed upon him. Perhaps Miss Rand would have done well to pay attention to Mr. Marley's very objective assessment of what his actions and attitudes in life should have been.Ah, but I digress; Kira just wants to get with Leo; and aside from her justifiably deep anger at the bolsheviks (please note that I deliberately decline to capitalize \\"bolsheviks\\"), there just isn't much more to her. That's why it's hard to be much more than very generally sympathetic with her. There just isn't much evidence that she really cared about anything other than what she was and what she wanted. It seems that Miss Rand never realized that glorifiying selfishness above all else does not a heroic character make.Being born under communist rule, Miss Rand does have some first-hand knowledge, so this book might be worth reading in that regard. However, this is no classic, and only those who worship money, and absolutely adore their own ego above all else, would ever think that it is."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"It's hard not to look at this book as little more than a piece of propaganda. It is not that Rand sat down with the intention to write propaganda, but that instead her own opinions have become so overbearing and all-encompassing, that it is as if they constitute a religion for her. And she is so devout a believer of her own 'religion' that her opinions end up reading like propaganda. A good majority of the book is spent bad-mouthing Communism and Socialism. If this were a critical analysis of Communism, I would not mind, as I am open to alternate views. But for Rand, there is no subtlety, to cognition, no grace, but instead, hundreds of pages of &quot;Communism Sucks!&quot; Like most people, she seems to have NO knowledge of Marxist theory. Like the people on this board, she confuses Communism with Socialism, and in so doing, treats them as being the same. Communism is as 'close' to Socialism as Capitalism is close to Socialism. The book is simple unreadable to anyone who has any diversified education in political theory. From a literary standpoint, there are plot holes, strange attempts at characterization, 'insults' at Communism thrown in like commercials at various parts in the book. Skip it."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I agree with Kyle. This book is boring, dull, and uninteresting. This book reads like a history textbook, only with less information. I can't believe that such a book would be allowed to be published. There are two elements of this book: slight hunger and sex. The sex is even dull and uninteresting."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"As a writer, I must give tribute to Rand's colorful turn of phrase, several enrapturing descriptions, and well-drawn characters. However, as a person I must say I hate this book and don't recommend it to anyone.Don't get me wrong -- it's good as a piece of literature if one takes away the grime of a hard time for Russia, which she holds cruelly under a magnifying glass; if one forgets the fact that she is biased, horribly biased against both Tsarism and the Soviet regime; if one ignores what she wrote about Russia and the Russians in the foreword; if one discounts the fact that she hated the place she was writing her &quot;truth&quot; about.Of course, now that I am stating my view someone will say that I am wrong because I'm Russian and thus biased; perhaps you will even think me a communist. Do that if you like. But because I AM Russian, there's something glaringly wrong to me in the fact that escape is seen as the sign of a good and unbroken spirit in this book. In spite of all claims made to support the opposite, an escaping spirit IS broken if it can't face what its home has become.What is one if one has no home country? If one gives it up?Leaving home is like losing one's identity. I'm nothing if I am not Russian.

The characters were typical Rand, cardboard cut outs of humans. The setting in the early post revolutionary Russia is valuable and informative. Rand was a refugee of sorts from this culture and her insights are key to understanding the corrupt and worthless Soviet system. This book will not change the minds of any Clintonite socialist ... It will provide a peak behind the iron curtain for those of us who wondered about the day to day of the Soviet state. In her descriptions of life in the post revolutionary period we see what a farce the planned economies of socialism are. This is not the book that \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" or \\"The Fountainhead\\" was, it is simpler and the theme is less complex.

Well, we now know how accurate a picture she'd drawn for all to see, if they chose to look. Not only a picture of the old Soviet, but as she states in her foreword, \\"This is a story about Dictatorship, any dictatorship, anywhere, at any time...and that this novel might do its share in helping to prevent a socialist America.\\" Sadly, today \\"the Left\\" still spews lies, but that's all they can do, having given up the mantle of reason long ago, and \\"the Right\\" is mired in the death throes of religion.

She presents her philosophy masterfully in rich narration and thoughtful dialog.I found myself bored in the first half of the book. The second half read faster. I did not quickly connect emotionally with the characters; I kept reading because I enjoyed Atlas Shrugged so much.I did learn about life inside the U.S.S.R. and the dirty politics therein.

It's not filled with polemics. Primus Stoves are also mentioned frequently."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I am a huge fan of Atlas Shrugged, and I also enjoyed Fountainhead. As I had heard We The Living was a quasi autobiography of Ayn Rand's life in the Soviet Union, my expectations were very high. However, although the depictions of life under communism and the Soviet Union were extremely important and revealing, the storyline and plot itself were very dull. Maybe that was the point--the banality and dullness of life under communism aside from all the brutality and meanness. Regardless, the story was not interesting and the characters were not interesting; it turned into a bizarre, trashy romance novel. In no way did this book come close to Atlas Shrugged or Fountainhead. Sadly, I gave it up at about half-way. Others may have gotten more out of this book, but I did not. If you want to read Ayn Rand, go with Atlas Shrugged--it is tremendous."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Ayn Rand wrote one good book, her first one, a novel titled We the Living. When it was published in the 1930's it was reviewed favorably as a novel of ideas. And rightly so. Her better known novels, Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, might usefully be described as novels of length, or not novels at all. Long-winded, outrageously polemical diatribes might be a better characterization. Fountainhead is the only novel I've read which romanticizes rape. (I guess it depends on who is doing the raping.) Atlas Shrugged contains an 80-plus page disquisition on the meaning and value of money. When does a novel stop being a novel and become a torturously non-sensical treatise on political economy? (Alan Greenspan's close association with Ayn Rand may account for his mumbling incoherence and the disastrous failure of his policies. Come to think of it, W's last Secretary of Commerce was an Objectivist, as well.)Insofar as th substance of We the Living is concerned, if you've read one of Ayn Rand's novels, you've read them all. This one just happens to be have more subtlety and style. Yes, the novels get longer and more overwhelmingly reactionary as time goes by, but the themes are the same: romantic heroes and heroines determined not to compmromise with a trashy, mediocritizing collectivist system. Unwanted pregnancies and subsequent back-alley abortions for collectivized women, but our heroines commitment to unbridled romantic love magically wards off the need for contraception. (One wonders how Objectivists procreate.) It's better to freeze to death (smililng with joy) in deep drifts of snow, experiencing an exhilirating sense of liberation, than to be reduced to the status of a collectivized robot. Collectivized mediocrity eventually reduces physical and intellectual promise to flabby, dispirited passivity. The monetary price of anything represents its true value. Pragmatism is a curse that eventually leads to unmitigated collectivization. And stylistically, artistic understatement is hypocrisy.Many readers, no doubt, think of Ayn Rand as a libertarian. Even libertatians, however, usually acknowledge that accidents of birth, circumstances of upbringing, and contingencies of the life course make a substantial contribution to how we see the world and what we do. For Ayn Rand, however, all this is just so much collectivist weakness. Her heroes are thoroughly willful and self-determining characters in Twentieth Century Robinsinades. They stand apart, and seemingly have done so since birth, uninfluenced by anything but forces from within. How did those forces get there? Rand doesn't even acknowledge the issue. Perhaps Rand's heroes start off as a super species of feral children.Maybe Ayn Rand sold out. Rather than develop her real gifts as a novelist, she sought a much larger following with ham-handed appeals to the young, the inexperienced, and the romantically reactionary. There's no subtlety or style in the work that followed We the Living and her second novel, Anthem, but Ayn Rand did gain a large following of proponents of her objectivist philosophy. Literary appeal for big-bucks bellicosity. Hardly seems a fair trade."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This is my first Ayn Rand book; I can tell from the other reviews that I may like the others better. The edition I read provided some good notes on Ms. Rand, which helped me understand the book. I am glad that I read this book first, since it is apparently fairly autobiographical, and since it was her first book.

People lived in the exact same conditions, there were secret anti-government societies, and people were forced to believe that the goverment in always right.

If the story itself wasn't interesting enough, the publication history provided in this book (dealing with resistance by socialist elements)shows how real the influence Rand was trying to resist was. A great read, highly recommended."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"The novel is very well written, Details on what happened in Russia. The emotions and ideal thoughts of Kira as you read this book back when the Soviet system was in place makes you very thankful that America was not ruled under communist. It also makes you greatful that you are able to have thoughts and freedom.Reading the end of this book will put you in tears. The books definantly gives you an insight to the wider meaning of man."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I read this book hoping to be inspired to read her other works, and I may still read Atlas Shrugs, but if this is how life was in Russia, I am glad to be an America. I really love the freedoms we enjoy and would not like being indoctrinated and deprived for the wealthy or the government."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I read the Fountainhead first, then Atlas Shrugged, then We The Living. We The Living is by far the most moving, engaging, and realistic of these novels. How interesting that this was her first novel; written, presumably, before her Objectivist Philosophy had taken full shape, and taken over all other considerations. The novel's strengths lie in the believability of the characters; their motives are human and their actions and circumstances realistic rather than idealistic. I was truly drawn into all of her novels, however We The Living made clear to me the problems in her later novels-- in the later novels, Ayn Rand ceased to consider plot and character as useful ends unto themselves, and began utilizing them solely as mechanisms by which to disseminate her philosophy. We the Living is strong because her characters struggle to maintain the heroic integrity she assigns them. In her later books, the love stories she created lack the passion and innocence (and believability) found in We The Living. If Ayn Rand's goal was to present to the world a philosophy for man to live by on earth, We The Living is the only one of her fictional novels in which the plot and character are believable enough to have have existed on this earth."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This book, although is a rommance, is the closest to a autobiography that Ayn Rand ever made. In the time it was written, the book was probably despised, since in those years, the intellectual environment was socialist, and could never accept the views from Ayn Rand. But the truth is: Ayn Rand lived what she wrote, and that is what makes We the Living one of the most reliable and interesting books ever written about the first year of the Communist Revolution in Russia."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This book is one of my very favorites. Kira Argounova takes you through Russia immediatly following the Revolution. Through her eyes and others, you will see the painful life Communism set for all Russian citizens. Horrific details of the sacrifices people made for eachother, the hunger of the citizens and the dying. Although it is painful to read and finish, it gives you a strong feeling of hope. No other fictatious book about Russia at this time will let you feel with the Russians as this will!!!"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"To me, this book was a very big surprise. It was loaned to me by a friend who had borrowed a few of my books and was wanting to reciprocate. When she first gave it to me I was not at all excited, but once I picked it up I honestly could not put it down - even at work sometimes! I had thought her books were very philosophically surreal, but this book was very real and very easy for &quot;non-philosophical&quot; types in addition to those who are constantly in search of a higher meaning. Do keep in mind that it is an emotionally wrenching book, and other than that you need no introduction aside from what is on the back cover of the book. I look forward to reading Atlas Shrugged and Fountainhead, once I am able to get over this one and the lessons it teaches have sunk in completely."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This book is billed as a great philosophical tour de force, a marketing strategy clearly meant to appeal to Atlas Shrugged readers who may have missed her first work. Instead, most of the time it reads like a conventional love story, with many more shades of gray than one will find in her all-or-nothing works like Atlas. This disappointed me."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I love this book. Kira is so much more human and affable than all of Rand's later heros. Yes, it is a youthful attempt and you can tell it. However, the tale is pure passion and joy, without being bogged down with pages of intellectual support of it. You can tell that this writing was closer to Rand's heart, than her brain."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"So maybe I am not the best person to write a reveiw of this book, since I am a big Ayn Rand fan. But of my two most favorite books I have read this one is my second favorite (Atlas Shrugged is #1). This book is one of those I-read-it-all-in-one-sitting-because-I-couldn't-put-it-down books. In one way you could read it as only a love story with a few twists, and what a wonderful story it is in it's own right. However, to explain the characters, to teach the reader, to show this philosophy, it is shown in an easy to read book. While still remaining very in-depth. For people who are intimidated I recomend this: 1- Read this book first for the story. 2- Read this book again for the philosophy. 3- Read it again and enjoy what you have learned. 4- Then you can move on to The Fountain Head and Atlas Shrugged."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I am sure the intended purpose of these reviews is to show both the good and the bad of a work. As I read the comments of others, I was disappointed by being unable to find anyone who did not appreciate this book. Surely there must be one? It probably is probably just his luck not to have the internet.But I digress, We the Living is Rand's most digestable work. The reader needs to understand that she was in Russia during the revolution; she witnessed the hardships that took place, and that is why this book is beautiful. It has not been tainted by her theoritical objectivism idealogy. I find it quite a shame that this work will always remain in the shadows of Ayn Rand's other works. Perhaps that is the way she wanted it. We the Living is unlike all her other writings; it is her one innocent novel. Yet to be spoiled by her objectivism idealogy, it simple shows, through a sublime plot, what happens to man when he submits his freedom"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"It may be heretical but I consider this first workRand's best. It has an innocence not found inthe later tomes. An instant read - and one that can't be put down - it's a non-didactic Rand whois writing a story - not a polemic. The love story is absolutely fantastic and the description of Russia deadly. The characters will remain for along time and the plot is suberb. Warning - not a happy ending"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"First, I did not like the book. It was like a trashy romance novel. It offered little information on the actual Russian Revolution. The book is about a girl named Kira who sleeps around too much to survive. She claims that she is in love, but she doesn't even know the meaning of the word. I do, however, like the end. I believe that Communism does forbid life to the living. If any part of this story is read, read the end. Kira and Andrei's last speeches almost make reading the book worth while. People who want a spin on a serious topic should read this book."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Ayn Rand warns, in riveting fiction, of the fate that awaits those who succumb to the false promises of socialism. Unless you're asleep, it's hard to miss the similarity of language that steers the revolutionaries of early 20th century Russia and that of the current US administration. I couldn't put the book down."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Author Ayn Rand is best known for her objectivist novels \\"The Fountainhead\\" and \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" but those were not her first forays into fiction, nor were either her first novel. \\"We the Living\\" was Rand's first novel, published in 1936.In \\"We the Living,\\" Rand is still working on the ideals behind her philosophy of objectivism, a philosophy that focuses on the individual and the freedom of the individual and capitalism. The ideals are there in this book, and they're strong, but it's obvious she still doesn't have it all quite worked out yet. But that should not disappoint any of Rand's fans, because the novel is still entertaining and strong, though admittedly not as dogmatic as her later works.This novel covers three years, from 1922 to 1925, and the life of one young woman struggling to survive in the first days of the Soviet Union. Life is harsh for everyone, but especially so for an individual who wishes to be free from the restraints and influences of the collective. In an introduction to the novel Rand herself called the book semi-autobiographical, saying it related the world and experiences she knew during her last few years in the U.S.S.R. However, the events portrayed are not supposed to have been based upon real happenings.Surprisingly, one of the heroes to this novel is a Communist. This is so surprising considering Rand's vociferous attacks against Communism throughout her career. Perhaps the character was drawn from ideas of someone she knew, perhaps someone who agreed with her philosophically but was not strong enough to live in that vein? Only Rand knew."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This is a fine book which goes on in Petrograd, in the early days of the communist state. It describes the hardship of former bourgeosie returning to live in Russia after the revolution. Ayn somewhat indirectly portays human characters greater than the common mold and describes the difficulty they find to succumb to communist ideology, which doesn't favor the existence of strong outstanding individuals.The weakness of the novel is the plot, more precisely the actions of the characters, some of their actions seems not rational to me. There is the communist Andrei who gets Kira's (the main character) boyfriend imprisoned, but then he changes his mind and get's him out of prison again and become a spokesman for Ayn's philosopy before he commits suicide. Petrograd is a moving city and Ayn has many nice descriptions of it, especially at winter time. It's also very interesting to witness an insider view of the early years of the communist state. Even during communism bribery apparently was rife."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Not quite as entertaining as Atlas Shrugged, but all of Ayn Rand's books should be required reading for all high school students."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Set in Communist Russia but as a commentary on all social movements that aim to degrade the individual man, We the Living is the story of Kira, a idealistic and independent young woman from a \\"bourgeoisie\\" family, and the two men in her life: Leo, an indifferent but also individualistic young man, and Andrei, a youth leader in the Communist party. Not long after the revolution, Communism rules Russia. Kira's family, once aristocratic and wealthy, flounders under \\"proletariat\\" rule. Throughout society, men scramble for jobs, women wait in line for scarce and low-quality food, and everyone is smothered by a society that promises new freedoms and equality but offers little. Kira refuses to succumb to the communist message or principles, instead opting to study architecture out of the pure, selfish desire to do what she loves. Initially, consumed in her study, things go well, but when she falls in love with Leo she is suddenly dragged into conflict with the state. Meanwhile, she forms a strong friendship with Andrei--although they stand on opposing sides of the revolution, they share the same soul. Bit by bit, Kira must sacrifice herself and her morals in order to stay afloat in a society she hates and support a man that she loves. Ultimately, We the Living is the story of the fragile, indomitable spirit of man: no matter what they face, Kira, Leo, and Andrei maintain individuality and spirit, yet Communism erodes their power and makes their goals impossible to achieve. This is her first book, and so Rand's writing style hasn't fully matured, but the characters are realistic, the plot sympathetic, and the story's purpose threatening, frightening, and uplifting all at the same time.Rand generally has the same group of characters, basic plot line, and concept within her texts, and We the Living is no exception. The independent, antisocial main character (both Kira and Leo), as well as the similar character on the opposing side of the social issue (Andrei) are present, as is the plot line of the characters (male character is unemotional and female character doesn't believe in love, yet the two fall in love despite themselves; intervening character is a source of conflict and character development for both characters) and, of course, the underlying principle of the novel: Rand's belief in the independent, selfish man and his abilities and rights. To a certain extent, the repetition in character, plot, and purpose means that Rand's books can become repetitive, and if you've read one, you've read them all. To the extent that this is true, I would recommend one of her later novels (Atlas Shrugged or The Fountainhead), which are similar but have a more mature writing style and a more complex analysis of Rand's world view. That said, there is something different and worthwhile to be found in each of Rand's texts. We the Living in particular is more of a novel--more succinct and readable, less didactic, and on some level incredibly intimate. It would probably serve as a good introduction to Rand's writing and philosophy, and it is an approachable, personal novel in its own right.We the Living does have its flaws. Between setting, focus on the novel, and Rand's immaturity as an author, Rand's philosophy of Objectivism is underdeveloped and the text itself is nearly hopeless--that is, while it illustrates the problems with social structures such as Communism, it never provides an alternative or, truly, any sense of hope. Without coming full circle and providing a road map for achievement as well as a warning against weakness, Rand's books do little more than fear-monger and depress, and have no useful impact on the reader. In that respect, her later novels are much more effective and meaningful, and I highly recommend them. Outside of the Objectivist message but rather as a novel, We the Living is fairly strong, but it lacks realistic characters and sympathetic plot events. Initially, Kira and Leo, are realistic characters with personality and faults, but both eventually contradict themselves and become emotionless to an extreme; Andrei, in comparison, begins as a limited, undeveloped character, and only gains depth late in the novel. Plot events throughout, no matter how realistic, remove a lot of audiences sympathy for the characters and so distance the reader from the storyline.Nonetheless, I do recommend this novel. While I enjoy and appreciate Rand's later novels more, We the Living is a good introduction to her style and her philosophy and writing style/novel construction. It is also a very intimate, frightening warning against not just Communism but any social structure that aims to degrade and take power from the individual man. These structures, Rand argues, will only be successful in compromising man's individually; they will never provide the freedom and equality that they promise. She fails to offer an alternative, but Rand definitely provides a strong commentary on this sort of social structure, and if nothing else it reminds the reader to enjoy, take advantage of, and preserve, the true freedoms that he may have."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Ayn Rand's We The Living is a novel set in Russia right after the revolution ended and explores the lifes and times of primarily three individuals: Kira, the female who wants to be an engineer and is passionately in love with Leo, the son of former Army General and the immistakable Andrei, who has risen from streets to become a formidable communist. To complete the cast is Victor, Kira's cousin, who does the needful to shed his bourgeois past and rise through the ranks, Pyerov and Sonia, who in their own way use communism to become richer and powerful, and other members of Kira's family. The novel dwells on how revolution alters not only their daily lifes, morals, ambitions but also reveals their base and basic human character. It is a tale of falsified hopes, broken dreams, corruption, love, and of the struggle of someone to survive a political system that is of utmost dislike to him/her.Perhaps as the first book to come out of communist Russia, We The Living has gained more respect than it merits on basis of just literary qualities. Like all her heroes and heroines, Rand's prime suspects here are three idealists who seek to justify their different means for their selfish ends. The love triangle between Andrei, Leo and Kira is stifling reminder of how some people try to lead a dual life, hoping they can let two people be happily in love with them. Kira, who Rand wishes to potray as the martyr in her superhuman effort to be true to her individualistic ideals, and whose character is the reason for calling this novel as primarily as war of an individual against the state, fails to impress me. While the novel is a great treatize on how and why communist Russia squandered the dreams of early revolutionaries, Kira fails to impress. Her convictions are full of contradictions, as are her means and methods of achieving them. If I really want someone to read about communist Russia, I'd ask them to pick Doctor Zhivago by Boris Pasternak. If Ayn Rand's Objectivism or Invidualism is your ideal, stop after reading Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged.Kira's love is flawed for it lacks the honesty and fidelity that one must show towards one she cherishes. Her ideals are made ridiculous by the manner in which she sheds them for survival. Andrei is the unlikely hero, who is victim of his own idealogy, victim of treachery by both the women and the country that he tried to love and save. Leo is a failed ideal, and his character, throughout the novel does not tell me why Kira loved him so. There are other people in the novel, and Rand seeks to potray their state as the consequence of communism. Agreed, the state that supressed personal freedom and right for personal profit, must have broken the spirit of one and many. As a grim reminder of how social catastropes can alter family life, We The Living stands strong. As a ideological entity, I find it uninspiring. Fountainhead rules any day."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Some people seem to come away a little disappointed from this novel. I would guess that this is because this is one of Rand's lesser known works. The people who read this seem to have already made an acquaintance of Rand through The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. Expecting the same tenor of philosophical writing, they are disappointed that this book contains little more than the emotional core of individualism. There is hardly any concrete philosophy, beyond a depiction of collectivism as it really is, in this book.In truth, this book is Rand's best writing. We the Living is a true-to-life depiction of life under totalitarian rule. It's not philosophical. It's not journalistic writing - it applies to life under totalitarianism anywhere. We the Living shows the essential battle between the individual and the collective.We the Living has a certain raw, emotional quality (which may be due to the fact that much of it is drawn directly from the author's experience. The closing scene of this novel has a depth of feeling rarely found in any literature.I would recommend this as the first Rand novel one should read, followed by The Fountainhead. I would particularly recommend these two books to teenagers, as there is a great deal in both that resonates with the spirit of youth. Atlas Shrugged is a more philosophical novel, which is still important, even essential reading, but only after We the Living and The Fountainhead."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. It details life during the Russian Revolution. It is honest, provactive, and made me understand the Revolution. 5 stars is not a high enough rating. It is her best novel, and the best novel ever. For...or less, you can read the best piece of literature you'll ever read. Every cent is worth it, and at this price, too good to pass up. The price makes the book a real steal."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"It has been a long time since I've read this novel, but out of her several novels/novellae, this is probably the one with the most heart. As all of her fiction is quite tragic, this is a tragic love story, but these characters seem to take on a more human tone than characters in her other works of fiction. It would be difficult not to appreciate her writing even if in some ways her work is almost unpalatable. I'm not sure that I would want to recommend We The Living, but I did read it several times myself."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Rand uses her own experience of growing up during the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. The bleak picture she paints of Soviet Russia should be a warning to all Americans as to the catastrophic danger the democratic socialism presents.America is an election or two away from becoming a full blown socialist state. If our politicians don't stop amassing debt there will be no choice but to nationalize every aspect of American life. Imagine if you will that your pay is taxed 100% - that is the Democrat Party's end game.Read We the Living to see what America has in store for her if the Democrats have their way."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I'm glad to know I'm not the only person who felt that this novel fell way short of Rand's usual brilliance; brilliance that is apparently only achieved in her later works. As this is her first novel, it's understandable to see so many rough edges and undeveloped theories. Even so, I couldn't reconcile several elements of the plot since they were in such contrast to the concepts she upholds in later novels.Ayn Rand writes of characters set in Soviet Russia during the Communist revolution. Kira, the protagonist, stays neutral in her political beliefs so long as they don't interfere with her ambitions in life. While at first her goals were to move abroad and become an engineer, the only facet of her life of which the reader sees is her goal of being with the man she loves, Leo.Leo is a character with no notable ambitions-- the reader is introduced to him as a counter-revolutionist who is instantly drawn to Kira, but his efforts of fighting for his beilefs aren't mentioned after the first 50 pages. By the end of the story, he is nothing more than an arrogant alcoholic. Like others in the novel, he manipulates the good intentions of others to further his own worthless pursuits.Andrei, on the other hand, is Kira's other love interest. Andrei is inquisitive and loyal: as the Communist party to which he holds dearly falls into corruption and greed, he lives his life for Kira's love.After understanding some background on the characters, I was puzzled to see the way in which Rand developed the plot. One theory to which Rand upholds so strongly is the belief that man should not live for another. In \\"We the Living,\\" however, the characters do exactly that-- Andrei lives for Kira's love. Kira lives for the love of her playboy, Leo. As the book drew to a very depressing close, I wondered how on Earth Ayn Rand could revolve a story on the premise of that which she hates (the notion of living for another). Then I reflected on the outcome of the characters and realized that in a way, everyone got exactly what they deserved if one were to uphold Randian thinking.The novel progresses like a train wreck, ultimately not knowing how any characters are going to escape from the dire situations in which they place themselves. The hardest thing to note is that none of them do escape from their hellish reality. The single exception is one character who deserves absolution the least (Leo). As for the rest of them, they spend years on hopes that never solidify; dreams of school, French perfume, going abroad, and artistic achievements become buried in the cold winter of Russia.What alarmed me about both the characters and the way they're written is their level of compromise to achieve such dreams-- Kira becomes a sell-out to the Communist party for a job and a mistress to a man she doesn't love to save the man she does love. Instead of fighting as a counter-revolutionist, Leo becomes an illegal trader with the assistance of a top Communist government official. Those who do uphold unwaivering morality face the harshest outcomes (characters like Andrei and Kira's cousin Irena). The reason for my surprise is that Rand's most noble literary characters in her other stories, like Howard, Dangey, Francisco, John Galt, are rewarded for motives that are punished in \\"We the Living.\\"For readers who want to aquaint themselves with Ayn Rand's theories, I urge them not to read this book. The dislikeability of Kira and the other characters will distract the reader from themes that aren't conveyed in a convincing (or persuasive) manner. Themes of egoism, selfishness, and capitalism are cornerstones of Ayn Rand, but they just aren't set forth in a coherent manner within \\"We the Living.\\" If I hadn't read \\"The Fountainhead\\" or \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" I would've read this book and have had the same disdain towads Rand that I know so many people have towards her works."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"We The Living was not the first Ayn Ran book I read, and it would be difficult to say which is the best, but We the Living is a window to the life and thinking of Ayn Rand. Her characters are real people, ones I would have liked to know. Kira is the embodiment of a lover of life, no matter what the odds were against her living it. Rand used her characters to show the brutality of any dictatorship and her words are, sadly, still true today. Rand's writing style is superb and I recommend this book to anyone who believes their life is worth something to themselves and is not to be lived for the sake of others."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Whether you agree with her philosophy or not, this novel differs from her other writings in its passionate sincerity. Rather than intoning ominous mantras against Marxist collectivism, she demonstrates by vivid examples how constrictive and unfortunate such a theory can be when translated into fact. The harsh details she provides could only have been written by one who had lived in similar circumstances. The characters are not like the black-and-white archetypes she employs in her later fiction; their opinions and motives are much more credible.After reading WE THE LIVING, you feel a certain sympathy and understanding for Ayn Rand's vehement rejection of all philosophical systems or ideas that might inhibit personal freedom and individual expression. But the irony of her philosophy is that her &quot;Objectivism&quot; evolved into a system, which, if strictly adhered to, would be just as repressive, dogmatic and severe as the communism she so passionately disparaged.I've read and enjoyed several of her books; but this one I found to be the most striking and honest."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Ayn Rand proved her genius in this first novel, written in l937. I read it several times a year because Rand brilliantly evokes a long-gone world of Soviet Russia. You won't forget any of the characters which brings me to her heroine, Kira Argonouva. Kira sacrifices her dignity and helps the Soviets kill the only true hero in the book: Andrei. She does this in the name of love for the sleazy, brutal Leo. I can't see anything admirable about this sadistic killer. Kira becomes like any teeny-bopper and can't keep her hands off this muscular hunk. so much for the high ideals of our heroine. Other than that, \\"We the Living\\" is a masterpiece. You owe to yourself to see the Italian made film of this book. It was made in l942, literally beneath the war-strewn streets of Italy and stars an all-Italian cast. It's amazing how faithful the movie is to the book. Mussolini hated the movie and tried to have all copies destroyed."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"The background of We the Living is the aftermath of the Bolshevik Revolution and the ensuing White-Red civil war. Set in the years 1922 to 1925, it describes the hardships of living in Petrograd under the Communists. The story is told through the lives of Kira Argounova, who is 17 at the beginning, and her two lovers, Leo Kovalensky, the son of an Admiral in the Czar's navy, and Andrei Taganov, a Party member who is an officer in the G.P.U. (forerunner to the KGB). Kira's father owned a textile factory before the revolution; Leo's family was considered aristocracy. This puts them on the wrong side of the revolution: they are not part of the workers' proletariat; they belong to the hated bourgeoisie class who \\"exploited the masses\\" before the revolution.Rand's cold, stark descriptions of life in Petrograd illustrate the desperate hopelessness of life in the Communist system. Not being proletarians caused even greater hardships for the bourgeoisie. They were locked out of trade unions, and party membership was very difficult to attain without a significant transcendence into revolutionary thinking. They were the last hired and the first fired in the many purges that took place. Kira falls in love with Leo and they live together in Leo's father's house. They originally have three large rooms but eventually have to give two of them to other comrades because of the housing shortage. Their diet consists of millet and stale bread, and there is barely enough of that to stay alive. Being former exploiters of workers, they are assessed 50 times as much as proletarians for repairs on the building that Leo's father owned. Leo's father, by the way, was executed for \\"counter-revolutionary activity.\\"Kira maintains a dominant spirit of independence throughout the story. She pays lip service to the Party dogma to keep a job and to get a ration card, but she never buys into it. Leo does not even go that far: being openly hostile to the revolution eventually causes him to lose his job and they have to live on Kira's meager salary and rations. Kira begins a dangerous double life: she becomes a lover to Leo and Andrei at the same time. Leo enters into an even more dangerous profiteering business with a bureaucrat and a Party member. Through his affair with Kira and listening to her desire to live an independent life, Andrei begins to question his own commitment to the ideals of Communism. These are the elements that drive the story to its poignant and tragic conclusion.Once I reached the halfway point of this book the rising action became so intense that I couldn't put it down. I developed strong feelings either for or against the major characters. Rand is not the least bit preachy in this book; the story is told through the characters, and it is a great illustration of life under a repressive regime. The characters are fictional but the background is true: Any Rand lived through it. Americans should read this book to see the dark side of so-called \\"social justice\\" once it is put into place by the ruling class. It could happen here."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"A first novel, Ayn Rand establishes herself as a free-thinking individual who understands the importance of capitalist thought and that government which governs least, governs best. This 60th anniversary edition is important for any library of one who values America as the land of the free and the home of the brave."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"skulls, and poured blood, our blood, their blood, to wash a clean road for freedom.\\"Ayn Rand's first book is not what you might expect when you hear the words \\"Russian novel.\\" Although lengthy, it's an easy read. The story begins in 1922 with 18-year-old Kira Arguonova's arrival (after a four year hiatus) in Petrograd, along with her 28-year-old sister, Lydia, and her parents. The family has lost their store, their status and their home and set out to start a new life in a changed city. Kira a headstrong, opinionated, confident young woman, whose anti-communist beliefs mirror author Ayn Rand's own, decides to study engineering at the university, a logical choice for someone with a lifelong interest in things structural.One evening after fending off the unwanted attentions of an admirer, she encounters an attractive stranger named Leo Kovalensky, whose admiral father (we learn later) was executed as a counter-revolutionary. The two agree to meet a month later and do. A classmate involved with the secret police brings her in for questioning after seeing Kira with her newfound more-than-friend. Intrigued, twenty-eight-year-old Andrei Taganov, communist to the core, intervenes to extricate her from the situation. Leo and Anna decide to move in together, disappointing her parents. Like their fellow countrymen, the two are forced to wait in long lines for meager rations, but things get more difficult for the couple. Due to Leo's family's political leanings, he is unable to find work. When doctors recommend he be sent south to a sanatorium due to serious health concerns, Kira secretly takes up with the relatively wealthy Taganov to fund the trip. Leo returns eight months later a different man. He seems well, but gets involved in an illegal and dangerous business venture that ends badly. Through lies and deceit, Kira is able to keep both Leo and Andrei in the dark about her two-timing. True to typical Russian novels, tragedy triumphs. Save yourself some spoilers and save the Foreward for afterward.Although I couldn't wrap my head around Kira's ability to fool the other two vertices of her love triangle, the way Ms. Rand handled the story's setting (post Russian Revolution political situation in Soviet Russia) and her descriptiveness, especially of the weather and scenery: (p 6) \\"Like barnacles, they [men] clung to the steps, to the buffers, to the roofs,\\" (p 66) \\"Whipped into mud by horses' hoofs, the first snow looked like a pale coffee with thin, melting splinters of sugar,\\" and (p 83) \\"The face and the bulb stood as incongruous shadows against the frozen sunset outside, beyond the window, a sunset as sinister and cold as dead blood,\\" are spectacular. Beyond all that, there is a lot going on plot-wise between the primary characters and their family members, friends, and acquaintances: suffering, sadness, survival, and sometimes, being sent to Siberia. Also good, The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, 11 years in Soviet Prison Camps by Elinor Lipper, and Coming Out of the Ice: An Unexpected Life by Victor Herman."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Sometimes, after finishing a book, I feel deep within me that it is important that other people read it, too.I'm sure you feel the same way.We The Living is such a book. I can't say whether it is Rand's best fiction or not... certainly a better read than Atlas Shrugged or Anthem, but The Fountainhead looms large in my memory, and might still claim the throne. However, I wouldn't feel it as important to have others read The Fountainhead as I might this one -- We The Living is somehow more personal, and more affecting.Ayn Rand is a divisive author, especially for those who haven't really bothered to study her and are just going off of what they've heard from others. If even a detractor reads We The Living, however, I think they'll see a person passionately devoted to the best things about humanity, and about life. Who could witness the plight of Kira and not be moved? Not be profoundly angered at the society that would put her through such ordeal? Not be convicted to ensure that no such thing could take place again, anywhere on earth?We The Living is a labor of love, and its plain to see in the writing. It sparkles with honesty, and draws from its readers the true pain that only honest writing can. A person may or may not agree with the Objectivist stand on laissez-faire, or inductive reasoning, but a solid common ground can still be reached by looking into this slice of Soviet life and being properly and profoundly horrified. From the resultant senses of pain, sorrow, and anger, our common philosophical conversation can continue..."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Although I like and have been influenced by some of Rand's ideas, I have never been a big fan of her novels. I find her essays to be better written and more influential. Despite the claims of her die hard fans, both ATLAS SHRUGGED and THE FOUNTAINHEAD are overly long, spending way too much time and effort beating the reader over the head with their ideas. I am of the opinion that the reason those two novels are so popular is not because of their literary merit, but because they better represent Rand's philosophy as it was developing and provide context to her ideas in a fictionalized format.Rand's first novel, WE THE LIVING, is a different matter. Rand's ideas were not as well developed at the time it was written but existed in a more nascent form. This makes WE THE LIVING an inferior source for exploring Rand's ideas, but it does make it, in my opinion, a better novel than Rand's subsequent works. The ideas behind the writing are solid enough to understand, yet do not overwhelm the story itself, giving the reader more sympathetic characters with whom to relate.Rand herself stated that WE THE LIVING was her most autobiographical work. A depressing look at the new Soviet Russia in the early 1920s, the book opens with Kira, a young woman with a strong and independent spirit, returning to Petrograd after a political exile. Kira finds her family resigned to the new Communist political regime, which robbed them of all their possessions and, even worse, robbed them of all hope. Determined to become an engineer, Kira soon falls hard for Leo, another free spirit whose political ideals and human aspirations match Kira's own. The two find, however, that free spirits are hard to sustain in a brutally oppressive environment and the relationship collapses under the weight.Although Leo is her love, Kira finds her soul mate in the party ideologue Andrei. They may differ in politics, but Kira can confide in Andrei in ways she cannot with Leo. Kira feigns love for Andrei in order to help Leo. Unsurprisingly, things go wrong. Kira soul is crushed that much more by her guilt over using Andrei, whom she holds dear, for ulterior purposes.Rand's portrayal of life in the new Soviet Russia is bleak and depressing. Long lines, poor food, cramped apartments and tired citizens are only the beginning. As Kira discovers in her relationships with Leo and Andrei, the real price to pay is in the brutal truth that, in a totalitarian state, even intimate relationships are subsumed to the cause. Perhaps such a lesson is not as ambitious as those Rand explored in later novels. Yet it is the simplicity of that idea combined with more realistic characters that makes WE THE LIVING worthwhile."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Anyone interested in reading Rand's fiction should start with this book. It's the first she wrote and, via the depiction of the horrible life it's protagonist leads (seemingly somewhat autobiographical) you can see where Rand's later philosophies and excesses stem from. A moving story of an idealistic, free-thinking young woman's doomed attempts to live her life under Soviet rule. No one who reads this book can come away unappreciative of life in a democracy where individuals have a much greater degree of self-determination."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Ms. Rand states in the foreward of her debut novel, We the Living, that it's the closest thing to an autobiography she's ever written, and it also marked her beginning as a novelist in the Romantic Realist school using a new language(English), since she left the Soviet Union. Anyone who claims that Rand is not really a novelist should read this book. The character development is without a doubt the most professional and urbane of any of her works, and the imagery she uses to immerse the reader into the dark, cruel, and depressing soul of Petrograd in the early to mid 1920's is downright impressive. It's obvious that she used a tremendous of time and effort to translate her thoughts onto the page while still trying to master the English language. Perhaps this is why the book is so well crafted and never varies in its painstaking realism from start to finish. There are no long speeches or oratories in this wonderful work, it is a rather plodding, brooding, and sensual piece of continual development from start to finish. Only a self-made author as Ms. Rand calls herself, and I might add one who is very gifted and able, could have written such a great piece of historical literature, which is still a very relavant and vibrant read to this day. Yes, it provokes thought as any work of her's does, however, she does not hammer the reader over the head with her beliefs, but rather lets it meld into the storyline. I would love to hear somebody say that Ms. Rand cannot write well and isn't a real novelist after reading this marvelous and steady piece of prose, for I would say that it's far better than anything done by Pasternak or many of the other modern Russian novelists of &quot;acclaim,&quot; and of course it's of much more value. Only a fool would doubt that Rand's work does not reveal a person of pure genius and unadulterated greatness. After reading We the Living, only a very stupid fool, can honestly say that she's not a skilled novelist or very talented writer. Another triumph for this unique and precious literary visionary. We probably won't see one like her ever again, but I'm hoping that we don't quit trying to surpass her acheivements. I know she wouldn't want us to! Live and think brothers and sisters. Ignorance is not bliss, it's only a shallow disguise for those who are afraid to really try. This is a work of art by a person who was in progress. Even her most ardent critics would have to agree that this work has substantial merit as a living historical document alone.

This book brought it back, with all the subtlety of a hammer blow. To an American reader the descriptions may seem unreal: &quot;did people really talk that way? behave that way?&quot; Yes, they did, even in the more prosperous post-Stalin times. This is one of the most powerful indictments of collectivism in general and communism in particular - it shows, in stark colors, what this ideology does to its adherents and enemies."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"The children of today's Americans do not know the meaning of freedom. It is taken for granted, without any thought of what has been the cost to many of America's greatest champions.We The Living is the literary equivalent of what that freedom has cost. That a young woman emigrant felt compelled to challenge the political trend of a continent in the hope of saving her brave new world from the same fate.When I attented high school, I was required to study communism, but nothing prepared me for Ms. Rand's revelations. In my high school course I learned of the mechanical structure of communism with the implication that such a system could work for the benifit of mankind. In We The Living I learned the result of such a political system.If it is our goal to teach our children the history of communism to aid in their understanding of freedom, I suggest We The Living be mandatory reading during the course.Keith Williams"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Although this was the first of Rand's invidual vs. the masses novels, it is quite good. It is her most autobiographical and also her most beautiful love story. The book is not necessarily as triumphant as are her others and is, in fact, quite tragic in parts.

It stayed with me for 6 years until I read We The Living. This is the best book, and I live by it. If you like to think, if you aren't very religious and you are an individual then this book is for you. It is more than a love story, it is intellectual and thought provoking. Now 7 years from reading Anthem and 1 from reading We The Living, I am now reading Atlas Shrugged and I love it. So to all those out there who condemn Ayn Rand for her beliefs (and mine) all I have to say is you don't understand, you are the people she says are evil in her books and you prove it when you bad mouth her."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This is my favorite of Ayn Rand's books. I began my love affair with &quot;We the Living&quot; back in the fifties and read it several times each year. My attitude toward Kira Argounova, however, has changed drastically as I've grown older. She represented a fascinating, fearless heroine who stood alone against a brutal world. But then I began to wonder why did she give up everything for the sadistic, beautiful Leo while delbirately destroying the only heroic character in the book: Andrei? Through the book, Kira arrogantly insists that nothing is greater than a person's ego. Yet, she becomes hot for the body of the Russian god, Leo, and goes crazy over him. Leo belongs with Rand's gallery of villians and I would definitely put Kira Argounova in there with them. She destroyed a noble, intense young Russian warrior in order to keep her sleazy hunk alive. There's nothing admirable or noble in what she does. She would fit in with the hookers on 42nd Street here in NYC."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I was drawn into the novel by the heroine's devotion to her ideals but was finally let down by a weak ending. I wonder, though, if this was Rand's goal? Maybe the story of a Russian girl who holds to her ideals in the communist Soviet Union doesn't have a grand finale? Maybe she is simply crushed by the weight of socialism that sees her only as part of a collective. Besides the ending, though, the plot is engaging and interesting. The writing isn't quite on par with Rand's later works (this being her first novel) but the presentation of her fledgling philosophy and her social commentary make the book worthwhile on every level."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"this book left me absolutly breathless. i have read all of her other novels and found this to be the most touching. Kira was unlike any other character i have ever gotten to know, she has a charming quality. i could not get enough of her. i cried for 45 minutes when i finished and later when i thought about it. i am 16 and i go to enloe high in raleigh nc. this book is incredible. raw and true to human nature. i enjoyed it most b/c it was not fancy with the happy endings and over done unrealistic love. read it. it is true to LIFE. and how people truly are. and appreciate what that means to you."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I am 2/3 of the way through reading WTL and bought a copy of the WTL movie made in 1942 Italy. I would say the book is a million times better than the movie, but I really enjoyed the movie, and the great lengths they went through during the reign of Mussilini to hide one copy of the movie in a basement so it couldn't be destroyed. They also went to great lengths to make the movie as the 1942 Italian government was very fascist. If you read the book you should see the DVD movie. But if you haven't read the book, you will not enjoy the movie half as much, as the movie has to leave so much out. To me, this is a story about the reality of life in a communist country. People were starving, crawling around on the ground to eat the empty sunflower seed shells and cigarette butts. They have to cook on a little kerosene Primus stove and heat their ROOM, their homes are taken from them, in a metal box, they can't afford the logs to heat up a whole fireplace. Everyone lives in absolute poverty and fear of the ruling elite, who by the way take their homes and they are corrupt and have plenty to eat - while the masses starve. Anyone who has a love affair with communism should read this book and watch the 1942 movie WTL. Now I totally understand why people try to escape Cuban communism to come to American freedom. Let Freedom Ring! God Bless America!"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"As soon as I started reading this book I could not put it down. It's the best thing I've read in a long time! I can't give it 5 stars because to me the dialogue comes off as kind of stilted and unnatural-sounding--but the dialogue is by no means the most important aspect of the book. It has the kind of propulsive plot that makes you wish you could read faster so you could find out what happens next, and Ayn Rand's descriptive writing is peerless. It really blows my mind to think she only learned English when she was in her twenties. I highly recommend this book to everyone. It is fabulous! I now plan to read everything else Ayn Rand ever wrote."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Once I read On The beach by Nevil Shute and thought that was the most depressing novel I'd ever read then I came by this book and it beat them all by a mile. Even though despare practicly clings to this book and can feel it's strength through every page, the carecters in this book were amazing. The way rand built them up to such high standerds then tore each of the apart piece by piece fascinated me. Leo is a great example. ayn rand was a very talented writer and her styil of writing proved it. This book will stick in my heart for a long time and it true message also"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"If you enjoy Rand, I am delighted to direct you to another &quot;Randlike&quot; novel, THE LAST DAY, by Glenn Kleier. In THE LAST DAY, Kleier tackles the subject of authority in organized religion with startling &quot;Ayn Rand&quot; objectivism and outrageous wit and irreverence. LAST DAY is a classic, watershed novel in the manner of FOUNTAINHEAD and SHRUGGED. I found it a riveting read, and one that I greatly encourage all Rand fans to experience."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I thought &quot;We The Living&quot; was an incredibly moving book. The love and devotion between these two characters was incredible. Every word that Rand wrote made me feel like I was the one experiencing the hardships and triumphs that were experienced. I believe this is a very true experience of what it was like to grow up in communist Russia from 1920 to 1945. Since this was supposed to be the closest thing to an autobiography of Rand I think we can experience more clearly what most people did from that time period."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"As other reviewers have noted, this novel is different from Ayn Rand's others: it actually qualifies as literature rather than propaganda.The characterization is a little off (e.g. Leo stops being an attractive character in fairly short order), and the alterations from the original version do show. (Rand apparently wanted to make it more &quot;capitalistic&quot; and less &quot;Nietzschean&quot; -- cf. Kira's desire to become an &quot;engineer,&quot; of which nothing whatsoever is made in the novel. And see the earlier versions of some of Kira's speeches, available in _The Journals of Ayn Rand_.) But it's actually a pretty good novel about the individual human being vs. the collectivist State.The rest of the Randian oeuvre is too didactic and too full of cardboard, self-serving moralizing to be classified as &quot;literature&quot;; it's more like the stuff the Soviet propaganda machine used to crank out, only in favor of Rand's version of &quot;capitalism&quot; rather than Soviet communism.But in this novel we see a hint of what Rand could have become if she'd tried. She wrote this one while her mind was still among the living."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"We the Living is a haunting portrayal of the harsh reality of too much power. Ayn Rand was able to achieve her objective in opening eyes as to the impact of the Russian Revolution on the individual. It is the story of those who love life and that which threatens its existence."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Critics of Rand, when pointing to her more popular classics Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead, often point out the exaggerated nature of the situations her characters are in. They suggest that Rand made her characters seem more heroic by creating unrealistic enemies and overblown conflicts.Yet, in We the Living, Rand can't be accused of hyperbole. Her most autobiographical novel, it tells the story of the young and ambitious Kyra Argounova, and her struggles to maintain her individualism in the tumultuous time of 1920's Soviet Russia. Readers will wisely note the similarities between Rand's own life and that of the character of Kyra.Although it may have been the novel that most successfully captured the struggle of life in Soviet Russia, the story is, as Rand points out, certainly not merely about the struggle of Kira to retain her freedom against the Communist Party, but rather, more generally, the struggle of the individual to retain their soul against the attempts of the state to strip it away.In response to Rand's critics, yes, this is her most realistic work of fiction. And that is exactly why it should not be overlooked. Ayn Rand experienced life under the thumb of the Communists first-hand, and this book captures it perfectly. There can be no claim of exagerated villains, because these villains were real.Simultaneously depressing, as we see freedom slowly being destoyed, and uplifting, as we see Kira struggle to live on, We the Living will challenge your ideas of politics, as all of Rand's novels do. Hopefully, after reading this book, you'll want to keep your politics to yourself, and understand why socialism will always be doomed to failure."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Although I couldn't honestly say that this book changed my life, I have never read anything that haunted me as much as _We, the Living_ does. A year after reading it I still find myself reliving scenes and going back to reread chapters that are so familiar I might have written them myself. Kira, like Howard Roark (_The Fountainhead_), does not grow during the novel, but she struggles to stay honest to herself and to her own ideals even though a hundred million people tell her that she can't. Rand's prose style is bitterly exact, even more astonishing because she didn't learn English until her twenties (similar to Joseph Conrad). Anyone who feels that communism was a good idea should read this book to see an alternate view, provided with clarity and honesty."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"While writing We the Living, Ayn Rand was still mastering the nuances of the English language after her emigration to America. It doesn't matter; she hits a literary homerunanyway. This is the essential Rand, antiticipating the brilliance of the Fountainhead and utilizing subtlety I wish she had exercised in Atlas Shrugged. You'll be carried away by Rand's protagonist, Kira, a hero in the classic sense of the word. At the same time, you'll be devastated by Rand's all too accurate description of the drudgery and misery of post-revolutionary Russia."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Thankfully I read this book before The Fountainhead (which I didn't enjoy at all). We The Living is a story about a triumphant woman never giving up on herself, the people she loves, and her dreams.The story was extremely well written and I was transformed to a time and place that I had been previously unfamiliar with. I quickly developed a fondness for the main characters and was anxious to read how things worked out. On a romantic level We The Living was frustrating, encouraging, and heartbreaking. I could not decide who would be a better match for Kira. Leo because of her love for him or Andrei because of his love for her?I highly recommend this book and guarantee it will become one of your favorites."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This novel is very poignant; set in post-Revolution Russia, a young girl on the point of going to University finds herself living in a world she cannot accept.Kira is depicted very well as a very young, emotional and sometimes impulsive woman who loves the wrong guy for the wrong reasons, sacrifices everything for him and learns that a life not lived as one wishes is not worth living. The tragic character of the Communist official Andrei is incredibly well-done.This book is a bit raw in places, showing the deep feelings that Rand must have experienced as she re-lives the world she left behind along with a family she never saw again. It is not as well-crafted a novel as The Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged, but it is the most deeply emotional thing Rand ever wrote and well worth reading."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"\\" \`Society, Kira, is a stupendous whole.' \`If you write a whole line of zeroes, it's still- nothing.\\" Chapter 3; Kira and VictorThis quote sums up Kira's attitude about the Collective, and mirrors author Ayn Rand's attitude on it as well. We the Living is a novel set in Russia during the Russian Revolution, and a young girl named Kira who refuses to settle for anything less than what she desires and deserves. The characters in it represent what every true individual can aspire to be if they believe in themselves. Leo, whom Kira loves and worships as her only god, is an example of one who had the potential to be great but who did not have the guts. Almost everyone surrounding Kira are examples of those born without potential or initiative. Kira is an example of someone who did all that she possibly could to be what she knows she can be, but the country and time period she lives in will not allow her to be anything but just another person in the great mass of people.Ayn Rand admitted that this is the closest she has ever come to writing an autobiography. She said that the events in the book are fiction, but Kira's ideals and values are her own. This book, like all of Ayn Rand's, will definately make you think, and it is an interesting read as well."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"When I first picked up Ayn Rand, I was warned that some of her ideas are a bit strange and that she loves bringing them up in her books. I shrugged that off, and read the book. I won't deny that I don't really understand what part of her philosophy is in her writing. When I read her books, I see fiction, and that's what I see here - a great work of fiction.\\"We the Living\\" is about revolutionary Russia. It's a fascinating book about people trying to live their lives and because of what they believe in, they cannot do that. The book has many examples of children paying parents' prices. The book shows us how people tried, and failed to live.The main character Kira, while the central figure in the story, is not exactly the most interesting. While a strong character, I didn't particularly love her, because she's not the sort of character to fall in love with. Instead, I was intrigued by her actions and mostly I was just curious. I found that I liked the side characters more than Kira, though she is certainly interesting and is definitely drawing.Much of the story centers around Kira's love troubles. There is her lover, Leo, who is a lot like Kira. He does what he believes in, no matter the cost. Here, it means not being a communist. Half of the story revolves around his and Kira's troubles at home, in life and love. Then there is Andrei, a communist who loves Kira. She uses him for money, help, and sometimes pleasure. He is the more interesting boy, with more of a personality and more interesting moments.There are a whole host of side characters, however, whose stories are just as fascinating as Kira and her boys. There is the story of Irina, Kira's cousin, who ultimately goes to jail for hiding her fiance/husband. There is the story of Victor, Irina's brother. Victor, the son of a man once wealthy like the rest of the family, chooses the \\"other\\" path, and rises to the top. There's the story of Pavel Syerov and Sonia, two communists, also living, but not quite. These side stories add a lot to the general idea, showing us more and more about Russia at the time through different people's eyes.I don't know what Ayn Rand wanted us to get from this. All I know is that I enjoyed reading this immensely. Once I started to read it, I couldn't put it down. I grew close to the characters, and when the end arrived, I felt relieved, satisfied, and sad all at the same time. The writing style is so clear and understandable, but at the same time it's all beautiful. This is a wonderful work of fiction - and I don't care about what the philosophy is. Even if someone's told you that Rand has strange beliefs, read this book. It doesn't have to be philosophy. This is fiction, and it's incredible.Happy reading."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"When I read Atlas Shrugged, I could not help feeling the novel was almost science fiction in its depiction of a world where capitalism is not allowed to flourish freely because the government tries to regulate it, and consequently, the intellectuals and inventors abandon the rest of society. And then, I read Ayn Rand's first novel, We The Living, and within the first few pages realized she was not only depicting the very world that would exist if the government controlled everything, but that such a world had existed in the Soviet Union, and she had been a first hand witness to it. Atlas Shrugged was less a fantasy than a nightmare she had already lived through without as successful an ending as her greatest novel.The novel begins at the end of the Russian Revolution and depicts the lives of several of the younger generation trying to survive in the increasingly communist world as the state squelches individual freedom more and more. Having myself grown up during the Cold War, I foudn the novel rang true to many of the stories I heard about life in the Soviet Union--people standing in line for hours for a little bit of food for example. What is amazing is that it was written by someone who actually lived through those experiences in the early 1920s in Russia.Ayn Rand states the novel is \\"as near to an autobiography as I will ever write. The plot is invented, the background is not. I was born in Russia, I was educated under the Soviets; I have seen the conditions of existence that I describe.\\" One wishes she had written more of an autobiography because she states the main character Kira's experiences are not her own, although her ideas and convictions are.The novel follows Kira as she attends the university where true learning is replaced by learning only about the state, communism and Marxist idealogies. Kira submits to this social pressure to survive and to help her family, but she cannot come to believe these ideologies. The living conditions of the novel are intolerable as people are crammed, entire families into one or two rooms of a compartment, as people must wear worn out clothes because there are non new, and worst of all, as people are unable to think or discuss anything except the socialist ideologies.Saddest of all is Kira's attempts to find love. Both men she becomes involved with are unable to stand on their own because they fear the state or try to work underground to make money to survive because they cannot feed themselves in a society that does not allow free enterprise. Kira finds herself caught between these two men as she tries to survive and help them. In the end, she can help no one except herself and she makes her decision to escape abroad. Most readers I think will be disappointed by the ending, and I think Rand could have provided a stronger one to affirm life, but the final pages are dramatic and suspenseful.The novel is not as pointed or as much of a page turner as Atlas Shrugged, but it makes one understand better the events that led Ayn Rand to develop her philosophy of objectivism. The reader is left wanting to know more about the history of the Russian Revolution and communism. The book reminds one of the more popular Dr. Zhivago, although it is questionable if that book is any more powerful. Most of all, one wants to learn more about Ayn Rand's personal life in Russia and how she escaped to America. I intend to read an autobiography of Ayn Rand next.- Tyler R. Tichelaar, author of Iron Pioneers and The Queen City, available on Amazon"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Among several circles of religious scholars and fundamentalists, Ayn Rand has been condemned for her philosophy of Objectivist Ethics on the basis that selfishness, in her terms, has been extolled as a virtue and that the essence of man is his rational, potential being. Since no references were made regarding a personal god, Rand and anything associated with her were thus branded by several clergymen as heretical. What is misunderstood is her application of the word selfishness, which is, in essence, the prerequisite to valuing the lives of others as well as understanding the pleasure and pain principles that underlie mankind's existence. Was Jesus, the epitome of virtue, not quoted as saying that we are to do unto others as we would have others do unto us?Though I am not a Randian and have several qualms about the contemporary postulates that Rand's intellectual heirs have placed in terms of how government and society should be run, I do find merits in the Objectivist Ethics that, in my opinion, have been well espoused by its founder, Ms. Ayn Rand.I will not go into the details of the characters in We the Living, but I do want to point out key themes that make this book worthwhile, but first, let me note that had it not been for the rise of Communist Russia, there would likely not have been Rand's Objectivist epistemologies. Instead, we would probably be stuck with the forerunners Locke and Nietzsche as guides or references for trying to formulate, with not so much success, a systematic, philosophical construct such as Rand's.In the story, pervasive is the disillusionment that seems to be both sweeping and seeping, though quietly, among those who have been told about a new and better tomorrow for Russia, which was under the rule of Lenin in 1922. Among the dumbfounded are those who made up what were once deemed as the bourgeoisie, namely middle and upper class merchants and professionals who are witnessing their personal and property rights being stripped by the new government officials in the name of equality throughout Mother Russia. Despite so-called aims to balance the scales among the classes, the average and poor citizens, who are supposed to be the benefactors of government change, are finding themselves less able to afford the basic necessities of food, shelter and clothing. With no clear solution before them, if they complain, then they will, at best, be promised, over and again, that progress will come and to be patient or, at worst, be condemned and tried as an enemy of the state.Reverberating within and around the continuous demands for Russia's people to be patient is the likely requirement that each individual renounce any claims or markers that once gave him or her any kind of personal distinction or unique identity. For instance, if your talents, be they technical, aesthetic or esoteric, did not fall in line with what was in accordance with the objectives of the new government, then you would have to disavow your uses of them or else suffer the consequences.Upon reflection, as a reader, such as myself, would continue to analyze, with the mind's eye, the day-to-day living, or dying, that would go on in 1920's Russia, the quote that the road to hell was paved with good intentions comes to thought.In We the Living, this hell is reflected by the challenges and obstacles that are placed before the protagonist, a young eighteen year-old woman named Kira. Kira is not the good person in the sense of moral purity, but she is a youth who wants to find her place in the world. She wants her own career, she wants to bond with the man of her choice, she wants to live in a home of her liking, and she wants to blaze her own trail, not one already prescribed or predetermined by others. And the longer Kira maintains those ideals, the more she is isolated as an enemy of the state, a totalitarian authority that will likely put to death those they perceive as threats, even if they are merely from a philosophical standpoint.In the starting pages, personalities and perceptions, at first, seem diverse, ranging from youthful idealism present in those who anticipate positive changes in Russia's government reforms to cynicism among those who are pessimistic about or are slow to change period. But as time passes, the frequency and intensity of totalitarian tones set forth by the communist government increase and ultimately result in a unifying mindset among virtually everyone, namely fear. This regression to such a primal state is gradual, and it is one of several elements that make We the Living great and seemingly realistic. It is not an engaging chapter-by-chapter sequence like Rand's nonfiction works, including The Virtue of Selfishness. However, it is a unique fictional, though nearly autobiographical (as Rand said it was), exposition of what happens when the wrong ideologies are institutionalized to set up and run a government or state.As Rand repeatedly published in her myriad volumes, to constantly ignore personal pursuits in the name of perceived morals could lead to improperly placing the fate of your well-being in the hands of others, as in the case of totalitarian regimes. Even the revered George Washington, himself, asserted that a good, effective government can only be established with the acknowledgement that men are more motivated by their self interests than they are by seemingly virtuous ideals. Throughout man's history, theocracies were doomed to failure for trying to do it the other way around. Even similar attempts but that would completely leave God out of the equation would create an establishment that would lead to the needless suffering of so many, such as the one Rand so effectively described in this early masterpiece of hers."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I am not an Ayn Rand fan. Yet, this novel cannot be ignored by those that are rational and honest.To me, every great author has a \\"signature novel.\\" (For example, \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is Hemingway's \\"signature novel.\\") This, to me, is Rand's \\"signature novel.\\"LOVERS OF SOCIALISM/COMMUNISM: Those that admire socialism/communism should read merely one portion of the Introduction to this splendid book. Rand wrote:'A young Russian had said to her [Any Rand] at a party in 1926, just before she [Any Rand] left for America: \\"When you get there, tell them that Russia is a huge cemetery and that we are all dying.\\"'That was in 1926, and little did anyone know that the situation in Russia/USSR would become far worse than a cemetery.Socialists, communists, collectivists that read this book will be challenged to defend their impeccably ludicrous, transparently preposterous belief-system. Will they admit it? No.\\"We The Living\\" is a powerful, bleak, grim tale of \\"Kira Argounova,\\" a young lady that wants to leave Russia. She faces one problem: It is illegal to leave Russia--so much so that it is punishable by death or a stint in the Gulag.Kira Argounova will use anyone and any method to leave. She is the hero. It is a book about escaping a terrible situation at any cost.This is Rand's most passionate, realistic and powerful novel. It is a masterpiece for those of us that have studied the history of the Soviet Union and have observed the abject repression--\\"repression\\" is a mild word for it--of those who suffered under Lenin, Stalin (who was born Iosef Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili and changed his name to Stalin, meaning, literally, \\"made of steel\\"--a title that fit him well), and others.This is her masterpiece.This is the book that will be remembered far, far after her other works are forgotten.I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"The two stars I give this book are for the extraordinary writing of Ayn Rand. I give her zero for creating such a predatory, egomaniacal heroine as Kira Argounova. Although she cloaks herself in lofty philosophical armor, she's no different than the scrungy females you see on Jerry Springer or Ricki Lake--all they want is &quot;their man.&quot; Kira destroys the only noble character in the book: her admirer/lover Andrei. She uses him ruthlessly to help save her sleazy, hoodlum boyfriend, Leo when he needs expensive treatment at a TB sanatorium. What she really wants is Leo's majestic body. Although he's as hard and indifferent as a robot, this is the man Kira gives us everything for. What's really disturbing is that Rand harps continuously about how one should never hold up anything higher than one's ego. Yet, she becomes the common street woman who wants to get this particular man in bed. So much for Kira's noble aspirations. Andrei was the only decent person in this book--besides Irina, Kira's cousin, and Irina's lover, Sasha, both who ended up in a concentration camp to die. When Kira is killed at the end, there was no sorrow from this reader. For someone who betrayed ,leeched and destroyed Andrei, the most admirable of any of her characters, her death was deserved."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"In the early days after the Russian Revolution, one might have easily slipped into the false idea that communism was a passing fad and life would soon return to normalcy. This is the backdrop for the masterful novel by Ayn Rand which follows three young adults as they learn about themselves and the ways of the embryonic communist government. \\"We the Living\\" is a world loosely held together, but which never seems to completely fall apart.Rand places much of the focus of \\"We the Living\\" on Kira, whom the author has suggested possesses many characteristics of herself. Kira's physical appearance is given an unflattering description in the initial pages, but which evolves positively as the story progresses. Kira can be described as an idealist, formerly of the wealth of a bourgeois family. But as many her age in all times and places do, she is searching for something. Leo is haunted by the death communism caused his father and begins to openly seek to sabotage the system. The only strand that seems to prevent recklessness is his bond with Kira. Andrei, although a communist, struggles with his beliefs in the face of the burgeoning love triangle. Perhaps Andrei is the most tragic character in the book.While Kira seems to have chosen Leo early in the novel, the realtionship is built on unstable ground. Circumstances lead Kira back to Andrei, causing an already confused woman to further question her direction. While the story digresses into some slower moving points, it is emblematic of the stereotypical image Westerners have of a depressed life in the Soviet Union. As one may expect, the ending reflects the stereotype. While the ending may be somewhat expected, readers are still eager in their anticipation.Though the pacing of \\"We the Living\\" seems uneven at times, the critical points in the plot make the novel tough to discontinue reading. Rand is masterful at putting an image to the faceless phenomenon of socialism."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This is another one I read when I was in high school. A teacher recommended it to me, &amp; I will be forever grateful for that. I'm not a real fan of Rand's other works but this one is stunning. There are parts of it that stay with me every day. The struggles of all the young people in it against a heartless crushing bureaucracy become even more resonant as I get older. And there is one small section, where one character watches the love of his life disappear on another train as they're separated &amp; sent to different parts of Siberia, that I challenge you to read without tears. That section alone makes the book worth it--I've never forgotten those few paragraphs &amp; never will."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"My copy of \\"We the Living\\" says that it's as near to an autobiography as Ayn Rand will ever write. She grew up in Russia during the revolution. It saddens me that countries with such amazing resources would have revolutions that didn't end as favorably as America's. We have the Declaration of Independence and the same philosophies as guided our nation's founders to fall back on. Russia had bread lines and a failed philosophy that still lives on.The book takes place in Russia five years into the Bolshevik revolution and we watch as a bourgeois family is pitted against tidal waves of bolshevism. The party's ideologies are so indoctrinated that people may start believing them. But Kira and Leo never will fall for it. Their lives are tried and hemmed in on all sides. What COURAGE! It is a compelling love story, but not just love between consenting adults, but love for freedom, love for individualism.Along with \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", this is an important book for any who wants to see where socialism inevitably leads. Save America!"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This was one of the most amazing books I've ever read. Tragic, uplifting and defiant Ayn Rand's unique philosophy comes through in its infant form. A must read for all would be objectivists."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"A page-turner and tear-jerker that conveys the immense strength of will of one woman struggling to live a human life, and who falls in love, while under a totalitarian dictatorship. Whatever happens to Kira, her spirit remains uncompromised. An intense early treatment of Ayn Rand's theme of individualism vs. collectivism examined more thoroughly (among other themes) in her later brilliant works."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"We the Living is a novel that examines the problems of Communism and its ideals, as well as illustrating the people whose lives are impacted by it. It is not only about Communism, however, but also about the fight of the individual against oppression and their struggle for freedom; a common theme in Ayn Rand's books and a core part of her philosophy, Objectivism.I would definitely recommend this book, although not as enthusiastically as Ayn Rand's other novels like The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. We the Living is certainly a good book to reach for if you are looking for an entertaining, thought-provoking novel."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Probably one of the greatest books of the twentieth century, Ayn Rand's &quot;We the Living&quot; is a non-stop course in the early history of society in Soviet Russia. I was extremely thrilled with this novel both in writing and plot. The story is semi-autobigraphical combined with dramatization of the mass sentiment. Rand presents characters the reader can almost feel. Without a doubt the novel exuded depressing elements, but even at it's conclusion you feel a sense of relief. &quot;We the Living&quot; is an easy read, and no matter what your taste you will be glad you read this book."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"We the Living is a great book and by far Ayn Rand's best. She wrote it before the Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged and before she started seeing evil everywhere. The book works because of its context which is Soviet Russia and Rand shows convincingly how communism is destructive of anything valuable. It is not as well crafted as later novels but at least in this case, she's on solid ground and not trying to be a know-it-all."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I've read three of Rand's books and this is by far the best, not because it's the shortest. In &quot;We the Living&quot;, you definitely get a more personal view from the auther. This book is about Kira, a young woman from a once majestic and respected family who returns from spending the more violent part of the Russian revolution in a smaller, less affected town, to find St. Petersburg destroyed. She and her family have to struggle just to survive as Communism becomes vile and corrupted. Later, she must choose between her family and her lover, Leo because of political differences, but when Leo catches tuberculosis, Kira must do things that would make anyone sick. She gives up all her dreams of education and of a suuccessful future, puyting everything she has into escaping the oppresive communists and their tyranny at the end. This is definitely not a light read, but it is a book I would recommend to anyone if you want a painful, but realistic version of the triumphs and tragedies of life itself."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I read ATLAS SHRUGGED several years ago in 2004 and I had just finished THE FOUNTAINHEAD right before I started WE THE LIVING. That said, I was gripped up until the very end of WTL by the vivid descriptions of life in Russia during the post revolutionary period of the 1920's. Even if you dislike Rand and her philosphy you will like WTL as a great novel."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"There is so much talk about Atlas Shrugged lately so that will be the next book I will read. However some reviewers recommended this book to \\"get your feet wet\\" on Rand's ideas, and, at 400+ pages, it is more manageable than Atlas. It took me a while to get into the book due to lack of time and the fact that the life portrayed is quite depressing. After about 200 pages though I finished quickly. I got to know the characters and started caring about their fates. It's an amazing portrait of what happens when an all powerful government tries to destroy individualism. Each character reacts differently to this destruction-of-self, but it has a healthy effect on no one. Some embrace the collectivist mentality, some play act to fit in, some rebel in subtle ways, some scam the system, some go underground and join the black market, some plot a counter revolution, some accept their fate with hopelessness.As I read the book, it was also depressing to realize that \\"it could happen here\\". Energy rationing via cap and trade, enviro-nazi regulations, NIMBY policies for energy production, high prices, CO2 limitations, \\"smart\\" grid, computerized electric meters, etc., etc. Medical care rationing including life and death decisions via government-run health care. The end of private property as, post Kelo, the government absconds with property will nilly. Thought control via hate crime legislation, speech codes, frivolous lawsuits against those with non PC opinions, fairness doctrine renewal, etc. Making everyone dependent on the government for everything via nanny statism legislation, high taxation, nationalization of industries, destruction of personal worth via recessionary and hyperinflative monetary policies.In the book, Timshenko (I think) said that thousands of brave, noble men died so that a million bureaucrats could live well. Well that's pretty much what is happening here. It just took us a lot longer to reach this sorry state. After all, a communist is just a socialist in a hurry.I say 4 stars as it is better than average fiction, but it's not Shakespeare. By the way, did I mention that it was really depressing?"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I have read this, Atlas shrugged and the Fountain head. I love all. Brilliant - compeling entertaing and engrossing. Rands novels have not only stood \\"test of time\\", they could not be mroe relevant for readers today.Read for yourself, Think for yourself, decide for yourself...You don't have to like it, But-if you experience and read for yourself the opinion will be formed honestly... It will be your own opinion. My biggest fear is the hightened interest in these consistanly popular novels and Author will bing on media attacks and attempts to discredit."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This is the first Ayn Rand book I have ever read. Its length wasn't nearly as intimidating as ATALS SHRUGGED, however once I started reading it the subject matter made me re-think whether or not I wanted to read through this. The depth of political and philosophical issues made me wonder if I had the energy to withstand something of this magnitude. As it was I did have to take a break from reading it half-way through the book. Rand, herself, admits that this is closely autobiographical, yet it is written so that you keep rooting for the good guy hoping that they come out on top in the end, but as Communism kept a firm grasp on the USSR for decades we know that there is little chance that the oppressed citizens are going to find themselves living comfortably in the end. After reading this though, one can understand why Rand promoted the philosophy that she did and championed THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS. Once forced to think about everyone but ones self, a person eventually begins to think only of herself. Politically, socially, psychologically or otherwise people cannot live without balance and by forcing its citizens to live for the collective the Communist party eventually forced them to live for themselves, even unto death.The writing was descriptive making the realness of Communism more than just history and illuminates just how twisted their campaign became. The revolt that led to the Communist inception was noble indeed, but as the years past it can be seen how fear led them to the same lengths of control that they had previously accused the Czar of perpetrating. Having read 1984 and ANIMAL FARM by George Orwell I found this to be much scarier as not only did this narration depict parts of the Orwellian books that had already played out in Communist Russia it also foreshadowed ideas that are seemingly materializing in the United States; the idea that people were afraid to have their own thoughts, among them.There were parts of the story that I bristled at. Particularly, Kira's continued devotion to Leo even in the wake of his disrespectful treatment of her. I don't understand how she had the courage to not get married, yet didn't have a problem with his shabby treatment of her. This personal dynamic detracted from her initial desire to be an individual. She wanted to be an engineer, but when that possibility was taken from her she lived for Leo rather than for herself. Victor was, also, a considerable thorn. Part of a classified bourgeois family who find difficulty in acclimating to the new political environment Victor threw his self heart and soul into being accepted by the proletariat to the point of betraying his family. Devotion to one's political convictions should not preclude the protection of one's relatives.Though it took me a couple of months to read, as it forces the reader to think, I would encourage people to read it. We live in a society that largely over-estimates the abilities of the government and this book shows what can happen when the government is completely in control."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This is another one I read when I was in high school.

The characters were intriguing as well. For those of you who aren't Ayn Rand readers, this book is completely unlike her others. The one quarrel I have with the book is its depression factor. Perhaps I become too emotional while reading, but this book really sank in and had a high sadness factor. Yet, overall, it is a must-read!"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I read &quot;We the Living&quot; a couple of months after reading &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; and &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; in that order. I was more than pleasantly surprised that the author started her writing career with the best book of them all. The objectivists hype &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; like its a bible which must be read to understand their philosophy. They should concentrate on promoting this book instead.Some reviewers from the &quot;Left Coast&quot; have assailed the book for its attack on Communism and total lack of objectivity. This is totally missing the point. It is not Communism that is on trial - it is any political philosophy forced upon the masses in an attempt to subvert individual will to the will and greed of those who have but only &quot;The deepest concern for his fellow brothers&quot; that is under attack here. When I grew up in the 60's and 70's many on the left stated that the USSR would make Marx twirl in his grave. The point is clearly made in the book that what starts off as good ideas and good intentions are eventually corrupted by those who know how to take advantage of the system and that everyone - sincere followers, those who dare to take a stand and those who just simply try to get on with their lives, are the eventual victims.The ending of the novel left me emotionally drained, and very moved. If you are to read only one Ayn Rand novel, this should be it!"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"First, a disclaimer: I am not a member of the cult of Ayn Rand. This is the first book I've read by her. I did not read it because I believe in Objectivism already, or am attracted to its tenets, with which I am completely unfamiliar. All I know of her, and that knowledge is dubious, is that she is the darling of many (what I would call) fundamentalist capitalists. I was looking for a good novel, knew that she was both reviled and adored, and figured it would be interesting reading, at least. For the record, most would call me a liberal.I was blown away. I'm still not looking to join the cult, mind you, but I will read other books by her because this one showed evidence of a warm heart, an uncompromising intellect, and a fever for living well. Ideology was not permitted to run roughshod over plot or character. It's an astonishingly accomplished first novel, and ought to be a candidate for every serious book club and every list of great books.Rand draws her characters clearly and with complexity. While she is a bit romantic, even her simpler characters, such as the lickspittle, Victor, are developed in such a way that the reader must ask difficult questions about who he is, why he is that way, and would we be different under the same constraints. Kira, the central figure, is sympathetic, tragic, heroic, and admirable - but also a conundrum. Given who she is, why does she do the things she does? Why the compromises? Are they compromises? What of the archetypal Party man, Andrei? Is he a tragic or romantic hero? Is he a naive tool? Is he redeemed, or is his naivete merely exposed? Rand crafts a story that raises questions that have no easy, vapid answers but that demand discussion.For those who think of Rand as the patron saint of Gordon Gecko, of greed and looking out for number one - which is the vague impression I've had of her - the characters who are most narcissistic, most self-aggrandizing, are also the most contemptible. And the hero lives a life of selfless love, with disciplined passion and a dreams deferred. This is not a book to avoid because of preconceived notions about Rand and her ideology.The book raises many ethical and political issues, but I didn't leave with the sense that the conclusions were foregone. She talks about the corruption of a well-intended revolution, and while it applies particularly to Soviet Communism in these pages, I take it that it could as easily apply to any ideology - political, economic, religious, whatever - that fails to serve the people it promises to serve. There is clearly a passion in favor of letting the gifted be gifted, but there are nasty aristocrats and noble peasants, both, here. There's no aristocrats good, peasants bad theme operating here. I see respect for the good, whether they be rich or poor, and derision for those without dreams or nobility. As a bumper sticker says, those who have smothered their own dreams will smother yours. It becomes their job.In 21st century America, where ideologies are ossified, partisans are blindly simplistic, and we have few, if any, bridge-builders, We the Living is a compelling call to remember that our dreams have a claim on us that we dismiss at the cost of lives worth living. What are our dreams, and what comforts or phantasms have we traded them for? I don't think Rand wants us to sleep easily after asking these questions."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I first read \\"We the living\\" as a young teenager in 1975. This book floored me as most of my family and friends were communists and i was very influenced by them. Reading the book changed my views and i was dismayed to discover the brutality of the soviet regime. I am now older and wiser and have two children and five grandchildren and have rediscovered Ayn Rand. What an amazing woman she was. I wish everyone would read her books. If she had stayed in Russia they would have destroyed her and we would have been denied the pleasure of reading her books. God bless America where she was allowed her freedom. A truely remarkable lady."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"In her self-proclaimed near-autobiography, Ayn Rand writes of the tumultuous time after Russia's fall to Soviet rule through the lives of a few individuals stuck in it. The descriptions of daily life, the frustrations of everything from heating to food to dealing with corrupt bureaucracy, give a realism to the time period and conditions that aren't so easily conveyed in history texts. While people tend towards caricatures, as can be typical in Rand's work, the core of humanity within them, both high and low points, clearly shine through.It's a love story gone all wrong as Kira, the young woman who wishes to design bridges but won't ever achieve that goal under the red boot of socialism, watches the man she loves succumb to the dehumanizing effects of the system which surrounds and controls them. Other characters, friends and relatives of the main characters give the story a great deal of depth.This book does not fall prey to the excess wordiness that Atlas Shrugged did. There are not redundant speeches which take up dozens of pages. I'd not re-read this book without a box of tissues handy. Whether or not you tend to agree with Rand, this is an excellent book which gives a deeper understanding to a particularly unique and dark period in history."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"\\"What's a citizen? Only a brick and of no use unless cemented to other bricks just like it\\"? As one character lectures another herein: \\"why do you think you are entitled to your own thoughts...against those of the majority of the Collective?\\" After all, as a Bolshevik explains, \\"...no external enemy...is as dangerous to us as the internal enemy of dissension within our own ranks. Hence we read this on the book's jacket: \\"We the Living demonstrates the supreme value of a human life and the evil of those who claim the right to sacrifice it.\\" There's your life. You begin it feeling that it's something so precious & rare, so beautiful that it's like a sacred treasure.\\" But \\"one man means nothing in the face of the mighty Proletarian Collective,\\" the Bolsheviks counter. In such an environment, Kira, the heroine of this 1936 novel (Ayn Rand's first) subsequently concludes: \\"Nothing matters. We mustn't think. We mustn't think at all.\\" To a Bolshevik she charges, \\"you came and forbade life [as in freedom of choice] to the living.\\" \\"You took their every hour, every minute, every nerve, every thought in the farthest corners of their souls---and you told them what it had to be;\\" \\"telling men \\"what they must live for.\\" This after we see how a number of characters lose their jobs, or get thrown out of university \\"for trying to think\\" for themselves. This is life in the Soviet Union as personally experienced by Ayn Rand (a nom de plume the Russian author invented to protect family members still living in Leningrad at the time). She saw firsthand how Bolshevism went about putting down new rules, fashioning a state that took \\"your honor, your life and your freedom.\\" And while this isn't Ms. Rand's life story, it is, as the author states in the introduction, a sort of autobiography, in the intellectual sense; having instilled Kira with the author's \\"ideas, her convictions, her values.\\" And while the \\"plot is invented,\\" the author admits, \\"the background is not.\\" And the \\"Sovietness\\" of said background is not the paramount issue herein either, but the notion that, notwithstanding any utopian rhetoric, \\"you cannot enslave man's mind. \\"You can only destroy it.\\" In a collectivist society, \\"what are your masses but millions of dull, shrivelled, stagnant souls that have no thoughts of their own, no dreams of their own, no will of their own.\\" Ms. Rand's work is, in short, a powerfully written expose of collectivist mentalities; a warning that \\"you cannot castigate life \\"in order to perpetuate it.\\" PS: There's an Italian-made film, very faithfull to this book---the only film ever made based on this novel---which is well worth viewing. It's available from Amazon (or perhaps through your local library). (06May) Cheers!"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I finished reading this book two nights ago, and still it feels like a gaping hole has been torn into my soul. Rand's writing is so powerful, I feel I must recover from this book as if it were me that lived the events she described.Read this book, not for likable characters or a feel-good ending - but for the way Rand will move you both emotionally and intellectually as you try to reconcile the events and characters of this book."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I read this book when i was so very young (19), and after reading The Fountainhead, Atlas Shrugged and Anthem, which i loved. i was astounded by this book and moved beyond belief. I found the writing much different than her other books, and much more fictionalized. amazing considering that english was not her first language and this was one of her earliest works. the story is highly romanticized, yet even with that, i found my heart beating strongly and my anxiety level so high as i lived through that hideous life in communist russia. and the scene when Irina is sentenced to (as i recall) siberia, and leaves on a train while her husbands struggles to keep her in sight, to keep a piece of her clothing in his sight as long as he can --- how can anyone read that and not practically fall to their knees in grief and anguish for this young couple who are so cruelly separated? i will not do a spoiler here about the end, but there were times when i wanted to slap kira and wake her up to the truth of her two lovers. yet, it plays out as it must. and it is a beautiful novel. many reviewers here refer to it as bleak; i do not find it so. i found it romantic, terrifying, tragic, and beautiful. i loved fountainhead and atlas in a different way. this book was so steeped in romantic language and story that one could swoon from it. there is not a page that i found superfluous and to this day i can remember savoring every word of that book (and that was 50 years ago!). whether or not you are a fan of ayn rand, this is a story and a book worth your time. it broke my heart. (and i find it offensive that the book is listed by Ayn Rand AND Leonard Peikoff who had nothing whatsoever to do with this book and didn't even know her when it was written. shame on him for sticking his name on everything published by her, even if he is the trustee for her estate. he knows only too well, that it is only because he was the only one left in the group that she felt she could trust. had Nathanial or Barbara Brandon still been in her good graces when she died, it certainly would have been them to whom she left her estate. but aside from that, how can he sleep at night, having slapped his name on everything she has written! shame! shame! shame!)"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This is an amazing and completely heart wrenching first novel of Ayn Rand and to me, her best, as it not only captured the destructive effects of collectivism but also the emergence of Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism. Set in post-Russian Revolution, We the Living portrayed the chaotic uncertainty and political changes that robbed many Russians of their rights as individuals.As Ayn Rand experienced life under communist tyranny firsthand, she breathed life into the three main characters and slowly unraveled a moving story as their lives became intertwined. Kira was an independent spirit as she refused to succumb to the brutal regime and its suffocation of her individuality. She represented the epitome of all young innocent idealists. Leo, her one true love, another character we all have ran into our life, handsome, dashing, and yet completely unreconciled. He took Kira's unconditional love for granted as she helplessly trying to save his spiraling descent into bitterness and anger. He was targeted as an enemy of the state due to his post-status of Bourgeoisie as the new regime completely pummeled his rational consciousness. Finally, Andrei, an officer of the Soviet Secret police whose idealism was also completely shattered when he questioned the underlying fallacy of Communism. The love triangle of Kira, Andrei and Leo was completely entrenched with a sadness that paralleled the realities of an affair, in this case, not just of the heart but of the battle of \\"the individual against the state\\" also. However, I do find Kira hiding behind her convictions, and somehow justified her abuse and maltreatment to Andrei disturbing. I suppose if you totally believe in objectivism, for her it is justified. My heart definitely goes out to Andrei, the only decent characters who was true to his heart until the end, even if his beliefs change over the time period, he still stayed true to his moral ethics.This novel was not well received at first due to its controversial nature and had a hard time getting published in the 30's. It wasn't until after the success of \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" that Ayn Rand managed to get this book more widely accepted. We the Living successfully denounced not just Communism, but of every entity that claims the right to sacrifice the supreme value of an individual human right or life. There is no book out there that fully captures how bad it was when communism massacred the spirits of the people. She managed to portrayed \\"the absolute concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.\\" (Objectivism) in a novel form. Indeed, this book will resonate and haunt for the rest of the reader's life"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This book was unlike her later books. It's more of a look at actual history and the effects of an actual change in government. There were many here in the US who have wanted to duplicate Russia and change our government to Marxism. They came here soon after the fall of Russia, in the very early 1900s. They called themselves \\"Marxists\\" which didn't go over well. They then stole the term \\"Progressives\\" from the conservatives and are once again using that term. Today, they have finally come into power in our current congress (Pelosi) and the puppet masters pulling their strings such as George Soros & International Answer.Another book that most haven't read is her first book. It rates a VERY high recommendation and is again much unlike her other books. \\"Anthem\\". I believe this was Ayn's 2nd book and the only one of this type she wrote.I couldn't help but think that it inspired \\"1984\\" and \\"Planet of the Apes\\". It was a short, quick read that was entertaining and thought provoking. Like all her books, it doesn't compare two shades of gray, but black & white. I've long used this technique in analyzing questions relating to physics, geometry, math & life."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Unlike Rand's other novels--supporters will be hard-pressed to state that she is a butle writer--We the Living is a historical snapshot, a supposedly semi-autobiographical novel that does wonders for evoking a specific time period. The characters are beautiful, colorful, and interesting, even against the backdrop of one of the most colorless regimes in modern history. There's no six-page diatribes or harsh anti-religios fervor in this novel, which is surprising given the nature of both The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. On the first level, this is a solid novel, written with suspence and surprise, genuine plot-driven episodes and (to use a trite phrase) a great way to capture the imagination of the reader."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"This book was pretty good, but nothing outstanding. One thing I liked about it was that the amount of philosophy you had to plow through in order to get the point was pretty minimal compared to The Fountainhead. The story made for interesting reading. One thing I do not feel is true, though, is that it is a truly accurate picture of the inside of Communist Russia. I think that One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, Doctor Zhivago, and Red Army Stories are all better. They seem to be a little more brutal, but one of the key things is that the protagonist is not the only good guy. In the other books the protagonist usually runs across at least one somewhat inspiring character who is surviving within the system and perhaps even making it work. I just feel these novels represent a more accurate portrayal of what went on in Communist Russia than what Rand shows the reader. One final note: (This applies in The Fountainhead as well as Anthem, but it is not quite as important, as the endings in those books are somewhat if not completely predictable.) DO NOT READ THE PLEIKOFF INTRODUCTION AS IT WILL COMPLETELY GIVE AWAY THE ENDING!!!!"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I thought this was an excellent novel. If you have issues with Rand's political ideology (I certainly tend to disagree with her) there is still much to enjoy about this novel. Don't prejudge the novel and decide not to read it because you dislike Rand. The story is genuinely moving and the characters, particularly the main character, are well drawn. I understood why she felt the way she did, and why she made the choices she did. Rand created some very evocative images in the novel -- I felt like I was there. I got totally pulled into the story. I can't say that the picture of Communist Russia at that time is particularly accurate or not, as I don't have enough knowledge on the subject to comment on that. I read the book because I was interested in the story, and the characters, not the politics. It does, however, raise some good, thought provoking questions about the dangers of totalitarianism. Thus, I can reccommend the book on two levels -- it will satisfy readers who just love a good story, and those who are interested in politcal systems and political ideology. The book might be hard to track down, but it will be worth the effort."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I am seventeen and I have never read a book like this one . I was profoundly affected and I believe anyone who reads this book will be , too . Kira is an unbelievable character . Her story is poignant and real . The book is real . There are no mushy fake scenes of perfect love or happy endings . Life isn't that way and niether is this book."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"We the Living is Ayn Rand at her greatest. Her phenomenal writing talent moves the story along at a fascinating pace. The characters are totally believable. They don't become the non-human symbols of people which populate her other two masterpieces (although they're all fascinating, you can't relate to them on a human level). She manages to interweave her philosophy in bits and pieces, rather than the page-after-page rants in Atlas Shrugged. Kira, though, is a frustrating heroine to admire. While she treats Andrei like crap, she pours her life into Leo, a fascinating but brutal hero. Also, if a basic tenent of her philosophy is self-reliance, of holding no one higher than one self, one wonders why Kira becomes dependent on Leo, and sacrifices so much for him. In re-reading this masterpiece again and again, I kept thinking of how Rand was using Greta Garbo as her heroine. Also, the Italian movie made of &quot;We the Living&quot; is an absolute must-see for any admirer of this book. It runs over 3 hours and is amazingly faithful to the book. To think that this film was made in Italy and not in Russia is a shock. And to think it was made right at the height of World War II, with bombs exploding all over the place, makes it even more extraordinary."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I am a big, big fan of Ayn Rand. While I doubt few people agree with 100% of Randological thought and reason (she was very eclectic in terms of her system of belief), I tend to agree with her far more than disagree. Personally, I started with \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", which is considered her masterpiece; then moved onto \\"The Fountainhead\\"; and most recently \\"We the Living\\". Quite by accident, I read these books in reverse order in the way she wrote them. As such, it has been interesting to see how Rand's thought process, beliefs, and writing style evolved over time.\\"We the Living\\", while certainly not to the scale or quality of \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", is nonetheless a very informative and enjoyable book. Mainly, it informed me about Rand herself. While this is not a direct autobiography of Rand in her Russia years, by her own account, it is the most autobiographical of all her works, and many points of the book can directly be reflected in her own life. For example, Kira's family was a bourgeoisie class business owner, as was the case of Rand herself. The bourgeoisie class became repressed and looked down upon by the leadership of the proletariat or working classes in the early days of the Soviet Union. It is these type of dynamics that are represented so well in this book, and the reader comes away feeling informed about the early beliefs and failings of the Soviet system in the immediate aftermath of the civil war there.If you are a Rand fan, this is a must read. If you are unfamiliar with Rand, I suggest starting with \\"The Fountainhead\\", then \\"We the Living\\", and finishing with \\"Atlas Shrugged\\". Of course, there are many more Rand works to read and enjoy as well."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"If you only can or only want to read one Ayn Rand book, read \\"We the Living.\\" Unlike \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" and \\"The Fountainhead,\\" \\"We the Living\\" never feels bloated lengthy sermons or superfluous detail. Readers of Rand will recognize characters from her other works in this book, but here she did it best and she did it first. Emotionally this is her most moving piece. More is explored and communicated in the 450 pages of this book than in her 1100 page behemoth \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\" If you think Ayn Rand can't write compelling fiction, read this book. It will change your mind (it did mine). If you enjoy good literature, read this book."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"** spoiler alert ** I was drawn into the miserable life of Kira and her family in Soviet Russia and my heart went for them. The filth, the hunger and the frustration against the new government's \\"social\\" policy.I love the philosophical debate in Rand's books. I really enjoy books in which I need to stop and think about what I read and how the story is entwined with my own life - for better or for worse.However, I was greatly disappointed that strong willed Kira, who risked her life for her ideals would become a doormat to her vain and ungrateful lover.Obviously, I was engrossed by the book, hence my anger towards its main protagonist [a fictional character] but I believe that the way the story ends doesn't serve the idea behind it.I know that in real life idealism may not work out and it doesn't mean that one must abandon one's ideals because of that. But it was frustrating that she eventually lost her life, not to her ideals, not to the cause - but due to her unwise choice of lovers."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I must be the strangest 18-year old on earth.

It clearly and explicitly depicts what a totalitarian government does to people and their spirits - and to the most basic instinct - love. I couldn't put it down, so much did I want things to work out for any of these people. What tragic lives all those Russians lived during those days and until, honestly, Ronald Reagan. Everyone should read this book NOW to find out where we are headed unless things change and we remember OUR revolution and what it stood for."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Red this book if you respect the right of the individual, of the right of all human beings to be free. Free to choose their way of living, of existing. This book will remind us all in a free society how precious this freedom is. You will feel for the main characters in this book and cry at the tragedies that befall them. A masterpiece."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"It seems as though everyone has their own view of Ayn Rand's work; some agree with every point she makes to the point of obsession, some think that she is a terrible writer and philosopher and should not be published. She is definately a controversial writer. However, this book is different from pretty much all of her other work in that it concentrates more on the story than anything else. It was written before Rand's philosophy was completely forulated, which is definately a good thing in my opinion. The reader doesn't have to worry about agreeing completely with parts of the book and being repulsed by other aspects; it isn't a philosophical novel.The fact that this is a love story and that I (who hates most &quot;love&quot; stories and wanted the butler to catch that stupid couple in Titanic) really enjoyed reading it speaks volumes. It takes an inquisitive look at the nature of love and how it works... and is usually extremely true when applied to real life (unlike some parts of her &quot;masterpieces&quot; The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged). The characters are extremely real and the setting is based on Rand's past experiences, which really adds to her work. Don't worry... although there are your typical speeches at the end by the antagonists and protagonists, they are not rants about how great capitalism is and how it is the best thing in the world to be selfish. The theme is totalitarianism and what it does to the human spirit, not &quot;Prime Movers and how they function.&quot;I would reccomend this book to anyone interested, not just the people obsessed with Objectivism. Of course, this is Rand's least-known book, so the general public will probably get their first taste of her through The Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged, which is a shame. When she's at her best, Ayn Rand doesn't have to resort to rants that are in essence, a giant overreaction to things."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Ayn Rand created a beautiful expression here. Personally, I've never known her better, than at 2:00 AM last evening when I finshed this work. I've been a big fan of Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead, admittedly full of obvious characters and grueling tirades. Subtlety is not always the benchmark by which I judge a book. So for that difference, I've loved these books, where many experienced readers have felt a nauseating boredom. &quot;We the living&quot; is just a fantastic expression of a talented and driven young woman (Ayn Rand). I think the average reader will really enjoy it."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was 12. I loved it then and didn't fully comprehend it. I love it now more. People seem to misunderstand the purpose of this book and Ayn Rand herself. She didn't misunderstand socialism and communism, she lived through it. We the Living was written about the time period and the events one who lived it saw and experienced. It was a dark and brooding work, but more realistic than anything else of what living under such a regime was like than anything else you can find."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"I really enjoyed this novel becuase it dealt with something that the author never mentioned in her later two novels: war. It is a heartbreaking tale of totalitarianism and very readable. Since this is apparently a novelization of her life, it made the story even more compelling. One of the interesting things about this book that makes it different from 'Atlas Shrugged' and 'The Fountainhead' is that it seems written in a wholly different style, which is very stimulating. The reader from Los Angeles is correct in that this book does not contain a point by point refutation of Marx' dialectical materialism. Whereas that would come under the purview of theory, Rand chooses to chronicle the practice (of course, the argument is that it was not applied correctly, yet any capitalist will tell you that the United States of America has not had the ideas of the free-market applied correctly for most of this century, due to elements of socialism creeping in here and there). For a critique of the theory of dialectical Marxism I would suggest von Mises' &quot;Theory and History.&quot;"},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"Have read this three or four times and have never tired.

You don' get the sometimes annoying 1 page monologues from characters that you see in &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; and in &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;.However, there are some serious problems with the plot. For instance, about 1/3 of the way through the book we find out that Kira, Leo, and her family all make it on the Purge list and will be kicked out of Petrograd. And then...absolutely nothing happens from it!!! It's never mentioned again. Another problem is the constant vascillation of Andrei. It seems he goes from bad to good and back again just to keep the plot moving. And what about Maurissa? Kira and Leo can't stand her as their neighbor and then all of the sudden their best friends.This is a pretty good book but points to the inevitable fact that Ayn Rand can not be considered a great wirter of fiction. Her books are merely allegorical attempts (successful ones, I may add) at encapsulating her Objectivist philosophy into an easily digestible form for the reader."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"For those of you who excroriate Rand for one-sided hatred of Communism, let me just point out that she was born under it, and she ought to know. The first hundred pages of this book are the best thing Rand ever wrote --complicated characters, and a vivid, chilling depiction of life under the Bolsheviks. Of course, then Rand the proselytizer elbows her way in, and it's downhill from there. One can forgive Rand for hating Communism, but to go a mile in the opposite direction and espouse such a brutal solipsism is perhaps a sign of some psychological problems on her part. What would the world be like if everyone were to declare himself a monomaniacal Dr. Doom surrounded by foolish mortals? Brilliant she may have been, but, unfortunately, also totally nuts."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"We The Living is a masterfully crafted tragedy recounting the life of Kira Argounova. Kira, born at the revolutionary dawn of the Soviet Union, is continually alone. Likewise she is doomed to live and die in a dismally solitary existence made even more lonesome by the presence of two men. One is Leo a former aristocrat-turned-dishonest and the other is Andrei the Communist. The men could not be any more disparate in their inadequacies, feelings and ideology. And yet they share Kira, which is a common theme for Ayn Rand: the book's hero(ine) is simultaneously involved with more than one lover . Notwithstanding that, as the protagonists, Kira and Leo are graceful, agile and sharp.The setting is an abusive state which believes its contribution to its citizens and the world so great as to exceed any kind of justification.Well-written and eloquent, Kira is exaggerated and yet thankfully disruptive. Romantic and tragic twists and turns follow, but Kira's character is always as dismal and wretched as the book. In this context it is remarkable how Kira unselfishly serves Leo while Ayn Rand goes on to make a career as the advocate for the mantra of narcissism.Despite Rand's protestations, We The Living is about the Soviet Union - one tainted by her personal outlook. While her Objectivist philosophy has not been fully developed here, it exists at the underlying and subconscious level. Which explains why We The Living remains as Rand's most explicitly political novel. Of course, with passion and resolve running through her, she never paused to consider how the USSR is not what Marx had in mind. Which is just as well, because as noted We The Living lives off the author's unbridled commitment to her conviction. For Rand's world is ultimately made only of two shades, Soviet red and Capitalist eden.\\"Comrade burglars, please don't bother.

I promised a friend I would finish the book so we shall see."},{"Title":"We the Living","review":"There is much to be admired in the writings of Ayn Rand. Objectivist thinking is sadly missing from a world now dominated by postmodern ideas, and Rand offers a viable counter-thesis to the misguided notions of the subjectivism of our day.American thought was once anchored in a search for objective truth, but is now ruled by a belief in the ABSENCE of objective truth. In We The Living, Rand poignantly depicts the end of the path we are following - and it is not pretty.In spite of the vigor of her objectivism, it is wrongly grounded in faith in individual humans rather than in the designs of the Creator. Worked out to its own ends, objective individualism (Rand's philosophy) leads to the very same desperate wickedness as subjective, collectivism (the Soviet experiment). Rand did not bother herself with this problem, however, because she was satisfied that the &quot;fittest&quot; among us would ultimately achieve theri own happiness - and to hell with everyone else.But even in her own story, we find that such an outlook leads to destruction - not only of society, but of self. Each of hero(-ines) - Kira, Leo, and Andrei, meets an unsavory end no better, and perhaps worse, than those whom she despises.While she accurately portrays the depravity and stench of the lives of so many of her villains, she unjustly vilifies the true heroes of the novel, Irina and Sasha, for clinging to their faith in God. When I read this book, I was an agnostic and a believer in many of Rand's ideas. But in my own search for objective truth, We The Living helped drive me to the Bible - and it is there I will stay!Unwittingly, Rand sets up Irina and Sasha as a type of heroine and hero. Though it could be argued they were not entirely faithful to their religion, it is only they in the story who maintained hope in a greater purpose, controlled by the Higher Being, and as such, only they could truly endure what they were dealt.Perhaps Irina and Sasha COULD HAVE and even SHOULD HAVE done more for themselves and their family. They had as many human flaws as the other characters. But their faith brought them to endure and anticipate a reward for someone greater than themselves - their Creator - and to give themselves up for His glory, not their own, nor that of the state."},{"Title":"The Theology of the Reformed Confessions, 1923 (Columbia Series in Reformed Theology)","review":"Any book that Barth writes is a must read!

Grouping his 78 steps into five parts, Fifer is clear that the first part is a personal commitment on the part of the leader; a commitment to be focused on results, consistent, tough, and fair. Part II is to create a culture of being the best. Then in Part III, taking a page or two from turn-a-round management books, Fifer offers 40 steps for cutting cost - including giving up the boss's corner office! With that, we are ready to move on the Part IV, increasing sales. Here, Fifer offers us another 20 steps that start with the recognition that we sell to people, not companies; and ends with recognition of the value of the sales force. The book finishes with some personal leadership advice; including the importance of determination, perspective, and stretch.This book is not a \`soft skills', people manual.

Basically, he shows us what is wrong with the profit-making system: people get brushed aside. The fact that communism is dead does not mean that capitalism is yet the best system. If we actually follow what Mr. Fifer proposes, we probably will increase profits, but at what cost? Are we only robots to be programmed for the good of the capitalistic ethos, for the good of the corporation? Yes, Mr. Fifer does confess that he reserves his special time for his family by not traveling on weekends. He also decries workaholism. He is capable of drawing the line, but is everyone else in his special position? I doubt it. Many people are going to swallow his philosophy and ruin themselves, \\"for the good of society,\\" or \\"for the bottom line.\\" But let's assume that Mr. Fifer's basic philosophy is correct, that is, that maximizing profit is the best goal because it is in accord with the evolution of the human species, etc. In that case, we are really subservient to the economic system, and nothing more than that. If that's the case, then we embark (again?) into a \\"Big Brother\\" type of world where \\"fear and loathing\\" are the watchwords, because we really don't count for anything more than what we can contribute to the precious bottom line. Gone is any Higher Power, the Bottom Line is the Higher Power. If this is the case, and who's to say it's not (maybe those who believe in a Higher Power other than the Bottom Line?), then all I can say is some of us really are deluded. And maybe that's Mr. Fifer's point after all: sweep out all of this delusion and these deluded people and concentrate on the Bottom Line (but save your weekends for your family, so your kids won't go on drugs, because they also have to play their role as Bottom Line Robots, when their time comes, and drug-users are distinctly disabled in the Bottom Line culture, unless of course they reserve their drinking and drug use for the weekends or after working hours). Diximus."},{"Title":"Double Your Profits: In Six Months or Less","review":"This is a real book, an important one, about real cost-cutting, in a real world. It has been used by many corporate leaders as a &quot;bible&quot; for increasing profits by cutting costs...all company costs that do not actually create a direct profit. That means cutting most of middle management, some senior management, and most employees who do not have direct responsibility for adding daily value to the bottom line. It preaches renegotiating or eliminating vendor contracts on a regular basis. It teaches questioning the value of any consultant or outside service. It is a roadmap for rapid, perhaps severe, cost-cutting to achieve immediate profitability.This is not a book for the timid. It is not a feel-good book, except for those who enjoy counting their money. It will make most readers feel uncomfortable, perhaps insecure. These are among the important reasons to read the book.This book was required reading by Sanford Weill and Bob Lipp for all the senior managers of The Travelers Insurance Companies when they engineered the takeover of the ailing company in 1993. It created shock among many of the senior management of the old, established Travelers, but the book prescribed an exact remedy for turning the corporation into a highly profitable company, now a thriving part of CITICORP...one of the great financial corporations in America.If the reader is a CEO or senior officer, this book is a guaranteed prescription for increasing profitability. If the reader is an employee, at almost any level, this book should be required reading for one's survival. If the reader is a vendor, a consultant, or from an association that provides a service to corporate America, the book should be required reading, because it imparts the knowledge of a real business culture that drives decision-making...and possibly will drive their future relationship with the company.The book lacks concern for human resources, for many of the people who make up a company's workforce. They can quickly become a drain on profits. Loyalty, human compassion, sense of community, and many human skills are too easily forgotten or deemed insignificant to the bottom line. This is one of the great faults of the book, of its philosophy, and of its short-term prescription for profits. It is why it only deserves four stars, instead of five. It would deserve five stars or more if the author had enough insight to find value in loyalty, human skills (other than direct sales), and the importance of communities or governments (of people) in the ability of a corporation to provide valid and profitable services. In this area, it is deficient.The book is very simple and easily read in one sitting. It should be required reading by anyone with a serious interest in business...or anyone who has an interest in an important modern business culture, for better or worse, but certainly for profit."},{"Title":"Double Your Profits: In Six Months or Less","review":"Got the indication from a Brazilian business magazine - Exame - issued January 2010. Marcel Telles, one of the greatest Brazilian entrepreneurs, recommended the book, as a must read, and as the book that influenced him the most. You might ask, who is this person...well, he is one of the guys behind AB-Inbev deal!Although the book dates from 1993 (I don't like much old business books), most principles are very interesting and totally applicable for today's market. The focus on cost reduction is clear, and can generate blunt results. I can clearly understand how inspiring this book were for some successful Brazilian companies in the past decade, specially the ones from GP group. Some of the tips such as giving away your own office (as a CEO) to bring cost down is a true example on how you can demonstrate to your crew how committed you are in order to maximize the company's result.

It's really simple: increase your sales and lower your costs, and look at EVERYTHING. Nothing is sacred to Bob Fifer.Although it seems to be more oriented to larger organizations, I have gotten a lot of great ideas for my own small business.However, there is one suggestion that he offers with which I completely disagree. Step 37 says you should extend your payables. In effect, ride your suppliers and use them as a bank, even to the point of holding out payment for six months or more!This is a VERY BAD IDEA. While your suppliers might tolerate this, they are not going to treat you as a good corporate citizen. You lose the opportunity to earn cash discounts when you don't pay on time. You might even have trouble getting credit elsewhere. Most of my best customers always pay me within ten days. I am a busy person and sometimes I have to prioritize which customer I take care of first. If I have to choose as to whether to take care of a customer who pays me on time vs. one who doesn't, who do you think is going to get faster service? Besides that, it is just wrong to drag out payment. Pay what you owe and pay it when you owe it.Other than this one flaw, I think Mr. Fifer's book is excellent. Federal, state, and local governments should put some of his cost-cutting ideas into practice."},{"Title":"Double Your Profits: In Six Months or Less","review":"This book offers amazing insights on how to creste a profit-oriented culture in a company.

But many people don't know who founder Bruce McLaren was or that the team was selling sportscars and winning sportscar championships in the 1960s and 1970s. McLaren Sports Racing Cars by Dave Friedman is a wonderful photo history of the early Team McLaren.Starting with a brief section on Bruce McLaren's early racing career, it moves through the formation of Team McLaren, their Can-Am championships, Bruce's death in a testing accident, and the team finally quitting sportscar racing to concentrate on F1. There is also a chapter on McLaren's foray into racing at Le Mans in the '90s -- coming back to its heritage.The book does not go too deep into facts on the old Can-Am outside of Team McLaren, but as in his other books, Dave Friedman's photos (both B&amp;W and color) are wonderful. Fabulous action shots, close-ups of the engines and chassis, and candid photos of Bruce and the other drivers of McLaren cars, such as Chris Amon, Dennis Hulme, Dan Gurney, and Peter Revson. Included are not only the race team's cars, but also those of the Can-Am privateers, who bought and raced McLaren customer cars. A beautiful photo history of an age in racing when bigger was better and engineers were only beginning to come to grips with aerodynamics. A must for every fan of Bruce McLaren, Team McLaren, the old Can-Am series, or vintage sports racers in general."},{"Title":"McLaren Sports Racing Cars","review":"Excellent Pictorial History of McLaren, Bruce McLaren Is a Legend.

The story is a formula one, popular in movies in the forties, usually starring Judy Garland or Deanna Durbin, where a gangly, plain, seemingly misfit member of a family of beauties turns out to be wise beyond her years and talented, to boot. Candace Victoria Kane is the 14 year old younger daughter of an Army officer and a beautiful socialite. Older sister, Leigh, is an 18 year old copy of her mother.Candy is charming and clever in the way she gets herself in and out of situations. She and her father go in advance to Ft. Benning to set up housekeeping for the arrival of her mother and Leigh. Candy moves in the furnishings, purchases what else is needed to decorate the house, employs a housekeeper/cook, and makes friends of all ages. Yet she insists that she is, and wants to remain, a happy little girl.The jury is out on whether present day teenagers, fed on a diet of \\"The Princess Diaries\\" and \\"Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,\\" will find as much enjoyment in \\"Candy Kane.\\" My 14 year old granddaughters are in the process of reading Janet Lambert books and will let me know how they like them. Since they enjoyed the \\"Betsy-Tacy\\" and \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" series, which I also gave them, I have hopes that they will enjoy \\"Candy Kane\\" and the other Lambert series, as well."},{"Title":"Bruckner Symphonies (Music Guides)","review":"Bruckner is an acquired taste. Many concert-goers approach his music with trepidation, much like the British critic who bleated, \\"Surely we have a right to be bored by Bruckner'. In yesteryear, one occasionally came across the view that one had to be a Catholic - and presumably a 19th Century Austrian one at that - in order to subjugate these 'symphonic boa constrictors.' This view is less common nowadays. Given Bruckner's metaphysical quest, it does not hurt to have an introit into this dimension. Even so, an atheist can adore this music.Philip Barford is a devout Buddhist. It is refreshing to hear his viewpoint on Bruckner. There is a commonality to the great religions - the clearing away of worldliness in wait for the moment of epiphany - and he finds that Bruckner speaks to him on this level. Bruckner demands patience from conductors, musicians and listeners alike: this is likewise in accordance with the tenets of Buddhism.The author is no mean musicologist and fearlessly wades into the textual swamp. His commentary on the symphonies are illuminating and not overtly technical. Barford may not displace the Simpson but it is a damn good read and a sagacious take on a composer whose star is in the ascendant."},{"Title":"Bruckner Symphonies (Music Guides)","review":"Viva, Mr Barford --- for the joy and pleasure your tiny volume offers: balanced, factual, and touching in turn. You understand Bruckner as a creative, spiritual giant, an artist. This BBC gem, from the previous edition of Grove, is, word-for-word, unsurpassed. Its luminosity and humanity outshine the sad embarassment of the article that has taken its place in the current Grove. Find it, and treasure it."},{"Title":"Bruckner Symphonies (Music Guides)","review":"A jewel of tiny dimension but true knowledge and understanding.

This book largely consists of translations of source texts, with some analysis of their contents. It is neither too technical for a relative layman, nor too watered down to be a good reference text in the future, so I'm going to keep it, rather than reselling.I would hazard a guess that if you're reading reviews of it, you're either very interested in the specific topic, or are required to read it for a class, so I can't imagine that what I have to say would have much effect, but here it goes: Women's Life in Greece and Rome covers its topic in depth to a degree that I don't imagine any other text in this area does.

The plot is well-written and quite exciting. Nate is world weary and looking for a place and purpose for himself, Jolene is average Texas woman from small town.

He is immediately drawn to volunteer Jolene Kannon-Angel, widowed and pregnant. Jolene is impulsive, always rushing to save others at her own peril. Nate is serious and responsible. Both, from the hand of fate, feel a bit cast off from the world, an undesirable prospect for the opposite sex. Yet, each is immediately attracted to the other as they perform feats of derring-do, then seek comfort in each other under the onslaught of a screaming hurricane. They heat up the barn and the sheets, and fall in love, and Nate realizes he's found the place where he belongs.This Code Red-on-the-road novel was a sweet, old-fashioned romance with a virginal heroine and a world-weary hero who light each other up and have some hot sex. There was more action than longing and pining, though there was a little of that. A few details were overlooked, and, despite the hurricane disaster setting, it was a bit on the fluffy side. Engaging and well-written, though.

It is a testament to the power of embracing the feminine aspect. Jones is a voice for a new black women's feminism that both recognizes the innate value of femininity and sees women as equally valuable to men, deserving of equity and respect. This new feminist perspective also encourages women and men to embrace femininity and masculinity as equally valuable, and women to find power and fulfillment through their feminine nature. A must read for all black men and women, as well as for women (especially women of color) interested in effective \\"self help/self improvement\\" approaches to a more fulfilling life and relationships. It especially speaks to the challenges many women of color face in negotiating a world in which they are taught by elders, example and/or by experience, that they must take care of themselves, those around them, and \\"handle their business\\" because no one else can be relied on to do it for them or help them, and to still know and embrace and operate from their feminine nature.Thank you Joy! -Nathalie Thandiwe, Host of Women: Body & Soul Radio"},{"Title":"Between Black Women: Listening with the Third Ear","review":"I would love to own this book but I can't afford due to my very tight budget.

Elizabeth Cogswell Baskin does that and more, giving us not only her experiences starting ad agencies -- she's on her second -- but the inspiring stories of other female entrepreneurs from around the country. One of the best things about the book is that Baskin and her subjects are open about the scary times and tough decisions they've had to make along the way. Although the tone of the book is breezy and fun, Baskin offers plenty of solid advice and cautionary tales. As the former editor-in-chief of Atlanta Woman magazine, I read many books geared to working women and women entrepreneurs. This one is the perfect read for women who are contemplating doing their own thing."},{"Title":"How to Run Your Business Like a Girl","review":"This was a nice book. It points out that women and men typically have different motivations for starting their own businesses. The author says men are usually starting a business for their healthy ego and to make money. And women instead start a business so they can have more control in their lives. There might actually be some truth to that - at least for the older generation of men and women who start businesses.I'm actually part of the younger generation of men and women born in 1962 or thereafter. And I don't think men and women (my peers) are all that different today when starting a business. Both sexes in my generation are faced with job opportunities that lack security, pension plans, and wages that can be lived on comfortably. Both sexes are faced with escalating gasoline prices without a commensurate jump in their salaries. And both sexes are competing for the same jobs. Both sexes are quitting the corporate world and starting their own businesses today because they see more opportunity AND CONTROL in doing that instead of collecting a W-2.This book talks about the unique strengths of women, and the author may have a point there. But I don't think (1) trusting intuition, (2) focusing on relationships, and (3) putting more emphasis on life balance are strengths that women have a lock on.But what men of my generation have an abundance of is male role models in business. And the wonderful thing about this book is that the author has interviewed a few successful women entrepreneurs and documented their stories so women in my generation can read the book and benefit by hearing from female role models in business. Female readers can gain words of wisdom from other women who have been there and done that. And that's what makes this book so good. 5 stars!PS. A nice companion book to this one is Small Business Big Life (ISBN: 140160336X).

To read that other women have gone through the same struggles and challenges, and also share the immense feeling of accomplishment and freedom that comes with it, was very comforting. Ms. Baskin's writing style is very frank and refreshing, as if she were talking to me. I laughed out loud at times, especially the part about \\"putting your big girl panties on\\" and dealing with problems that may arise. A wonderful resource in the midst of lots of very dry business books."},{"Title":"How to Run Your Business Like a Girl","review":"A down to earth, tell it like it is, get real guide. The author, herself an entrepreneur, uses a combination of in depth stories of several women-owned businesses and includes many sidebar profiles by other women entrepreneurs, in their own words. The title doesn't give it credit because for the women entrepreneurs in this book, its not only about running a business, but about running a life for all that its worth. Which is not easy in any case, what with balancing families, facing stereotypes, challenging expectations. But instead of fighting those things, the businesswomen profiled in this book show us ways to take aspects of womanhood and apply them to running a business. Not better nor worse than men, just different. I especially liked the honest, fresh stories by real people -- even when it has not all been a bed of roses -- its a real inspiration."},{"Title":"How to Run Your Business Like a Girl","review":"I enjoyed this book very much, especially since one of the profiled entrepreneurs has a very similar business to what my dream is; it was a surprising peek into the work I aspire to create and integrate into my daily life.As far as information goes, this is not an all-encompassing \\"what to do\\" to check off your list as you go about starting a business; but rather, an uplifting and inspiring read that affirms the burning desire within yourself to launch a venture of your very own. Wanna-be-business-owners need to be inspired from time to time as our very creative natures overanalyze details to the point of discouraging ourselves from even making that first step.Upon beginning the read you are welcomed with the profound statement that if you have a strong desire to start a business, very few things will satisfy that desire, other than starting a business. What a refreshing thing to hear! - that I am not simply obsessed for some odd reason - reading this book helps me come to an understanding of my own entrepreneurial spirit.We all long to make our mark on this world in some small way, and for some, that mark is to create a company from one's own passion and ideals and vision. At the VERY least, this book is a must-have to reach for again and again for inspiration."},{"Title":"How to Run Your Business Like a Girl","review":"Elizabeth Cogswell Baskin has written an entertaining, useful book about launching and operating a business \\"like a girl.\\" Actually, her book is filled with grown-up practical advice that women and men (as opposed to girls and boys) can use, though she hews to her gender-difference theme, particularly pointing out that women tend to rely more on intuition and relationship-building. She covers getting started, choosing your partner, opening your office, surviving slow times and marketing your product. Baskin recounts the stories of female sojourners in the entrepreneurial world and gives more than a third of the book to informative Q&A interviews with women business owners.

One Thursday, when the local law, a one-man force, comes calling for donations to an auction to benefit the police, they laugh but donate. The Auctioneer is Perly Dunsmore, a worldly man who suddenly descends on quiet, sleepy Harlowe. As Thursday after Thursday passes, the requests for donations turn to demands and Harlowe's police force grows along with the power Dunsmore has over the town. What the townspeople end up giving goes far beyond the old furniture and rusty tools of the first auction. How far they have to be pushed before they fight back will shock you.This book is truly a horror story and, if you begin by thinking this sort of thing could never happen, as you read, you'll be shocked at how easily it unfolds.

Buy a used copy, borrow it from someone, or obtain a copy of this book at your local library. It's a fairly fast read, and riveting. A novel, yes ... but you can't help but wonder, \\"Could it happen today? In the 21st Century?\\" I encourage high school English teachers to not only read this book, but find a way for their class to read it and discuss it. This book is (IMHO) a modern day classic. The implications, lessons, and warnings inherent in this story are applicable, even today ... decades after the story was set in a fictitious small town in New Hampshire in the late '60's. Topics that could be discussed and touched on are: bullies, extortion, and the expression: \\"All that is needed for evil to flourish is for good men to do nothing.\\" For a good scare that will leave you pondering human nature: READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Auctioneer","review":"absoute evil,this book will slowly but surely curdle your blood.dynamite from start to finish,with an ending you will not forget."},{"Title":"The Auctioneer","review":"A creepy, paranoid classic from the mid-1970's, this book is one of the best from the horror boom. It relies much more on atmosphere and impending doom than blood and guts, but that's exactly what makes it so wonderful. The plot is simple: a new auctioneer arrives in a small New Hampshire town and asks the townspeople for donations. But soon one family finds themselves giving more than they can afford, and the actioneer won't seem to take no for an answer.The writing is controlled and evocative. It builds like a Shirley Jackson story, with a strong climax that stays with the reader. It's easy to see how this was an influence on Stephen King -- Needful Things uses the same basic idea. I read this based on the King's recommendation, and I can say it was well worth checking out. Find a copy if you can!"},{"Title":"The Auctioneer","review":"I just finished reading this book. It is a great read and kept me in suspense from start to finish. The Moore family was a great example of the people who settled America and gave us our freedom.

I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Auctioneer","review":"When I read this book, decades ago, I was a malleable, impressionable teenager. It pointed out how something greatly evil can begin innocently, as when people ignore indications of the erosion of principals of freedom and charity when it starts small, then gradually ratchets up in easy-to-dismiss steps until it is in control of - and destroying - your life. What I see today, decades later, is that its premise is applicable - and is actually unfolding - with regard to U.S. government today. We have an out-of-control, bail-out intoxicated Congress, a President (GW Bush) unwilling to veto anything, and now he will hand the \\"reins of reckle$$ne$$\\" over to a tax-and-spend liberal, the likes of which we have never seen before. Inexperienced but cunning President-elect Obama (as of this writing, 1/10/09) could be author Joan Samson's auctioneer. Stepping down from a political soap-box, this book awakened me to be more aware that the innocent beginnings of what appears to be charity can soon become a burdensome tax on one's life. I am forever glad to have read this book. It opened my eyes. The auctioneer who posted a review here understandably did not like this book. Of course he wouldn't! Read this book, an American Classic in my eyes, even if you get it at the library. You won't regret it. It's an easy book to read, and should get you to think about your possessions, your rights and your freedoms, and about keeping them from being taken away by others."},{"Title":"The Auctioneer","review":"I read this book about a year or so ago, and I still get upset when I think about it.

But then I read the book.This is one of those stories about them bad, bad guys who come from outside the small community and try to grab locals' land by any means, preferably wicked means, and develop it. The old conspiracy theory, stupid even back when this one was written.The underlying idea is that the only good use for land is agriculture, no matter how unproductive or unprofitable. Recreation of the wealthy is bad, bad, bad. I find that insulting to reason.Credit must be given as to the original, roundabout way in which the outsider tries to grab poor, helpless, unhygienic farmers' land (hence the one star).It bothered me in more ways than one, but (spoiler hint) I have to admit that I laughed my lungs out when our friend the anti-hero auctions out babies to couples unfit for legal adoption procedures."},{"Title":"NTC's Dictionary of Common Mistakes in Spanish","review":"This reference focuses on mistakes that English speakers frecuently make in Spanish.

I found the book to be extemely useful because it does include the most common errors and also saves time in that you don't have to use the dictionary and sift through detailed information in search of a quick clarification.

Rather, it is an excellent summary of the revisionist scholarship about Reconstruction that gained currency in the '50s and '60s, and it is essential reading for anyone interested in this era of history.The Dunning view of Reconstruction, which had almost universal scholarly and popular acceptance from the turn of the 20th Century until the '50s, held that rapacious and vindictive Radical Republicans hijacked the Reconstruction process from the just and magnanimous policies of Andrew Johnson and installed in the South state governments dominated by unscrupulous and incompetent white carpetbaggers and scalawags. These state governments were monuments to misgovernment and corruption, and the entire region (indeed, the entire country) breathed a collective sigh of relief when the white &quot;redeemers&quot; finally forced them out of office. The black freedmen were portrayed as ignorant, infantile, incapable of self-government, and prone to political and economic manipulation in this account of Reconstruction.Revisionist scholars, beginning as early as 1909 with W.E.B. DuBois seminal paper about the subject but really not gaining momentum until the '50s, held that the Dunning school was substantially in error about the progress and nature of Reconstruction, and that this error was largely caused by bald racial prejudice. While the Radical Republicans did have crass economic motives, they honestly believed that the freedmen ought to have civil and political rights. While the Reconstruction state governments were often corrupt and incompetent, they were not out of the ordinary for state governments of the time, and the redeemer governments were frequently as bad or worse. Despite the corruption and the base motivations that did exist, much was accomplished during Reconstruction that should inspire pride: the Reconstruction Amendments to the Constitution, which guaranteed blacks civil and political rights; the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and 1875, which guaranteed blacks the equal use of public accomodations and which provided the Federal government with the legal basis to prosecute those who would deny the black man his civil rights; the institution of truly republican governments in the former Confederacy; the beginning of the reconstruction of the South's infrastructure, which had been largely destroyed by the Civil War; and the foundation of such worthwhile institutions as state-supported schools.Stampp does an admirable job of summarizing both the historiography of Reconstruction and the revisionist view of it. His prose may be somewhat dry at times, but nevertheless it is lucid and engaging in its totality. The key merit of this book is not, however, its groundbreaking scholarship -- indeed, there is nothing groundbreaking about this book -- or its literary style. This has been an enormously influential book because it makes revisionist scholarship about Reconstruction accessible to the masses. In so doing, it has performed the invaluable task of popularizing the revisionist conclusions about Reconstruction, thus making popular acceptance of our later-day Reconstruction, the Civil Rights movement, more readily attainable.As wonderful and influential as this book is, it is not without its shortcomings. Stampp does an insufficient job of citing his sources. This is, in part, because this book is largely the written and polished version of lectures about Reconstruction that he has given over the years; unfortunately, understanding why there are so few citations does not excuse it. His ending bibliographical essay, while very useful, ultimately does not take the place of detailed in-text citations, and his book suffers for it.Secondly, his depiction of the freedman leaves something to be desired. One of the great modern-day complaints about the Dunning school of Reconstruction is that it does not treat Reconstruction-era blacks as actual agents in Reconstruction history. They have no will, and they are not actors in the drama. Rather, they are acted upon. Stampp certainly does not share the racist assumptions of the Dunning scholars that he seeks to replace, but he does share with them the assumption that the black man was not a prime actor in this story. It is rather amazing to me that Stampp discusses the freedman as incessantly as he does and yet fails to talk much about him.Neither of these two criticisms should take that much away from this otherwise excellent book. Read it as an introduction to the era, and treasure it for its salutary historical influence."},{"Title":"The Era Of Reconstruction, 1865-1877","review":"Call this effort from the great historian Reconstruction deconstruction. He deconstructs the notion, all too lazily accepted even today, that Reconstruction was a failed political movement, the only accomplishment of which was pocket-lining by Carpetbaggers from the North.Far from it, Stampp convincingly argues. While he does not deny that the Radical Reconstructionists had a political agenda that included punishing the South and forcing through a pro-industrial, high-tariff program that a populist South was bound to oppose, he also points out Reconstruction wrought many positive changes, including bringing the newly freed African-American into the political process.Stampp also is able to show the social programs launched by the Reconstructionists under the aegis of the Freedmen's Bureau were necessary in a South that was all too eager after the war to force black citizens into a new servitude. For example, the federal officials were instrumental in monitoring court proceedings in the South, ensuring that justice was served for all citizens, not just those holding money and political power.The reasons for Reconstruction's demise have been well documented, and Stampp does not shy from acknowledging the obvious instances of corruption and soaring taxes. But he points out that in the decades following the end of the war, corruption was hardly unique to southern governments and that tax increases were to be expected in states and local communities whose infrastructures had been badly damaged by war.Finally, Stampp reminds us, lest we forget, that Reconstruction failed because of a determined effort by diehard white supremacists and secret organizations such as the Klan. This effort was best characterized by the Mississippi Plan of 1875, in which anti-Reconstructionists set out openly to ensure that black citizens would not make it to the polls to vote. This perversion of democracy spelled the end until the 1950s, essentially, of efforts by the U.S. to achieve political and social equality for blacks.This is essential reading for students of American history. It represents an important contribution to the literature that illuminates this country's self-inflicted racial problems."},{"Title":"The Era Of Reconstruction, 1865-1877","review":"A cohesive and well-written account of Reconstruction by a world-renowned historian. Stampp does not present a flowing narrative of historical events, rather he gives his own revisionist perspective on the policies of both the Johnson administration and the Radical Republicans. An excellent work of scholarship, accessible to both the student and those with a general interest in American history - Thoroughly recommended."},{"Title":"The Era Of Reconstruction, 1865-1877","review":"The standard view of reconstruction up to the middle of the last century was that it was very bad: the radical Republicans, opposed to Lincoln's desire to show leniency toward the people of the South after the rebellion was terminated, went out of their way to see that the South was \\"punished.\\" Historians began revising this view during the 1960s; Stampp's book is among the best of these revisions. Stampp admits there were many mistakes committed by the radical Republicans, and their idealistic aims, especially toward the blacks, might not have been so pure, but he believes if it wasn't for the radicals there would be no 14th or 15th Ammendments to the Constitution. As with most controversies, there is probably truth to be found on both sides of the argument. Stampp develops his argument carefully and fairly. What was truly tragic was the utter failure of the government (and the people) to prevent or even care any longer about the South's \\"experiment\\" with two separate societies, which began in earnest after Grant's two disastrous terms as President. Jim Crow would end up being almost as bad as slavery itself."},{"Title":"The Era Of Reconstruction, 1865-1877","review":"What amazed me the most about this book by Kenneth Stampp is its readability. The book is suprisingly entertaining despite what some may consider its dry subject matter. Although, some of the revisionist ideas of Mr. Stampp have been taken to task by recent historians, The Era of Reconstruction still remains one of the essential tools for any student of American history.Mr. Stampp can perhaps be taken to task for some of the far-fetched psychological connections he makes when trying to surmise the motiviations of historical personages, most notably Lincoln and Andrew Johnson, but the fact that Stampp used psychology in his historical speculations is remarkable because of the fact that his work was written in the mid sixties. By delving deeper than any historian before him into the motivations behind reconstruction, Stampp's work remains fresh and readable even today."},{"Title":"The Era Of Reconstruction, 1865-1877","review":"I bought this very old book (1965 edition) from the second hand booksellers in Ankara. I did not have a chance to read it for years. I must admit I had a prejudice against the book and the subject. I thought that after Howard Fast's Road to Freedom no book can surpass it in the field of Reconstruction Era (1865-1877). I was wrong! I am really happy that I was wrong, I learnt a lot from the late Mr. Kenneth Stampp albeit too late.The writer carefully builds the scene during the Civil War, probably the bloodiest period in US history. He describes the various aspects of the Northern and Southern sides basing the foundation of his analysis to the class interests of either side. After examining the Northern side he concludes that the rapidly developing capitalism has created a new strata in the society. New industrial bosses are step by step dethroning the usual old generation of Northern elite who held on to power during previous periods. Stampp sees in this elite the seeds of the future US imperialism. With regards to Lincoln, Stampp clears the picture even more brilliantly. He uses the argument of abolution of slavery only as an argument for his fight to preserve the union. Even Lincoln does not have a clear solution for the Negro questionStampp is utterly correct when he declares that most of the Republicans are not quite devastated by the early death of Lincoln. As Lincoln sought to deal with the Negro Question without the Congress, the Republicans (Radicals most of all) are happy to pursue their own solution for the problem. However the new president Grant is not what he say he is. His Presendial Restoration attempts will be thwarted by the Congress paving the way for the Radicals dominating the scene.Stampp is curiosly cathes the bull by the horns as he describes the failure of giving the land formerly belonging to white owners to be distributed to the emancipated slaves. The class conscious Northerns, even the Radicals' reforms have limits. They only want to emancipate the slaves, they are not bothered how they will survive after centuries of bonding. It is a free country, so let them take care of themselves!After the Johnson impeachment of 1867 the Radicals are powerfull and have allies in the South. The scalawags (poor white men), carpetbaggers (Northerns arriving south) and freed Negros. The first to get off the Reconstruction will be scalawags. The poor white men from the South think that they ought to be compensated as they are members of the superior race. The carpetbagger Northern entrepreneurs arriving South joins the powerful White elite in reconstructing the devastated South. The Negro is emancipated from the slavery to be bonded into another form of slavery. Quoting from Stampp: \\"The negro was first freed, then enfranchised then launched into practical politics and then mercilessly beaten into reasonable subjection.\\"Stampp asks rightly why the federal government did not resist the southern white elite when they forced, blackmailed and killed the negroes to vote for them. He mentions that the Northernmen were not at all leftists fighting for ideals but businessmen caring for their gains. As the southern economy was beginning to revive with the help of huge railroad constructions, the Northern powerful bosses came to realise that if they demanded the rights for the Negroes and the lowly classes they would be encouraging the communists and radical revolutionaries. This was not small talk as the year was 1871, the yearof the Paris Commune! So the Southern states were left to their own devices, re-forming the social slaver of the Negroes and the poor whites.A very easily readable book, a must for the interested history reader of the era. Despite being old, yet remains unchallenged. Ought to be re-printed. Bravo Mr. Stampp. Rest in pace..."},{"Title":"The Era Of Reconstruction, 1865-1877","review":"This was an informative and interesting book. The author's thesis is that the radical reconstructionists were less corrupt than was commonly assumed at the time. He gives them credit for their noble goal of protecting civil rights and blames conservative parties in society for ensuring that reconstruction failed.Stampp was passionate about the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. In this context, he took issue with the traditional portrayal of the radical Republicans as corrupt and inept carpetbaggers and scalawags. Historiographical analysis was a strong suit for this author. However, the book does have some drawbacks. The tone of the book is tendendentious and polemical. Sources are not clearly cited. The biggest problem with the book is that the evidence backing his arguments is mostly anecdotal and quantifiable data is rarely used.The section on Andrew Johnson is illuminating, but he fails to give Lincoln enough credit for his achievements. Also, he should have given Grant more credit for being committed to protecting civil rights in the South. Reconstruction would have ended years earlier if Grant had decided to remove troops from the South.The author is correct that Reconstruction was a noble effort to protexct civil rights. However, he fails to realize that it was doomed to fail because it could only be enforced by keeping troops in the South for generations. This would be hindered by shortages in manpower and money in the laissez-faire Gilded Age and the economic devastation of the Panic of 1873.Overall,this is a good book and is worth reading. It is important to keep in mind that it was written in 1965 and better and more compelling evidence has surfaced since then. The author's passion for civil rights is to be commended. The language he employs is lively and engaging. His anger at the disenfranchisement of African-American citizens is tangiable and warranted."},{"Title":"The Era Of Reconstruction, 1865-1877","review":"Stampp really helps to dissuade readers of the old Reconstruction interpretations that still exist. These old interpretations from the Dunningite era need to be exposed, deconstructed, and put in their proper place--an example of what happens when personal biases and agendas are placed before history, thereby leading to a slanted, subjective view. Stampp sets things straight, and really sheds new light on our nation's past, and turns traditional beliefs upside-down."},{"Title":"The Era Of Reconstruction, 1865-1877","review":"February is Black History MonthBack in the days of my personal \`pre-history' the Reconstruction period directly after the American Civil War ended in 1865 was cast as the time of the scalawags, carpetbaggers, Black Codes and ultimately after a determined fight by the \`right' people in the South \`redemption'. In short a time of shame in the American experience and, at least implicitly, a racist slap at blacks and their supporters. Well so much for that nonsense.There certainly was plenty that went wrong during radical reconstruction in the South but the conventional high school history textbooks never got into the whole story. Nor did they want to. The whole story is that until fairly recently this radical reconstruction period was the most democratic period in the South in American history, for white and black alike. The book under review, or rather some essays done by Professor Stampp on this subject that led me to this book, went a long way toward a better understanding of the period when I entered my \`history' long ago.Professor Stamp, as he must, starts off his book by describing the political problems associated with most of the earlier studies of Reconstruction done by those influenced by Professor Dunning and his school in the early 20th century. That picture presented, as I described in my opening sentence, the familiar corrupt and scandalous activities associated with this period. Needless to say this position dovetailed very nicely with the rationale for Jim Crow in the pre-1960's South. Moreover, in the hands of its northern liberal devotees nicely covered up the burgeoning corruption of the northern- based \`robber barons'. There is an old adage that history is written by the victors. Whatever the truth to that assertion early Reconstruction history was written by the losers, or rather their apologists once removed.The Reconstruction era was dominated by three basic plans that Professor Stampp describes in some detail; the Lincoln \`soft' union indivisible efforts; the Johnson \`soft' redemption plans; and, the radical Republican \`scorched earth' policy. In the end none of these plans was pursued strongly enough to insure that enhanced black rights gained through legislation would lead to enlightened citizenship. Stampp presents detailed critiques of all these plans and some insights about the social and cultural mores of the country at the time that does not make for pretty reading.The professor then goes on to try to demystify what the radical reconstruction governments did and did not do. That there were scandalous activities and more than enough corrupt politicians to go around goes without saying. However like most myths there is a snowball effect about how bad things really were that obliterates the very real advances for black (and some poor whites) like public education, improved roads and increased state facilities that were anathema to the planting class that formerly ruled the South.The last part of the book deals with the conservative counter-revolution to overthrow the radical governments culminating the well-known Compromise of 1877. The actions of that rabble, rich and poor whites alike formed in militias and other para-military operations like the Klan, is certainly not pretty reading. Moreover it took about a century and a \`cold' civil war during the 1960's (a battle that continues today) to even minimally right that situation. For those that need an in depth, definite study of this subject you must turn to the master Eric Foner and his monumental Reconstruction, 1863-1877. However, if you want an earlier, shorter but nevertheless informative overview of Reconstruction this is your first stop."},{"Title":"The Era Of Reconstruction, 1865-1877","review":"I have read the books by Stampp, Foner, Dubois, and Dunning and find that each of them has hold of a part of the history of the &quot;elephant&quot; (as in the blind men trying to describe something) known as Reconstruction. Dunning and his &quot;Dunning School&quot; on the subject was academically and historically accurate and cannot be discredited, but neither can Stampp be challenged on his attempt to revise the history of the &quot;tragic decade&quot; and the scar left behind by the attempt to reconstruct the southern states in the image of the &quot;radical&quot; members of Congress and the United States military. However, Stampp comes to the subject matter with his own bias and prejudices based on ethnicity and &quot;liberal&quot; politically-correct scholarship. The &quot;elephant&quot; was long gone before any of these writers described Reconstruction 1865-1877, so all we can do in the name of intellectual honesty is read them all with the awareness thatStampp is no more valid than Dunning."},{"Title":"The Other God: Dualist Religions from Antiquity to the Cathar Heresy (Yale Nota Bene)","review":"The \\"Da Vinci Code\\" was largely fiction. In \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\", it wasn't clear what was fact and what was fiction. But \\"The Other God\\" is just fact (and some interpretation) and yet as fascinating as the other two works.Based on some other reading I'd done in this area, I had low expectations for this book. As I read it, the beginning didn't grab me. I didn't see where it was leading. But every new 50 pages seemed better than the preceding 50, not because the preceding 50 wasn't good, but because the latest 50 tied all the earlier pages together. It just kept getting better and better.If you like reading about the Cathars, \\"The Other God\\" is even better. It shows the roots of Catharism, way back to Armenia and before. It tells the Cathar history. It discusses the Cathar beliefs. It's all very scholarly, with the main 294 pages backed up by 126 pages of footnotes and a select bibliography of 32 pages. Items that get alluded to in other books on the Cathars get discussed in depth here, such as the contribution of the Bogamils to Catharism. Not to mention the earlier contributions of Zoroaster, Mani, and Mithraism. Stoyanov is thoroughness incarnate.If you've read the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" or \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\", you'll recall the claim that Mary Magdalene had been Jesus's wife. You might have read discussions about that without hearing where it originated. Stoyanov points out that the Cathars introduced that belief (which isn't found in Bogamilism). No evidence it was based on fact (just as a lot in the Bible doesn't have factual support) but the belief did have a function: it at the least gave a higher status to women, something that many women who read the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" resonated with.What I'd realized by the time I finished this book is that religious dualisms wasn't isolated nor odd: it started a long time ago and developed meaningfully in many branches. It feels like orthodox Christianity would like us to believe it was ocassional and short-lived (and thanks to orthodox Christian persecution there's some truth to that) , but \\"The Other God\\" shows how widespread it has been and the imporant issues it has raised and provided answers for.Stoyanov isn't biased. He is scholarly. Since he's careful to support his positions you'll find many references to other works you can follow if you want to learn more, although I suspect for many readers \\"The Other God\\" will seem quite sufficient.Read this book and you'll understand why people going back to the ancient Egyptians struggled to render our lives meaningful by developing myths that made more sense to some of us. Here, then, is a God some of us can believe in: not the one the authorities try to control us with, but the Other God."},{"Title":"The Other God: Dualist Religions from Antiquity to the Cathar Heresy (Yale Nota Bene)","review":"The history of secret societies and sects will not be the same after the publication of this book. The amount of new and frequently astonishing information concerning ancient and medieval underground societies is so great and so well-documented that one will need to read the book again and again to select the section of history he wants to explore and understand. The book fortifies with some dramatic new evidence the all-pervading importance of stellar myths and correlations in ancient Egypt, Babylonia and Iran, as emphasized in some recent books, and then traces these and related esoteric trends in late antiquity and the Middle Ages. Stoyanov's final discussion of Cathar secret doctrines and myths, including the teaching of a marriage between Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene ('described as a 'great secret')and their sources is a tour de force and one has the feeling that he does not reveal all the material at his disposal, hinting that it is reserved for a book yet to come for which I will wait with some impatience."},{"Title":"The Other God: Dualist Religions from Antiquity to the Cathar Heresy (Yale Nota Bene)","review":"In a superb and scholarly work Yuri Stoyanov charts the descent and evolution of Dualism (the idea of cosmic conflict between good and evil) from the revelations of Zoroaster and the Orphics, via the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Mithraic mysteries and the great Gnostic teachers, to it's revival in medieval Europe. It reveals a mass of political and religious undercurrents that lie beneath the surface of official history, touching on the Knights Templars, the Rosicrucians and the early Freemasons. This is by far the best book available in English on the movement that became known, in its last major European incarnation, as 'Catharism'."},{"Title":"The Other God: Dualist Religions from Antiquity to the Cathar Heresy (Yale Nota Bene)","review":"This book offers an astonishing amount of information on very little known religions and heretical secret movements from ancient Egypt to Siberia.

I discovered it when I was researching the same questions as Stoyanov addresses so masterfully. I suggested it as reading in my Philosophy of Religion course, and I referenced it heavily in my book, \\"The Order of the Dragon,\\" which extends Stoyanov's history of The Great Heresy (I prefer The Great Heterodoxy as a name) both backward and forward in time. The discovery of an ivory statuette of a lion-headed man in Ulm, Germany, dating to about 40,000 BC indicates how far back this Heterodoxy can go. Its inclusion in Freemasonry and in cutting-edge science indicates how far forward it has come. But it has been suppressed ruthlessly along the way. The one review of Stoyanov's \\"The Hidden Tradition\\" can't fault him on facts or reason, so it faults him for Judaeo-Christian heterodoxy. Apparently Joseph Campbell even had trouble getting his books published in his later years, as he too was walking the path of the heterodoxy. After teaching 20 years at an academic institution to complement my main area of bioethics at a medical school, I had my adjunct professor appointment terminated for using that heterodox text as a supplementary reading to expand the parochial texts of philosophy of religion, and for daring to use it in my Nietzsche course to give students the Zarathustrian background one needs to understand Nietzsche.I'm relieved that Stoyanov has experienced only minor suppression of his work, though I think the last chapter of his book reflects his trying to accomodate that suppression. After carefully showing the ongoing thread of The Great Heresy, he recants in that last chapter and denies there is such an ongoing thread because this tradition is not monolithic. But then, neither is the Jewish or Christian tradition, yet we still group those religious views under unifying categories. I don't think the suppressive cultural tendencies deserve such obeisance, and I hope Stoyanov continues to light the hidden recesses of The Great Heterodoxy. When that Heterodoxy successfully defends itself against suppression by monotheisms, we have Renaissances. When it doesn't, we have Dark Ages.Dr. Colleen D.

Like the gnosticism with which it sometimes overlapped, dualism predated Christianity and some combined its principles with the new faith of Christ into a syncretistic blend that was a natural byproduct of the melting pot of religious and philosophical ideas swirling around the Roman Empire. Although the dualist form of Christianity tells us little about Jesus or his early followers, it is an important ingredient in understanding certain events in Church history.Yuri Stoyanov has done much to overcome the ignorance of dualist beliefs in his marvelous history of the movement The Other God. Beginning with the idea of a divine polarity - the concept of struggle between opposing spiritual forces - Stoyanov explores how in Zoroastrianism this led to the belief in two divine powers of good and evil were engaged in battle for dominance. As this influence of this religion of Persia spread west, elements of the dualist system would become integrated in variants of other religions leading to a syncretistic blend of faiths. This blending of beliefs would become especially prevelant after large areas of the Mediterranean were conquered in succession by Persia, then the Macedonians, and finally the Romans.Stoyanov demonstrates that even as Christianity spread througout the Roman Empire, the prevailing syncretism attempted to absorb the new faith. There were overlaps of the aforementioned divine dualism with the gnostic emphasis on a spiritual/physical dualism as the good became identified with the spriritual and evil with the physical world. Thus Jesus was sent by the \\"good god\\" to free us from the bondage of physical existence and the god of the Old Testament who created the physical world is seen as the prevailing force of evil. This is in sharp contrast to the incarnational view of orthodox Christianity where the physical world was made good but has fallen due to man's sin and in Jesus the Word was made flesh for the world's redemption.For those interested in the history of the patristic period, the book will fill in many gaps and correct numerous misconceptions. For example, Manicheanism is often categorized as a Christian heresy but it is better thought of as another world religion that adopted elements of gnosticism, Judaism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Mahayana Buddhism. Although the religion's founder, Mani of Babylon, taught of Jesus, he insisted that the religion Jesus taught was actually Manicheanism and not the Christian faith as had been passed down. In this remaking the figure of Jesus to support Manicheanism, Mani prefigured Muhammed and Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h who did the same, respectively, for Islam and Bah&aacute;'&iacute;.After these preparatory sections outlining how dualism developed and then battled with Christianity for the hearts of those who had rejected paganism, Stoyanov turns to what might be called the \\"dualist succession\\" - the series of various dualist movements that continued to flourish and continue this tradition throughout the medieval period. Some of these movements were a more moderate form of dualism - the evil god was an inferior being to the good god -while others were more absolute in holding the dyadic principles in struggle. Sometimes there were even splits as absolute and moderate dualists would declare each other heretics.The author does a remarkable job of explaining how the myriad dualist groups throughout Asia and parts of Europe were interconnected. In some cases there was a direct institutional link while in other cases the migration of members of a dualist community due to economic or political factors would result in the dualist view finding fertile new ground. One item that is of particular interest to those knowledgable of Christian history is how the Bogomil movement - a Christiian dualist movement centered in the Balkans - may have organized a dualist mission to Western Europe that resulted in the Catharist (or Albighensian) heresy that shook the medieval Catholic Church to its foundations.Stoyanov then details how the combination of crusades by the Eastern and Western Churches against dualist churches and then Muslim conquests of Asia and parts of Eastern Europe eliminated the dualist threat to monotheism. Bosnia, a longtime stronghold of dualism, would be the only area in Europe to permanentlly convert to Islam. Persia (now Iran), which may be considered the birthplace of dualism would also end up ruled by the Muslim religion. Although it did influence monotheism with some of its mystical practices, it's overt adherents have been reduced to small and often isolated communities. Thus dualism eventually lost its struggle with its monotheistic rivals.The book closes with a description of how certain dualist ideas became incorporated into popular folklore. In areas where dualism was strong, certain myths would naturally have arisen and been passed down. Such informal tradition is generally freer from the scrutiny of the Church as it is likely ignored by theologians or ascribed to mere ignorance. However, it does reinforce the ideas into the popular consciousness.Although not mentioned in the book, one area where dualism be said to survive in a very moderate form is within the confines of American Evangelicalism. With an entrenched anti-sacramentalism and pockets of fascination with Satan as a power in his own right - often ignoring the sovereignty of God - we can hear echoes of earlier dualist claims. This is most prevalent in the \\"Word-Faith\\" movement where Satan seemingly calls the shots and God is reduced to pulling a Jacob to trick Satan out of his inheritance.The irony increases when certain Evangelicals claim past dualist movements as \\"proto-Protestants\\" in a \\"trail of blood\\" who kept the true faith. While those who make such claims are generally ignorant of Church history and have no idea what these groups actually taught, their claim of them as spiritual ancestors does have a validity in one sense - although it is not something they would find flattering.The history of dualism is a story that needed to be told. With its influence often downplayed except for sensationalistic and mostly erroneous accounts, an accurate historic treatment is vital to understand how the forces the Church struggled against in the devlopment of her doctrine. With The Other God, Yuri Stoyanov has written the most through source on this subject in a style accessible to the average lay reader. For an understanding of the challenge of dualism, there is simply nothing better"},{"Title":"The Other God: Dualist Religions from Antiquity to the Cathar Heresy (Yale Nota Bene)","review":"This book is a republished old version with a new name. It is tedious. It is written from a Bulgarian nationalist perspective, and provides absolutely no new information on the subject. It is obsessed with Balkan and Byzantine history, and seems only dimly informed by modern Manichean and Gnostic studies. A big let down."},{"Title":"The Other God: Dualist Religions from Antiquity to the Cathar Heresy (Yale Nota Bene)","review":"The reviewers of this book indicate that the author's story of religious dualisms is complete. But, this story will remain incomplete until &quot;the fat lady sings.&quot; The fat lady is the Roman Catholic Church and the song is the 1440 negative theology of Bishop Nicholas of Cusa. Negative theology, which is described in Cusa's book &quot;On Learned Ignorance,&quot; landed in the USA only in 1981. It was translated by Dr. Jasper Hopkins of the University of Minnesota. And, it was published by The Arthur J. Banning Press in Minneapolis. It is now in paperback from amazon.com.Stoyanov had to conduct considerable research on the subject of religious dualism to bring us his great story. Now, I hope a new story is told in a similar way. This new story would include the religious dualism discovered by Bishop Cusa. Unfortunately, Cusa's new religious dualism was also silemced by the Roman Church. When are Christian churches going to grow up and open up? Jesus Christ will not be defeated, even by junk movies such as created by Mel Gibson. Cusa defeats the God/Satan dualism and Gibson's promotion of the Original Sin of Christianity with his new identity/difference dualism. All good forces, on the side of God, and all evil forces, on the side of Satan, can be rejected. The battles between good and evil forces in a celestial world, or a supernatural world, are foolish imaginations of people who are unaware of Cusa's identity/difference dualism."},{"Title":"The Other God: Dualist Religions from Antiquity to the Cathar Heresy (Yale Nota Bene)","review":"This book is a sober straight-forward account of many versions of the Other God, that is to say, the ignored, defeated, or avoided divinity in dualist systems. The main concern, however, is not so much the other deities as much as dualistic belief systems and their fate in history. The original title is more accurate: \\"The Hidden Traditions in Europe: the Secret History of Medieval Christian Heresy.\\" It is for the most part well-written although some surprising typographical errors creep in here and there. It tries to cover most dualist religious systems in history. The book is 476 pages long out of which 125 are endnotes! These are almost exclusively bibliographical info. The chapter titles and section titles are for the most part not particularly helpful in describing the content (e.g.\\"The Bridge of the Separator\\", \\"The Father of Light and Darkness\\").This book is not written in a difficult way at all. But it does use a lot of terms from the Greek and Latin. It is arranged chronologically, which also means somewhat geographically and travels from ancient Egypt via Greece and Palestine to medieval France making several stops in Persia and the Balkans, where it also concludes. A difficulty is the geography and names of places we don't have anymore. Some unclear maps are provided at the beginning of the book. This difficulty is compounded by political history which invariably affected some of these religions and movements. Typical of the larger religious movements is their spreading, mixing with other religions, then being persecuted by those in power, so aside from names of places we get a wealth of names of clans, dynasties, tribes, ethnies, rulers, writers, etc. As a result, some chapters focus entirely on history and not so much on religion.The Cathars don't occupy all that much space or interest for the author. In turn, the Balkans is what takes up a good portion of this book, and that story was a revelation to me. Sandwiched between Western and Eastern Christianity and later even Islam, the Balkans were the last and most consistent stronghold of dualism. We are introduced to a dizzying array of varieties of Christian dualism with all their respective varieties of demonology and Christology. One should also note that the author acknowledges that sources for this material are questionable as they come mostly from opponents of dualism who distorted and caricatured and literally demonized dualistic beliefs. To some extent this makes a good companion to Umberto Eco's excellent Baudolino, where heresies are at the center of the story and the significance of fine theological differences are worked out more clearly.The author did a tremendous amount of research and this work could almost be the perfect reference text on heresies, if the index were clearer."},{"Title":"The Other God: Dualist Religions from Antiquity to the Cathar Heresy (Yale Nota Bene)","review":"This book is the best thing I have read on the history and beliefs of the medieval Cathar heretics, the other secret sects behind them (i.e. the eastern Bogomils) and their predecessors in antiquity.

If you have any interest in delving into the history and thought that led to many modern texts on gnosticism or discovering the core ideas that animate esoteric thought, this book is an excellent read.I have to say, I'm a little surprised that this book was given a 2 Star review.

The book fortifies with some dramatic new evidence the all-pervading importance of stellar myths and correlations in ancient Egypt, Babylonia and Iran, as emphasized in some recent books, and then traces these and related esoteric trends in late antiquity and the Middle Ages. Stoyanov's final discussion of Cathar secret doctrines and myths, including the teaching of a marriage between Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene ('described as a 'great secret')and their sources is a tour de force and one has the feeling that he does not reveal all the material at his disposal, hinting that it is reserved for a book yet to come for which I will wait with some impatience."},{"Title":"The Other God: Dualist Religions from Antiquity to the Cathar Heresy (Yale Nota Bene)","review":"Not a light read by any stretch of the imagination, but I can't think of any better book to cover this subject matter."},{"Title":"The Other God: Dualist Religions from Antiquity to the Cathar Heresy (Yale Nota Bene)","review":"This book is full of very interesting information on the early dualist religions but it is extremely difficult reading both theologically and linguistically.

My political and emotional perspective on Cuba is strong and personal, yet try as I may, the two times I've read this book, I did not ever find it tarnished by the rhetoric of propagandists.I recommend this book to teachers and professors searching for a complete and honest history of Cuba for classroom use, and to independent students and learners who really want a strong background knowledge on the long history of Cuba."},{"Title":"Cuba: Between Reform and Revolution (Latin American Histories)","review":"At least two reviews have been posted recently claiming Professor Perez is wrong about the facts he offers on social and economic conditions in Cuba before the victory of the revolution in 1959. I have placed a comment under the more extensive of the two challenges, but I want to alert others who may not look at the comments to the reviews, that in general, but especially on Cuba and its revolution, a subject on which feelings run very deep, a challenge to factual material presented by a leading academic expert such as Professor Perez (no relation to this writer) cannot be credited unless the source is given, and preferably a reliable or authoritative source that can be independently verified.In this case, the author of the longer challenge writes with such assertiveness and specific detail that I imagined I was reading first hand testimony from someone who was there, although the reviewer doesn't say that. Even then, on Cuba, such accounts need to be taken with a grain of salt and the person should be encouraged to provide authoritative or reliable and verifiable sources to corroborate at least the overall picture they are presenting if not all the specific details.But as it turns out, in the case of the comment that challenges Professor Perez so vigorously, it comes from someone whose profile page has another review where he makes it clear he was born in 1973. He is in his 30s, but he'd need to be well past retirement age to know from personal experience the assertions he makes challenging Professor Perez on the facts about Cuba in the late 1950s. Yet the critic provided no sources.Among many of us Cuban emigres (and our descendants) a myth has developed that I would caricature as, \\"Nothing was wrong with Cuba before 1959; nothing has been right ever since.\\" But that is more a reflection of the depth of feeling about the Cuban Revolution from those who were negatively impacted than a true portrait of what the island was then and what has happened since. (And feelings run just as deeply on the other side, too.)As the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said, \\"Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.\\" Professor Perez's record and standing in the academic community makes his book authoritative. I would completely discount those kinds of negative reviews claiming the book is inaccurate until and unless they are backed up with sources."},{"Title":"Cuba: Between Reform and Revolution (Latin American Histories)","review":"E X C E L L E N TE X C E L L E N TVERY EXCELLENT"},{"Title":"Cuba: Between Reform and Revolution (Latin American Histories)","review":"Covering almost 4 centuries of history even of a small country as Cuba is a daunting task. Perez, however, does a wonderful job in making a succinct and clear overview of the general narratives that have shaped the island. Beginning with a brief introduction to the native population of the island before the Spanish discovery of Taino and Ciboney tribes to the present years of the revolution. What I think was important was how the author provided a geographical overview of the island so as the reader can become acquainted with the territory. While for many Cubans this may not be necessary for those with little or even just some knowledge of Cuba this preliminary step is extremely helpful. I enjoyed this book most of all because it gives a narrative to each historical epoch. From the bleak beginnings of Cuba as a country that was depopulated over and over as more Spaniards moved to the Spanish colonial mainland to how and why Havana was able to grow as an important city for Spanish interests. Again because the author cannot cover everything many will criticize that he missed this or that. Personally my biggest surprise was that he didn't mentioned the events that lead to the Spanish-American War. He does extensively note the long history of U.S. intentions to annex Cuba. But the explosion of the Maine and the events leading to the U.S. occupation are not mentioned at all. With respects to keeping a bias opinion and the accuracy of his evidence...well with regards to all the modern developments (i.e. 2000-present) the author is quite accurate and he does give a succinct and clear idea of the main events. With respect to the Pre-1959 I cannot attest for much. The author at least does try, so it seems, to a keep a non-biased view throughout his book. He neither staunchly praises the Revolution nor demonizes. He notes its few achievements and its key problems. The author does note how Cuba is one of the most developed economies in Latin America by 1958 in comparison to most Latin American countries on many levels including # of radios, televions, literacy, infant mortality etc. At the same time, this doesn't mean that there aren't many problems with Cuban society before 1959 there are and A LOT. And the author does keep note of these. Some things I would like to have seen mentioned were key public works of Havana i.e. The Capitolio built under the Machado administration, the Hotel Nacional build in 1930 and most importantly Habana Libre, Riviera. These last were built just a year or 2 prior to the Revolution I would like to see more in depth economic analysis of these years preceding the Revolution. Despite these minor setbacks I think Perez has done an astonishing job and hope to read other books by him"},{"Title":"Cuba: Between Reform and Revolution (Latin American Histories)","review":"I do not recommend this book for the casual reader nor for the beginning student of Cuban History.This text is filled with errors in various places. The most distorted portion seems to deal with the Pre-Revolutionary, Pre-Castro Cuba. Mr Perez explains, for example, that \\"approximately 892,000 Cubans were fully employed in 1958 and of these 62 percent earned $75 (US) a month or less.\\"The fact is that Cuban union workers earned about $40 per week in 1958. The lowest paid workers were those who worked in construction. They were paid more than what Mr. Perez believes. Bricklayers earned an average of $4 a day and other construction workers about $7 per day. Construction work in the decade of the 1950's was on the increase - not decrease. And even if we were to accept the figure of $75 per month (for which I'd love to know the source) this would be a decent salary in the Cuba of the 1950's. Rents at that time were as low as $15 or $20 per month, for apartments. Rent control existed in Cuba as far back as 1940. (Although new construction, anything built post-1940, did not have to be rent-controlled.) A gallon of gasoline in 1958 cost about $0.32...Writing about Cuba in 1958, on page 304 of the Second Edition, Mr. Perez continues, \\"The neighborhoods of Luyano, Jesus del Monte and Las Yaguas were crowded with tens of thousands of poor, unemployed, unemployable, living in squalor and destitution, eight to a room in hovels of tin sheeting and cardboard without sanitary facilities, garbage collection, sidewalks, or street lighting, and increasingly without hope.\\"The statement above is only true of one neighborhood called 'Las Yaguas,' but the statement is not accurate about the other neighborhoods.The fact is there were no 'Yaguas' in Jesus del Monte, nor in Luyano. Jesus del Monte had broad avenues, theaters, churches (The Passionists), homes - new construction of poured concrete and slab - built in the mid 20th century after the Great Depression and WWII, so that by 1958 the homes in this part of the city would have seemed new. In 1958, Luyano was also a middle class neighborhood. It too was a neighborhood composed of new homes, new construction - such as the home built by my own grandmother in 1953 on the corner of Fontz and Cumbre, hospitals (such as 'casa de socorros') etc.Las Yaguas was a slum. It was home to perhaps as many as 5000 people. President Batista attempted to move its residents into new housing in the 1950's, into something akin to public housing here in the US, in a place called 'Mantillas,' but the people moved back to 'Las Yaguas' on their own because in Las Yaguas they paid no rent. Theose people would routinely illegally vandalize the homes in Mantillas - selling toilets or whatever they could - and return on their own to Las Yaguas.Castro then did finally move these indeed 'unemployable' people, as Mr. Perez describes them, out of Las Yaguas and into government-built housing after 1959. But this success was only due to Castro's mandate, this is to say it was something achieved by force, practically at the point of a gun.Leonardo PuigUnion City, NJ"},{"Title":"Cuba: Between Reform and Revolution (Latin American Histories)","review":"As an anthropologist, I found this book an invaluable introduction to Cuban history, and I would certainly use it as a text for undergraduates.Perez starts with Cuba's geography and a quick review of its pre-Columbian peoples, and ends with Cuba in the Post-Cold War World. The book is readable and concise, and gave me insights into U.S. designs on Cuba that began with our second President. Perez goes through Cuba's history in extricating itself from Spain only to be dominated by the U.S., and then gives a very good account of Cuba under its various presidents up until the Revolution. His account of the Revolution and its roots is dispassionate and unbiased, though it won't seem like that to right-wing exiles who would like to see everything about Castro totally demonized.I disagree with other reviewers that the role of the U.S. is not included. It certainly is. With 329 pages, you can't go into extreme depth on all topics to everyone's tastes, but I for one was surprised by how old U.S. ambitions toward the island are.

I was disappointed, however, with the rather overbearing tone of the book. Although most of her advice was up-to-the-minute, sometimes it seems she assumes the world is divided into the well-dressed and those who still wear stirrup pants and hawaiian shirts. Come on, Bren--most of us fall somewhere in-between. I really didn't need a whole chapter of her opinions on tatoos, either. I give this book three stars because I'll bet she could help me out in the dressing room, but she might drive me crazy, too!"},{"Title":"In The Dressing Room with Brenda: A Fun and Practical Guide to Buying Smart and Looking Great","review":"Women looking for \\"straightforward\\" advice will be disappointed.If you can approach this book with an open mind, you'll have a lot of fun.I really like the illustrations here and there, and especially the font Brenda used. It's easy on the eyes.As far as the content, I'm fond of the \\"Fashion Calendar for Smarties\\" - a month by month look at what to expect in the stores each month. This is INDISPENSABLE.I also love the \\"Fashion Feng Shui\\".I haven't finished reading this book yet, but it's already given me a different approach to shopping for my wardrobe. It's about loving myself, not punishing myself with dreary clothes, or camouflaging myself! It's about a sense of adventure, and creativity.Most of all, I adore her writing style. It's extremely upbeat and energetic, and very warm. There was no picture of Brenda Kinsel anywhere in the book, so I searched under her name in Yahoo pictures. I pictured her as a happy, smiling, uplifting woman. I found only one picture of her, but she was exactly as I had imagined her!Anyway - Would I recommend this book? As I said above, if you can open your mind, YES!IF you want to look at the world with new eyes - YES.If you're tired of \\"practical\\", cold, uninspirational books about fashion that make you even more afraid of shopping, get this book....And please don't skip the introduction!"},{"Title":"In The Dressing Room with Brenda: A Fun and Practical Guide to Buying Smart and Looking Great","review":"The writing style was so extraordinarily annoying that I found it virtually impossible to read. The few nuggets of good advice must be culled out of hackneyed, trite, tired attempts at wit. I found myself skimming the entire book searching for something worthwhile and find it was not worth the effort. If you were able to edit out the exasperating filler you might have the makings of a worthwhile magazine article."},{"Title":"In The Dressing Room with Brenda: A Fun and Practical Guide to Buying Smart and Looking Great","review":"I pour over this book and another Brenda Kinsale title, \\"40 Over 40\\", twice a year at seasonal wardrobe evaluation time.

Keeping the chapter on clothing capsules."},{"Title":"In The Dressing Room with Brenda: A Fun and Practical Guide to Buying Smart and Looking Great","review":"This book is okay - a little cute, but some interesting ideas.

But what can you do...a shot in the dark I reckon..Buyer beware...look carefully....before buying. And yes you can judge a book by its cover! First 2 pages are missing. They show an Index but my book has none. And my book is about 100 pages the book advertised is over 300 pages...go figure...is this false or tricky advertising? Thank you."},{"Title":"Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda: The Broken Places","review":"This novel is essentially light reading -- a good novel to take to the beach. That said, I did feel the book was well plotted and well put together. It also had a number of very original creative flashes that keeps a reader going.Two separate plot lines converge in the book. One involves a conference being held on the Andromeda Ascendant to determine the freedom or slavery of a planetary system. This involves some fun characters as diplomats, including a very bad Nietzschean admiral who -- as one might expect -- intends to enslave the captive planets and grind their populations into the mire. This meanie admiral engages in a delightful chess game of diplomacy with Dylan Hunt. I won't spoil anything for readers, but the battle of wits between the two holds one's interest well.A second plot element that runs through the book involves a treasure hunt for artifacts of ancient technology -- think of \\"Indiana Jones\\" among the stars. This involves Beka, who emerges as perhaps the best-sketched character in the novel. Beka, her mom, and her ne'er-do-well brother all compete to find certain ancient artifacts. When -- after many chapters -- these artifacts are finally brought together, an ancient engine begins to shake the very foundations of space and time. How \\"Rommie\\" (avatar of Andromeda), Trance Gemini, and Dylan Hunt struggle to avert the consequences of Beka's foolishness makes for a good story.Some great touches, with panache and originality, include an attack on a Nietzschean battle cruiser by a fleet of primitive \\"sail ships.\\" These rag-tag, solar-powered fighters are the only craft the oppressed peoples of the planetary system are able to pull together. The battle is really David against Goliath. This was a wonderful development in the book and gives Seamus Harper his chance to take the spotlight.Another very fun bit of writers' invention was the \\"warbot\\" (war robot) named Tweedledum, who plays a key part near the end of the novel. He doesn't make a very lengthy appearance, but he really stirs things up when he does!The writers had to work with a \\"given\\" fictional world based on the TV series \\"Andromeda.\\" This book could have been just \\"going through the motions\\" writing as some of these spin-off novels tend to be. But this one offers more. There are many very creative flashes, many little unexpected touches of imagination, that make the book very enjoyable. The main plot lines are well crafted, and the outcome knits together all the earlier developments. Someone on the writing team definitely knows how to outline!I wish the writers knew a little about astrophysics. The black hole and quasar depicted in the book show an abysmal ignorance of the physics of such objects. And probability is stretched almost to the point of tossing the book down at a few points. But heck, this is strictly an entertainment novel. By that standard the book is very well done.Recommended -- especially when you are looking for something light and fun."},{"Title":"Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda: The Broken Places","review":"Of the six novels based on the Andromeda series,this one is by far the best. I really liked the focus on Beka and the story of her family. Rafe,her brother,while being a conartist of the first order,does seem to have a caring attitude towards his sister. The story flows smoothly and thankfully,Dylan is there when she needs him most. While I wholeheartedly recommend all six books in the series,I really think you will enjoy this one the most."},{"Title":"Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda: The Broken Places","review":"Just faaaaantastic stuff!! I wasn't into Kevin Sorbo or anything, but Vare and Morris have made me an Andromeda fan for life. For life!! Great unique plot, especially for a science fiction book. I just hope that the next one will follow the Broken Places in this new direction."},{"Title":"Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda: The Broken Places","review":"The author does an excellent job of capturing the essence of the Andromeda cast. I liked how she worked in the backstory of Beka's mother and the Genite origins. I would give the book from 4 to 5 stars if it was not for the lack of editing. The typos for this book was the worst I have ever read. Character names changed from paragraph to paragraph, both the Andromeda and the Eureka Maru were often misspelled. The poor editing spoiled my reading experience. It became a labor to read the book."},{"Title":"Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda: The Broken Places","review":"This is one of the better books that I've read having to do with the Andromeda series. It was written by an actual writer for the first two seasons of the show, and it's very apparent as you start reading the book. I could actually see what was going on played out in my head, fantastic detail and a wonderful plot.The only reason that I give this book four out of five stars is for a simple reason: I found the first few chapters to be a little slow. I'm not a big fan of Beka's brother Rafe, so I found the bits with them looking for their mother rather slow, but that's just personal opinion. I still found it wonderful to finally know what the Engine of Creation actually does, I had been curious about the item since they had picked it up on the show, but it was never used. Otherwise, the book has some great writing and some great scenes. Trance is used in an interesting way, Tyr and Harper have a friendly moment, Dylan does some negotiating, Rev Bem is used nicely as well--starting to notice the oddities that revolve around Trance.Besides the storyline with her brother, I found this to be an amazing read, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new adventure of Andromeda!"},{"Title":"Mastering Home Networking","review":"Falls short if you are looking for a step by step guide on how to implement a Home Network.

This book was my second choice, but I ultimately went for &quot;Networking by Example&quot; by Barry Press (which was especially helpful for people making networks with Linux and Windows in the same network).The Henricks book was easy to follow, clearly explained, and had fairly good diagrams. But once again, I thought the Networking by Example was better."},{"Title":"Mastering Home Networking","review":"Mastering Home Networking, by Mark Henricks, is an informative and entertaining way to learn about how you can network your computers together. I must admit that I am not a big fan of technology books. But this one is a bit different. The author does not treat the reader like an idiot. But at the same time, the author does not treat the reader like a technological genius. The subject matter is treated in a way that both a beginner and a expert can enjoy. If you want to learn how to network your computers together, to enhance your business, make home life simpler, or just for entertainment, this is a great book that will take you through the necessary steps."},{"Title":"Mastering Home Networking","review":"Truly the bible for novice and advanced home networkers.

Several of the photographs of the children, in particular, stopped my heart. Friends who have picked up the book to glance through it have expressed the same feeling. There is a texture to the photographs that makes your fingers twitch to reach in and examine further. I treasure this book."},{"Title":"Shaking the Dust of Ages: Gypsies and Wanderers of the Central Asian Steppe","review":"A poetic journey deep into the lives of the Roma people living in the former republics of the Soviet Union.

She is able to make the reader cry, feel pain and feel what the characters are feeling. I was not disappointed with 'East of Forever' and as a matter of fact, just reinforced my thoughts on Skye.This book is a must-read and one that I couldn't put down until I read the very last word on the very last page. She makes the reader want more and more she has given. Since I myself do martial arts, it was very entertaining and interesting to read about the heroine's exploits and knowledge in that field. There should be more heroines who know that kind of info in these romance novels. It puts a great twist to the story and adds more to the drama. Very good.I applaud Skye and her ability to weave magic within the hearts and minds of her readers. Makes me want to jump into the books and join the fun. Happy readings."},{"Title":"East of Forever","review":"I have read most of the Draycott Abby series and this was the first time that I have read Christina Skye's later books.

The historical accuracy is in depth and there is a lot of suspense along with exciting love story...Christina Skye writes one of the best historical romances next to Kathleen Woodiwis"},{"Title":"East of Forever","review":"This is my first book by Christina Skye and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed it. From the very first chapter I was intrigued. To have such woman who would do anything to save her father. I loved her character and the fact that she wasn't a weak-willed woman, but a strong well-trained warrior. Tony is a wonderful man and you can feel his pain as he reminisces over past experiences. I liked the story line, and the many secondary characters as well. The only flaw was the Epilogue was a bit too confusing. She tried to put too many things into it and it became a bit monotonous. I was waiting for the finish. All in all I must say this is one author that I will be reading more and more of."},{"Title":"East of Forever","review":"I was prepared to like this book, because I am a fan of Christina Skye and have liked many of her other books, such as Come the Night. I've set out on a quest to read all of her books, but boy, was I ever sorry I picked up this one!!My main problem with the book was the glaring number of inconsistencies within the plot line. Maybe it was just poorly edited, but it left me with a very hurried impression, as though Ms. Skye did not read over what she had written before submitting it, and neither, apparently, did anyone else!!In the beginning of the book Chessy, the main character, is supposed to be looking for a Chinese pillow book so that she can give it to the people who are holding her father for ransom. She supposedly has trained extensively and is gifted in the arts of deception and self-protection, even being able to easily spar with her master and trainer. However, I found out later that she trained for ONE year when she was FIFTEEN, and yet we were supposed to believe she was some kind of Jedi Knight, if you will?!? Whaaaat? I am certain that you can hone your skills to a certain extent in a year, but I believe to have the kind of expertise Chessy was purported to have, YEARS of training would be necessary, not just ONE year.Also, in every physical confrontation with Tony, the male love interest of the novel, she REFUSED to use any of her so-called skills. EH??? Did I miss something? This was the hardest part of the novel for me to believe. The only time any explanation was offered, it was that &quot;she couldn't bring herself to hurt him&quot;. Tony even goes so far as to abduct Chessy, and Chessy tries twice to throw herself from a fast-moving carriage rather than simply disarm him and painlessly knocking him out using one of his pressure points, which she has studied. But apparently she would rather risk her own death than put her lover (who she supposedly hates, anyway) to sleep. Then, later, she is accosted on a rooftop after she goes out the window to try and escape from him, and turns into a freezing, helpless female. She was unable to defeat her assailant (the GUY had to do it for her) and quivered like a bowl of jelly. I was enraged by this part--I wanted to scream &quot;Show some spirit! Kick some behind, girl!!&quot; but nooooo, that's not going to happen in this book.As though that wasn't enough, throughout the book, the hero and heroine of the novel never had one conversation. Sure, Chessy remembered good times with Tony from one summer when she was 15 years old. But for the author to expect me to believe that they were suddenly in love, that was just too much! Also, speaking of conversations, all Chessy was able to do was STAMMER. She did this on EVERY PAGE. Pick up the book and look through it a bit, you will see it's true. Whenever she seemed in danger of being able to string more than three words together, she broke off in the middle of her sentence, or was cut off by Tony. This left me with the impression of Chessy as nitwit incapable of coherent thought.Another glaring plot hole was that Chessy had fallen in love with Tony when she was 15, but when he shows up TEN YEARS later, she realizes she's been in love with him all this time. Now, I was in love at 15 too, but if he suddenly showed up again, I honestly don't think I would suddenly realize that I had been in love with him all this time. It would take more than vague memories of my first love ages ago for me to fall in love with him a second time. (Esp. after the way Tony suddenly abandoned Chessy all those years ago). The author expects us to believe there are no other men in a span of ten years. After Chessy meets Tony years later, he has done nothing to MAKE her fall in love with him; he doeesn't woo her in any way. He just wants to have wild sex with her, which is just about all they do, which does not constitute love to me.Chessy was, of course, described as &quot;ravishingly beautiful&quot;, yet she thought she was &quot;ugly&quot;. Come on!! Modesty is good, but let's be realistic. Most people have a fairly good idea of their own attractiveness.We all go into fiction novels knowing that we must have a suspension of disbelief over the unrealities of the novel. I'm sure we all realize there aren't that many men who are so beautiful and virile we are overcome with lust or stricken dumb when we look at them. Likewise, I'm sure there aren't that many women out there who are as fabulously enticing as they are described in books. But that's part of a romance novel, and we realize this. However, I believe Christina Skye asked too much of her readers when she expects us to believe all the problems which suffocated any pleasure I might have derived from reading this particular book. Way too many plot holes!!!If you are a huge Christina Skye fan, I advise you strongly to keep away from this book. Try another of her books such as Bride of the Mist, Come the Night, or Come the Dawn."},{"Title":"No Easy Answers: Bayard Rustin And The Civil Rights Movement (Civil Rights Leaders)","review":"I admire the gumption of Morgan Reynolds Publishing. Each year, as other publishers gin out yet another book about some popular hero, Morgan Reynolds tackles the unsung heroes with grace and clarity. This new book about Bayard Rustin is a perfect example.\\"Bayard who?\\" you're probably asking. Ah...my point exactly. Rustin - grandson of a former slave - was a talented musician, writer, and committed activist, organizer and advisor who worked closely with such luminaries as Martin Luther King Jr. and A. Philip Randolph. He is responsible for introducing Gandhi's principles of nonviolent protest to many in the Civil Rights Movement, and was a backbone of the historic 1963 March on Washington. At the President's request, he counseled Lyndon Johnson on how best to handle the aftermath of King's assassination in 1968. In the 1980's, he counseled Lech Walesa on the use of nonviolent resistance.The reason you've probably never heard of him is because he was also gay. After being prosecuted for a homosexual encounter, he was deserted by many of the movement leaders. But he continued to work tirelessly and bravely behind the scenes, choosing obscurity for the sake of the movement.Obviously, this is a complex topic for the young adult audience, but Miller respects their intelligence and handles his material deftly, without skirting the issues. The book includes a timeline, citations of sources, a bibliography, and related web sites. It is also lavishly illustrated, with archival photos and artwork on about every fourth page.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"No Easy Answers: Bayard Rustin And The Civil Rights Movement (Civil Rights Leaders)","review":"This book should be titled, \\"Everything You Never Knew About the Civil Rights Movement.\\" Of course, the biggest thing most people don't know about is the bed-rock, salt-mine work of Bayard Rustin. Although his name is not included when we speak of this history, this remarkable man seems to have been connected to everyone else in it. Miller does a fantastic job of giving us the whole story, complete with a frank discussion of Rustin's homosexuality. It is easy to assume that Rustin was forced into obscurity by a homophobic society. But--as Miller reveals by including a portion of Rustin's graduation poem--the limelight is something Bayard planned to shun.\\"No Easy Answers: Bayard Rustin and the Civil Rights Movement\\" can serve two purposes. First, it is an excellent resource for school age students (perhaps as early as grade 5). And, it is a good way to explore other civil rights issues. The racial struggle in America shares many of the same characterisitcs as the gay struggle, the immigrant struggle, etc.This book is both informative and entertaining. As the 50th anniversary of Bayard Rustin's famous, well planned March on Washington looms closer, this book is must reading."},{"Title":"A Twist in the Tale (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I am a big fan of Jeffrey Archer. I love his long novels and deep characterizations. This book was a bit different for me. When I first purchased it, I didn't know it was a collection of short stories. After reading the first story, I left it sitting by my beside for several weeks, then picked it up and read the rest in two days. The only reason I set it aside was that it surprised me when the first story ended--that's when I discovered it was a book of short stories. (I enjoy Jeffrey Archer so much that I bought it quickly, just looking at his name on the cover, passing through an airport, not noticing this book was not a novel like all his others.)Most of these stories can be read in 30 minutes, while the first story might take one hour. The book is very appropriately named, because the very end of each story has a bizarrre &quot;twist&quot; that you don't expect. The twist happens literally in the last sentence or two of each story, and the reader is completely surprised.Compared to most novels, these stories move incredibly fast. In spite of that, characterization is revealed well, as the stories move. There is quite a variety in the stories presented--in one story, he even writes as a woman. I highly enjoyed this book. Anyone who enjoys either short stories, or loves Jeffrey Archer's novels will enjoy it, too. The only reason I have rated it four stars instead of five, is that I personally enjoy novels much more than short stories-short stories end far too quickly for me."},{"Title":"A Twist in the Tale (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The modern shortstory, let's face it, is a dying artform. Yes, there are journals and literary magazines dedicated to publishing them but unless the words &quot;Ellery Queen&quot; or &quot;Isaac Asimov&quot; appear on the cover odds are you won't find them on your average magazine stand. It is even more deplorable in bookstores. It is rare to see a collection of shortstories from anyone to whom the phrase &quot;best selling author&quot; applies to. So I find it great that every once in a while Jeffrey Archer serves up a new set of clever yarns. He's published several but this one is the best. The tales are written well and are good entertainment on their own face but he goes the extra mile by pulling surprises in the end. And I do mean the end. Frequently in this set the line that opens your eyes is the final one. Running the gamut from the fairly amusing &quot;The Steal&quot; to the tragic &quot;Christina Rosenthal&quot; there is, if nothing else, something for everyone. Absolutely first rate."},{"Title":"A Twist in the Tale (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"It was the first book I had read from Jeffrey Archer, it would definitely not be my last.

These stories are brilliantly written and they mostly have twists at the end but sometimes midway. I don't really want to get into the plots of any of these stories as otherwise because of the twist I would give it away for people who haven't read the collection yet and I hate it when people do that. Settings are in the kitchen, courtroom and other places and characters roam across the gender and species. Anyway you'll enjoy this collection, just don't waste your money on 'To Cut a Long Story Short' as only the first couple of stories are good in that collection."},{"Title":"A Twist in the Tale (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"A TWIST IN THE TALE is the most exciting of Archer's collection of short stories. The stories simply grip you from the start and you wouldn't guess it right how they would end no matter how hard you try to. They get particularly interesting towards the end.

Sometimes funny, sometimes tragic, always enjoyable.This book is the first Jeffery Archer I have read, but it won't be the last."},{"Title":"A Twist in the Tale (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The inimitable Jeffrey Archer's unravelling of an intricately-woven web of stories in A Twist in the Tale results in an unpredictable, albeit lightweight, mosaic of twelve short stories which bursts forth with tension and exercises a vice-like grip on the reader. Once again, Archer's mastery of the dramatic form, his ear for the way people talk and his sardonic wit make the book an interesting read. One thing is for sure, though, he is one of those [very] good writers for whom boredom is a cardinal transgression and who seems unable to put his foot wrong.After churning out a spate of bestselling novels, like Kane and Abel, The Prodigal Daughter, Shall We Tell The President?, First Among Equals, A Matter of Honour and Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less, Archer has come up with his second collection of short stories; the stories here are nicely paced and neatly concluded, with characters and scenarios that leap from the pages with a vibrancy and raw intensity seldom found in short stories of such nature. The whole collection does not totter on tedium; neither does it lack coherence nor structure; in fact, the pleasure of this work lies in its depiction of the ordinary and mundane.This time, a murky broth of marital tryst, Machiavellian cunning and duplicity, promiscuity, sexual peccadilloes, fraud, corruption, murder, treachery and webs of cunning deceit are all grist to Archer's story-spinning mill. Nothing is what it seems to be and the unexpected never happens at all. The tension never relaxes but keeps on mounting in most of the stories and one reads ravenously, dreading the moment when it all comes to an end. What is more, the conclusions catch you unaware and never cease to surprise with their savage twists.In &#8220;The Perfect Murder&#8221;, a philandering husband calls unexpectedly on his mistress and sees another man leaving her apartment. Accusing her of unfaithfulness, an altercation ensues. In a moment of unbridled rage, he clenches his fist and takes a swipe at her. She dies of a broken jaw and lacerations of the skull. He leaves the scene unobserved and tips off Scotland Yard so that the other man is detained and charged with his mistress' murder. Has he committed &#8220;the perfect murder&#8221;? Indeed, a tantalising and skilfully contrived appetiser to A Twist in the Tale. From this moment, Archer has the reader in his grip and under his spell.Consider also a touchingly full-bodied Jewish-Gentile love affair in &#8220;Christina Rosenthal&#8221; with complex emotional consequences where secrets of the past can change the pattern of the future forever; a heated altercation in a golf clubhouse bar between two cronies in &#8220;The Loopholes&#8221;; a rivalry rooted in a childhood obsession with eating cornflakes and collecting the top flaps of cornflake boxes in &#8220;Not the Real Thing&#8221;; a sexy game of chess with an equally sexy stranger in &#8220;Checkmate&#8221; where the stakes are far, far higher than money; and the ritual of wine-tasting with a bizarre flourish in &#8220;Honour Among Thieves&#8221;. These are some of the better vignettes found in this marvellously entertaining collection of short stories, a collection that whets your appetite and leaves you gasping for more.With Archer's usual display of panache, humour and tremendous imaginative strength, each story is tightly packed with more richness and humanness than many good writers manage to achieve in a single novel. His observation of human quirks and eccentricities is acute, and some of his insights are unusually penetrating. His storytelling flows with ingenious fluidity so that the tales and the characters that people the landscape of his vivid imagination seem to sparkle and come alive, all of which makes this collection consistently entertaining.A Twist in the Tale is a witty and immensely varied collection of short stories well worth putting together. Much of the collection is a joy to read; it is worth reading for its prose alone, which is refreshingly crisp, taut, understated and peppered with irony, and a slightly twisted sense of humour. Archer's sort of prose has a light touch, the hint of a sparkle and an underlying seriousness as evident in his first collection of short stories, A Quiver Full of Arrows. The narrative thread that runs through the fabric of the whole collection is taut, and the tales Archer spin are intriguing, bristling with just enough plot twists and ironies, savage wit and sharp sensory details to hold the reader's interest. Though, indeed, a spare, slender volume, A Twist in the Tale is imbued with excitements and surprises, mirth and wickedness."},{"Title":"A Twist in the Tale (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"two stories at best were worth reading in this book of short stories.i guess i expected far too much as kane and abel is so very awesome[same author]."},{"Title":"A Twist in the Tale (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"After reading Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less and A Twist in the Tale, I'm ready to proclaim Jeffrey Archer King of the Twist. Every story in this collection turns on some unexpected event, point of view, or premise, and about the only thing you can count on is that you will be surprised.While not great literature, A Twist in the Tale does provide some entertaining reading. Though the characters are largely forgettable, Archer's narrative voice provides you with just enough distance that you can enjoy what happens to them and how it happens (Not The Real Thing, Just Good Friends). Some of these stories are reminiscent of Edgar Allen Poe (A Perfect Murder, Colonel Bullfrog).In short, entertaining reading. The kind of book you might pick up at a ski lodge and be able to finish in one sitting."},{"Title":"A Twist in the Tale (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Jeffrey Archer's 1988 collection of twelve short stories is not entitled *A Twist in the Tale* for nothing. The concluding paragraphs of each story--sometimes just the final sentence--inevitably offer the reader some kind of surprise, whether slight and easily swallowed (\\"A La Carte\\") or groan inducing (\\"Just Good Friends\\") or the product of a sort of dishonest storytelling that leaves one feeling ill treated (\\"The Perfect Murder\\"). Among the best of the lot are \\"A La Carte\\"--the story of a young man compelled by his father to delay entering his chosen profession--and \\"Honor among Thieves,\\" in which a wine connoisseur is put to the test by a \\"humbug.\\" But all of the stories (ten of them are reportedly based on actual events) are worth a read. Archer writes in a commendably straightforward style that is easily digested: it is not surprising that, as the jacket copy of the book informs us, Archer has been hailed as \\"the natural successor to Maugham.\\"****See Somerset Maugham's autobiographical *The Summing Up* for his discussion of the three qualities for which he strove in his writing: lucidity, simplicity, and euphony.Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece"},{"Title":"A Twist in the Tale (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The first in this series was much better than twist in the tale.

He's often been found at the top of the New York Times best-selling list.Also top listed is Martin Jarvis, talented stage and film performer who gives voice to these tales of duplicity, cupidity, and suspense. (Jarvis also reads Archer's \\"A Matter Of Honor,\\" another Audio Renaissance edition.)Archer is so skillful that it seems he almost teases the listener by dropping clues that allow us to think we've figured the matter out when we haven't at all.\\"A Twist In The Tale\\" is a bit of a departure for the author as it is a collection of 12 short stories all plot and character driven, all intriguing listening. We find an unfaithful husband who does a great deal more than cheat on his wife , and in another story discover that chess is not just a game.Knowing Archer, we must have a corrupt diplomat, and in another yarn a controlling father learns a sad lesson.Someone once said that a first-rate short story is much harder to write than a full length novel.

Whether you are a first time puppy parent or seasoned dog lover, this book will provide you with tons of useful and up to date information on how to raise and live with your canine best friend. Personally, the advice on throwing out the dog food bowl and replacing it with stuffed chew toys saved my relationship (not to mention my furniture) with my new little guy. What a clever idea!

I have one dog I \\"trained\\" before I read Dr. Dunbar, and one I trained after, and the difference between the experiences was night and day. You'll be forever grateful that you read this book, whether you already have a dog or, ideally, if you're thinking of getting one."},{"Title":"After You Get Your Puppy","review":"Weeks before our pup came home I had been looking for a 'list' of things that needed done. What should I do the first day? What milestones need to be reached by when? Things like that. I only found one website with any list what so ever, and this is the only book so far that I've found with any 'list'. It's not exactly what I've been looking for, but.....best I've found as yet. In the back of the book there are check off lists of things the author, Dr. Ian Dunbar recommends. I wish it were far more extensive but...again best I've found so far.The book repeats it's self several times. His main premise is 'all shelter dogs were once just precious puppies that someone didn't train' There are developmental deadlines for certain traits like bite inhibition, socialization, and others. If training in the specific areas are not done by the age of specific learning times by the pup, ..... It's to late. Like for humans, we can easily learn a second, or third language before 8 years of age, due to that's the part of the brain that is developing. If we attempt a second language at the age of 40, well, it can be done, but, nothing like when we were young. It's like that.He has a book 'before you get your puppy', I think it would be good to read this book also. The two books overlap. The second book would be easier if the first one has already been read. I found this book when my pup was three months old. I am already behind, I so wish I could have found his material before bringing the pup home. If you are getting a pup or know someone who is, please, look into this. Truly, I have found this data no where else. I have 20 books and have been searching web sites for months.The author has a web site. It has quite a bit of useful data. I feel this author is all about educating people and saving animals from misery more than he cares about money. This is refreshing. As a human, I give him 5 paws. I see he has a book that contains both, before you get the puppy and after. That may be a better bargain and easier to read. Do look at the web site. Invaluable data is there.

It goes without saying that Ian is a mentor to me and many others! Through his straight-forward and honest teachings, I've evolved as trainer. He's unique, original and confident enough to continue to evolve himself. His other books and video series are a \\"must have\\" for any serious trainers. I met Ian about 15 years ago at a workshop and then at APDT conferences. To say that he has guided me and is a valued mentor is not enough. He wrote the foreword for my book, Train Your Dog, Change Your Life, encouraged and challenged me! Without Ian, I would never have gotten this published. He encouraged me! He believed in my idea and gave me the confidence to just \\"do it\\". The basis of my book comes from the seeds that he planted, blossoming with my own wisdom and style. He launches sparks that ignite your brain waves ... he encourages open-mindedness. In the process, we learn about ourselves. For that I'm forever grateful and STRONGLY RECOMMEND any of his books and videos.

I was so disappointed when I received the book, from the moment I got a good look at it's cover and read the subtitle (\\"...The Clock Is Ticking!\\"), which I had missed when ordering the book, or I would have thought twice about buying it... This book turned having a delightful puppy into a race against time to prevent having an evil, rotten dog. It took all the fun and optimism out of raising my puppy. I'm glad I stopped reading it, and looked to more upbeat sources for advice on raising my puppy. Many of these sources I found on the internet. I looked to Karen Pryor and her clicker training theories, as well as such books as \\"Boxers for Dummies\\" and \\"The Boxer Handbook\\" and \\"I Just Got A Puppy What Do I Do.\\" All these emphasize the power of bonding with your dog, the pleasures of socializing your puppy, and while they don't downplay the significance of socialization, etc. they don't turn the cute puppy you have just made a part of your family into some ticking timebomb set to go off and bring nothing but pain and misery if not socialized absolutely correctly. I grew up with dogs, in a time before \\"socialization,\\" in a time where you just loved your puppy, and took him places, and tried your best with him/her, and those dogs all turned out fine. I am grateful for all the information that we have these days on how to better raise a puppy to be a happy well adjusted pet, and am doing my best to put that information to good use on my own Boxer puppy."},{"Title":"After You Get Your Puppy","review":"I thought this book was very readable, and full of good, practical information. Yes, there is some repetition of key points, but I even liked that.

Not only did the training information sometimes conflict with virtually every other reputable puppy training guide (I have read about 10 of them) in key aspects, but the author's ego permeates the pages. It's not a pleasant reading experience for a secure mature adult woman. This guy's unprocessed masculinity and control issues don't belong in a puppy training guide!

A poor investment indeed."},{"Title":"After You Get Your Puppy","review":"I'm inclined to believe that some of the \\"rave reviews\\" of this book are written by people who know the author personally. This book was repetitive and the \\"jokes\\" were really quite odd. I don't know much about training puppies yet (although I've been doing a lot of reading on the subject) but I do know quite a bit about good books and this just wasn't one of them. This man gives off the impression through his book that he is the ONLY person who knows how to train a dog correctly, and that \\"bad dogs\\" cannot be saved after their fourth month of living. He also dots this book with blatant sexism, talking about \\"inviting six men over to watch a sports game and play with the dog\\". Also, introducing a dog to over 100 different people before it's three months old? Most people will not adopt out puppies until they're at least 8 weeks old, giving the new owner only 4 weeks to introduce their new puppy to all these people. I'm sorry, but that's completely ridiculous and I've been reading quite a few puppy training books and this guy is the only one who says that.I gave the book two stars since there are some useful tips in the book that I probably wouldn't have thought of, but that are also included in MUCH better puppy-training books.

It's the best historical fiction I have read in a long time."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"Historical fictions are my favorite form of reading and they don't get better than \\"Something of Value\\". It is an extremely well written and historically accurate story; something all historical fictions should seek to be.It takes place in Africa (Kenya), just after WWII, when the whole face of Africa was changing, after the British colonial period was losing its grip on the region. The relationship between the white colonials and the native Africans, which had developed an uncomfortable peace and even some affection between them, was about to become completely undone by the influences of internal resentment and discontent and external political rivals vying for regional power. It culminates in one of the bloodiest massacres called the Mau Mau Rising.The characters in Robert Ruark's book are realistically portrayed; some are compassionate and kind, some cruel beyond all abilities of human understanding. His weaving of the familie's stories and the events of the time presents a realistic, poignant, and tragic story that offers a true understanding of a calamity that one would not otherwise be able to comprehend."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"This book was so accurate and so brutally honest that Ruark was banned from Kenya by the British and the Native Kenyan goverments.For those of you who don't know; Roberk Ruark was THE defining voice in America for Africa in the 1950's. His columns appeared in Field &amp; Stream magazine when EVERYONE read Field &amp; Stream. He was a celebrity with apartments in New York and a villa in Spain. These were the days when rich men ate red meat, went to Africa to &quot;shoot lions&quot; and were disappointed if it didn't charge!If you love African game stories and you belive in the superiority of Western civilization over shamanist tribalism then this book is for you.When the English colonized what is now Kenya it was a true clash of moderns with the Stone Age. These men (and women) had as rough a time as Americans did taming the West. Really more so because the Africans were more numerous than the American Indians and only one or two of our animals would eat you. After years of carving farms out of the harsh African veldt with the permission and support of the Britsh goverment the farmers suddenly found themselves put &quot;out into the cold&quot; by their goverment. The Socialists in England suddenly decided by vote to modernize the Native African from the Stone Age to the Industrial age overnight. From shamans and chiefs to democracy; brought in by &quot;the Winds of Change&quot;. If you ever suspected that you have been lied to about Africa by the Desmond Tutu's and Nelson Mandela's of the world, if you want to know what is going to happen in South Africa in the next 10 years, if you need any more convincing that America's Africa policy caters more to Jesse Jackson than the true &quot;status quo&quot; of Africa, then this is the book for you.Ruark does a brillant job of juxapositioning the issues of tribesman and colonist alike.The politics and violence of MauMau are amazingly similar to the African National Congress.In Ruark's Africa everyone is right; and wrong. All the native born Africans in his book, Black and White alike, believe to the bottom of their soul in what they are doing.I don't think Kipling himself could have captured the essense of Africa any better!"},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"A brilliant work by perhaps one of America's finest authors. The most thought provoking aspect of this classic book was the truth that the Bolshevicks used the same tactics to subvert Kenya that they used before in the Congo and most lately in Peru with Shining Path. Find a down-trodden minority with a genuine reason to be angry in a country you want to de-stabilize, then use a bastarized version of their faith to bind them to your will and cut them loose on the majority you want to terrorize. Even raises questions about the 60's more violent activists in the good old USA and elsewhere. The film version with the brilliant Sidney Poitier and the abysmal Rock Hudson is still a film to rent and enjoy, but the book's power must be experienced first hand. For an old hippie from the 60's, it gave me a new way of thinking of of Jomo Kenyatta and certain other people I encountered in those days. &quot;Uhuru&quot; is the sequel. Ruarks's &quot;The Old Man and the Boy&quot; is probably my favorite book. &quot;Horn of the Hunter&quot; is probably the best pure hunting book by Ruark, who, sadly, drank himself to an early death."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"Ruark's first-hand experience and insight into the events which changed Africa in the middle of this century are a real eye opener. If one really cares to know why and how Africa changed, a lot of it is found in this wonderful historic fiction based upon the evidence of an apparently noble cause gone madly awry. Not for the faint of heart."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"They don't get any better than this. Ruark redefines the novel in this tale of lives bound up in Kenya's struggle for freedom. The last generation of English colonialism meets the first generation of free Kenya, who have nothing left to lose in their struggle.It is all here: the African bush, the 'Safari' life, the strength of people both black and white,passion, adventure, pain and joy.If this book doesn't move you, then nothing will. It is an 'eleven'! I first read it about 15 years ago, and plan to re-read it annually!Kurt Wagner, Hawthorne NJ"},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"Ruark's finest work, this novel focuses on the Mau Mau rising in Kenya but entends to a consideration of many other fundamental issues, from the conflicts between man and woman to those between races. No pat, simplistic answers are provided-- thank God. The lack of resolution at the conclusion of the novel speaks for itself and is, in microcosm, a telling commentary on race relations, today.Ruark was, of course, a &quot;white hunter&quot; of some renown. He did not foresee the rabid anti-hunting movement of today, but speaks of a time when the uncomfortable truth of man-as-predator was not lacquered over with sentimentalist pap. While foreshadowing the &quot;camera safaris&quot; of the placid 90s, Ruark was still able to write of a time when a man could hunt truly dangerous big game. His spare but beautiful prose is, I suspect, what leads so many to carry this book through life as _the_ novel they most remember. Not one word is wasted.This book is not dogma, nor is it truly predictive of the future of Africa. It is meant to be savored by those who still have something of the hunter in their hearts."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"With Uhuru, Something of Value gives an excellent insight into both sides of the story of Mau Mau.

The British entered Kenya with the intent of 'civilizing' the savages. They imposed thier way of life on the natives of Kenya. However, the new values made no sense to the Kenyans. They did not understand the value of the white mans ways.Similarly, todays intellectuals and social elitists are imposing a new value system on America's children. One that has no absolutes, no heroes of substance, no morality or ethics. The children don't know if they are good or bad. They have become value-less because of the lack of value. Nothing more than wondering generalities.When you read this book with this perspective in mind, the reason for a lot of the problems that are occurring today become obvious, American society has become an amorphous blob of do what feels good whenever you feel like it and let someone else take care of you.&quot;Something of Value&quot; is as revealing today as it was back in the '50s. If you read it with an open mind and are willing to draw parallels to today.It is history being repeated."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time.

I could not put it down easily after I got into it. I love Ruark's writing style in that it is like listening to a wild story at a party or a bar. You can almost see the scenery of Kenya as you progress along during the safari, and you can feel the fear as the rebellion of the Mau Mau begins. Like Ruark tells us in the introduction, it is not a &quot;pretty&quot; book, in that it is gruesome and bloody, but I like to think that men anywhere would rise to fight such circumstances."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"I have an original copy but I think it is a great story with just as much truth today as when it was written.

It is part novel and part history lesson. I would recommend it to anyone with a love of travel or Africa."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"I first read this book as a teen ager in the 1960's, and I've probably read it eight or nine times since then. This book introduced me to Robert Ruark and started my life-long appreciation of his works. Something of Value examines clash of civilization between the British settlers and the Kikuyu natives in Kenya after WWII during what became the Mau Mau Rebellion. It examines the causes and consequences of the conflict and how it affected both sides. As I became older, I began to understand the motivations of the characters and their actions. With each rereading, the book changed. It was not only a safari adventure story, but it was also a snapshot of history, a study of human psychology, and a search for recognition and justice. I know I'm paraphrasing, but the opening Bantu proverb, &quot;If you do away with the traditions of the past, then you must first replace them with Something of Value&quot; definitely and perfectly describes the book. When Ruark wrote about the conflict, he examined how people on both sides were torn from what they knew and had cherished in the past and were thrown unprepared into the future. He examines foreign and unfamiliar ideology, how it affects us, and what its consequences are. Finally, despite the cruelty, blood, and horror in the book, he examines the nobility of human beings and what it means to us. This book has changed the way I view the world because I now can appreciate both the view of the fox and the hound. If great writing enables us to finds new and deeper meaning with each rereading, then &quot;Something of Value&quot; is great literature."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"I spent three of the most impressionable years of my live in Kenya in the early '70's as a State Department dependant. Even then, the Mau Mau uprising had a strong influence on day to day life in Kenya. Gun control laws were among the most strict in the world and for good reason. During my three years in Kenya I heard many stories from people who lived through the emergency. Most of these stories made Stephen King novels sound like childrens' tales. I could not count the times I've read both Uhuru and Something Of Value and each time they have taken me back in time to the Norfolk or New Stanley hotel. Everything about the book, from the safaris, to the uprising, are totally authentic. While this is not a &quot;feel good&quot; book, anyone who has a interest in East African history, or just wants to read on of the great books of this century MUST read this book. Even though this is a book of fiction, it should be required reading for anyone studying the history of Kenya. Make no mistake, most of the things written about in this book, no matter how disturbing, actually happened."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"When it was first published in 1955 &quot;Something of Value&quot; was a novel right out of the headlines, set in contemporary Kenya during the time of the Mau Mau rebellion which were the last years of British colonial rule. Now it has aged into an historical novel. The largest part of the novel concerns two men, once childhood friends: Kimani, a Kenyan Kikuyu, and Peter, a British settler. They grow up together on a farm in the &quot;white highlands&quot;, Kimani is the son of a farmhand, Peter the son of the owner. They imagine themselves working together as adults, as gunbearer and white hunter, guiding tourists on hunting safaris. Instead they become adversaries during the Mau Mau. Ruark tells a good story though the book is a bit long in places. Throughout the novel, the depictions of both African and British characters is remarkably balanced and fair. Ruark is one of the few white writers of the 1950s to provide a sympathetic and (apparently) informed view of African (particularly Kikuyu) culture. It is the clash of Kikuyu and British cultures, as British law is applied to traditional Kikuyu custom that is the impetus for Kimani to join the rebellion. It would be interesting to know if all of the novel's details of the Mau Mau oaths are accurate. The female characters are a bit one dimensional; this is a book about hunting, warfare, and the world as seen by men. Overall, a very good book, especially for anyone interested in Kenya and the end of colonialism.

It's an obscure book today, but it holds a special place in my heart and mind, and has so for nearly my entire life. I first read it in the late 1950's, when I was a young teenager. The adventure and graphic violence was probably shocking to me then, but the book inspired me to make reading about Africa and it's history a serious hobby back then.I read the book the second time when I was an adult in my 30's. I found a tattered paperback edition in a used book store. It was just as exciting to me then as it was many years before. By then I had two daughters, and I told them of my &quot;favorite book.&quot;Last Christmas, my youngest daughter, who was then 19, gave me an ORIGINAL edition, which still had the paper jacket. When I opened the gift, tears welled up in my eyes. WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS BOOK?Ruark's style was wonderful, and his way of developing a story was terrific. Read this book."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"I am absolutely thrilled and honored to write the first Amazon review of Something of Value, though a little amazed as well. Has this truly great, epic novel of Africa been so completely forgotten?Robert Ruark was sometimes called \\"the poor man's Hemingway,\\" but that's just because he wrote about Africa without lapsing into the pseudo-intellectual vagueness that leaves so many of Papa's readers (come on, admit it) wondering what the devil he was talking about. While Hemingway was boozing in Cuba and writing about fish, and ten years before Capote invented \\"fictional journalism,\\" Ruark was writing about life, death and sheer bloody terror in East Africa, and leaving nobody in any doubt about it. When you get to the end of Something of Value, you won't be scratching your head, pondering philosophic conundrums. You'll be wiping your brow with a shaking hand, just bloody glad you weren't there.To oblivious, Eisenhower-era Americans, Africa was Tarzan and King Solomon's Mines. (Several local members on the crew of John Ford's Mogambo, filmed during the uprising, were later arrested as Mau Mau. Imagine if Clark Gable, Ava Gardner or Grace Kelly had been hacked to death in their tents.) Robert Ruark -- ex-reporter and big-game hunter, just arrived for his second African safari -- was the right man in the right place at the right time to pen a one-of-a-kind tale of Africa, brilliantly simple in concept, brilliantly stunning in execution. Two men -- one white, one black, raised as brothers in colonial Kenya -- are caught up, as are their peoples, in the Terror: a vicious, bloody uprising that degenerates into a slogging war of racial extermination. Savage mutilations. Horrific blood rituals. Incest. Cannibalism. Bloody-handed atrocities committed on both sides. Ruark not only doesn't sugarcoat it, he documents it. (He drew on actual events for several scenes and characters.) Something of Value, its sweeping scope and universal theme spattered with Manson-level depravity and violence, must have hacked white-bread, Peyton Place America's skull open like a bloody machete aimed right at the face.Published in April 1955, the novel was an instant, massive bestseller, with more than a million copies ultimately sold in over ten languages. It spawned a predictably mediocre movie starring Rock Hudson, Sidney Poitier and the lovely and perfectly cast Dana Wynter. With its simplistic politics, sanitized violence and utterly stupid ending, the film is a poor black & white shadow of the full Technicolor, Cinemascope-sized novel. Blunt as a club, sharp as a saw-backed bush knife, this book drags us readers by the hair, kicking and screaming, out of our comfortable sleep and into the African night.Though it doesn't make him wrong, Ruark's take on the downfall of empire has been overridden by the modern, politically correct view of colonialism, which assumes that everyone in Africa is now better off because they aren't white-ruled. Anybody who wrote this book today would almost certainly be vilified as a racist (watch for subsequent reviews; I give myself a better than 50-50 chance of catching the same flak, just for praising it), which is probably why Something of Value has been largely forgotten. Thing is, Mau Mau set the pattern for every subsequent African uprising. This sort of racial, intertribal violence is still going on right now, in Zimbabwe, the Congo, Sudan, and a slew of other sub-Saharan countries, and we all try hard to forget about that, too. Something of Value is Africa's War and Peace. It's Kenya's Sand Pebbles. And if you read one novel about the African Question, this is the one.

Ruark shows the mistakes the British had made in &quot;civilzing&quot; the largest native tribe in Kenya, the Kikyuyu, taking their customs away and replacing them with nothing they could relate to and how this lack of &quot;something of value&quot; allowed the Mau-Mau to grow until it consisted of 90% of the male Kikyuyu population. It is, in many ways, an old, old story of culture clash, but seldom is the story told so powerfully.

It is also a tremendous piece of writing, the like of which comes along only every few years. Ruark traveled in Africa during this challenging period and as a news correspondent, held pre-eminent qualifications to write the story. I have re-read it several times since John loaned it to me.

The strengths and the faults of both European and African/Kikuyu culture are carefully delineated, so that the reader can see the causes and, perhaps, inevitability of the Mau Mau uprising quite clearly. While the Kikuyu were brutal by European standards, it seems most of the reviews I read here miss the point. Yes, the white settlers in Kenya came in and imposed their values on the indigenous blacks, treating them as inferiors, almost as pets. Yes, the white settles were kind, improving health care, imposing peace, and so on -- albeit with a great degree of condescension Yes, by present-day, &quot;civilized&quot; standards, the reaction of the Kikuyu in the excesses of the Mau Mau were unconscionable. But the author prefaces the book with a Basuto proverb: &quot;If a man does away with his traditional way of living and throws away his good customs, he had better first make certain that he has something of value to replace them.&quot; The Kikuyu had their traditions stripped away, but the Europeans gave them nothing with which to replace them. The Kikuyu then created something horrible to fill the void. Tragic."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"......Like the reviewer from Kenya, I lived through an African horror show... but in Rhodesia (present day Zimbabwe...)

His descriptions of and understanding of Kenya of a half century ago are superb and fascinating. Novels rarely teach anything today because the writers seldom know anything. Ruark knew Kenya.His weakness is his bad habit of telling rather than showing. There are only a handful of action scenes in this novel and they are dull and without tension. He knows little about fighting with hands or guns. In the scene with the lady farmers fighting off the mau mau, he has one drop a huge man with a long shot to the neck with a .22. Ridiculous. He then has them murder their house boys who are cowering in hiding. One must respect the honesty, whether or not intended.The culminating fight between Peter and Kimani he has the Peter bend back the wrist of the evenly matched black and break his elbow. An expert in martial arts might do this. A farmer could not.The blacks speak well and simply, but his white dialog is so smart, glib and cute that it can barely be read without nausea. All the trite conventions are here. The women drink like men and talk like sailors. Every line is sarcasm, quip and slang. No one ever says they are off to take a bath without saying they're off to \\"wash off the soil.\\" No one ever talked like this outside a novel of a movie---not even in the fifties when sarcasm and faux-sophistication were thought clever.His portrayal of white's thinking about and treatment of blacks as loyal dogs is true if nauseating. He portrays the relationships and attitudes of blacks and whites as honestly as he knows how. The whites here are no angels, but are as barbaric and murderous as the blacks. That I respect coming from a man who obviously sympathized with the whites."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"This book was made into a movie and had Sir Winston Churchill do the opening narration.The Kenya of the Birtish Empire was one of aristocrats gone farming. Blacks of eastern Africa -- especially the Kikuyu -- wanted to take power from the whites and subjugate the remaining tribes -- the Masai for example.While the term &quot;Mau Mau&quot; has no basis in any African language it quickly took on the nightmarish -- goulish meaning of disembowelment, slaughter, terror.There is abundant evidence that the Mau Mau took the rituals of the Christian church and turned them into ceremonies encouraging brotherhood in the Mau Mau society. These rituals included drinking human blood laced with semen and urine followed by a meal of human infants exhumed or murdered for the occasion.It should be interesting to note that the body of Dr. Gray Arundel Leakey -- patriarch of the archaeological family of Olduvai Gorge fame -- was made part of one of these ceremonies.While it is popular to blame the white man for every fault in the human condition it will take a real stretch to blame pedantic English Aristocrats for native chapels decorated with human intestines, gouged eyes and exhumed bodies."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"While many will say that the terror of the 1950s in Kenya was the White Man's fault those same people will be hard pressed to blame the Congo, Rwanda, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Sierra Leone and more all on the &quot;invading whites&quot;.Ruark's book tells it like it was in the 1950s.

Upon investigation and reading the many positive customer reviews here, I ordered this one. Very early in this book one of the main white characters a \\"Mr Mackenzie\\" grabs his sjambock whip and beats his black farm help with it I put the book down. From reading the reviews apparently this book is a fictional but realistic story of the Mau Mau revolt. And I was intrigued to read a review of one customer who claims to have actually lived in Kenya and does indeed say this book is \\"pretty accurate\\". Despite having never lived in Africa and only read about the country, I would think there would be something humanly wrong with the Mau Mau if they didnt revolt against this treatment. I am a bit of a writer myself so after reading \\"Horn of the Hunter\\" I did some investigating of Ruark. It turns out he had a very long and well known battle with alcoholism and eventually died from it.

Gray is one of the very few translators who can come close to doing justice to Hafiz. Forget Ladinsky; if you want to get an idea what Hafiz really said, get Gray. To correct a misconception, the convention in Sufi poetry is to invoke Allah as a woman, lover of the male human Sufi. That's why so many Sufi poems are about love for women named Layla or Salma. The Sufi vision of God tends to be female. This is more explicit in Arabic Sufi poetry, because Arabic uses gender unlike Persian. Muhyi al-Din ibn al-\`Arabi said in Arabic we can call Allah either huwa 'He' or hiya 'She', the latter because the ultimate Divine Essence (al-Dhat) is Feminine. The genderless Persian pronoun leaves an interesting ambiguity that you can't duplicate in English, but by calling God &quot;She,&quot; Elizabeth T. Gray is well within the authenticity of the Sufi poetic tradition. I have heard her speak about how she discovered these poems, and read Hafiz aloud; she told of her deep spiritual connection with these poems and the divine love they inspired in her, and of her visit to Hafiz's tomb in Shiraz. The poet himself must be smiling from Heaven upon seeing her presenting his poems to us moderns with such love and care."},{"Title":"The Green Sea of Heaven: Fifty Ghazals from the Diwan of Hafiz (Library of Persian: Text and Contexts in Persian Religions and Spirituality)","review":"Gray's translations are about as true, in both form and content, to the original as one can get. Unlike other dispensers of Hafiz (like Ladinsky), Gray actually speaks Persian, and follows the Persian closely, instead of finding what she wants to fit fads like new-age spiritualism. The English-facing-Persian format makes the book particularly useful for those who have a basic command of Persian, but are not fluent enough with the language to read exclusively the original texts."},{"Title":"The Green Sea of Heaven: Fifty Ghazals from the Diwan of Hafiz (Library of Persian: Text and Contexts in Persian Religions and Spirituality)","review":"I really enjoy reading this book. A warning though is in order when one encounters Sufi poetry. Often one might draw a false conclusion from reading Sufi poems that men like Hafez are nothing more than a drunk, alcoholic womanizers who can think of nothing but wine and women and whatever else that comes with these combinations. Those who understand Sufis and Sufi poetry in this manner are most likely projecting their own selves into Hafez and his like. Proper understanding of Sufis is possible only if one takes time to understand their &quot;language&quot;, a language which all great Sufis have chosen very carefully to express their inner being, and unlike most modern men, their inner being was/is not confined behind the zipper though this may be impossible to imagine for 21st century men."},{"Title":"The Green Sea of Heaven: Fifty Ghazals from the Diwan of Hafiz (Library of Persian: Text and Contexts in Persian Religions and Spirituality)","review":"Gray's Green Sea of Heaven is not a bad book. In fact, is a more or less good one, and infinitely saner than the deceptively marketed doggerel penned by Ladinsky. The fifty ghazals are translated into a more or less literal (but literary) English idiom, and are accompanied by the original en face along with a (somewhat misleading) introduction by Daryush Shayegan.First off, the selection: the fifty ghazals are chosen out of Hafiz' mammoth corpus of over 400 poems. This means that they cannot even be representative of all of Hafiz' various abilities and lyrical tricks. The selection here seems, to me anyway, to be calculated to portray Hafiz as a religious, more Sufi-inclined poet in keeping with the American image/stereotype he has acquired. Almost all the great mystically-flavored poems are here including \\"saaqi be nur-i baade\\", \\"dar azal partow\\", \\"saalhaa del talab\\" and others.However, what this volume (like most partial translations of Hafiz' work) lacks is poems displaying the other sides of Hafiz' lyrical genius: the bibulously amatory \\"Agar aan turk-i shiraazi,\\" the heartbreaking lamentation for the city of Shiraz fallen to tyranny \\"yaarii andar kas nemibinam\\", and more carnal love-lyrics. This, I feel, is truly problematic. If there's one thing I find disturbing about the modern Western presentation of Hafiz, it's the idea that he was just a \\"Sufi poet\\" like Rumi (is it any wonder that people who claim to like Rumi in the west often also claim to like Hafiz?) True, he was and is a deeply spiritual poet whose faith often transcended the narrow boundaries set up by religious legal authorities. However, he was also a carnal lover, a drinker of very real (and very non-spiritual) wine and a man deeply attached to his hometown. Hafiz deserves to have his full story told.Now, about the translations: they're as good as one could expect, given the limits that Elizabeth Gray has set for herself. She does not permit herself much invention, attempts to maintain as much of the polysemy of the original as possible and relies on footnotes to supply the much-needed context for readers who don't know Persian. The result is not great poetry, or even good poetry, but okay poetry that neither fully avails itself of the resources of the English literary tradition nor expands its boundaries in the manner of Ezra Pound.Often, Gray's Hafiz, shorn of the connective music of rhyme and meter, merely sounds like flat, plodding surrealist modernism, or simply prose with line-breaks. For example, take the following incredibly musical lineHame kaaram ze khwod kaami be badnaami keshid aariAll lovely \\"-aami\\"s and \\"-aar\\"s with a rhythm that simply carries you on to the next line. However, for this, Gray gives us\\"In the end, my life has drawn me from self-concern to ill-repute.\\"As an impromptu translation on a Persian test, this might eke out a passing grade, but, as poetry, this line is a complete waste of the reader's time and effort. In addition to failing musically, it doesn't even convey the line's meaning: the speaker (in both love affairs and art) has lead a wanton life of self-interest and this has brought him the opprobrium of others. \\"life has drawn me from self-concern to ill-repute\\" echoes the syntax of the Persian in a way that completely obscures the intended meaning. Granted, I just chose one of Gray's worst lines. There are poems where she manages to acquit herself fairly well and produce decent, unremarkable English poetry. I simply find that putting a book's flaws on display is a better way to assess it's worth than by lauding it's finer moments.English readers do not yet have a translation of Hafiz capable of expressing the poet's musical and lyrical genius in anything approaching a satisfactory manner, without developing a dysfunctional relationship with Anglophone aesthetics. That day will come. It may in fact come quite soon: Dick Davis' \\"The Faces of Love: Hafiz and the Poets of Shiraz\\" promises to be a momentous occasion for Hafiz in English when it comes out in late 2010 (from what I've read of early pre-publication excerpts anyway.)In conclusion:Buy this book if you want to have an intellectual introduction to the mystical side of Hafiz. If you want to experience it as pure poetry, I'm afraid not many of these poems will completely satisfy.(As a side note, I also noticed that, in at least one case, the text from which the English was translated seemed to have come from a different edition of Hafiz' work than the one used to print the Persian text on the facing pages. On page 89, the second half of the eighth couplet reads \\"the sorcerers tried before Moses.\\" The facing Persian on page 88, however, reads \\"Saameri pish asaa o yad-e beyzaa mikard,\\" where \\"Saameri\\" translates as \\"the Samaritan\\" rather than as \\"the sorcerers.\\" \\"Sorcerers\\" would be \\"Saaheri\\", instead.)"},{"Title":"The Green Sea of Heaven: Fifty Ghazals from the Diwan of Hafiz (Library of Persian: Text and Contexts in Persian Religions and Spirituality)","review":"I strongly recommend this book. The translations are beautiful (and are direct translations, not renderings). The notes on each poem are extensive, and I find them alone interesting to read. My only qualm is that I think the cover's a little ugly, but I suppose you can always tape a nice picture over it.(And of course, I would be remiss not to warn anyone interested in Hafiz away from a certain Daniel Ladinsky. Ladinsky invents his own original poetry and markets it as the work of Hafiz. It seems almost impossible to look up Hafiz without coming across this man's words falsely attributed to Hafiz.)"},{"Title":"The Green Sea of Heaven: Fifty Ghazals from the Diwan of Hafiz (Library of Persian: Text and Contexts in Persian Religions and Spirituality)","review":"Yet another stiff, unimaginative version of the great poet Hafiz.

Although the book is done in excellent taste, the words do not move well together (many translations). Referring to God as a female was both confusing and awkward to me. As a general rule most masters refer to God (the Doer) as male, and the soul (man or woman) as female. Thus, if we read about Hafiz making love to his lord, we know that it is a joining or merging of the soul (female), which is not the same as our so called worldly love. Maybe there is a good reason why the relationship is expressed this way.If you're not familiar with Sufi terminology, you will have a tough time understanding the work, without continually bouncing to the beginning or end of the book and searching out the word's meaning. Even though the book's translation is dry and flat there is still great truths hidden in the work. This type of material is better translated by someone with poetic style or better yet someone with personal experience.I give this book a low rating, however, if you like to read a book and value the intellectual and historical data, then this might be the book for you.

I'm willing to read the next one by this author, but I wish that writers would really surprise me a little more often."},{"Title":"Magical Four-Patch and Nine-Patch Quilts","review":"Though I love her work, I am disappointed in Porcella's new book. Not only do the projects lack her work's usual vibrancy, but the diagrams and directions contain inaccuracies--for example, a drawing shows a strip of seven 2-inch squares as being the same length as a 20-inch strip.It's too bad--I really looked forward to receiving the book. Oh well, maybe taht will teach me not to buy pre-pub."},{"Title":"Magical Four-Patch and Nine-Patch Quilts","review":"I love Yvonne Porcella's work. It has a distinctive look, filled with simple shapes and bright primary colors. Sadly, most of that is missing in this book. I can just hear the publisher telling her to use varied palettes to appeal to more people. Who knows? Maybe she will. But somehow I can't see the repro and plaid crowd wanting to make her freeform quilts. If they want to, there are instructions for how to assemble a conglomeration of 4-patch and 9-patch units with spacer strips. In trying to please everyone, the book ended up being neither traditional nor contemporary and all the magic is missing."},{"Title":"Magical Four-Patch and Nine-Patch Quilts","review":"Great creativity is sometimes born of impatience, and this seems to be the case with Yvonne Porcella, who says she never has made a large quilt using a repeated block because \\"I do not like the precision required to measure and calculate fabrics to make a large quilt.\\" Instead, she thinks up magical numbering schemes, fiddles with brightly colored strips of fabric, and makes eye-popping quilts out of simple elements. In this book she shares her clever techniques in great detail and with lots of examples. Some reviewers have carped that Porcella departs from her usual bright primary palette in this volume, but it is nowhere written that an artist can't experiment with other styles and appeal from time to time to other color sensibilities. The primary purpose of the book is to teach a highly formalized technique, and the variety of color choices shows that it works as well for country plaids as for high contrast."},{"Title":"Magical Four-Patch and Nine-Patch Quilts","review":"I was sorry to see this book had such a low review and wanted to add a stronger plus. It was one of the first quilt books I bought and it got me thinking out of the box. I enjoy it and still go back and look through it for ideas. Now that I know Yvonne Porcella's work better, this book does demonstrate a generally more pallid palette of color but it is a good book for a beginner that would like to explore making irregularly patterned quilts."},{"Title":"Magical Four-Patch and Nine-Patch Quilts","review":"Sadly,this book lacks variety in the patterns. It is basicly a one technique book showing several layout and color variations. The biggest dissappointment is the uninspiring color combinations in the pictures.

I am making a second quilt from the book and now I'm remembering why I never used the book after the first time. She has you cut way more fabric than you actually need, AND the instructions are often incomplete so pieces don't fit the way they are illustrated which is very frustrating even for a VERY experienced quilter which I am (which is also possibly why I do most of my own designes now....no worries about following instructions....). I am going to write a note to myself and put it into the book...cut as you go...and don't believe the instructions....."},{"Title":"Magical Four-Patch and Nine-Patch Quilts","review":"I am sorry I bought this book. Perhaps the author has an artistic vision which works for her, but these photos of her quilts look very amateurish. The directions are poor. She states she started this method because she had trouble getting her blocks/seams to match. Her solution is to take a row of blocks, add random strips of fabric, then square it up after it is finished. One does not need to spend money on a book to learn how to do this. Please find a book that has good patterns or can teach you something about quilting."},{"Title":"Magical Four-Patch and Nine-Patch Quilts","review":"This book summarizes all things four or nine patch quilting.

It is an amazing story and a detailed look behind the veil of Saddam Hussein's regime.Before I read the book, I was 50/50 on our need to take military action against Saddam. Now I am convinced it is necessary."},{"Title":"Saddam's Bombmaker : The Terrifying Inside Story of the Iraqi Nuclear and Biological Weapons Agenda (Lisa Drew Bks.)","review":"i loved this book. the technical details are explained in a manner that a non-physicist can understand but still include more details than any other book i can recall. for example, tom clancy's Sum of All Fears had me convinced that building a small nuclear weapon was a 6 month project. Obviously this is not the case.Anyway, i am a little perturbed by some of the negative comments here. I'll try to address them a little:timeline confusing - i disagree. the first few pages describe the climax of the book, Dr. Hamza's midnight drive to the border with an agent he barely knew. then the book tells the whole story, in order from beginning to endtoo autobiographical - again i disagree. perhaps if i was looking for a rundown on the state of iraq's weapons program i would be disappointed but the title of the book is his bombMAKER - the story of a PERSON. so i expected a first-person narrative. beyond that point, the book was immensely enjoyable precisely because of Dr. Harza's terrific ability to weave his personal story with the historic fact. A dry objective listing of names, dates, and events would have bored me to tears, but reading about how each event impacted someone's life, often with life-or-death consequences, made me unable to stop reading. i was actually up until 5 am two nights in a row because i couldn't put it down :)the hypocrisy - i don't think anyone can judge him for making the decisions he made. throughout the book he makes repeated apologies and admits to personal weaknesses that kept him in a \\"gilded cage,\\" a phrase he used often to describe the situation of the elite in iraq. i never once had any impression that he felt anything but regret andd horror at the events of the past 20 years.poorly edited - i disagree again. i'm quite a good spller :) regardless of my typos in this hastily written review. i find a few mistakes in almost every book, but in this book i found none. i think most of the writing was excellent actually. i don't recall one passage that distracted me from the story because of editing errors or poorly written prosehearsay about torture - well, i'm not sure what you imagine it was like, but i don't think there is a weekly newsletter that published reports of all the people tortured and killed. how else could he possibly know about these things except as rumors or from personal conversations with close associates?too much travel - on the contrary i found the middle section describing all the trips to be compelling and convincing. the fact that so much work was being done in the black market belied that reality behind the story - you can't get a smart high school student to make a bomb. and it often helped show how saddam was \\"everywhere\\" thus helping to explain his feeling of helplessness. the trips also included most of the humor in the book, when he described the exploits of the idiotic \\"intelligence\\" agents.i wish there were another 500 pages left to read. i got on the web this morning to try to find Dr. Hamza's site, hoping that he has written anything new, even diaries about a new dog or cat, because the book was just so enjoyable."},{"Title":"Saddam's Bombmaker : The Terrifying Inside Story of the Iraqi Nuclear and Biological Weapons Agenda (Lisa Drew Bks.)","review":"This is a compelling story of one man's journey to hell and back. The book is extraordinary, frightening and unfortunatley, a realistic portrait of Saddam Hussein's Iraq. Although the story details the escape of Dr. Hamza, there is so much more to the story that goes beyond the account of one individuals freedom and liberation. The book gives a chilling account of the inhumane regime of one of the planets truly bad guys. The book reveals Saddam to be a very dangerous man that will go to any lenghts to achieve his desires. In this case it is a nuclear weapon, not to mention the much known about biological weapons of mass destruction. This creep uses his own people for guinea pigs. His dastardly regime eliminates opposition and uncooperative scientists at will. He not only murders anyone in his way but tortures them before killing them. If need be, to emphasize the point, Saddam does it himself. No one is safe, the families of anyone crossing Saddam are the first to &quot;disappear.&quot; Those that cooperate and are trusted are given a privileged life that includes state sponsored homes, high salaries and a new luxury Mercedes Benz to get around. There are perks for those that can live with the fear of suddenly being on Saddams wrong side. All of this makes the story even more amazing and truly fascinating. A true story that shows how one man lived through the hell and made a daring escape, risking his life as well as his families, with the help of the CIA to escape from Saddams Iraq. The story has the best elements of a good spy novel, only this is the real deal. It is a book that is hard to put down, full of intrigue but it also gives insight into daily life, in a secret Iraq, under Saddam Hussein. The book details the clandestine bomb program, dating back to the seventies, through it's peak in 1993-94 and culminating with Dr. Hamza's safe reunion with his family in 1996. Get this book for a portrait of evil inside Irag."},{"Title":"Saddam's Bombmaker : The Terrifying Inside Story of the Iraqi Nuclear and Biological Weapons Agenda (Lisa Drew Bks.)","review":"Few of us who fulfill our youthful ambitions as adults do so at the cost of being jailed, tortured and forced to flee from our homeland. Khidhir Hamza, an Iraqi scientist, was happily teaching college in America, when he was ordered back home. Despite having almost nothing in the way of workable plans, Saddam, determined to develop nuclear weapons, charged Hamza and others with this task. Despite many obstacles, not the least of which was Saddam's mercurial leadership, the goal was reached. But many of Hamza's colleagues were jailed or put to death, causing the author to finally take the bravest step of all - getting himself and his family safely out of Iraq. A real thriller made even more horrifying by the fact that it's all non-fiction."},{"Title":"Saddam's Bombmaker : The Terrifying Inside Story of the Iraqi Nuclear and Biological Weapons Agenda (Lisa Drew Bks.)","review":"&quot;The Egyptian belly dancers jiggled across the stage, shaking their bellies like quivering bowls of cr&egrave;me brulee. The oudh players strummed themselves into a dither. The violinists sawed away. (p. 85).&quot;This book tells and engaging and important story, even if it is told through often amateurish prose which sometimes reads more like the product of a high school creative writing class than a bestseller. The author is entitled to some forgiveness since he is not writing in his native language and his expertise is in physics and not literature. However, he does have a distracting propensity towards clich&eacute; phrases and awkward simile. Does cr&egrave;me brulee really quiver?I make this point only because other reviews have described the writing as &quot;superb.&quot; I respectfully disagree. I enjoyed this book, but not because it is superbly written. I found the writing to boorish and tired, but the story itself to be enthralling. While the book may lack some elements of style, it tells the interesting story of Khidmir Hamza who headed Iraq's atomic bomb program. This is a tale that is at the same time fascinating and frightening. If you find the author to be credible, then the book gives you insight into Iraq's horrific and brutal regime.While I enjoyed this book, I do have some criticisms. First, there is the difficulty with some of the prose that I illustrated above. Second, it is the story of Khidmir Hamza. The author is writing his autobiography and not an analysis of the political or military status of Iraq. While Saddam Hussein and his regime are interwoven, this is secondary. Indeed, much of what the author writes about Hussein are things that Hamza heard said or suspected may have happened. A fair amount of what he retells is actually nothing more than rumor. When he speaks of torture or murder, its usually prefaced with a statement that he had heard that this had happened. However, he never actually witnessed much of that he writes about nor did he speak directly to persons who had. Sometimes the direct witnesses/victims disagreed with his accounts, but he suspected they were lying. A lot of the sensational aspects of the book are truly based upon gossip. While gossip is sometimes true, it isn't always and eyewitness testimony or direct knowledge would have been more compelling. Thirdly, as some other reviewers have alluded to, Hamza himself has a bit of a credibility problem. Some of what he writes does not ring true. Hamza came to the United States, studied atomic physics at premier institutions, returned to Iraq, began attempting to manufacture an atomic bomb for the purpose of killing civilians, used guile and deception to obtain parts, supplies and research data under false pretenses, but accepts virtually no culpability for his actions. Despite the fact that these efforts made him wealthy and brought him into the inner circle of the Palace with all the privileges that entailed, the author portrays himself as an unwitting and seemingly helpless victim. He would have us believe that the prestige, gourmet food and alcohol, expensive cars, gifts of money were all things thrust upon him that he never sought out nor wanted.This is a gripping book and may be worthy of your time if you are interested. However, I believe that you need to approach any book with an obvious political agenda with a little bit of skepticism. While elements of this book are probably true, the impression that the author sanitized his role in the events detracts from the credibility of what he writes."},{"Title":"Saddam's Bombmaker : The Terrifying Inside Story of the Iraqi Nuclear and Biological Weapons Agenda (Lisa Drew Bks.)","review":"Dr. Khidir was my professor at school back home, Iraq.

(Back in the cold-war Soviet defectors wrote lousy books, this fellow from Iraq is OK). I first heard about this book on a Iraqi-exile bulletin board and there have not been any negative comments posted about it to that bulletin board. The book appears to be the genuine article.

The book gives an incredible first hand account of what life was like under Saddam for a high rank offical, which the author is. The author was a man who worked on (and later headed) the Iraqi nuclear program, and goes into how Saddam sought for decades anything that would help the nuclear program along. Dr. Hamzah also shows the complete lack of interest the IAEA had in Iraq's nuclear program. He also shows how France, who Saddam bought a nuclear reactor from, had no interest what so ever in why Saddam wanted a reactor. He shows that all the French were interested in was making money. However, Dr. Hamzah does not bore the reader with just talk about nuclear programs and highly complex nuclear science. He also tells the reader what living under Saddam was like and how NO one was safe from Saddam. In addition to all that I have stated above, the author has tells how the CIA during the 90's did not help the author escape from Iraq and just sat on their hands. The escape from Iraq by the author is just one of many great parts in the book. Overall, the book is a great read and I would recommend to anyone interested in the former Iraqi regime, Saddam, or his never ending quest for nuclear weapons."},{"Title":"Saddam's Bombmaker : The Terrifying Inside Story of the Iraqi Nuclear and Biological Weapons Agenda (Lisa Drew Bks.)","review":"Now that we have him, can't wait for the trial.

Just enough technical detail is included to whet the appetite of the reader.

It is an attempt to cash in on 9-11.Basically, in atomic research you need lots of industrial equipment, like the South African and Israeli governments bought or developed (from other advanced nations). Iraq has nothing close to this. Yes, Iraq can build a dirty bomb, or crude air dispersed chemical weapon, but the big boys (UN Group of 5) have the real tools.

Many times throughout the book I kept being surprised at the overall cruelty of Saddam. The details of how hard the government of Iraq tried to develop nuclear weapons is interesting and a bit scary. Unfortunately, like so many things in this world, if you have the money you can usually buy what you are after. Luckily in this case, Saddam ran out of time. The one bright spot was the large amount of time and money that was wasted on projects that did not succeed.

I would frequently find time to take breaks from other activities to read another chapter.His narrative might be a bit too technical for some, but mostly it is a fast-paced and frightening account of what was, and undoubtedly still is, going on in Iraq and the complicity of many foreign countries (our &quot;Allies&quot;?) in supplying the necessary materials, knowledge and personnel to help Iraq in not only their Nuclear program but also their Chemical and Biological warfare efforts.Would that our Government would take note of what is contained in this book!"},{"Title":"Saddam's Bombmaker : The Terrifying Inside Story of the Iraqi Nuclear and Biological Weapons Agenda (Lisa Drew Bks.)","review":"Khidir Hamza presents a truly unique view of two antipodal societies--neither fully appreciated by most Americans. His insider's view of Iraq shows the desperation and danger than entraps the innocent populace under Saddam Hussain's megalomaniac reign. Likewise, his eventually fulfilled lifetime longing for the bounties of America shows a patriotic appreciation for the freedoms most native born citizens spend theirs lives taking for granted.His authentic story would stretch the boundaries of the most creative novelists. Visual imagery rivaling Dickens' \\"Bleak House\\" makes the hopelessness of daily life in Iraq vividly real, and his ultimate escape from Saddam's clutches challenges Tom Clancy's most intricate yarn. Making the adventure even more chilling is his longtime easy access to the highest levels of Saddam's government. As a player and eventual head of Iraqi's nuclear program, Dr. Hamza was privy to the palace's inner machinations. From the unrestrained use of torture for any perceived slight to Saddam's clintonian-caliber sexual conquests, Dr. Hamza shares it all from his close-up vantage point.Among the book's most interesting features are several almost desultory anecdotes. Curiously, Iraq allows considerably more religious freedom than most predominantly Islamic countries; Christianity is largely ignored. After the Gulf War, Saddam's probably- not-irrational fear of revolt reassigned much of the nation's depleted resources to maintaining order--a catchall phrase often used to justify unprovoked massacres. Penury and entropy flooded the country as many industries folded, while Saddam also built himself three new palaces (to add to the dozens he already owned.) Dr. Hamza remarks that several Muslim charities misappropriated donations intended to help the poor--much of it was rerouted into corrupt imams' pockets. Conversely, Christian charities diligently distributed their sparse resources to those in the greatest need. He even sites one Christian minister who denied his own brother because his meager income was greater than the average pauper.Discussing Saddam's lack of interest in world travel, Dr. Hamza mentions that his only two official visits to non-Arab states brought him to Moscow and Paris where a hero's welcome greeted him in both capitols. Major changes in Russia as well as clearly revealed picture of Saddam's evil nature would likely negate a repeat embrace in Moscow. Conversely, with recent developments betraying France's present descent from civilization's standards, it is easy to see loving throngs welcoming a return visit there in 2002.Those who perceive a decline in intelligence activities starting under the Clinton administration will not be surprised to hear of the CIA's reluctance to cooperate when Dr. Hamza first contacted them with a request to defect. Over a year passed while the CIA dilly-dallied with the possibility of acquiring information that could save millions of lives in the free world, but fortunately even the dilatory interstice did not deter Dr. Hanna's quest for the American Dream and he was eventually accepted. The inspiring story of getting his family out is another beguiling facet that employed enough ingenuity to put James Bond to shame.Among the autobiography's many uplifting messages is Dr, Hamza's devotion to his marriage. At the age of thirty he entered into an arranged marriage with a 15 year-old, but his unflinching commitment to her stands as testament to how seriously he viewed his husbandly obligations. In a telling revelation about Iraq, he describes once flying back from a international government mission to accompany his wife while she went into labor because Iraqi hospitals do not extend major efforts in caring for women--even the wife of a high-ranking government official--unless a man is around to hector the staff.Both the tenacity and temerity of the Israeli military are displayed by two incidents in the book. First was the completely unanticipated bombing of Iraq's nascent nuclear reactor in the early 1980's. A move that despite snarling in the West must have been greatly appreciated by the allied forced during the Gulf War. The second ingenious maneuver occurred when Israeli troops landed in convincingly disguised Iraqi helicopters and planted an underground spy satellite. Many witnesses overheard the imposters speaking authentic Iraqi slang.To eliminate any doubt about Saddam's evil nature, Dr. Hamza discussed the sustained, multi-faceted biological and chemical weapon experimentation on Iraqi solders and civilians which he rightly names \\"one of the most grisly episodes of these awful weapons in history.\\" Atrocities ranging from transferring political prisoners to a \\"pesticide factory\\" to poisoning the water supply of unsuspecting rural dwellers bare bold witness to the Iraqi despot's insensate turpitude.Underlining the whole narrative is a version of the typical American immigrant's story. The circumstances may deviate greatly, but as for so many others, the beacon of liberty beckoned. For decades, it looked like Dr. Hamza and his family--financially sound in Iraq--would never be among those blessed tempest-tossed souls who would make it. Fortunately like so many other first generation Americans, perseverance and kismet intersected and he successful reached the Shining City on the Hill."},{"Title":"Saddam's Bombmaker : The Terrifying Inside Story of the Iraqi Nuclear and Biological Weapons Agenda (Lisa Drew Bks.)","review":"This book reads like a spy novel. But Dr. Hamsa's story is very important. The chief of Saddam's nuclear bomb project his story is fantastic. From his own rough childhood as one of 14 children, 9 that died before the age of 1 year and the last birth killing his mother during the process. Life was clearly hard in Iraq. With his education in the United States at MIT and in Florida he was recruite to build a nuclear bomb, from scratch, for Iraq.This is a great insight into life in Iraq for the regular folks and the priveledged. Dr. Hamza was one of the priveledged, living within the walls of the Presidential Palace. The conditions the Iraqi's live in are unbelievable.Dr. Hamza's story of how easy it is to buy the parts and machines needed to build a bomb are frightening. From countries that supposedly are watching Iraq. The United States, Great Britain, France, Russia. The list goes on.Dr. Hamza's tale of his escape from Iraq is also devastating to those that think the United States government and the CIA are on top of things. The apparently didn't know who Dr. Hamza was and when he tried to explain they laughed at him. What kind of information did they actually have on the goings on inside Iraq?Dr. Hamza's story is a must read for anyone interested in current events or history, as we are living history now.

It also provides an important lesson for those who are terrified of Al Qaeda or some other terrorist group developing a nuclear bomb - atomic weapons making is devilishly difficult, appallingly time consuming and fabulously expensive work. Here we have a group of brillant physicists given virtually unlimited funds from their government and technical assistance from unscrupulous Western companies, and after a decade of work they are still years away from a working nuclear bomb when the invasion of Kuwait destroys the program. It also demonstrates just how unlikely it is that Iraq currently has nuclear weapons today given the huge amount of reasources which must be conspicously assigned to the task and the relentless nature of the UNSCOM inspections of the 1990s, the nuclear industry portion of which, incidentally, Iraq has passed with flying colors. This book demonstrates once again its hell to be an Iraqi not matter how valuable you may think you are to the government or your social standing. It also demonstrates that its a lot more difficult to make a nuclear bomb than is generally believed."},{"Title":"Saddam's Bombmaker : The Terrifying Inside Story of the Iraqi Nuclear and Biological Weapons Agenda (Lisa Drew Bks.)","review":"We have been deeply moved by the enthusiastic response our book has generated, not only from readers here and elsewhere on the internet, but by knowledgeable experts and writers at such publications as The New York Times and The Washington Post, who have recognized &quot;Saddam's Bombmaker&quot; as a uniquely valuable portrait of the Iraqi regime and its shocking success at hiding its weapons programs. The prestigious Carnegie Endowment for International Peace honored us as well, by showcasing Dr. Hamza in Washington, DC upon the publication of our book in early November. Our heartfelt thanks to all. From the beginning, however, we expected that our book would come under attack from Saddam's allies, both witting and unwitting, using the shopworn, but sometimes effective use of anonymous rumors and character assassination concerning Dr. Hamza. No wonder: He is the only senior official to defect from Saddam's inner circle and live to tell the story. But we trust most readers will agree with David Kay, the highly respected former chief of UN weapons inspections in Iraq, who wrote, &quot;I urge that this book be required reading for the next American president.&quot; Kay added, &quot;Dr. Hamza has written that rare combination of a fascinating story that is genuinely important on many levels -- a compelling description of Saddam's twisted quest to dominate the Middle East through gaining nuclear weapons; a tragic description of how this quest coarsened and finally destroyed Iraqi society; and a warning that Saddam still has the capability to unleash a conflict that could engulf the Middle East in another round of war and tragedy.&quot; Dr. Paul Leventhal, president of the authoritative Nuclear Control Institute, also enthusiastically weighed in, describing Dr. Hamza as &quot;an architect of Iraq's atom bomb project.&quot; He said we had &quot;produced the rarest of books on nuclear proliferation -- a real page turner ... a sobering tale that hopefully will permit the world to learn from past mistakes.&quot; Not even the CIA, which initially flubbed Dr. Hamza's attempt to defect in 1994, minimized Dr. Hamza's credentials as the unwilling former chief of Saddam's nuclear weapons effort. &quot;He is viewed as valuable,&quot; a CIA official told Vernon Loeb, The Washington Post's intelligence specialist, &quot;and his insights have been valuable.&quot; We hope readers will agree. Thank you."},{"Title":"Saddam's Bombmaker : The Terrifying Inside Story of the Iraqi Nuclear and Biological Weapons Agenda (Lisa Drew Bks.)","review":"As an high-ranking Iraqi defector, Khidir Hamza provides his life as a prominent scientist in Saddam's nuclear weapons program as an example of Saddam Hussein's &quot;truncheon or Mercedes&quot; approach to domestic politics. Saddam and his family consistently use threats of extreme cruelty and the enticements of opulent living to coerce or cajole the most capable Iraqi citizens into serving Saddam's terrifying ambitions. For example, Hamza was informed that unless he returned from the United States to work for Saddam, his father would be in danger of torture and death. While working diligently for Saddam's nuclear weapons program, Hamza was rewarded on various occasions with new luxury cars. Hamza also shows how Saddam and his henchmen used these tactics with others. In addition to these personal examples that Hamza provides, he also corroborates information about Saddam's personality (his paranoia, even his fear of germs for example) provided by other Iraqi expatriates (such as Kanan Makiya and Latif Yahia). Hamza's book also provides important new information (such as the brain tumor surgery on Hussein Kamel and its effects on his memory) that contributes to an understanding of the quirks, attitudes and behaviors of other high-ranking officials in Saddam's regime (living and dead). This is a useful book."},{"Title":"Saddam's Bombmaker : The Terrifying Inside Story of the Iraqi Nuclear and Biological Weapons Agenda (Lisa Drew Bks.)","review":"When I read this book about six months before we invaded Iraq, I believed that the book was an accurate portrayal of Iraq's nuclear program. We now know that much of the book is fictional and propaganda.Another former Iraqi scientist now in Canada, Imad Khadduri, relates that Khidhir Hamza, &quot;the self-claimed Iraqi atomic &quot;Bomb Maker.&quot; Given a short lived assignment in the Iraqi nuclear program in 1987 to lead the atomic bomb design team, he was kicked out a few months later for petty theft. Reduced to a non-entity in the accelerated nuclear weapons program between 1987 and the start of the 1991 war, he retired from the Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission in 1989 and became a college lecturer, a stock market swindler and a shady business middle-man.&quot;Therefore, he would have had no direct knowledge of Iraq's nuclear program after 1989. Obviously his claim in the book that there were extensive underground nuclear facilities in Iraq has not been validated."},{"Title":"Saddam's Bombmaker : The Terrifying Inside Story of the Iraqi Nuclear and Biological Weapons Agenda (Lisa Drew Bks.)","review":"Not a great read, but worth making the effort."},{"Title":"Saddam's Bombmaker : The Terrifying Inside Story of the Iraqi Nuclear and Biological Weapons Agenda (Lisa Drew Bks.)","review":"Post September 11, the 24-hour news shows have produced many specials on dangers in the Middle East, including Saddam's development of weapons of mass destruction. This book fits perfectly into the puzzle, providing depth and explanation to subjects TV can treat only superficially.I have watched carefully for any inconsistencies between those reports and Hamza's book, finding none. In fact, David Kay, former chief UN weapons inspector in Iraq, who praises Hamza's book, figures prominently in several of those specials. It is consistent.Saddam's Bombmaker works on several levels:* The personal story is engaging and exciting.* The view of different cultures and ways of life is developed through many disturbing examples.* The technical details of acquiring and developing materials for a nuclear weapon were just right (I wanted enough to know it was real, but not enough to build one myself).The few criticisms I have read in earlier reviews confuse me. Those readers say that the book is too technical, not technical enough, or too focused on Hamza, himself. It IS an autobiography of a nuclear engineer, meant for a popular audience. It is not an investigative report of Iraq's weapons development effort, but it does give a remarkable insight into that because we hear the personal story of the person at the very top of the nuclear effort (which meant he was also privy to other programs).Like Richard Preston's Hot Zone, this is an exciting, can't-put-the-book-down thriller with enough technical detail to prove that it's real."}]`),L={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:R,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},q={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],H={key:0},C={key:1};function B(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",q,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",C,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",H,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const j=u(L,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-fe53ecd7"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/26.md","filePath":"people/26.md"}'),M={name:"people/26.md"},D=Object.assign(M,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{G as __pageData,D as default};
